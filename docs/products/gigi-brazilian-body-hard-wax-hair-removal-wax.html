            <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product!!</li>
            <li>I do not recommend for the bikini parts at freaking all (unless you are into that torture feels great kind of thing!)</li>
            <li>Amazing wax!</li>
            <li>but the benefits are amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I liked this product a lot!</li>
            <li>Love this product its great for the legs and bikini area!</li>

            <li>my coochie is quite smooth, im happy, my boyfriend&#x27;s happy, his chin and balls are happy!</li>
            <li>If you are going to try this wax, have the oil to remove it handy!</li>
            <li>Peels away nicely!</li>
            <li>The best suggesting ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product.</li>
            <li>its perfect and worthwhile.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>consistency is perfect, and easy to remove from counter-tops and skin if some of the wax strays.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it takes me a good 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;m that kind of brave.</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>It grabs on to the hairs really good</li>
            <li>good Luck</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to work with but just breaks the hair off.  </li>
            <li>But once you use the oil, it&#x27;s a breeze, and the results are really good.</li>
            <li>This wax held onto all of it and pulled it out really good.  </li>
            <li>Good wax for home use, but way surpassed by Cirepil Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably a good idea.</li>
            <li>I loved the result.</li>
            <li>This wax picks up hair well and lasts a good while, depending on climate, body hair texture, growth and re-growth.</li>
            <li>This wax is good.</li>
            <li>Pre-epilation oil is good for reducing the pain ( Brazilian).</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t understand where these good reviews are from...&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;FAKE GOOD REVIEWS.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a good job on thinner hair on my legs, but the bikini area...</li>
            <li>but this stuff does as good of a job at a fraction of the price and</li>
            <li>This is a really good quality wax.</li>
            <li>Its a good product.</li>

            <li>and you do need to apply a good amount of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just makes sense to go this route money wise.</li>
            <li>The good stuff.</li>
            <li>Works good for legs and bikini area.</li>
            <li>Good for course hair</li>
            <li>wise ...</li>

            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Also a good price.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how affordable this is compared to going to a salon, and in my opinion it works BETTER!</li>
            <li>if hot water- which by the way works perfectly.</li>

            <li>I want use them more!</li>
            <li>I like this a lot more than prewaxed sheets!</li>
            <li>the shipping was free BTW!!</li>
            <li>Still way better than having a stranger wax you and paying through the nose once a month!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The awesome thing is that my hair grew out So much softer and I haven&#x27;t shaved for weeks!</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve to doing your own waxing but it is so nice to be able to do it in the privacy of your own home!  </li>
            <li>This is the best wax in large containers out there.</li>
            <li>This wax is amazing.</li>
            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I just have myself an Amazing Brazilian wax</li>
            <li>This wax is amazing.</li>
            <li>This wax is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>But THIS stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap and it works great.</li>
            <li>(I just hop in a slightly warm shower and do a quck wash.  </li>
            <li>Suggestion---don&#x27;t try to use any kind of waxing cloth/paper with this.</li>
            <li>Simply warm it up in the wax warmer until it gets to be a caramel thickness to it</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; wax - the kind that you use without strips.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted to start doing my own wax at home.  </li>
            <li>and sometimes I&#x27;ll get some really nice patches that stay nice for two weeks.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>so you kind of know what to do and what your pain tolerance is going to</li>
            <li>But if you do, those scissors you have handy find another use.</li>
            <li>But if you do, those scissors you have handy find another use.</li>
            <li>I started doing my own waxes after getting fed-up with paying $70+ for a patchy job...</li>
            <li>But it works effectively (98%).</li>
            <li>but they took away the brand I liked and upped the prices of the others....</li>
            <li>Nice wax.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to not have to use the strips.</li>
            <li>I had some kind of allergic reaction to this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that kind of money sitting around to have my hair removed, so I went ahead and got a can of this stuff, some applicators, and a wax warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you do your own waxing, buy this stuff - it truly rocks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it melted nicely in a pot of boiling water.</li>
            <li>When those sticks ran out, I shaped my own out of tongue depressors.</li>
            <li>Great fast shipping and the wax works great.</li>
            <li>This wax is kind of like having a baby, I guess.  </li>
            <li>I do my own brazilian, and I wax my own armpits.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try it on my own.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t apply it as nicely.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice.  </li>
            <li>made it warm</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>I use it to do my own Brazilians and it&#x27;s worked out well with my method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to use cloth in order to rip this wax off.  </li>
            <li>I just let it warm up on medium for about 40 minutes while I do something else, and prepare the area with baby powder.</li>
            <li>Cloth strips are not needed for this product and had a nice bees wax smell to it.</li>
            <li>I think most problems that come with this are from user error, and it&#x27;s a really good wax.</li>
            <li>I honestly became a fan of GiGi products and i just bought they numbing spray as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the wax heater machine, so I warm it in my oven</li>
            <li>/&gt;After waxing I use aloe Vera or rose water to avoid break out.</li>
            <li>This was nice</li>
            <li>My last experience with home waxing was a misery, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything great from this, but I was very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave my self a bikini wax and it came out really great, soft and smooth and was very proud of myself.</li>
            <li>but I sure did and am very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure that it worked well, but this is a great value and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>It works great, All smooth:).</li>
            <li>Its easy to melt n use and has good results.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this from Amazon.com several times and I have always had a good experience and it has arrived on time in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cleanup was also very easy.</li>
            <li>This wax works much better than the kind they had at my salon.</li>
            <li>Given how tricky this is to use, you might wonder whether it&#x27;s really suitable for DIYers.</li>
            <li>actually I loved how smooth my legs feels after waxing.</li>
            <li>you start, make sure you have baby powder, coconut oil (or the oil in the kit) and scissors handy.</li>
            <li>(it works amazingly for this), and as many others have said -</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees makes a talc-free powder that just has a light honey scent to it, and I&#x27;ve had good experience with that.  </li>
            <li>cheap, good, and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>By far the best home waxing kit I have used (And I&#x27;ve tried a lot.)</li>
            <li>This is by far the best wax.</li>
            <li>I am waxing for 5 years now (by myself) and this is by far the best wax ever.</li>
            <li>and I had great success,</li>
            <li>So far this wax works great!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pinch the wax to start ripping it off, work an edge free first and use that, otherwise you&#x27;ll give yourself an impressive bruise.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, remove and does its job!</li>
            <li>Great and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I LOVE HOW EASY IT IS TO APPLY AND REMOVE!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s very important.</li>
            <li>Very very important.</li>
            <li>This wax works great heat it up and make sure its creamy and not too hot</li>
            <li>will admit that it kind of smells like sap, and sometimes you do get bits sticking, (though this is easily resolved with the gigi prewax oil)</li>
            <li>Application was easy, I used a chopstick to roll the wax on in the direction of the hair growth, and got a nice even layer.  </li>
            <li>When I used it first time I find it very nice..</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough great things about this product!</li>
            <li>It works so well and even better if you use the pre epi oil also by Gigi.</li>
            <li>Also I love this wax.</li>
            <li>its one of my favorites out of the many I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my underarms, which works phenomenally.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied!!</li>
            <li>This wax is obnoxiously sticky and will ruin most things if it happens to drip on it.</li>
            <li>er done\\&quot;!!  When I had it done at the spa, it hurt more, and I took two ibuprofin before I went.  </li>
            <li>I am looking forward to the hair thinning and having more time in waxes.</li>
            <li>and when you pull it all gone. :-)</li>
            <li>You could seriously do better removing hair with chewed up bubble gum.  </li>
            <li>I bought the whole brazalian kit which was a great buy.</li>
            <li>I am glad to purchased both the items( Gigi wax and Gigi wax heater).</li>
            <li>Can not find this size product in my drugstore any more.</li>
            <li>Be sure to let it heat</li>
            <li>LOVE this wax.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay the $70 or more that area salons are charging for bikini waxes, so I decided to DIY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it hurts more, and it&#x27;s messier.</li>
            <li>used along with the gigi warmer she is able to do any touch up work at home in between salon visits, which saves us both time and money.</li>
            <li>Love this wax.  </li>
            <li>wax mostly just rips my hair, it doesn&#x27;t rip it out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update, I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used it many times over to wax myself as well as others.</li>
            <li>Like this and will get more when I need it.</li>
            <li>It hardens way to fast and doesn&#x27;t rip off great</li>
            <li>I bought the kit with the warmer and the oils, and I&#x27;m really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been getting Brazilian waxes for almost two years before I moved away from my favorite salon</li>
            <li>when using it: make sure it&#x27;s about the consistency of honey,</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>So far so good it does a good job as in waxing, will continue to test</li>
            <li>Did the waxing myself for the first time using this wax and it works amazing!</li>
            <li>Basic, best product!</li>
            <li>leaves residue more than i planned.</li>
            <li>what more can a girl ask for?</li>
            <li>This is the second time ordering it; she uses it for her bikini area and it works perfect!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Their wax warmer is great to Go with this and works very well to heat this up.</li>
            <li>Prep the skin extremely important!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with coconut oil</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>luck! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I bought this wax.</li>
            <li>Love not having to go to the salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li>this works way better.</li>
            <li>do not wax more than once in one setting.</li>
            <li>Granted, it takes me longer to wax myself, but I&#x27;m getting better.  </li>
            <li>I love being able to just scrape it off a linoleum floor or peel it off of myself, if needed.  </li>
            <li>in any way is better any time.</li>
            <li>great buy and much cheaper then at stores.</li>
            <li>Possibly the best wax product for brazilian and under arms.</li>
            <li>On top of that  </li>
            <li>I just need to get better at it.</li>
            <li>, my toaster warms up faster and is more efficient</li>
            <li>I bought the set and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I have used this wax for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this wax.  </li>
            <li>use it with the Gigi wax warmer and love it.  </li>
            <li>This is one of those things you get better at the more you do it.  </li>
            <li>the more hair it took off.</li>
            <li>I love this wax but the can came dented which caused the wax to spill when melted</li>
            <li>it covers way more body</li>
            <li>That said I have tried many waxes over the years to do my bikini area.  </li>
            <li>MOST OF THE HAIR CAME OFF.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d either have to pick the pieces out or apply more wax to try again.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this wax.</li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>Love how you don&#x27;t need the paper wax strips.</li>
            <li>Worked better then</li>
            <li>Because no trips are used, I was actually able to wax parts that I have never been able to before.</li>
            <li>I was able to wax everything off with some trial and error.</li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is taut.</li>
            <li>i have an issue with gripping it to remove, you have to bend the edge a bit</li>
            <li>Be sure to use pre-wax oil or coconut oil to help prevent it from sticking to your skin.</li>
            <li>Best American wax in this country</li>
            <li>( like you would hold a blob of gum and stick it to more gum to get it off).</li>
            <li>Love to use this wax for armpits.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love not having to deal with fabric strips.</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>Sprinkle baby powder on top of the wax after applying so that you can touch it sooner without it sticking to your fingers.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve gotten the hang of waxing, it will let you wax areas more than once per sitting - no problem.</li>
            <li>i will love to shop more stuff.</li>
            <li>just ok.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>Thank guys :)</li>
            <li>love this in the summer.</li>
            <li>Maybe practice makes perfect, but I&#x27;m going to try a different type of wax.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite wax.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It works like magic.</li>
            <li>Every person is different, so it takes some time figuring out what temperature, thickness etc that works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I found that I had to go over areas more than twice to get all of the hair out.</li>
            <li>and it hurts more.</li>
            <li>I love love love love LOVE</li>
            <li>Tried so many products for my underarm hair.</li>
            <li>This works great Thanks.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this sure did the trick.  </li>
            <li>and then it hurts so much more.  </li>
            <li>Pamper yourself - don&#x27;t cause more work.</li>
            <li>i am the most unsatisfied customer</li>
            <li>Make sure to have a towel or cardboard under you when using.</li>
            <li>I used a cheap candle warmer to heat it, and it took forever to warm up, but after that, it works</li>
            <li>I love that it does not require strips.</li>
            <li>was not at all what i was expecting, disapointed :)</li>
            <li>Lovely smell, no irritation.</li>
            <li>but it did stop the plastic lid from fitting when cooled.</li>
            <li>and I love not having to use strips to take it off.</li>
            <li>I love this wax because you don&#x27;t need cloth to pull it off.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>and I use this more than the all purpose wax that came in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>okay -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this wax.</li>
            <li>It took more time to wax</li>
            <li>If you have to apply more wax I found it best to just apply it directly on top of the initial layer and then trying to evenly spread it out.  </li>
            <li>You have to make sure that you oil your skin before applying it so that it doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product many times.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to try this wax.</li>
            <li>but that was ok.</li>
            <li>I cannot love without this and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>you wiggle it around once inside to make sure it coats all hair</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li>It was the most disastereble experience I had.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find better wax for brazilian waxing than this one.</li>
            <li>Any longer and the wax won&#x27;t be able to rip it off and it&#x27;ll be like taking bubblegum out of your hair.</li>
            <li>However, the level of pain you feel is a ton greater</li>
            <li>Love the brand.</li>
            <li>I even got this really satisfying ziiiip</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I think its because this one is more of a honey texture</li>
            <li>It does an okay job and getting the hairs off though</li>
            <li>great for Brazilian... goes on cool, sets up quickly</li>
            <li>This was melts nicely and is super easy to apply!</li>
            <li>forget about going to a salon; this wax is exactly like the brazilian wax salons - and I can tell because I am brazilian!!!</li>
            <li>hair is very fine and breaks easily (some growth from in the hemp waxed area, where I think I broke the hairs off instead of pulling them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the quality is good...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this a dozen times already, it&#x27;s a great product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This wax is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It took me 1 full hour for the wax to warm up</li>
            <li>This stuff works great and is amazing, HOWEVER- Definitely not for beginners!!</li>
            <li>I quickly ordered my own jar (as my wife already had the warming pot).</li>
            <li>use a shower curtain from a dollar store so it makes clean-up easy, just a helpful hint :)</li>
            <li>Love it and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Part of the reason it was so easy for me to use was because I had a lot done before I decided to do it myself, and I like doing it myself more than getting it done.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and seems to remove most hair from one use.</li>
            <li>FOr the experienced waxer though, this is far more product for your dollar.</li>
            <li>It also is very easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>They give you better fine control over where the wax ends up.</li>
            <li>Hair comes off clean!</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft and tingly after a good waxing!</li>
            <li>It does the job very nicely, like a professional waxing experience!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more comfortable and faster if you do, but the hair will be gone regardless.     </li>
            <li>Works great for bikini waxing, but if you want to use it on your legs or arms, I would suggest using sugar-based soft wax (to be used with strips).</li>
            <li>This wax is the most smooth that i have found.</li>
            <li>you get smooth skin in no time :)</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of having the kit available when I want and the non-salon prices can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li>I loathe muslim strips and am so glad to have this available to me.</li>
            <li>as too much will also cause issues with the wax getting a good grip on shorter hairs.</li>
            <li>I would say this is as good of a wax as any and at an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and also make sure you have the right texture</li>
            <li>I tried this product once and although my results weren&#x27;t perfect, they were 1000% better than what my results were previously.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the self waxing, but this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Works great , feels amazing , grabs every single hair.</li>
            <li>It is very effective in its purpose and the result looks professional.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy!!</li>
            <li>I got perfect results the first time I used it, and things have only gotten better with practice.    </li>
            <li>If you are looking for safe and clean use .</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use in the Gigi Brazilian waxing kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, this wax was so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>it is supposed to come off easily</li>
            <li>This wax is so easy to use I managed to wax everywhere</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works the way it should.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t come off the skin quite as easily as I would like.</li>
            <li>I easy to use and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>comes out easily</li>
            <li>It did not come off easily.</li>
            <li>Really easy to use.</li>
            <li>it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>you figure out the consistency that is easy to work with</li>
            <li>That will get the wax close to the skin and make the hair come out easy otherwise you might as well just grab the hair and pull it out by hand.</li>
            <li>sure the skin is washed clean and apply generous amount of oil to the area before waxing..to protect the skin.</li>
            <li>This wax makes home Brazilians easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great because I can use it more than once over the same area in one sitting--which ensures removal of all the hair.</li>
            <li>Generally easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a wax that is easy to use at home.</li>
            <li>But the Brazilian wax has been so easy to use, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with cleanup.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>so you can grab it easily when you pull.</li>
            <li>Still goin strong</li>
            <li>strongly suggest to buy the wax warmer.</li>
            <li>Based on my first experience with doing this on my own, I probably should have done that.</li>
            <li>for\\&quot; cannot be more true in this</li>
            <li>If this happens, add more wax over that area, let it cool and then remove.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a video in YouTube that you can watch of a woman doing her own educational DIY Brazilian waxing.</li>
            <li>This wax is super easy to use and better than them sticky pads that don&#x27;t remove the hair.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and easy to peel off once you get used to it.</li>
            <li>Having used the kit for self removal for the first time, I can really say that I am happy about it.  </li>
            <li>Smells fine.</li>
            <li>I just used a plastic disposable butter knife to spread it on and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Gigi is a fine brand</li>
            <li>used this wax with cloth strips that I cut myself, but it works fine without the cloth as well.</li>
            <li>A FINE LINE BETWEEN</li>
            <li>just fine into my space saver warmer.</li>
            <li>This removes the toughest hair and even fine hair ( I tried it ALL over, just to see).</li>
            <li>Second, make very sure that you have the oil to remove the wax handy.</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>It took a while but worked just fine.</li>
            <li>and it works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Is my hair too fine?</li>
            <li>I did not take any Advil and pain was fine with</li>
            <li>If not, you can just reapply it as many times as you need to, if hair is super stubborn you can just grab the tweezers and get the hair yourself with no effort.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to buy strips but this wax finishes more quickly.</li>
            <li>Once you learn to use the wax, and to pull fast, you will absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to get all of your nails, and mess up your perfectly manicured nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great wax... removes most hairs the very first time...don&#x27;t have to go back over again and again.</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit of time to get used to the best consistency, thinkness and temperature</li>
            <li>I do have to admit that surgiwax is better than this wax, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in large containers.</li>
            <li>Not an accurate description.</li>
            <li>So far MOOM is the best natural wax that I&#x27;ve come by and cleans up well.</li>
            <li>This has been a huge time saver and money saver for me.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really important</li>
            <li>I think we cn have cheaper qualities available.</li>
            <li>2 days before lightly exfoliate.</li>
            <li>This part is as important as oiling.&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It gets the hairs and leaves you silky smooth.</li>
            <li>(no words can describe how important that step is.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>It smelt great, but stuck to my skin and was such a mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I tried the Clean N Easy sensitive wax on the bikini area, and while this wax works well for eyebrows and legs, it is not so good for underarms or bikini area.</li>
            <li>If it does, the residue is easy to clean off since it hardens.</li>
            <li>The wax has a nice scent and hardens very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to fit a wax warmer</li>
            <li>No funky smell and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that great for facial hair</li>
            <li>It may take a while to get,  but it&#x27;s way worth it not to go to waxing appointments when you&#x27;re able to do it at home and save all that money.</li>
            <li>Then I ended up scraping the rest off in the shower with a cheap razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, works well and is almost the same salon quality without the salon price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I try to spread it on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t go as smoothly as those I see in youtube videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being able to get salon results at home has made this purchase worth it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for facial hair</li>
            <li>This did not effect its fit into the warmer</li>
            <li>Need a warmer to melt the wax, since I did not have one, I melted it in a pot filled with boiling water.</li>
            <li>I have medium toned skin &amp; light brown/blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Is my hair too light?</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s great product &amp; i</li>
            <li>it in the warmer for about 30 minues, and it was melted and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The container lasts for several waxes, making it a great buy.</li>
            <li>Gigi&#x27;s Wax Warmer doesn&#x27;t warm, it probably took an extra hour to warm the wax</li>
            <li>The wax is good so far unless you know its application on skin.</li>
            <li>Extremely cheap, and worth way more than what you&#x27;re paying.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast, love this product  easy to use</li>
            <li>let it sit and hardened up before peeling the wax off, be sure to apply baby oil (yes you read it right....</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, love it!</li>
            <li>A baby oil) to clean off the remaining wax pieces off then wash your face with regular soap, you will be happy, be sure to do it on the day when you don&#x27;t have any plans to go anywhere during the day or night time, let your skin heal up a bit (if you are first time waxing).</li>
            <li>Super easy to tweeze if wax didn&#x27;t take care of that one or two hairs.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and easy to warm and use.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have some hair to pull out first tho, otherwise, you&#x27;ll be wasting your time.</li>
            <li>Fruitlessly pulling at bits of hardening wax on my bikini area is not my idea of fun!</li>
            <li>It gets most of the hairs on the first pull.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been to a pro for a brazilian, but this mother hurt on my kind parts!</li>
            <li>awesome product as usual</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 4 different waxes and this is the best so far!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li>most importantly, make sure it has COMPLETELY hardened before attempting removal.  </li>
            <li>and it came with a video, which I highly recommend watching because it is pretty informative and gives some good tips on using this wax and will have you waxing like a pro in no time.</li>
            <li>Hard wax and a light baby OIL pre treat is the best for DIY bikini, lip and underarm areas.</li>
            <li>I tried the other GiGi waxes and they are great and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I also bought the cardboard rings that go around the can to keep the warmer clean.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any spills or issues with clean up.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great wax for sensitive areas</li>
            <li>I do not recommend waxing any area on your face more than once ever, and for more sensitive people, this rule of thumb should apply to underarm and bikini area -</li>
            <li>Well, like many people, I&#x27;ve been making an effort to do my own beauty stuff to save money, and this has extended to DIY waxing of various body parts.</li>
            <li>This wax is by far my favorite, and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>Clean up used to be a nightmare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought some popsicle sticks for dipping and they work well for a clean wax</li>
            <li>I would also recommend showering before you use this especially if you have used deodorant that day and are planning on doing your underarms, cause it needs to be washed off for the wax to be most effective.</li>
            <li>Most of them say it&#x27;s a good product I tries everything they said</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend using this stuff in a warm room, otherwise it cools to breaking point too quickly.</li>
            <li>this is beautiful magic ladys and no need foor strips works so well on my extra sensitive skin</li>
            <li>(I bought the full kit originally) and I&#x27;ve no complaints.</li>
            <li>Special recommendations for use.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>Some of the best hard wax on the market.</li>
            <li>The best hard wax I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>this hard wax was perfect!</li>
            <li>Best hard wax in the market.</li>
            <li>the best hard body wax I have used.</li>
            <li>Best hard wash I have ever had.</li>
            <li>have the entire kit, and it is very easy to use!</li>
            <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean up after, and you hardly need the oil if you keep your skin a bit damp.</li>
            <li>I use it to wax my bikini area, and I really can&#x27;t believe that it doesn&#x27;t hurt more than it does.  </li>
            <li>I recommend getting the full Gigi Brazilian Waxing Kit and watching the video (warning - you do see some nakedness as they are doing a &amp;#34;brazilian&amp;#34; wax in it).</li>
            <li>It works best when it&#x27;s on the thick side.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper and more convenient than go to the wax salon.</li>
            <li>Most salons I go into have this wax and a GiGi warmer - you can do it at home and save so much money.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to order more</li>
            <li>Actually, too good.  </li>
            <li>i found that the longer i let it cool on my skin</li>
            <li>After about 45 minutes the wax was mostly melted and ready for use.</li>
            <li>No embarrassing bikini line to worry about and no painful in grown hairs to deal with.</li>
            <li>Works best applied thick.</li>
            <li>True story.</li>
            <li>It can be done but will be to much hassle for most.</li>
            <li>Sometimes waiting for the wax to cool is just not an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>I have had a full waxing done at the salon</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but good product overall.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s applied, you let it cool for about a minute and when you remove the wax a ton of hair is attached.  </li>
            <li>+ tip to get my full face wax at salon every week.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll risk the wax chipping off instead of ripping off the full strip/area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad idea.</li>
            <li>After 2 hours, I never could quite get the right temperature, it was just too hot most of the time.</li>
            <li>But it goes on easy and smooth, and removed the hair very well with no breakage.</li>
            <li>It works great at removing coarse hair and worked pretty good at eyebrows but hurt a little bit more than strip wax.</li>
            <li>The hair re-grows very quickly and , for the first time, I had ingrown hairs and bumps.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty easy to use&lt;br /&gt;*Pick</li>
            <li>even the more dense areas, but if you aren&#x27;t careful, you won&#x27;t be able to get the wax off at all!</li>
            <li>It was quick and easy, and it was my first time.</li>
            <li>sure wax is warm enough but not too hot.</li>
            <li>It takes a few hours , but word just as good !</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great way to DIY beauty and save all the money I was spending on monthly waxes.</li>
            <li>This wax is seriously the best I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li>Anyway - I learned a lot, and went back and read through all the helpful review tips before I made a second attempt, which went wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>and now I am just SUPER IRRITATED.</li>
            <li>works great for delicate areas that need a bit more protection during waxing.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and the price is a couple bucks cheaper than my nearest Beauty supply shop.</li>
            <li>Product works quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>love this wax, i have try different ones, but this one is my favorite</li>
            <li>Of course, it hurts but I am happy about its quality as I really don&#x27;t want to go through all the turmoil of setting up and pain only to discover that 3/4 hair are still in.</li>
            <li>- I move quickly and use a wax strip instead of waiting for this to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love being able to wax at home and save tons of money rather than having to go to a salon multiple times to pay to have my eyebrows waxed and etc.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 37 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Melts in the warmer in an adequate amount of time and is just like the wax you see in the salons.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most difficult part was getting rid of the hairs &amp;#34;back there&amp;#34;  I tried bending over and squatting, and I found that bending over with my foot and leg on a chair was the best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find</li>
            <li>(we do not go with full liquid because OUCH, it&#x27;s hot!).</li>
            <li>I personally feel that for upper lips sugar wax is best as they pain less but for armpit this is great.</li>
            <li>and on the very first wax, i forgot to use the gigi&#x27;s pre-epilation powder that is supposed to help the wax not stick to the skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty cheap on Amazon, and if you have Prime, you don&#x27;t have to even take the time to drive to the beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I allowed the wax cool for a while, and found that there is a nice window of where the wax will let off of your skin just enough to get a corner started and where it broke into bits from being cool.  </li>
            <li>Even the drips of wax that ran down my legs ripped up hairs (by accident, but a happy accident)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do full brazilians and it is super safe for my sensitive parts.</li>
            <li>then put i on top of my candle melter to keep it warm.it cools very fast but also heats fast on the candle melter(no need to buy eexpensive melter things)</li>
            <li>Best Hard Wax I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li>but this product works very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, convenient and very affordable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is really easy to use and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before I waxed the first time, I did a bunch of tests on my arms (using rubbing alcohol before waxing, using alcohol + oil, using oil only, using nothing, using the spray) and the best results were obtained from not using anything on my skin prior to waxing.  </li>
            <li>REALLY?!?!</li>
            <li>Like extreme torture kind of pain with blood and all!</li>
            <li>I definitely will order some more wax product again soon!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty gentle as far as waxes go, plus one tin lasts me a good 6 months.</li>
            <li>As a cosmetologist, This is the only brand of wax I use, I am in love with this wax, it does not irritate the skin and does not leave and sticky residue, I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li>There is definitely a learning curve, but it so much better than shaving!  </li>
            <li>Clean it to prevent any water getting in the wax, set the wax can on the hot plate and turn on.</li>
            <li>Great consistency at a comfortably low temperature, hardens quickly and completely and pulls like a champ.</li>
            <li>On this Brazilian wax you have to be quick and know for sure where you are putting the strip or the wax dries to fast and will not get much off.  </li>
            <li>* Set out a comfortable pillow covered by a large towel that you won&#x27;t mind getting ruined in the place you plan on waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some suggestions for the beginners: spread a large [old] bed sheet on the floor, have a mirror handy, wear examination gloves (unless you don&#x27;t care for your fingernails), sit on the floor and lean against the wall.</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;ve always used the GiGi all purpose wax and love it but the Brazillain Body Hard Wax wasn&#x27;t so good....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to using the Ceripil which is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This wax did a fantastic job, It really grabs onto the hair and doesnt let go.</li>
            <li>There are much better waxes out there if you are a professional.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Plus, no white heads of any kind and no ingrowns.  </li>
            <li>probably EVERY kind of wax possible!</li>
            <li>So much better then soft wax.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Waxing isn&#x27;t fun</li>
            <li>Still comes off skin well enough with warm water and soap if you don&#x27;t pre-treat with oil.</li>
            <li>so far ive tried clean and easy but</li>
            <li>Not even worth it one bit.</li>
            <li>and I suggest you give this wax a try, its economical and gets all the hair out</li>
            <li>works much better than soft wax/wax strips.</li>
            <li>I made sure to prep the skin areas well, as I do with the soft wax, used powder, and everything, and it still took skin with it.  </li>
            <li>It is the only kind I use at home.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this; I&#x27;ll never use soft wax again.</li>
            <li>to use for beginners, and well worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>I used my nails to chip off hardened wax that fell on my floor (a butter knife would also be useful if you don&#x27;t want to risk damaging your nails).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that makes using this wax nearly painless in most areas.</li>
            <li>so I rarely use it for that.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t apply wax that is too cool or too hot.  </li>
            <li>Let it cool first.  </li>
            <li>and once it has melted, keep it warm on low heat.  </li>
            <li>I decided to do my own bikini waxing with mixed results.  </li>
            <li>When it heats up, it smells like a forest, kind of like fresh essential oils.  </li>
            <li>This is a good time to note that keeping the wax at a low temperature will allow you to apply enough wax to be able to pull it off.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>Some tips: make sure that 1) you don&#x27;t put too far up in the nostril; 2).</li>
            <li>I suggest buying a different kind of wax.</li>
            <li>No cutting wax strips required.</li>
            <li>second time ordering this product happy so far</li>
            <li>(well, for me) than using the cloth... I&#x27;ve decided to switch over to the regular honey wax with cloth instead of this kind.</li>
            <li>Then when it is warm enough I take it out and follow the instructions to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>It melts quickly and does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased the whole kit and bought this refill 3 times.</li>
            <li>I bought this right after I bought the waxing kit here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>IS NOT THE RIGHT PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They did not even send the right product.</li>
            <li>AND you figure out the right consistency.  </li>
            <li>you also need to adjust while you go to keep it right.  </li>
            <li>Being completely new to wax i found this fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>Again, not a waxer, not sure if my method is &#x27;the best&#x27;, but it&#x27;s easy peasy for this long time DIYer.</li>
            <li>try Sally Hansen strip free wax because it is very easy to work with and in small containers that heat quickly, and easier to clean.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product because it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have waxed my upper lip and my bikini line, all very easily.</li>
            <li>wax is not that great .Getting hard quickly and leaves residue.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, gets down to the roots and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t need any special strips and it doesnt hurt as much as the all-purpose one does.</li>
            <li>The wax does not need to cool that much before you pull it off again.  </li>
            <li>I normally use Satin smooth calendula gold wax but thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>Fits just right in the hot wax warmer.</li>
            <li>It takes some time to get used to the right temperature, but once you get it, it&#x27;s not difficult at all.</li>
            <li>It heats up evenly in the GiGi heater, goes on smoothly, and most importantly comes off easily and takes all of the hair with it without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>I also got it super fast.</li>
            <li>Its by far the best wax I&#x27;ve used at least for me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and not messy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for facial and private areas.</li>
            <li>It sounds easy to slop on a strip of wax, wait for it to cool a bit, then pull it off in one swoop...but an entirely different thing to do it.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>It has a sugaring/ honey like quality to it, translucent and very very sticky.</li>
            <li>Also very very cost</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very gentle</li>
            <li>First, you need to use more wax to get a thick layer to pull off, so you go through a container a lot more quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to leave on too long.</li>
            <li>Works great as hard wax.  </li>
            <li>This is a great salon quality hard wax.</li>
            <li>The Gigi Hard Wax is really great.</li>
            <li>little on the gross side: I could see the roots of my hair on the wax, which is great because it means the area will stay hair free for a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It can last you quite a while, it has lasted us many waxing sessions, probably over 10-15 all together.</li>
            <li>The morning after waxing and all the days following, I make sure to exfoliate the waxed area with a loofah to prevent ingrown</li>
            <li>and all the days following, I make sure to exfoliate the waxed area with a loofah to prevent ingrown hairs.    </li>
            <li>I think you should practice on your legs first, just a couple of strips, so you get the feeling on how to use it.</li>
            <li>n start waxing, it used to take me an hour at first</li>
            <li>I know it hurts a lot at first</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I didn&#x27;t put anything on my legs.</li>
            <li>I have acrylic nails the first time I thought the wax ruined it.</li>
            <li>First time using this product, just at home with the Gigi warmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having it too hot makes it runny hence making the application and removal process impossible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A real SCAM!</li>
            <li>Buy waxing strips so much easier!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>being said... let me tell you my first experience with this wax and of waxing period.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thought this wax wouldn&#x27;t be able to get my hair because I have never had it plucked or waxed before and thought it may be too coarse</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time took me almost 3 hours... and my arm and neck hurt more than the area that was waxed.&lt;br /&gt;There was no lasting pain with the brazilian</li>
            <li>The first time, it took me 3-4 hours, yikes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased and can&#x27;t wait till the next session.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for everybody like me ;)</li>
            <li>Make sure that you use pre-epilation oil prior to waxing.</li>
            <li>first time I did it, that was me.</li>
            <li>It takes AGES to melt the first time,</li>
            <li>This is where your first learning curve comes</li>
            <li>If you can get gyno style with your back supported and your feet pushing on something, you&#x27;re going to be better</li>
            <li>I refrained from writing a review after my first time because I figured I would try again before I made a judgement on the product.</li>
            <li>I refrained from writing a review after my first time because I figured I would try again before I made a judgement on the product.</li>
            <li>Some areas may need to be waxed more than once but be careful because the area will become more sensitive after the first wax.</li>
            <li>I wish I had known of this first.</li>
            <li>If interested in waxing, should by the kit and text it and</li>
            <li>It works well and is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Ok you guys, I am European.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better at getting the wax only where I want it.  </li>
            <li>First let me start by saying I have never been to a salon for a waxing.</li>
            <li>It seems to work pretty well for the bikini area.</li>
            <li>First time DIY waxer and</li>
            <li>Pull fast!</li>
            <li>Trim first.</li>
            <li>By the time I was done, I probably pulled out more hair pulling, rubbing and scraping with my fingernails than the actual waxing.</li>
            <li>I love the results and I am noticing that my hair is growing back  </li>
            <li>I am able to wax underarms, bikini, forearms, legs and still have around 1/2 can of product left over.</li>
            <li>It does not always work the first time you use it</li>
            <li>Maybe, be a bit smarter than me and test it out on your leg or something first until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>an alcohol free toner directly after waxing to sooth.</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>do it the first couple times</li>
            <li>It was my first Brazilian ever</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried it and will continue to use it regularly.</li>
            <li>first of all I ordered this on the 27th of may</li>
            <li>so I could figure it out before the first attempt.  </li>
            <li>Gigi&#x27;s wax is cheap and clearly so because it&#x27;s garbage.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>I actually heated this product stove top in hot water.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s too hot</li>
            <li>I just wish I could buy a bigger size. :)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>For me personally I didn&#x27;t like it better at all.</li>
            <li>I used this on my legs first to get used to it.</li>
            <li>I worked with it for about an hour even though the first try told me what I wanted to know about it.</li>
            <li>I bought it at Sallys and because of that I was able to get my money back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are still married and she still lets me wax her every 2 weeks</li>
            <li>It was delivered on time and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Never fails.</li>
            <li>When you feel your skin afterward, it feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My first container lasted me about 13 waxings.</li>
            <li>First I use the Gigi Pre-Hon then baby powder on the area.</li>
            <li>(of course, I am a novice and it&#x27;s been 2 weeks since that first experience with Moom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But my 3 hours went to waste, because I didn&#x27;t get good results from the GiGi.</li>
            <li>Very nice hard wax.</li>
            <li>Never even got soft!!!!</li>
            <li>Stuff works great for the price, but make sure to use a nice thick amount, usually a couple layers thick, also make sure it is smooth so it wont break when you pull it off.</li>
            <li>So much that I&#x27;m buying another can of it right now.</li>
            <li>really good wax, when you use it just make sure is really liquid without burning your skin because if is a little solid (because is cooling) then it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>Good for underarms, legs and hands too but as hard wax requires a slightly thick application, I think its best to go for soft wax for those.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I have pretty coarse hairs and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well, have to keep the area dry in order for it to stick appropriately to the hair, so make sure to keep some baby powder next to you</li>
            <li>GiGi is equal to the best hard wax that I have used.  </li>
            <li>GiGi is priced better than most hard waxes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a different hard wax refill before but this one is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Turns out that everywhere I found that even offered brazilians for men (most of them do not) wanted to charge twice as much as they do for a female brazilian wax.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, it does take practice and it will hurt, but I think the pain is the same as if you were getting it professionally done.</li>
            <li>plus you dont need to clean the room after using it as there will be no mess.</li>
            <li>This wax is perfect for underarms and facial waxing at home, for busy people like me who do not have a lot of time to waste in salons.</li>
            <li>I will say though that I haven&#x27;t been waxing too long and the hair already seems sparser, which is lovely.</li>
            <li>Buy the whole kit at first.</li>
            <li>Works very well and saves me so much money at the salon!</li>
            <li>will share that you need to make sure the hair is trimmed properly as the wax can get away from you real quick if you&#x27;re inexperienced.</li>
            <li>A tip though, make sure your hair is about a centimeter long.</li>
            <li>Be sure not to apply it too thick, it really works better with a thinner layer since it relies on flexibility when being yanked off to not break off.</li>
            <li>At first, I tried without it (like I used to do, with the waxes back in Brazil, and they work just fine that way).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, the wax hardens relatively quickly, but I could use it for over half hour, which is more than sufficient time for me to do the brazilian.</li>
            <li>I have used the GiGi brand hard wax for a long time and I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>The wax is pretty hard and good</li>
            <li>Just apply with wooden stick, wait for wax to solidify and cool, peel up an edge, and strip away!</li>
            <li>2) it did not irritate my super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise you will easily exhaust your can in one sitting for all of the above.</li>
            <li>Not only is it easy to use it also gets all of the hair off without hurting your skin.</li>
            <li>Because it hardens, cleanup is really easy in case you drip any (unlike regular waxes).  </li>
            <li>This wax was strong enough to remove thicker hair from underarms and crotch.</li>
            <li>If you do too large of an area, the wax breaks apart</li>
            <li>Buy a ton of large popsicle sticks.</li>
            <li>The hair does have to be a certain length for it to work well</li>
            <li>Maybe since I&#x27;m not super experienced with hard wax but did more pain then removal of hair.</li>
            <li>It took a little getting used to since this was my first time waxing, but really very easy.</li>
            <li>Fifty percent of my clients get Brazilians (the other 50% are massage) and it is the most consistent among my clients.</li>
            <li>no matter how coarse or fine,</li>
            <li>I was a first time waxer and I had no serious issues using this product.  </li>
            <li>maybe I have pretty high tolerance, or maybe because the SugarPot wax experience was hell.</li>
            <li>It does take a little practice to learn to use it properly, but it gives consistently great results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly it&#x27;s a good wax, which is why I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars, but for some advice to anyone purchasing it, go on YouTube and watch videos on how to apply and use hard wax.</li>
            <li>I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend hard wax to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a fair amount of experience with strip wax.</li>
            <li>Way better than satin smooth hard waxes.</li>
            <li>It pulls hairs great and does not leave behind much residue.</li>
            <li>Believe me, much easier.</li>
            <li>The real trick is to use the wax when it is not runny at all.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really matter whether you hit the window of pliability or not.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>He bought this and brought it over, promising to change the way I experience nose breathing.</li>
            <li>, it really keeps it from tearing at your skin, and it&#x27;s really inexpensive</li>
            <li>So much easier than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does remove hair very well.</li>
            <li>This product also leaves the skin very sticky.  </li>
            <li>She really testifies to its quality and peel.</li>
            <li>but i really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Very Contnent</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Removes hair very well and heats fairly quickly, very convenient for touch ups.</li>
            <li>I was really scared after realizing that</li>
            <li>Moisturize VERY WELL every day.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know how to use it very well</li>
            <li>That was really freaking painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)go get your salon wax, carefully watch how they do</li>
            <li>I tried it on my arms and legs, but it didn&#x27;t work out very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on skin but adheres to hair really well.</li>
            <li>You get a cheap wax, and you got a big problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then, the whole process has gotten worlds easier.  </li>
            <li>At this point, it&#x27;s really just a</li>
            <li>I really prefer to wax myself because of the money I save.</li>
            <li>It melts fast and hardens fast.</li>
            <li>it require too much work</li>
            <li>The system works really well and beats having to go to someone to get waxing done.</li>
            <li>This really helps with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It really reduces the pain when your skin is not being pulled and dragged along with the wax!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>If you wax every two weeks or so, the pain will become very manageable.  </li>
            <li>After this, my parts became MUCH lighter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s MUCH easier to wax using this method.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odorless, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll take about 30 minutes or more to heat up a full can and small water droplets can condense into the can, but that&#x27;s not something you have to worry too much about.</li>
            <li>really.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper to buy the warming kit and then refill it as needed than to spend $65-85 a wax by professionals.</li>
            <li>but it was packed very well.</li>
            <li>This was really grabs onto the hair</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Too much work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very frugal person but saving the wax and straining it to use again isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>I gave it five stars because it shipped here really fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this wax for over a year and continue to really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset</li>
            <li>this product is so much cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li>I insisted I could remove it without too much discomfort.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price and how much you will save in doing this yourself at home.  </li>
            <li>But too much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first-time self waxer and went straight to trying the Brazilian on myself.</li>
            <li>or you will really just tug on your nose and be too freaked out to finish.  </li>
            <li>granted I don&#x27;t wax very often so it has lasted me awhile</li>
            <li>I primarily use this for facial waxing (lip and brow).</li>
            <li>This stuff saves me SO much money compared to a salon waxing.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the wax harden too much though so follow the instructions</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m the only one who uses it, it seems sanitary enough to reuse my own leg wax.</li>
            <li>&quot; (pun intended:) I have had it completely melted and instantly put it on my legs</li>
            <li>It can get messy, as most wax is💁, but still worth it.</li>
            <li>This wax was ok, and this noted for professional use only, but I bought it anyways.</li>
            <li>They say not to go over the same area more than once or twice, but this is completely non-irritating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different kinds and versions, but this is the only kind buy now.</li>
            <li>I use GIGI all my life but, lately, their quality product is not so good.</li>
            <li>Gets all my hairs off without any trouble and leaves me loving my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>But when I used it on my legs second time I got red spots pimple kind of things on leg ...</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s back to the regular kind for me.</li>
            <li>It would be a good idea to go and get a few professional waxes before trying to do one on your self</li>
            <li>But, if you don&#x27;t let it harden completely you will pull out the stick, but no wax (seriously!!)...leaving the wax inside for more torturous removal of smaller pieces one at a time!  </li>
            <li>I did a fairly comprehensive job and withnesed long hairs extracted even though they didn&#x27;t seem that long at upon application.  </li>
            <li>I just filter the hot wax through clean pantyhose, leaving all the hair behind and resulting in nice clean wax that can be reused for the next time.</li>
            <li>I love the results and can achieve more control with it, but the large container takes a very long time to heat (hour +) and itll make a heck of a mess if you drip.</li>
            <li>This was not an easy process the first use and took some effort and trial/error to get it down but by the end of the first session, I was sold.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while to heat up and melt, but is pretty quick to cool down and harden.</li>
            <li>(To get it to the right temp, leave the lid off while you&#x27;re warming it, and stir frequently to test it.  </li>
            <li>At first I had trouble getting the consistency right, but having the warmer makes it easy to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li>still, the first half of my first Brazilian attempt was actually easy and painless.  </li>
            <li>Pain is minimal in most areas if you apply baby oil to the skin (or my personal favorite, coconut oil) with a rag first, so the wax will then only adhere to the hair.</li>
            <li>I really like using this wax better then other kinds.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a good body hard wax.</li>
            <li>It is thick and easy to apply and peels off easily.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get all the hairs off the bikini line the first time I did it, but my skin handled it so well that I tried again the following day and it worked much better the second time</li>
            <li>Worked better than any other waxing product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>, i found that a thicker consistency of a cold honey worked best as it wasnt scalding hot on the sensitive areas and still workable.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell any difference except I prefer the other one better.</li>
            <li>Also, though the microwavable is the same wax, I wholly recommend using the standard with the warmer--much more consistently heated and simplifies the process, no reheating at the microwave, etc.</li>
            <li>Though it takes a while to apply and wax, it is extremely efficient and I love it.</li>
            <li>It also gets all the hair at once compared to other waxes I&#x27;ve tried which is much better than having to re wax the area.</li>
            <li>but, its better than any other wax I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other waxes and none work as well as this one does.</li>
            <li>I love how this wax doesn&#x27;t break like other waxes I have used</li>
            <li>Way better then any other</li>
            <li>and i feel like this one hurts more than other ones.</li>
            <li>I also own the cirepil blue wax and have found that the GiGi brand is less messy/stringy than the blue wax and also does a much better job of grabbing the hairs by the root.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to set the warmer to high and make sure you exfoliate.</li>
            <li>If it feels warm or drips and runs, it&#x27;s too hot and you&#x27;ll have a hard time peeling it off in one go.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product if you only wax small areas, like eyebrows or lips.</li>
            <li>You can use up anywhere from half the can to 3/4 of the can or more if you want to wax off your whole body [for reference as to how much is in the can].</li>
            <li>Generally it always misses some hair and I need to wax the same spot 2 or more times.</li>
            <li>; I have ample hair stubble before starting, I warm it, wait for the right consistency, turn it down, spread it on in the direction of the hair growth, wait for it to be pliable and let &#x27;er rip.</li>
            <li>This wax is waayyyyyyy better than the conventional wax that you have to use with strips.</li>
            <li>Just be super fast with the entire thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not new to waxing, but have always used Gigi&#x27;s soft waxes, for, well, ALMOST everywhere, the all purpose honee being my favorite.</li>
            <li>: as long as you use the oil, you are going to get perfectly smooth skin* using this.</li>
            <li>Well, this is going to be a long one filled with info</li>
            <li>I only do my bikini area, but I do as close to a full Sphynx wax as I can</li>
            <li>This is really only a problem if you are doing the full Monty though.&lt;br /&gt;*When</li>
            <li>I will never go back to paying close to 100$ to get full legs, bikini, and underarms done at a salon.  </li>
            <li>It has to cool a second on the stick so it doesn&#x27;t drip everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I suggest go professional waxing first and then consider whether you want to do wax by yourself.</li>
            <li>I have used many many waxes and this is the best least painful most efficient at removing hair hard wax.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to cut the hair down to 1/2 inch.</li>
            <li>I tried this to see if I liked the hard wax better than the other.</li>
            <li>Better too much than too little, because you can always rub some off if you need to.</li>
            <li>Its very messy but does job effectively.</li>
            <li>The great thing about Hard Wax is that you don&#x27;t need strips and it only sticks to the hair.  </li>
            <li>I also just started the blue hard wax which is also great</li>
            <li>The hard wax is far superior to cream wax used with muslin strips.</li>
            <li>it is very chunky too as far as removal because it gets really hard and very quickly so it doesn&#x27;t come off smoothly.</li>
            <li>I am new to home waxing, but I really like this brand.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t give up, mainly because I had ordered 10 cans of it,  Lol&lt;br /&gt;It takes practice and perseverance,  </li>
            <li>and I thought that if people are using this hard wax on their bikini areas, it MUST be better than sugar wax!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not impossible to use it on your legs, but you can&#x27;t do a big area at a time, so it takes forever.</li>
            <li>Second time around using the oil I was able to keep the gloves on the entire time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back for seconds (sometimes three or four passes) because I don&#x27;t expect it to get it all in one fell swoop, and some spots are just super stubborn and refuse to come</li>
            <li>This is my 5th or 6th jar of this particular wax.</li>
            <li>because there is a decent learning curve here.</li>
            <li>Rip it off in one quick motion, against the grain if possible.</li>
            <li>At least that wax didn&#x27;t rip apart when trying to remove and was easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The warmer is good for regulating the temperature, and if I find that it has gotten too hot/cold, I just adjust the setting (low, medium, high) and wait a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I hardly have to go over the same area twice; it does a good job at getting the hair the first pull.</li>
            <li>It hurts only a little more than the salon, but only because you have to apply and yank off so many times.</li>
            <li>how many times you mess</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t rush it or you will for sure mess it up and will have some regret.</li>
            <li>This wax drips everywhere when its too hot, once its had time to cool down its much easier to work with.  </li>
            <li>I leave it on high for 45 mins</li>
            <li>- I take a high dose aspirin an hour in advance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially since we live in a rural community, and her favorite salon is hours away.</li>
            <li>I am not a very hairy person, and my hair is fine, too.  </li>
            <li>So far better than other brands that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Unlike other waxes I&#x27;d tried, It melts to a good texture, is easy to apply and removes the hairs with minimal hair breakage (due to user error).</li>
            <li>The problem with GiGi, for me, is that it&#x27;s a little too sticky for my taste, comparing to my favorite one.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive and this wax works wonders!!</li>
            <li>It just takes a little more patience and skill.</li>
            <li>However, having said that, hard wax does kind of let you pull the wax out in any direction and still hold on to the hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not as effective and hard to pull off.</li>
            <li>Then let it sit for around 30 seconds or until its hard and no longer warm.</li>
            <li>Less pain, more effective, and less redness overall.  </li>
            <li>The wax sets up fast and hard for quick, clean hair removal...</li>
            <li>Smoother than smooth, and absolutely no problems with stuff sticking and leaking.</li>
            <li>Clean and pat dry areas that are going to be waxed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Carefully work an edge free as soon as it starts to get gummy.  </li>
            <li>As long as you use oil freely beforehand (I used sensitive formula baby oil in cotton squares) the sticking to your skin fear is a mute one.</li>
            <li>(If you let it cool too long it will not work).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It takes the hair off from different areas of the body pretty much every time.</li>
            <li>But, I was also able to do the top halves of my legs in that time (got bored waiting on the thicker strips in denser areas to completely harden for removal.)  </li>
            <li>I may not be professional, but I&#x27;ve used the all-purpose wax for a long time and it has worked fantastic (maybe a bit of residue at time).</li>
            <li>I suggest using the normal one instead of this one.</li>
            <li>It also lasts several uses, so it&#x27;s worth its price 100%.</li>
            <li>It is messy as most of the people do say..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waxed for years using normal Gigi wax.</li>
            <li>I NORMALLY WOULD GET MINE</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>It can get kind of taffy-like when you pile it on too thick and then doesn&#x27;t pull off as it should.</li>
            <li>I usually love GiGi Wax products and have used other brands of hard wax and love them.</li>
            <li>It melts in no time and goes on smooth along with drying fast which makes for removing less painfull.</li>
            <li>I guess all I can add is to make sure the layer applied is super thin then with your finger, keep pulling up at one of the edges</li>
            <li>My only problem is getting the temperature control just right.</li>
            <li>To keep it at the right temp, go between Low and Off on your heater while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>I used it on my left armpit and right leg.</li>
            <li>Beats having to spend $100 plus for the same thing I can do right at home.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need the muslin strips for this because the wax hardens enough that you can just rip it right off.</li>
            <li>At first there are little pieces of wax left on your skin, but you&#x27;ll soon find that you get better at it.</li>
            <li>I know i was hurting more because of my slowness because later when i took a deep breath and pulled fast, i only felt a sting and not the pain I was feeling from pulling slowly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have even tried putting more than one layer of wax on the same spot to get it thick enough to be able to pull the end...</li>
            <li>and you stalled just long enough or haven&#x27;t gotten it warm enough</li>
            <li>I was new to waxing when I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li>and i am a new fan.</li>
            <li>(yes, I&#x27;m really new to waxing) using some sugar wax called Sugarpot.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfectly legal in most places to reuse hard wax.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gets hard too quickly and hurts a lot more than the regular wax</li>
            <li>This is amazing, I have been waxing for years and I in the last few years started waxing myself.</li>
            <li>Less pain easy to operate..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would have come off if I spent some time with oil or a scrubber, but I don&#x27;t like to spend extra time which is why I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li>But to be fair, there isn&#x27;t really enough Advil to make it not hurt at least a little.&lt;br /&gt;*Start</li>
            <li>Overall, this is totally worth the money, and completely diy doable.  </li>
            <li>Although I LOVE European Wax Center</li>
            <li>It was a tiny free trial wax that was not even the same type.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Make sure the hair is long enough, even if it&#x27;s tempting to get rid of them as fast as possible.</li>
            <li>and she has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>though wax doesn&#x27;t come off easily so it leaves it a mess.</li>
            <li>I recommend, just read the instruction before and Use oil before application, that makes all the difference, a little oil other wise</li>
            <li>for where this falls in line with other hard waxes, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>only problem I had on my first try was that I was a bit of a coward.  </li>
            <li>The first time was essentially a disaster, because I hadn&#x27;t read any of the tips from the reviews, and forgot to use the pre-epilation oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;Alright, so the first time I used this stuff, it sucked big time.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it in the long term.  </li>
            <li>Soft wax just can&#x27;t compare to this stuff!</li>
            <li>finally decided to suck it up and wax for my first time, using the GiGi kit.</li>
            <li>The wax warmer, wooden sticks, and wax all pay for themselves within the first use.  </li>
            <li>With experience the time it takes to wax will fo down, it took me about 3 hours of trial and error before the process was working in a way that allowed me to be comfortable.</li>
            <li>Get it right on your legs first, and know you&#x27;re going to mess up on your lady parts anyway.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Toward the end, I figured out that when the wax was applied thinly enough to nearly qualify as &amp;#34;strands&amp;#34;, that seemed to be the easiest, least messy and ripped the  hair out the best, taking everything with it.  </li>
            <li>The normal honey hard wax is better for underarm hair and pubic hair.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s made for the most sensitive skins for that area.</li>
            <li>what i did was use the hot plate from an old basic on/off coffee maker.</li>
            <li>It takes a few tries to get used to knowing when the wax is ready to be stripped off, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Good product, takes a little longer to dry on the skin than some I have used in the past, but overall it&#x27;s fine and cools off relatively fast.  </li>
            <li>I understand there are better hard waxes out there, but many aren&#x27;t for sale in small quantities or at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She has vowed never to put a razor near &amp;#34;the zone&amp;#34; again after the smooth long lasting difference of this wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is difficult to use for first - timers, but once you know what you are doing, there really isn&#x27;t any better wax out there.</li>
            <li>Im sure future waxes will be easier but take the first time slow.</li>
            <li>Nice thick layers!</li>
            <li>If I had better lighting and didn&#x27;t get distracted by what&#x27;s on screen occasionally, I could prabably do this in an hour and a half or less.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I just waited for it to dry, and it peeled right off the carpet.</li>
            <li>The wax was easy to remove, a little messy, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the olive oil to remove all the wax, I did apply some Bee Magic to just sooth my skin.</li>
            <li>I always wax the upper bikini area with no problems, but decided to try this one for the lower part since it has so many positive reviews (the wax..not my lower parts ;P.&lt;br /&gt;First, please know how to use hard, stripless wax.</li>
            <li>Second time I think I left mine in for 3-4 minutes and make sure you pull straight down (not out)</li>
            <li>The above setting will help you accomplish the task more efficiently, faster and with a minimum mess.</li>
            <li>it ok but make a big mess</li>
            <li>This is a large quantity and will last for some time.</li>
            <li>Pure and simple garbage.</li>
            <li>A little hard for the face, but it does a great job removing the hair.</li>
            <li>I order the GiGi wax kit after reading reviews there were many negative reviews, but there were enough positive reviews to make me buy it.</li>
            <li>After the second strip the first should be mildy cool and that is when you pull the skin tight and let em rip.</li>
            <li>Just remember, don&#x27;t be cheap when you apply it on, and leave a little goop near the end</li>
            <li>This one would still work okay, but is hard work and takes longer time.</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve and it doesn&#x27;t matter how many reviews you read, everything is hard to remember when you&#x27;ve accidentally globbed on a chunk of wax on your armpit</li>
            <li>Hard wax is able to be picked up by hand.</li>
            <li>I always have been a fan of gigi brazilian body hard wax, i absolutely love it</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hard wax.</li>
            <li>This stuff rocks, love the hard wax.</li>
            <li>it way too sticky, hard to remove and does not remove completely most of the hair in the needed area</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE HARD WAX.</li>
            <li>This hard wax pulls off much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this hard wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better hard waxes, but this gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The Brazilian Body Hard Wax also sticks directly to hair and not skin, which is another factor that I really love.</li>
            <li>Use thinner strips on your legs and maybe do it with a friend (doing the back of your own legs is really hard).  </li>
            <li>I am NOW hearing that soft crème wax with strips are 1,000 times better than hard wax.</li>
            <li>I tried baby powder and baby oil to prevent the wax from grabbing the skin and oil definitely helped out more but made it hard to spread as it would move around too much.</li>
            <li>Clearly you need the heater for this</li>
            <li>(this wax is gentle enough where it shouldn&#x27;t be aproblem-it wasn&#x27;t for me, and I have fairly sensitive skin that is prone to irritation).</li>
            <li>I did not know that my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>I had been waxed professionally before, but grew weary of the price tag and decided to try it myself.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin but only to the hair which makes waxing so much easier and bearable.</li>
            <li>Before using this product, I had never had a wax done professionally or by myself.  </li>
            <li>The first time it took me twice as long, but after I got used to things, my time improved.  </li>
            <li>I even used it on my face and it didn&#x27;t cause any problems with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I would not waste your money with this brand.</li>
            <li>I am also very squeamish and a big baby, but I can deal with the pain.  </li>
            <li>let it get completely brittle before you pull and</li>
            <li>My girlfriend also has sensitive skin, so that says something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing for almost a year with GiGi products (sensitive wax), and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it</li>
            <li>though it by no means makes you a professional, go out to a salon and get one done</li>
            <li>So far I have used it to wax my eyebrows, face, legs, and</li>
            <li>I know that strips are for soft waxes</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It heats up well, attached well to the hairs and comes off well, as long as you pre-treat the area with oil first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried strips and seriously am surprised I even wanted to try waxing again after that trauma 😣</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>The wax is gentle enough for my bakini area</li>
            <li>I also use a lidocaine spray that decreases the pain with sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I tried for literally two whole days to melt this enough to use it....</li>
            <li>I do brazilian, so absolutely nothing is left after I get to it.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have nails, you can use an old butter knife to help scrape it off.  </li>
            <li>I can also get a thinner layer than I can get with the soft wax.</li>
            <li>Plus, no added fragrances, just the natural pine smell of the resin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wax tends to get more the tiny peach fuzz hair and the medium coarse hair; that&#x27;s perfect for me, because those are the ones I hate trying to tweeze!</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t had any growback so far.  </li>
            <li>Rub baby powder over sensitive areas before applying (keeps it from sticking to your skin, but not the hair).</li>
            <li>Like it so far</li>
            <li>Now, I have used Gigi microwave stripless wax, and it is nowhere near as sticky as this one.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it affecting those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use soft wax for brazilian waxing.</li>
            <li>I read nearly every review</li>
            <li>I had always felt like it was pricey to go to a professional but</li>
            <li>I would completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It did take some getting used to, as I started with the soft wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I put sown an old sheet on the bathroom floor and go for it.</li>
            <li>whereas the soft (Honee) wax removes almost EVERYTHING in one pull.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad at least that the Honee wax works well for me, because this stuff is MYSTIFYING.</li>
            <li>I had a professional wax and this is what they used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so versatile, I&#x27;ve eliminated soft wax from all but the most delicate of hair removal protocols.</li>
            <li>If you pull too early it may be gooey in last applied area of swathe and stringily stretch apart, and if you let it cool too long</li>
            <li>more feel of thick candle wax on body</li>
            <li>I bought this wax a month ago because I was tired of making my own sugar wax and having to use strips.</li>
            <li>Its good, but expensive.</li>
            <li>that didn&#x27;t stick for me and i was hurting more because I was pulling slow.  </li>
            <li>It should be spread thick enough that it can be peeled off while still slightly warm and still malleable.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you do not put it on too thick.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like the cooler the wax was, I had to pull more slowly.  </li>
            <li>Using it with strips brought my (full Brazilian) waxing time from 60 minutes down to 20 minutes</li>
            <li>You put it on let it cool down, and pull with your fingers.</li>
            <li>wax is by far superior to any other hard wax I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, after a pretty easy learning curve, I would recommend this product to anyone is tired of shaving.  </li>
            <li>The wax dries fairly quickly so u don&#x27;t have to wait a long time, also remains solid when u pull it and doesn&#x27;t tear.</li>
            <li>The Brazilian Body Hard Wax is easy to work with, doesn&#x27;t create a sticky mess, and leaves skin feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I spent hours trying to get the \\&quot;flick\\&quot; of pulling the tab of wax in just the right way for it to remove the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on my significant other&#x27;s back and it worked like a charm, but it&#x27;s also gentle enough to use on my face and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t judge), which worked except that the wax cools down extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>This product is great, but not for the faint of heart!</li>
            <li>I think over 50% pulled out by this wax was pulled completely out with all of its roots and caused slight bleeding in those but not excessively, actually it was at most a tiny drop the size of the tip of a pencil.  </li>
            <li>Immediately press down on that spot with your free hand for a few seconds to calm the skin and minimize bleeding.</li>
            <li>I soaked a little isopropyl alcohol in a cotton ball to clean the areas to be waxed, pat dried them with a paper towel and then applied baby powder pretty much everywhere.</li>
            <li>The product is fine, and captures the small hairs.</li>
            <li>a few tips - don&#x27;t forget your aspirin, have everything set up and prepared before getting started, don&#x27;t let your wax get too hot/thin, have some muslin nearby just for keeping your hands clean</li>
            <li>I mainly do Armpit and upper lips with this.</li>
            <li>Luckily I only applied to a small area and I was able to remove it -</li>
            <li>product only makes sense if you&#x27;re willing to shell out the money for the wax warmer by the same company though.</li>
            <li>I have used several brands of hard and soft wax, wax strips, and sugaring paste, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>There is no other wax to use as far as I am concerned.  </li>
            <li>I leave it on high with the cover OFF for about twenty minutes then leave it on low with the cover on for the rest of the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heat for 20 minutes on high, then turn it on low.</li>
            <li>I have a high pain threshold, and I&#x27;m used to waxing in salons and at home, so maybe I&#x27;m biased in favor of it.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that a lot of people commented, and I definitely agree</li>
            <li>It works so well with minimal pain and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It makes for a smooth wax, with very little of the rashy aftermath.</li>
            <li>Performs as expected, it has a slight pine scent to it, nothing overwhelming</li>
            <li>Hard wax is definitely the way to go for more sensitive areas like underarms or brazillian/bikini.</li>
            <li>gradually peel up enough of one end and rip away once hard and pretty cool.</li>
            <li>They never get the hair (I have coarse hair) and leaves a huge sticky mess.</li>
            <li>Removes every small hair from my face and body, and leaves my skin smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>I checked the directions, just to be sure what I was doing, and unlike all my other Gigi products, only the ingredients we listed in English, for only some of the products.</li>
            <li>You do not need muslin strips to press on top of it--you just spread the wax on in a little area, let it cool until it&#x27;s not gooey anymore, and slowly peel it off in opposite direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li>This stuff takes a little bit of skill and it will hurt something fierce the first time you use it on a sensitive area with thick hair, but once you get the timing down and learn a few tricks - it works great!  </li>
            <li>Always wanted to be hair free in an area that I consider a little private to show off at the salon.  </li>
            <li>I know some say it was hard to get off but for me i just used my nails and scrapped it off easily.  </li>
            <li>Wax was easy to spread but hard to get off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing for many years and always used the blue hard wax</li>
            <li>it takes more time to get hard enough to pull of!</li>
            <li>I love the hard wax, the only think I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>Hair starts to grow back relatively quickly in comparison to other waxes or wax strips.</li>
            <li>I like the hard wax much better than regular wax as well.</li>
            <li>I watched SO many videos on youtube on the specific techniques of applying &amp; using hard wax, and I&#x27;m at a loss as to what the problem is.</li>
            <li>You need not use any cloth strips, just a thick coating of the wax, cool, rip and it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li>I love using the GiGi hard wax system!</li>
            <li>I love hard waxes too!</li>
            <li>Be carful not to use really hot water or satay in too long because you don&#x27;t want to open up your pores too</li>
            <li>I do my own waxing, because it gets expensive to have a professional do it.</li>
            <li>Finally, you definitely want to moisturize with something gentle.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t work as well, and lay it on THICK especially at the top of the strip where you are going to start your pull.</li>
            <li>Make sure it is thick enough on area where you want to remove.  </li>
            <li>This wax gets the job done, but took forever to melt and was super messy.</li>
            <li>Coming back to this wax, it leaves a very soft skin.</li>
            <li>it does dry, or if I mess up with the strip, it&#x27;s still easy to pull off once it hardens.</li>
            <li>whole area gets really sensitive and it takes a long time when you first start, so if you find it getting unbearable, do your armpits or your legs or stomach or whatever for fifteen or twenty minutes and give it a little rest.&lt;br /&gt;*Look</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever waxed or anything other than shaving for manscaping (yes i am a man).</li>
            <li>I used it on my face and other areas of the body first, and they went over ...</li>
            <li>(I use this to wax myself, not other people).  </li>
            <li>It also smells good in my opinion (like beeswax), and I noticed a lot less irritation with this vs. whatever they used in the salons and a LOT less irritation than with sugaring, and far less pain in my case than when I paid to get it done.</li>
            <li>This makes the removal process more effective and less painful since it doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have found that using them when bikini waxing makes the process much faster, I don&#x27;t get as much wax in my fingernails from pulling the strips, and it&#x27;s overall less</li>
            <li>wax is more brittle, speads less well, holds hair less well, leaves more residue, removes less hair and is less</li>
            <li>/&gt;Learning curve was very small, I got used to this stuff very quickly.</li>
            <li>They have a buy 1 get 1 free of the hard wax and the wax warmer was on sale.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this GiGi hard wax for anyone looking for a quality hard wax that is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Has a very slight but not unpleasant medicinal smell when heated.</li>
            <li>little tip I learned with using it (and oil, don&#x27;t forget the oil) is to pull it up a lot more slowly than you might think you should, as this prevents the hair from breaking as much</li>
            <li>Got this for the wife and it works better than the honey and less mess.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to all of my family and friends, when I recieved the product I was shocked on how great this product it.</li>
            <li>I use sugar wax on my eyebrows, but honestly that&#x27;s pretty painful</li>
            <li>If you wait too long, it will obviously harden too much.  </li>
            <li>But obviously, since I had been to a spa once and gotten it done, I was a professional.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It still hurts, especially if you have sensitive skin like me, but it gets better!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It still hurts, especially if you have sensitive skin like me, but it gets better!&lt;br</li>
            <li>it adheres to only the hair and doesn&#x27;t rip it off with skin like soft wax can.</li>
            <li>I barely felt it.</li>
            <li>a local Sally Beauty near you and get the membership card, gives you a discount.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a fast rip like with the strip waxing I tried, and I found if I pulled too fast, I would pull off a chunk.  </li>
            <li>I do actually use it for a brazilian wax,other than normally puffiness and red irritation that comes with a wax, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>All of them have failed spectacularly.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s kind of weird to have someone else do a brazilian wax on me.</li>
            <li>After some failed attempts to make my own sugar wax (which is basically burned sugar on the stove)</li>
            <li>and it really doenst get hard enough to pull off quickly with one big pull.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re sporting a forest down there, cut it first.</li>
            <li>I did this because I heard that although it is more painful, it is better than soft wax because it leaves your skin less irritated.</li>
            <li>I feel like it hurt me less to wax myself than to have the job done professionally, but it did take me much much longer to get it done (</li>
            <li>It is easy to get used to after a few tries you will be an expert at it.</li>
            <li>It dried so quickly and deeply that it pulled off</li>
            <li>I would advise growing hair to at least 1/4 inch before attempting the wax unless you dont mind it being less effective.</li>
            <li>Could be less messy, but it gets the job done mostly.</li>
            <li>(I think there was a slight learning curve, plus I was super nervous the first time as I thought it would be much more painful than it was).  </li>
            <li>At best you&#x27;re going to end up with a painful, goopy mess.</li>
            <li>Cleaned the area and started to clean the sides as I worked through the middle - which I think was the most painful part.</li>
            <li>I bought my first pot from a beauty supply store, and then thought to check Amazon and found that it was literally half the price...</li>
            <li>The wax does have a slight learning curve if it is the first time you&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>Even used pretty thickly, half a can is all you need for both legs&lt;</li>
            <li>I used to use Bliss Poetic hard wax</li>
            <li>This worked pretty well, but leaves a sticky mess on the skin.</li>
            <li>I do recommend using the pre waxing oil liberally as this is hard to clean up</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a whole other \\&quot;ball of wax\\</li>
            <li>The other 50% had roots too but not the whole root</li>
            <li>I use to have a license to wax  amongst other things, This product really works well if you develop a technique</li>
            <li>We were unable to make this work with strips, as other reviewers recommended, but did find, as said before, that with a little practice, the wax gives you a nice, smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just bought the wax warmer, the hard wax (with 1 free) and a big popsicle stick to spread</li>
            <li>I did find myself having to pinch little bits and pieces of wax (along with hair) at a time, which was excruciatingly painful, but this is my own fault for not being able to pull fast enough.</li>
            <li>As a novice home-waxer, I bought this at the same time as the All Purpose Honee wax, after hearing that harder wax was much gentler on the skin.</li>
            <li>Also, after your wax has gotten hot and melted , turn the setting down to LOW and leave it for another 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the wax cool hard.  </li>
            <li>The hard wax is just the best at getting thick hairs out of those hard to reach places without me having to grow them out for a month.</li>
            <li>Better than other hard waxes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>(make sure they use the hard wax like European Wax Center).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting Brazilians and my underarms done for several years, so I knew the general gist of how to use the product.</li>
            <li>Second, the wax should be just barely melted.</li>
            <li>At first I had trouble pulling the wax off.</li>
            <li>It gets a bit messy the first time you use it</li>
            <li>but I read a few reviews, tips and watched a YouTube video then proceeded to my first attempt with a diy Brazilian.</li>
            <li>This wax did the trick, more or less, but I found it very messy.</li>
            <li>My routine consists of first turning the machine on high at least an hour before you want to start waxing to melt the wax, and then after its all melted I alternate between low and turning it off for a few minutes, otherwise it gets too hot.  </li>
            <li>I originally had the normal wax from Gigi and that stuff was a mess, hard to work with, and hard to clean up...</li>
            <li>Love this hard wax!!</li>
            <li>It gets hard too quickly and i don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li>spread a thin layer thinking less is better, It is not!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as other waxes I&#x27;ve tried, and after using it a few times, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!</li>
            <li>The whole process (brazillian and underarms) took me around an hour and a half to two hours, but I took my time and was distracted by watching some Netflix.  </li>
            <li>I heat it for a little while on hot, then to extra low.  </li>
            <li>I know which areas are more or less sensitive, so I can alternate between the painful and not painful areas.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get the pre-epilator oil or the wax removal because I&#x27;ve checked the youtube videos and some other reviews which says normal baby oil works as well.</li>
            <li>I have tried every single hard wax available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine art though, because if its too thin you get a lot of leftover flaky wax which is a pain in the butt to get rid of.</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s really messy and stringy, but I&#x27;m fairly certain all wax is like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was always OK but sorta messy and sticky, but the hard wax is a completely different experience</li>

            <li> I bought this product after reading all the great reviews on here.</li>
            <li> (they worked great).</li>

            <li> This is a great, great product.</li>

            <li> it works great.</li>
            <li> All the products worked great together.</li>
            <li> Great quality product.</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried here in the US, and it&#x27;s very easy to use, once you got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product!!</li>
            <li> I do not recommend for the bikini parts at freaking all (unless you are into that torture feels great kind of thing!)</li>
            <li> Amazing wax!</li>
            <li> but the benefits are amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot!</li>
            <li> Love this product its great for the legs and bikini area!</li>
            <li> For me works perfect, I love it.</li>
            <li> my coochie is quite smooth, im happy, my boyfriend&#x27;s happy, his chin and balls are happy!</li>
            <li> If you are going to try this wax, have the oil to remove it handy!</li>
            <li> Peels away nicely!</li>
            <li> The best suggesting ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product.</li>
            <li> its perfect and worthwhile.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> consistency is perfect, and easy to remove from counter-tops and skin if some of the wax strays.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it takes me a good 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m that kind of brave.</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> It grabs on to the hairs really good</li>
            <li> good Luck</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to work with but just breaks the hair off.  </li>
            <li> But once you use the oil, it&#x27;s a breeze, and the results are really good.</li>
            <li> This wax held onto all of it and pulled it out really good.  </li>
            <li> Good wax for home use, but way surpassed by Cirepil Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably a good idea.</li>
            <li> I loved the result.</li>
            <li> This wax picks up hair well and lasts a good while, depending on climate, body hair texture, growth and re-growth.</li>
            <li> This wax is good.</li>
            <li> Pre-epilation oil is good for reducing the pain ( Brazilian).</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand where these good reviews are from...&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;FAKE GOOD REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a good job on thinner hair on my legs, but the bikini area...</li>
            <li> but this stuff does as good of a job at a fraction of the price and</li>
            <li> This is a really good quality wax.</li>
            <li> Its a good product.</li>
            <li> This kit honestly worked great on my eyebrows and my daughter&#x27;s</li>
            <li> As an athletic man, I can&#x27;t begin to describe how wonderful it feels to be smooth done there.  </li>
            <li> and you do need to apply a good amount of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just makes sense to go this route money wise.</li>
            <li> The good stuff.</li>
            <li> Works good for legs and bikini area.</li>
            <li> Good for course hair</li>
            <li> wise ...</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bleeding or hurting, I just thought it would be good for the skin to have some healing &amp; moisturizing cream after waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Also a good price.</li>
            <li> but I will change the rating if I find out a good method.&lt;br /&gt;Under</li>

            <li> This strip free wax is very good.</li>
            <li> I have continued to buy this product for all my waxing needs as I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still I was very satisfied with the experience and plan to use again.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this wax were for the most part were great, and for newbies like myself it takes a lot of practice to use this wax</li>

            <li> the product is absolutely great, just what I needed :)</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my eyebrows and its great.</li>
            <li> IN ALL:  I am very satisfied with this product, stripless wax is the one for me.  </li>
            <li> Cleans up nice and not sticky and a good price for the amount.</li>
            <li> and I did an awesome job all by myself because it was so easy to use :)</li>
            <li> I love this wax!</li>
            <li> The ingrown hairs are much, much better!  </li>

            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how affordable this is compared to going to a salon, and in my opinion it works BETTER!</li>
            <li> if hot water- which by the way works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this wax!</li>
            <li> but I love this wax!</li>

            <li> I love this!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Even walking feels better!</li>
            <li> On top of that, it still missed sections of hair!  </li>
            <li> I was able to do my nose and ears without a problem!  </li>

            <li> I like this a lot more than prewaxed sheets!</li>
            <li> the shipping was free BTW!!</li>
            <li> Still way better than having a stranger wax you and paying through the nose once a month!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The awesome thing is that my hair grew out So much softer and I haven&#x27;t shaved for weeks!</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve to doing your own waxing but it is so nice to be able to do it in the privacy of your own home!  </li>
            <li> This is the best wax in large containers out there.</li>
            <li> This wax is amazing.</li>
            <li> AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I just have myself an Amazing Brazilian wax</li>
            <li> This wax is amazing.</li>
            <li> This wax is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> But THIS stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is cheap and it works great.</li>
            <li> (I just hop in a slightly warm shower and do a quck wash.  </li>
            <li> Suggestion---don&#x27;t try to use any kind of waxing cloth/paper with this.</li>
            <li> Simply warm it up in the wax warmer until it gets to be a caramel thickness to it</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; wax - the kind that you use without strips.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted to start doing my own wax at home.  </li>
            <li> and sometimes I&#x27;ll get some really nice patches that stay nice for two weeks.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> so you kind of know what to do and what your pain tolerance is going to</li>
            <li> But if you do, those scissors you have handy find another use.</li>
            <li> But if you do, those scissors you have handy find another use.</li>
            <li> I started doing my own waxes after getting fed-up with paying $70+ for a patchy job...</li>
            <li> But it works effectively (98%).</li>
            <li> but they took away the brand I liked and upped the prices of the others....</li>
            <li> Nice wax.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to not have to use the strips.</li>
            <li> I had some kind of allergic reaction to this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that kind of money sitting around to have my hair removed, so I went ahead and got a can of this stuff, some applicators, and a wax warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you do your own waxing, buy this stuff - it truly rocks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it melted nicely in a pot of boiling water.</li>
            <li> When those sticks ran out, I shaped my own out of tongue depressors.</li>
            <li> Great fast shipping and the wax works great.</li>
            <li> This wax is kind of like having a baby, I guess.  </li>
            <li> I do my own brazilian, and I wax my own armpits.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try it on my own.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t apply it as nicely.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice.  </li>
            <li> made it warm</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> I use it to do my own Brazilians and it&#x27;s worked out well with my method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to use cloth in order to rip this wax off.  </li>
            <li> I just let it warm up on medium for about 40 minutes while I do something else, and prepare the area with baby powder.</li>
            <li> Cloth strips are not needed for this product and had a nice bees wax smell to it.</li>
            <li> I think most problems that come with this are from user error, and it&#x27;s a really good wax.</li>
            <li> I honestly became a fan of GiGi products and i just bought they numbing spray as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the wax heater machine, so I warm it in my oven</li>
            <li> /&gt;After waxing I use aloe Vera or rose water to avoid break out.</li>
            <li> This was nice</li>
            <li> My last experience with home waxing was a misery, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything great from this, but I was very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave my self a bikini wax and it came out really great, soft and smooth and was very proud of myself.</li>
            <li> but I sure did and am very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that it worked well, but this is a great value and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> It works great, All smooth:).</li>
            <li> Its easy to melt n use and has good results.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this from Amazon.com several times and I have always had a good experience and it has arrived on time in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cleanup was also very easy.</li>
            <li> This wax works much better than the kind they had at my salon.</li>
            <li> Given how tricky this is to use, you might wonder whether it&#x27;s really suitable for DIYers.</li>
            <li> actually I loved how smooth my legs feels after waxing.</li>
            <li> you start, make sure you have baby powder, coconut oil (or the oil in the kit) and scissors handy.</li>
            <li> (it works amazingly for this), and as many others have said -</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees makes a talc-free powder that just has a light honey scent to it, and I&#x27;ve had good experience with that.  </li>
            <li> cheap, good, and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> By far the best home waxing kit I have used (And I&#x27;ve tried a lot.)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best wax.</li>
            <li> I am waxing for 5 years now (by myself) and this is by far the best wax ever.</li>
            <li> and I had great success,</li>
            <li> So far this wax works great!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pinch the wax to start ripping it off, work an edge free first and use that, otherwise you&#x27;ll give yourself an impressive bruise.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, remove and does its job!</li>
            <li> Great and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW EASY IT IS TO APPLY AND REMOVE!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s very important.</li>
            <li> Very very important.</li>
            <li> This wax works great heat it up and make sure its creamy and not too hot</li>
            <li> will admit that it kind of smells like sap, and sometimes you do get bits sticking, (though this is easily resolved with the gigi prewax oil)</li>
            <li> Application was easy, I used a chopstick to roll the wax on in the direction of the hair growth, and got a nice even layer.  </li>
            <li> When I used it first time I find it very nice..</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about this product!</li>
            <li> It works so well and even better if you use the pre epi oil also by Gigi.</li>
            <li> Also I love this wax.</li>
            <li> its one of my favorites out of the many I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my underarms, which works phenomenally.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> This wax is obnoxiously sticky and will ruin most things if it happens to drip on it.</li>
            <li> er done\\&quot;!!  When I had it done at the spa, it hurt more, and I took two ibuprofin before I went.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to the hair thinning and having more time in waxes.</li>
            <li> and when you pull it all gone. :-)</li>
            <li> You could seriously do better removing hair with chewed up bubble gum.  </li>
            <li> I bought the whole brazalian kit which was a great buy.</li>
            <li> I am glad to purchased both the items( Gigi wax and Gigi wax heater).</li>
            <li> Can not find this size product in my drugstore any more.</li>
            <li> Be sure to let it heat</li>
            <li> LOVE this wax.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay the $70 or more that area salons are charging for bikini waxes, so I decided to DIY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it hurts more, and it&#x27;s messier.</li>
            <li> used along with the gigi warmer she is able to do any touch up work at home in between salon visits, which saves us both time and money.</li>
            <li> Love this wax.  </li>
            <li> wax mostly just rips my hair, it doesn&#x27;t rip it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update, I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it many times over to wax myself as well as others.</li>
            <li> Like this and will get more when I need it.</li>
            <li> It hardens way to fast and doesn&#x27;t rip off great</li>
            <li> I bought the kit with the warmer and the oils, and I&#x27;m really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been getting Brazilian waxes for almost two years before I moved away from my favorite salon</li>
            <li> when using it: make sure it&#x27;s about the consistency of honey,</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> So far so good it does a good job as in waxing, will continue to test</li>
            <li> Did the waxing myself for the first time using this wax and it works amazing!</li>
            <li> Basic, best product!</li>
            <li> leaves residue more than i planned.</li>
            <li> what more can a girl ask for?</li>
            <li> This is the second time ordering it; she uses it for her bikini area and it works perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Their wax warmer is great to Go with this and works very well to heat this up.</li>
            <li> Prep the skin extremely important!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with coconut oil</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> luck! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I bought this wax.</li>
            <li> Love not having to go to the salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li> this works way better.</li>
            <li> do not wax more than once in one setting.</li>
            <li> Granted, it takes me longer to wax myself, but I&#x27;m getting better.  </li>
            <li> I love being able to just scrape it off a linoleum floor or peel it off of myself, if needed.  </li>
            <li> in any way is better any time.</li>
            <li> great buy and much cheaper then at stores.</li>
            <li> Possibly the best wax product for brazilian and under arms.</li>
            <li> On top of that  </li>
            <li> I just need to get better at it.</li>
            <li> , my toaster warms up faster and is more efficient</li>
            <li> I bought the set and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I have used this wax for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this wax.  </li>
            <li> use it with the Gigi wax warmer and love it.  </li>
            <li> This is one of those things you get better at the more you do it.  </li>
            <li> the more hair it took off.</li>
            <li> I love this wax but the can came dented which caused the wax to spill when melted</li>
            <li> it covers way more body</li>
            <li> That said I have tried many waxes over the years to do my bikini area.  </li>
            <li> MOST OF THE HAIR CAME OFF.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d either have to pick the pieces out or apply more wax to try again.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this wax.</li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> Love how you don&#x27;t need the paper wax strips.</li>
            <li> Worked better then</li>
            <li> Because no trips are used, I was actually able to wax parts that I have never been able to before.</li>
            <li> I was able to wax everything off with some trial and error.</li>
            <li> Make sure your skin is taut.</li>
            <li> i have an issue with gripping it to remove, you have to bend the edge a bit</li>
            <li> Be sure to use pre-wax oil or coconut oil to help prevent it from sticking to your skin.</li>
            <li> Best American wax in this country</li>
            <li> ( like you would hold a blob of gum and stick it to more gum to get it off).</li>
            <li> Love to use this wax for armpits.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love not having to deal with fabric strips.</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> Sprinkle baby powder on top of the wax after applying so that you can touch it sooner without it sticking to your fingers.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve gotten the hang of waxing, it will let you wax areas more than once per sitting - no problem.</li>
            <li> i will love to shop more stuff.</li>
            <li> just ok.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Much better.</li>
            <li> Thank guys :)</li>
            <li> love this in the summer.</li>
            <li> Maybe practice makes perfect, but I&#x27;m going to try a different type of wax.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite wax.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It works like magic.</li>
            <li> Every person is different, so it takes some time figuring out what temperature, thickness etc that works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I found that I had to go over areas more than twice to get all of the hair out.</li>
            <li> and it hurts more.</li>
            <li> I love love love love LOVE</li>
            <li> Tried so many products for my underarm hair.</li>
            <li> This works great Thanks.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this sure did the trick.  </li>
            <li> and then it hurts so much more.  </li>
            <li> Pamper yourself - don&#x27;t cause more work.</li>
            <li> i am the most unsatisfied customer</li>
            <li> Make sure to have a towel or cardboard under you when using.</li>
            <li> I used a cheap candle warmer to heat it, and it took forever to warm up, but after that, it works</li>
            <li> I love that it does not require strips.</li>
            <li> was not at all what i was expecting, disapointed :)</li>
            <li> Lovely smell, no irritation.</li>
            <li> but it did stop the plastic lid from fitting when cooled.</li>
            <li> and I love not having to use strips to take it off.</li>
            <li> I love this wax because you don&#x27;t need cloth to pull it off.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> and I use this more than the all purpose wax that came in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> okay -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this wax.</li>
            <li> It took more time to wax</li>
            <li> If you have to apply more wax I found it best to just apply it directly on top of the initial layer and then trying to evenly spread it out.  </li>
            <li> You have to make sure that you oil your skin before applying it so that it doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to try this wax.</li>
            <li> but that was ok.</li>
            <li> I cannot love without this and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> you wiggle it around once inside to make sure it coats all hair</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li> It was the most disastereble experience I had.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find better wax for brazilian waxing than this one.</li>
            <li> Any longer and the wax won&#x27;t be able to rip it off and it&#x27;ll be like taking bubblegum out of your hair.</li>
            <li> However, the level of pain you feel is a ton greater</li>
            <li> Love the brand.</li>
            <li> I even got this really satisfying ziiiip</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I think its because this one is more of a honey texture</li>
            <li> It does an okay job and getting the hairs off though</li>
            <li> great for Brazilian... goes on cool, sets up quickly</li>
            <li> This was melts nicely and is super easy to apply!</li>
            <li> forget about going to a salon; this wax is exactly like the brazilian wax salons - and I can tell because I am brazilian!!!</li>
            <li> hair is very fine and breaks easily (some growth from in the hemp waxed area, where I think I broke the hairs off instead of pulling them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the quality is good...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this a dozen times already, it&#x27;s a great product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This wax is pretty good.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> It took me 1 full hour for the wax to warm up</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and is amazing, HOWEVER- Definitely not for beginners!!</li>
            <li> I quickly ordered my own jar (as my wife already had the warming pot).</li>
            <li> use a shower curtain from a dollar store so it makes clean-up easy, just a helpful hint :)</li>
            <li> Love it and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Part of the reason it was so easy for me to use was because I had a lot done before I decided to do it myself, and I like doing it myself more than getting it done.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and seems to remove most hair from one use.</li>
            <li> FOr the experienced waxer though, this is far more product for your dollar.</li>
            <li> It also is very easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> They give you better fine control over where the wax ends up.</li>
            <li> Hair comes off clean!</li>
            <li> Smooth, soft and tingly after a good waxing!</li>
            <li> It does the job very nicely, like a professional waxing experience!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more comfortable and faster if you do, but the hair will be gone regardless.     </li>
            <li> Works great for bikini waxing, but if you want to use it on your legs or arms, I would suggest using sugar-based soft wax (to be used with strips).</li>
            <li> This wax is the most smooth that i have found.</li>
            <li> you get smooth skin in no time :)</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of having the kit available when I want and the non-salon prices can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> I loathe muslim strips and am so glad to have this available to me.</li>
            <li> as too much will also cause issues with the wax getting a good grip on shorter hairs.</li>
            <li> I would say this is as good of a wax as any and at an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and also make sure you have the right texture</li>
            <li> I tried this product once and although my results weren&#x27;t perfect, they were 1000% better than what my results were previously.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the self waxing, but this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Works great , feels amazing , grabs every single hair.</li>
            <li> It is very effective in its purpose and the result looks professional.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy!!</li>
            <li> I got perfect results the first time I used it, and things have only gotten better with practice.    </li>
            <li> If you are looking for safe and clean use .</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use in the Gigi Brazilian waxing kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, this wax was so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> it is supposed to come off easily</li>
            <li> This wax is so easy to use I managed to wax everywhere</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works the way it should.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come off the skin quite as easily as I would like.</li>
            <li> I easy to use and comes off easily.</li>
            <li> comes out easily</li>
            <li> It did not come off easily.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use.</li>
            <li> it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> you figure out the consistency that is easy to work with</li>
            <li> That will get the wax close to the skin and make the hair come out easy otherwise you might as well just grab the hair and pull it out by hand.</li>
            <li> sure the skin is washed clean and apply generous amount of oil to the area before waxing..to protect the skin.</li>
            <li> This wax makes home Brazilians easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great because I can use it more than once over the same area in one sitting--which ensures removal of all the hair.</li>
            <li> Generally easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a wax that is easy to use at home.</li>
            <li> But the Brazilian wax has been so easy to use, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with cleanup.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> so you can grab it easily when you pull.</li>
            <li> Still goin strong</li>
            <li> strongly suggest to buy the wax warmer.</li>
            <li> Based on my first experience with doing this on my own, I probably should have done that.</li>
            <li> for\\&quot; cannot be more true in this</li>
            <li> If this happens, add more wax over that area, let it cool and then remove.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a video in YouTube that you can watch of a woman doing her own educational DIY Brazilian waxing.</li>
            <li> This wax is super easy to use and better than them sticky pads that don&#x27;t remove the hair.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and easy to peel off once you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Having used the kit for self removal for the first time, I can really say that I am happy about it.  </li>
            <li> Smells fine.</li>
            <li> I just used a plastic disposable butter knife to spread it on and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Gigi is a fine brand</li>
            <li> used this wax with cloth strips that I cut myself, but it works fine without the cloth as well.</li>
            <li> A FINE LINE BETWEEN</li>
            <li> just fine into my space saver warmer.</li>
            <li> This removes the toughest hair and even fine hair ( I tried it ALL over, just to see).</li>
            <li> Second, make very sure that you have the oil to remove the wax handy.</li>
            <li> Works just fine.</li>
            <li> It took a while but worked just fine.</li>
            <li> and it works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Is my hair too fine?</li>
            <li> I did not take any Advil and pain was fine with</li>
            <li> If not, you can just reapply it as many times as you need to, if hair is super stubborn you can just grab the tweezers and get the hair yourself with no effort.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to buy strips but this wax finishes more quickly.</li>
            <li> Once you learn to use the wax, and to pull fast, you will absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to get all of your nails, and mess up your perfectly manicured nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great wax... removes most hairs the very first time...don&#x27;t have to go back over again and again.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of time to get used to the best consistency, thinkness and temperature</li>
            <li> I do have to admit that surgiwax is better than this wax, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in large containers.</li>
            <li> Not an accurate description.</li>
            <li> So far MOOM is the best natural wax that I&#x27;ve come by and cleans up well.</li>
            <li> This has been a huge time saver and money saver for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really important</li>
            <li> I think we cn have cheaper qualities available.</li>
            <li> 2 days before lightly exfoliate.</li>
            <li> This part is as important as oiling.&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It gets the hairs and leaves you silky smooth.</li>
            <li> (no words can describe how important that step is.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> It smelt great, but stuck to my skin and was such a mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I tried the Clean N Easy sensitive wax on the bikini area, and while this wax works well for eyebrows and legs, it is not so good for underarms or bikini area.</li>
            <li> If it does, the residue is easy to clean off since it hardens.</li>
            <li> The wax has a nice scent and hardens very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to fit a wax warmer</li>
            <li> No funky smell and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that great for facial hair</li>
            <li> It may take a while to get,  but it&#x27;s way worth it not to go to waxing appointments when you&#x27;re able to do it at home and save all that money.</li>
            <li> Then I ended up scraping the rest off in the shower with a cheap razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, works well and is almost the same salon quality without the salon price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I try to spread it on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t go as smoothly as those I see in youtube videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being able to get salon results at home has made this purchase worth it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for facial hair</li>
            <li> This did not effect its fit into the warmer</li>
            <li> Need a warmer to melt the wax, since I did not have one, I melted it in a pot filled with boiling water.</li>
            <li> I have medium toned skin &amp; light brown/blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Is my hair too light?</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s great product &amp; i</li>
            <li> it in the warmer for about 30 minues, and it was melted and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The container lasts for several waxes, making it a great buy.</li>
            <li> Gigi&#x27;s Wax Warmer doesn&#x27;t warm, it probably took an extra hour to warm the wax</li>
            <li> The wax is good so far unless you know its application on skin.</li>
            <li> Extremely cheap, and worth way more than what you&#x27;re paying.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast, love this product  easy to use</li>
            <li> let it sit and hardened up before peeling the wax off, be sure to apply baby oil (yes you read it right....</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, love it!</li>
            <li> A baby oil) to clean off the remaining wax pieces off then wash your face with regular soap, you will be happy, be sure to do it on the day when you don&#x27;t have any plans to go anywhere during the day or night time, let your skin heal up a bit (if you are first time waxing).</li>
            <li> Super easy to tweeze if wax didn&#x27;t take care of that one or two hairs.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and easy to warm and use.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have some hair to pull out first tho, otherwise, you&#x27;ll be wasting your time.</li>
            <li> Fruitlessly pulling at bits of hardening wax on my bikini area is not my idea of fun!</li>
            <li> It gets most of the hairs on the first pull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been to a pro for a brazilian, but this mother hurt on my kind parts!</li>
            <li> awesome product as usual</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 4 different waxes and this is the best so far!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li> most importantly, make sure it has COMPLETELY hardened before attempting removal.  </li>
            <li> and it came with a video, which I highly recommend watching because it is pretty informative and gives some good tips on using this wax and will have you waxing like a pro in no time.</li>
            <li> Hard wax and a light baby OIL pre treat is the best for DIY bikini, lip and underarm areas.</li>
            <li> I tried the other GiGi waxes and they are great and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the cardboard rings that go around the can to keep the warmer clean.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any spills or issues with clean up.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great wax for sensitive areas</li>
            <li> I do not recommend waxing any area on your face more than once ever, and for more sensitive people, this rule of thumb should apply to underarm and bikini area -</li>
            <li> Well, like many people, I&#x27;ve been making an effort to do my own beauty stuff to save money, and this has extended to DIY waxing of various body parts.</li>
            <li> This wax is by far my favorite, and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> Clean up used to be a nightmare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought some popsicle sticks for dipping and they work well for a clean wax</li>
            <li> I would also recommend showering before you use this especially if you have used deodorant that day and are planning on doing your underarms, cause it needs to be washed off for the wax to be most effective.</li>
            <li> Most of them say it&#x27;s a good product I tries everything they said</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend using this stuff in a warm room, otherwise it cools to breaking point too quickly.</li>
            <li> this is beautiful magic ladys and no need foor strips works so well on my extra sensitive skin</li>
            <li> (I bought the full kit originally) and I&#x27;ve no complaints.</li>
            <li> Special recommendations for use.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Some of the best hard wax on the market.</li>
            <li> The best hard wax I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> this hard wax was perfect!</li>
            <li> Best hard wax in the market.</li>
            <li> the best hard body wax I have used.</li>
            <li> Best hard wash I have ever had.</li>
            <li> have the entire kit, and it is very easy to use!</li>
            <li> Best of all, it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean up after, and you hardly need the oil if you keep your skin a bit damp.</li>
            <li> I use it to wax my bikini area, and I really can&#x27;t believe that it doesn&#x27;t hurt more than it does.  </li>
            <li> I recommend getting the full Gigi Brazilian Waxing Kit and watching the video (warning - you do see some nakedness as they are doing a &amp;#34;brazilian&amp;#34; wax in it).</li>
            <li> It works best when it&#x27;s on the thick side.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper and more convenient than go to the wax salon.</li>
            <li> Most salons I go into have this wax and a GiGi warmer - you can do it at home and save so much money.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to order more</li>
            <li> Actually, too good.  </li>
            <li> i found that the longer i let it cool on my skin</li>
            <li> After about 45 minutes the wax was mostly melted and ready for use.</li>
            <li> No embarrassing bikini line to worry about and no painful in grown hairs to deal with.</li>
            <li> Works best applied thick.</li>
            <li> True story.</li>
            <li> It can be done but will be to much hassle for most.</li>
            <li> Sometimes waiting for the wax to cool is just not an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> I have had a full waxing done at the salon</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but good product overall.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s applied, you let it cool for about a minute and when you remove the wax a ton of hair is attached.  </li>
            <li> + tip to get my full face wax at salon every week.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll risk the wax chipping off instead of ripping off the full strip/area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad idea.</li>
            <li> After 2 hours, I never could quite get the right temperature, it was just too hot most of the time.</li>
            <li> But it goes on easy and smooth, and removed the hair very well with no breakage.</li>
            <li> It works great at removing coarse hair and worked pretty good at eyebrows but hurt a little bit more than strip wax.</li>
            <li> The hair re-grows very quickly and , for the first time, I had ingrown hairs and bumps.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty easy to use&lt;br /&gt;*Pick</li>
            <li> even the more dense areas, but if you aren&#x27;t careful, you won&#x27;t be able to get the wax off at all!</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy, and it was my first time.</li>
            <li> sure wax is warm enough but not too hot.</li>
            <li> It takes a few hours , but word just as good !</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a great way to DIY beauty and save all the money I was spending on monthly waxes.</li>
            <li> This wax is seriously the best I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> Anyway - I learned a lot, and went back and read through all the helpful review tips before I made a second attempt, which went wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> and now I am just SUPER IRRITATED.</li>
            <li> works great for delicate areas that need a bit more protection during waxing.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and the price is a couple bucks cheaper than my nearest Beauty supply shop.</li>
            <li> Product works quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> love this wax, i have try different ones, but this one is my favorite</li>
            <li> Of course, it hurts but I am happy about its quality as I really don&#x27;t want to go through all the turmoil of setting up and pain only to discover that 3/4 hair are still in.</li>
            <li> - I move quickly and use a wax strip instead of waiting for this to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love being able to wax at home and save tons of money rather than having to go to a salon multiple times to pay to have my eyebrows waxed and etc.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 37 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Melts in the warmer in an adequate amount of time and is just like the wax you see in the salons.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most difficult part was getting rid of the hairs &amp;#34;back there&amp;#34;  I tried bending over and squatting, and I found that bending over with my foot and leg on a chair was the best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find</li>
            <li> (we do not go with full liquid because OUCH, it&#x27;s hot!).</li>
            <li> I personally feel that for upper lips sugar wax is best as they pain less but for armpit this is great.</li>
            <li> and on the very first wax, i forgot to use the gigi&#x27;s pre-epilation powder that is supposed to help the wax not stick to the skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty cheap on Amazon, and if you have Prime, you don&#x27;t have to even take the time to drive to the beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I allowed the wax cool for a while, and found that there is a nice window of where the wax will let off of your skin just enough to get a corner started and where it broke into bits from being cool.  </li>
            <li> Even the drips of wax that ran down my legs ripped up hairs (by accident, but a happy accident)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do full brazilians and it is super safe for my sensitive parts.</li>
            <li> then put i on top of my candle melter to keep it warm.it cools very fast but also heats fast on the candle melter(no need to buy eexpensive melter things)</li>
            <li> Best Hard Wax I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> but this product works very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, convenient and very affordable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is really easy to use and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before I waxed the first time, I did a bunch of tests on my arms (using rubbing alcohol before waxing, using alcohol + oil, using oil only, using nothing, using the spray) and the best results were obtained from not using anything on my skin prior to waxing.  </li>
            <li> REALLY?!?!</li>
            <li> Like extreme torture kind of pain with blood and all!</li>
            <li> I definitely will order some more wax product again soon!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty gentle as far as waxes go, plus one tin lasts me a good 6 months.</li>
            <li> As a cosmetologist, This is the only brand of wax I use, I am in love with this wax, it does not irritate the skin and does not leave and sticky residue, I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> There is definitely a learning curve, but it so much better than shaving!  </li>
            <li> Clean it to prevent any water getting in the wax, set the wax can on the hot plate and turn on.</li>
            <li> Great consistency at a comfortably low temperature, hardens quickly and completely and pulls like a champ.</li>
            <li> On this Brazilian wax you have to be quick and know for sure where you are putting the strip or the wax dries to fast and will not get much off.  </li>
            <li> * Set out a comfortable pillow covered by a large towel that you won&#x27;t mind getting ruined in the place you plan on waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some suggestions for the beginners: spread a large [old] bed sheet on the floor, have a mirror handy, wear examination gloves (unless you don&#x27;t care for your fingernails), sit on the floor and lean against the wall.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;ve always used the GiGi all purpose wax and love it but the Brazillain Body Hard Wax wasn&#x27;t so good....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to using the Ceripil which is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This wax did a fantastic job, It really grabs onto the hair and doesnt let go.</li>
            <li> There are much better waxes out there if you are a professional.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Plus, no white heads of any kind and no ingrowns.  </li>
            <li> probably EVERY kind of wax possible!</li>
            <li> So much better then soft wax.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Waxing isn&#x27;t fun</li>
            <li> Still comes off skin well enough with warm water and soap if you don&#x27;t pre-treat with oil.</li>
            <li> so far ive tried clean and easy but</li>
            <li> Not even worth it one bit.</li>
            <li> and I suggest you give this wax a try, its economical and gets all the hair out</li>
            <li> works much better than soft wax/wax strips.</li>
            <li> I made sure to prep the skin areas well, as I do with the soft wax, used powder, and everything, and it still took skin with it.  </li>
            <li> It is the only kind I use at home.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this; I&#x27;ll never use soft wax again.</li>
            <li> to use for beginners, and well worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I used my nails to chip off hardened wax that fell on my floor (a butter knife would also be useful if you don&#x27;t want to risk damaging your nails).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that makes using this wax nearly painless in most areas.</li>
            <li> so I rarely use it for that.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t apply wax that is too cool or too hot.  </li>
            <li> Let it cool first.  </li>
            <li> and once it has melted, keep it warm on low heat.  </li>
            <li> I decided to do my own bikini waxing with mixed results.  </li>
            <li> When it heats up, it smells like a forest, kind of like fresh essential oils.  </li>
            <li> This is a good time to note that keeping the wax at a low temperature will allow you to apply enough wax to be able to pull it off.</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> Some tips: make sure that 1) you don&#x27;t put too far up in the nostril; 2).</li>
            <li> I suggest buying a different kind of wax.</li>
            <li> No cutting wax strips required.</li>
            <li> second time ordering this product happy so far</li>
            <li> (well, for me) than using the cloth... I&#x27;ve decided to switch over to the regular honey wax with cloth instead of this kind.</li>
            <li> Then when it is warm enough I take it out and follow the instructions to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> It melts quickly and does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased the whole kit and bought this refill 3 times.</li>
            <li> I bought this right after I bought the waxing kit here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> IS NOT THE RIGHT PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They did not even send the right product.</li>
            <li> AND you figure out the right consistency.  </li>
            <li> you also need to adjust while you go to keep it right.  </li>
            <li> Being completely new to wax i found this fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> Again, not a waxer, not sure if my method is &#x27;the best&#x27;, but it&#x27;s easy peasy for this long time DIYer.</li>
            <li> try Sally Hansen strip free wax because it is very easy to work with and in small containers that heat quickly, and easier to clean.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product because it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have waxed my upper lip and my bikini line, all very easily.</li>
            <li> wax is not that great .Getting hard quickly and leaves residue.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, gets down to the roots and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t need any special strips and it doesnt hurt as much as the all-purpose one does.</li>
            <li> The wax does not need to cool that much before you pull it off again.  </li>
            <li> I normally use Satin smooth calendula gold wax but thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> Fits just right in the hot wax warmer.</li>
            <li> It takes some time to get used to the right temperature, but once you get it, it&#x27;s not difficult at all.</li>
            <li> It heats up evenly in the GiGi heater, goes on smoothly, and most importantly comes off easily and takes all of the hair with it without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I also got it super fast.</li>
            <li> Its by far the best wax I&#x27;ve used at least for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and not messy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for facial and private areas.</li>
            <li> It sounds easy to slop on a strip of wax, wait for it to cool a bit, then pull it off in one swoop...but an entirely different thing to do it.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> It has a sugaring/ honey like quality to it, translucent and very very sticky.</li>
            <li> Also very very cost</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very gentle</li>
            <li> First, you need to use more wax to get a thick layer to pull off, so you go through a container a lot more quickly.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to leave on too long.</li>
            <li> Works great as hard wax.  </li>
            <li> This is a great salon quality hard wax.</li>
            <li> The Gigi Hard Wax is really great.</li>
            <li> little on the gross side: I could see the roots of my hair on the wax, which is great because it means the area will stay hair free for a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It can last you quite a while, it has lasted us many waxing sessions, probably over 10-15 all together.</li>
            <li> The morning after waxing and all the days following, I make sure to exfoliate the waxed area with a loofah to prevent ingrown</li>
            <li> and all the days following, I make sure to exfoliate the waxed area with a loofah to prevent ingrown hairs.    </li>
            <li> I think you should practice on your legs first, just a couple of strips, so you get the feeling on how to use it.</li>
            <li> n start waxing, it used to take me an hour at first</li>
            <li> I know it hurts a lot at first</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I didn&#x27;t put anything on my legs.</li>
            <li> I have acrylic nails the first time I thought the wax ruined it.</li>
            <li> First time using this product, just at home with the Gigi warmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having it too hot makes it runny hence making the application and removal process impossible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A real SCAM!</li>
            <li> Buy waxing strips so much easier!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> being said... let me tell you my first experience with this wax and of waxing period.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thought this wax wouldn&#x27;t be able to get my hair because I have never had it plucked or waxed before and thought it may be too coarse</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time took me almost 3 hours... and my arm and neck hurt more than the area that was waxed.&lt;br /&gt;There was no lasting pain with the brazilian</li>
            <li> The first time, it took me 3-4 hours, yikes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased and can&#x27;t wait till the next session.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for everybody like me ;)</li>
            <li> Make sure that you use pre-epilation oil prior to waxing.</li>
            <li> first time I did it, that was me.</li>
            <li> It takes AGES to melt the first time,</li>
            <li> This is where your first learning curve comes</li>
            <li> If you can get gyno style with your back supported and your feet pushing on something, you&#x27;re going to be better</li>
            <li> I refrained from writing a review after my first time because I figured I would try again before I made a judgement on the product.</li>
            <li> I refrained from writing a review after my first time because I figured I would try again before I made a judgement on the product.</li>
            <li> Some areas may need to be waxed more than once but be careful because the area will become more sensitive after the first wax.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known of this first.</li>
            <li> If interested in waxing, should by the kit and text it and</li>
            <li> It works well and is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Ok you guys, I am European.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better at getting the wax only where I want it.  </li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I have never been to a salon for a waxing.</li>
            <li> It seems to work pretty well for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> First time DIY waxer and</li>
            <li> Pull fast!</li>
            <li> Trim first.</li>
            <li> By the time I was done, I probably pulled out more hair pulling, rubbing and scraping with my fingernails than the actual waxing.</li>
            <li> I love the results and I am noticing that my hair is growing back  </li>
            <li> I am able to wax underarms, bikini, forearms, legs and still have around 1/2 can of product left over.</li>
            <li> It does not always work the first time you use it</li>
            <li> Maybe, be a bit smarter than me and test it out on your leg or something first until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> an alcohol free toner directly after waxing to sooth.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> do it the first couple times</li>
            <li> It was my first Brazilian ever</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried it and will continue to use it regularly.</li>
            <li> first of all I ordered this on the 27th of may</li>
            <li> so I could figure it out before the first attempt.  </li>
            <li> Gigi&#x27;s wax is cheap and clearly so because it&#x27;s garbage.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> I actually heated this product stove top in hot water.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too hot</li>
            <li> I just wish I could buy a bigger size. :)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> For me personally I didn&#x27;t like it better at all.</li>
            <li> I used this on my legs first to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I worked with it for about an hour even though the first try told me what I wanted to know about it.</li>
            <li> I bought it at Sallys and because of that I was able to get my money back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are still married and she still lets me wax her every 2 weeks</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Never fails.</li>
            <li> When you feel your skin afterward, it feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My first container lasted me about 13 waxings.</li>
            <li> First I use the Gigi Pre-Hon then baby powder on the area.</li>
            <li> (of course, I am a novice and it&#x27;s been 2 weeks since that first experience with Moom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But my 3 hours went to waste, because I didn&#x27;t get good results from the GiGi.</li>
            <li> Very nice hard wax.</li>
            <li> Never even got soft!!!!</li>
            <li> Stuff works great for the price, but make sure to use a nice thick amount, usually a couple layers thick, also make sure it is smooth so it wont break when you pull it off.</li>
            <li> So much that I&#x27;m buying another can of it right now.</li>
            <li> really good wax, when you use it just make sure is really liquid without burning your skin because if is a little solid (because is cooling) then it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Good for underarms, legs and hands too but as hard wax requires a slightly thick application, I think its best to go for soft wax for those.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I have pretty coarse hairs and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well, have to keep the area dry in order for it to stick appropriately to the hair, so make sure to keep some baby powder next to you</li>
            <li> GiGi is equal to the best hard wax that I have used.  </li>
            <li> GiGi is priced better than most hard waxes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a different hard wax refill before but this one is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Turns out that everywhere I found that even offered brazilians for men (most of them do not) wanted to charge twice as much as they do for a female brazilian wax.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, it does take practice and it will hurt, but I think the pain is the same as if you were getting it professionally done.</li>
            <li> plus you dont need to clean the room after using it as there will be no mess.</li>
            <li> This wax is perfect for underarms and facial waxing at home, for busy people like me who do not have a lot of time to waste in salons.</li>
            <li> I will say though that I haven&#x27;t been waxing too long and the hair already seems sparser, which is lovely.</li>
            <li> Buy the whole kit at first.</li>
            <li> Works very well and saves me so much money at the salon!</li>
            <li> will share that you need to make sure the hair is trimmed properly as the wax can get away from you real quick if you&#x27;re inexperienced.</li>
            <li> A tip though, make sure your hair is about a centimeter long.</li>
            <li> Be sure not to apply it too thick, it really works better with a thinner layer since it relies on flexibility when being yanked off to not break off.</li>
            <li> At first, I tried without it (like I used to do, with the waxes back in Brazil, and they work just fine that way).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, the wax hardens relatively quickly, but I could use it for over half hour, which is more than sufficient time for me to do the brazilian.</li>
            <li> I have used the GiGi brand hard wax for a long time and I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The wax is pretty hard and good</li>
            <li> Just apply with wooden stick, wait for wax to solidify and cool, peel up an edge, and strip away!</li>
            <li> 2) it did not irritate my super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise you will easily exhaust your can in one sitting for all of the above.</li>
            <li> Not only is it easy to use it also gets all of the hair off without hurting your skin.</li>
            <li> Because it hardens, cleanup is really easy in case you drip any (unlike regular waxes).  </li>
            <li> This wax was strong enough to remove thicker hair from underarms and crotch.</li>
            <li> If you do too large of an area, the wax breaks apart</li>
            <li> Buy a ton of large popsicle sticks.</li>
            <li> The hair does have to be a certain length for it to work well</li>
            <li> Maybe since I&#x27;m not super experienced with hard wax but did more pain then removal of hair.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to since this was my first time waxing, but really very easy.</li>
            <li> Fifty percent of my clients get Brazilians (the other 50% are massage) and it is the most consistent among my clients.</li>
            <li> no matter how coarse or fine,</li>
            <li> I was a first time waxer and I had no serious issues using this product.  </li>
            <li> maybe I have pretty high tolerance, or maybe because the SugarPot wax experience was hell.</li>
            <li> It does take a little practice to learn to use it properly, but it gives consistently great results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly it&#x27;s a good wax, which is why I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars, but for some advice to anyone purchasing it, go on YouTube and watch videos on how to apply and use hard wax.</li>
            <li> I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend hard wax to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a fair amount of experience with strip wax.</li>
            <li> Way better than satin smooth hard waxes.</li>
            <li> It pulls hairs great and does not leave behind much residue.</li>
            <li> Believe me, much easier.</li>
            <li> The real trick is to use the wax when it is not runny at all.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really matter whether you hit the window of pliability or not.  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> He bought this and brought it over, promising to change the way I experience nose breathing.</li>
            <li> , it really keeps it from tearing at your skin, and it&#x27;s really inexpensive</li>
            <li> So much easier than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does remove hair very well.</li>
            <li> This product also leaves the skin very sticky.  </li>
            <li> She really testifies to its quality and peel.</li>
            <li> but i really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Very Contnent</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Removes hair very well and heats fairly quickly, very convenient for touch ups.</li>
            <li> I was really scared after realizing that</li>
            <li> Moisturize VERY WELL every day.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know how to use it very well</li>
            <li> That was really freaking painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)go get your salon wax, carefully watch how they do</li>
            <li> I tried it on my arms and legs, but it didn&#x27;t work out very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on skin but adheres to hair really well.</li>
            <li> You get a cheap wax, and you got a big problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then, the whole process has gotten worlds easier.  </li>
            <li> At this point, it&#x27;s really just a</li>
            <li> I really prefer to wax myself because of the money I save.</li>
            <li> It melts fast and hardens fast.</li>
            <li> it require too much work</li>
            <li> The system works really well and beats having to go to someone to get waxing done.</li>
            <li> This really helps with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It really reduces the pain when your skin is not being pulled and dragged along with the wax!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> If you wax every two weeks or so, the pain will become very manageable.  </li>
            <li> After this, my parts became MUCH lighter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s MUCH easier to wax using this method.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odorless, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and works really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll take about 30 minutes or more to heat up a full can and small water droplets can condense into the can, but that&#x27;s not something you have to worry too much about.</li>
            <li> really.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper to buy the warming kit and then refill it as needed than to spend $65-85 a wax by professionals.</li>
            <li> but it was packed very well.</li>
            <li> This was really grabs onto the hair</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> Too much work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very frugal person but saving the wax and straining it to use again isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> I gave it five stars because it shipped here really fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wax for over a year and continue to really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset</li>
            <li> this product is so much cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li> I insisted I could remove it without too much discomfort.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and how much you will save in doing this yourself at home.  </li>
            <li> But too much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first-time self waxer and went straight to trying the Brazilian on myself.</li>
            <li> or you will really just tug on your nose and be too freaked out to finish.  </li>
            <li> granted I don&#x27;t wax very often so it has lasted me awhile</li>
            <li> I primarily use this for facial waxing (lip and brow).</li>
            <li> This stuff saves me SO much money compared to a salon waxing.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the wax harden too much though so follow the instructions</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m the only one who uses it, it seems sanitary enough to reuse my own leg wax.</li>
            <li> &quot; (pun intended:) I have had it completely melted and instantly put it on my legs</li>
            <li> It can get messy, as most wax is💁, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> This wax was ok, and this noted for professional use only, but I bought it anyways.</li>
            <li> They say not to go over the same area more than once or twice, but this is completely non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different kinds and versions, but this is the only kind buy now.</li>
            <li> I use GIGI all my life but, lately, their quality product is not so good.</li>
            <li> Gets all my hairs off without any trouble and leaves me loving my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> But when I used it on my legs second time I got red spots pimple kind of things on leg ...</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s back to the regular kind for me.</li>
            <li> It would be a good idea to go and get a few professional waxes before trying to do one on your self</li>
            <li> But, if you don&#x27;t let it harden completely you will pull out the stick, but no wax (seriously!!)...leaving the wax inside for more torturous removal of smaller pieces one at a time!  </li>
            <li> I did a fairly comprehensive job and withnesed long hairs extracted even though they didn&#x27;t seem that long at upon application.  </li>
            <li> I just filter the hot wax through clean pantyhose, leaving all the hair behind and resulting in nice clean wax that can be reused for the next time.</li>
            <li> I love the results and can achieve more control with it, but the large container takes a very long time to heat (hour +) and itll make a heck of a mess if you drip.</li>
            <li> This was not an easy process the first use and took some effort and trial/error to get it down but by the end of the first session, I was sold.  </li>
            <li> It takes a while to heat up and melt, but is pretty quick to cool down and harden.</li>
            <li> (To get it to the right temp, leave the lid off while you&#x27;re warming it, and stir frequently to test it.  </li>
            <li> At first I had trouble getting the consistency right, but having the warmer makes it easy to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> still, the first half of my first Brazilian attempt was actually easy and painless.  </li>
            <li> Pain is minimal in most areas if you apply baby oil to the skin (or my personal favorite, coconut oil) with a rag first, so the wax will then only adhere to the hair.</li>
            <li> I really like using this wax better then other kinds.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a good body hard wax.</li>
            <li> It is thick and easy to apply and peels off easily.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get all the hairs off the bikini line the first time I did it, but my skin handled it so well that I tried again the following day and it worked much better the second time</li>
            <li> Worked better than any other waxing product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> , i found that a thicker consistency of a cold honey worked best as it wasnt scalding hot on the sensitive areas and still workable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference except I prefer the other one better.</li>
            <li> Also, though the microwavable is the same wax, I wholly recommend using the standard with the warmer--much more consistently heated and simplifies the process, no reheating at the microwave, etc.</li>
            <li> Though it takes a while to apply and wax, it is extremely efficient and I love it.</li>
            <li> It also gets all the hair at once compared to other waxes I&#x27;ve tried which is much better than having to re wax the area.</li>
            <li> but, its better than any other wax I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other waxes and none work as well as this one does.</li>
            <li> I love how this wax doesn&#x27;t break like other waxes I have used</li>
            <li> Way better then any other</li>
            <li> and i feel like this one hurts more than other ones.</li>
            <li> I also own the cirepil blue wax and have found that the GiGi brand is less messy/stringy than the blue wax and also does a much better job of grabbing the hairs by the root.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to set the warmer to high and make sure you exfoliate.</li>
            <li> If it feels warm or drips and runs, it&#x27;s too hot and you&#x27;ll have a hard time peeling it off in one go.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product if you only wax small areas, like eyebrows or lips.</li>
            <li> You can use up anywhere from half the can to 3/4 of the can or more if you want to wax off your whole body [for reference as to how much is in the can].</li>
            <li> Generally it always misses some hair and I need to wax the same spot 2 or more times.</li>
            <li> ; I have ample hair stubble before starting, I warm it, wait for the right consistency, turn it down, spread it on in the direction of the hair growth, wait for it to be pliable and let &#x27;er rip.</li>
            <li> This wax is waayyyyyyy better than the conventional wax that you have to use with strips.</li>
            <li> Just be super fast with the entire thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not new to waxing, but have always used Gigi&#x27;s soft waxes, for, well, ALMOST everywhere, the all purpose honee being my favorite.</li>
            <li> : as long as you use the oil, you are going to get perfectly smooth skin* using this.</li>
            <li> Well, this is going to be a long one filled with info</li>
            <li> I only do my bikini area, but I do as close to a full Sphynx wax as I can</li>
            <li> This is really only a problem if you are doing the full Monty though.&lt;br /&gt;*When</li>
            <li> I will never go back to paying close to 100$ to get full legs, bikini, and underarms done at a salon.  </li>
            <li> It has to cool a second on the stick so it doesn&#x27;t drip everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I suggest go professional waxing first and then consider whether you want to do wax by yourself.</li>
            <li> I have used many many waxes and this is the best least painful most efficient at removing hair hard wax.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to cut the hair down to 1/2 inch.</li>
            <li> I tried this to see if I liked the hard wax better than the other.</li>
            <li> Better too much than too little, because you can always rub some off if you need to.</li>
            <li> Its very messy but does job effectively.</li>
            <li> The great thing about Hard Wax is that you don&#x27;t need strips and it only sticks to the hair.  </li>
            <li> I also just started the blue hard wax which is also great</li>
            <li> The hard wax is far superior to cream wax used with muslin strips.</li>
            <li> it is very chunky too as far as removal because it gets really hard and very quickly so it doesn&#x27;t come off smoothly.</li>
            <li> I am new to home waxing, but I really like this brand.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t give up, mainly because I had ordered 10 cans of it,  Lol&lt;br /&gt;It takes practice and perseverance,  </li>
            <li> and I thought that if people are using this hard wax on their bikini areas, it MUST be better than sugar wax!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not impossible to use it on your legs, but you can&#x27;t do a big area at a time, so it takes forever.</li>
            <li> Second time around using the oil I was able to keep the gloves on the entire time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back for seconds (sometimes three or four passes) because I don&#x27;t expect it to get it all in one fell swoop, and some spots are just super stubborn and refuse to come</li>
            <li> This is my 5th or 6th jar of this particular wax.</li>
            <li> because there is a decent learning curve here.</li>
            <li> Rip it off in one quick motion, against the grain if possible.</li>
            <li> At least that wax didn&#x27;t rip apart when trying to remove and was easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The warmer is good for regulating the temperature, and if I find that it has gotten too hot/cold, I just adjust the setting (low, medium, high) and wait a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I hardly have to go over the same area twice; it does a good job at getting the hair the first pull.</li>
            <li> It hurts only a little more than the salon, but only because you have to apply and yank off so many times.</li>
            <li> how many times you mess</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t rush it or you will for sure mess it up and will have some regret.</li>
            <li> This wax drips everywhere when its too hot, once its had time to cool down its much easier to work with.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on high for 45 mins</li>
            <li> - I take a high dose aspirin an hour in advance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially since we live in a rural community, and her favorite salon is hours away.</li>
            <li> I am not a very hairy person, and my hair is fine, too.  </li>
            <li> So far better than other brands that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Unlike other waxes I&#x27;d tried, It melts to a good texture, is easy to apply and removes the hairs with minimal hair breakage (due to user error).</li>
            <li> The problem with GiGi, for me, is that it&#x27;s a little too sticky for my taste, comparing to my favorite one.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive and this wax works wonders!!</li>
            <li> It just takes a little more patience and skill.</li>
            <li> However, having said that, hard wax does kind of let you pull the wax out in any direction and still hold on to the hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as effective and hard to pull off.</li>
            <li> Then let it sit for around 30 seconds or until its hard and no longer warm.</li>
            <li> Less pain, more effective, and less redness overall.  </li>
            <li> The wax sets up fast and hard for quick, clean hair removal...</li>
            <li> Smoother than smooth, and absolutely no problems with stuff sticking and leaking.</li>
            <li> Clean and pat dry areas that are going to be waxed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Carefully work an edge free as soon as it starts to get gummy.  </li>
            <li> As long as you use oil freely beforehand (I used sensitive formula baby oil in cotton squares) the sticking to your skin fear is a mute one.</li>
            <li> (If you let it cool too long it will not work).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It takes the hair off from different areas of the body pretty much every time.</li>
            <li> But, I was also able to do the top halves of my legs in that time (got bored waiting on the thicker strips in denser areas to completely harden for removal.)  </li>
            <li> I may not be professional, but I&#x27;ve used the all-purpose wax for a long time and it has worked fantastic (maybe a bit of residue at time).</li>
            <li> I suggest using the normal one instead of this one.</li>
            <li> It also lasts several uses, so it&#x27;s worth its price 100%.</li>
            <li> It is messy as most of the people do say..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed for years using normal Gigi wax.</li>
            <li> I NORMALLY WOULD GET MINE</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> It can get kind of taffy-like when you pile it on too thick and then doesn&#x27;t pull off as it should.</li>
            <li> I usually love GiGi Wax products and have used other brands of hard wax and love them.</li>
            <li> It melts in no time and goes on smooth along with drying fast which makes for removing less painfull.</li>
            <li> I guess all I can add is to make sure the layer applied is super thin then with your finger, keep pulling up at one of the edges</li>
            <li> My only problem is getting the temperature control just right.</li>
            <li> To keep it at the right temp, go between Low and Off on your heater while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> I used it on my left armpit and right leg.</li>
            <li> Beats having to spend $100 plus for the same thing I can do right at home.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need the muslin strips for this because the wax hardens enough that you can just rip it right off.</li>
            <li> At first there are little pieces of wax left on your skin, but you&#x27;ll soon find that you get better at it.</li>
            <li> I know i was hurting more because of my slowness because later when i took a deep breath and pulled fast, i only felt a sting and not the pain I was feeling from pulling slowly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have even tried putting more than one layer of wax on the same spot to get it thick enough to be able to pull the end...</li>
            <li> and you stalled just long enough or haven&#x27;t gotten it warm enough</li>
            <li> I was new to waxing when I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> and i am a new fan.</li>
            <li> (yes, I&#x27;m really new to waxing) using some sugar wax called Sugarpot.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfectly legal in most places to reuse hard wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gets hard too quickly and hurts a lot more than the regular wax</li>
            <li> This is amazing, I have been waxing for years and I in the last few years started waxing myself.</li>
            <li> Less pain easy to operate..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would have come off if I spent some time with oil or a scrubber, but I don&#x27;t like to spend extra time which is why I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> But to be fair, there isn&#x27;t really enough Advil to make it not hurt at least a little.&lt;br /&gt;*Start</li>
            <li> Overall, this is totally worth the money, and completely diy doable.  </li>
            <li> Although I LOVE European Wax Center</li>
            <li> It was a tiny free trial wax that was not even the same type.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Make sure the hair is long enough, even if it&#x27;s tempting to get rid of them as fast as possible.</li>
            <li> and she has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> though wax doesn&#x27;t come off easily so it leaves it a mess.</li>
            <li> I recommend, just read the instruction before and Use oil before application, that makes all the difference, a little oil other wise</li>
            <li> for where this falls in line with other hard waxes, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> only problem I had on my first try was that I was a bit of a coward.  </li>
            <li> The first time was essentially a disaster, because I hadn&#x27;t read any of the tips from the reviews, and forgot to use the pre-epilation oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;Alright, so the first time I used this stuff, it sucked big time.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it in the long term.  </li>
            <li> Soft wax just can&#x27;t compare to this stuff!</li>
            <li> finally decided to suck it up and wax for my first time, using the GiGi kit.</li>
            <li> The wax warmer, wooden sticks, and wax all pay for themselves within the first use.  </li>
            <li> With experience the time it takes to wax will fo down, it took me about 3 hours of trial and error before the process was working in a way that allowed me to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> Get it right on your legs first, and know you&#x27;re going to mess up on your lady parts anyway.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Toward the end, I figured out that when the wax was applied thinly enough to nearly qualify as &amp;#34;strands&amp;#34;, that seemed to be the easiest, least messy and ripped the  hair out the best, taking everything with it.  </li>
            <li> The normal honey hard wax is better for underarm hair and pubic hair.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s made for the most sensitive skins for that area.</li>
            <li> what i did was use the hot plate from an old basic on/off coffee maker.</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries to get used to knowing when the wax is ready to be stripped off, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Good product, takes a little longer to dry on the skin than some I have used in the past, but overall it&#x27;s fine and cools off relatively fast.  </li>
            <li> I understand there are better hard waxes out there, but many aren&#x27;t for sale in small quantities or at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She has vowed never to put a razor near &amp;#34;the zone&amp;#34; again after the smooth long lasting difference of this wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is difficult to use for first - timers, but once you know what you are doing, there really isn&#x27;t any better wax out there.</li>
            <li> Im sure future waxes will be easier but take the first time slow.</li>
            <li> Nice thick layers!</li>
            <li> If I had better lighting and didn&#x27;t get distracted by what&#x27;s on screen occasionally, I could prabably do this in an hour and a half or less.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I just waited for it to dry, and it peeled right off the carpet.</li>
            <li> The wax was easy to remove, a little messy, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the olive oil to remove all the wax, I did apply some Bee Magic to just sooth my skin.</li>
            <li> I always wax the upper bikini area with no problems, but decided to try this one for the lower part since it has so many positive reviews (the wax..not my lower parts ;P.&lt;br /&gt;First, please know how to use hard, stripless wax.</li>
            <li> Second time I think I left mine in for 3-4 minutes and make sure you pull straight down (not out)</li>
            <li> The above setting will help you accomplish the task more efficiently, faster and with a minimum mess.</li>
            <li> it ok but make a big mess</li>
            <li> This is a large quantity and will last for some time.</li>
            <li> Pure and simple garbage.</li>
            <li> A little hard for the face, but it does a great job removing the hair.</li>
            <li> I order the GiGi wax kit after reading reviews there were many negative reviews, but there were enough positive reviews to make me buy it.</li>
            <li> After the second strip the first should be mildy cool and that is when you pull the skin tight and let em rip.</li>
            <li> Just remember, don&#x27;t be cheap when you apply it on, and leave a little goop near the end</li>
            <li> This one would still work okay, but is hard work and takes longer time.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve and it doesn&#x27;t matter how many reviews you read, everything is hard to remember when you&#x27;ve accidentally globbed on a chunk of wax on your armpit</li>
            <li> Hard wax is able to be picked up by hand.</li>
            <li> I always have been a fan of gigi brazilian body hard wax, i absolutely love it</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hard wax.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks, love the hard wax.</li>
            <li> it way too sticky, hard to remove and does not remove completely most of the hair in the needed area</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE HARD WAX.</li>
            <li> This hard wax pulls off much better.  </li>
            <li> I love this hard wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better hard waxes, but this gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The Brazilian Body Hard Wax also sticks directly to hair and not skin, which is another factor that I really love.</li>
            <li> Use thinner strips on your legs and maybe do it with a friend (doing the back of your own legs is really hard).  </li>
            <li> I am NOW hearing that soft crème wax with strips are 1,000 times better than hard wax.</li>
            <li> I tried baby powder and baby oil to prevent the wax from grabbing the skin and oil definitely helped out more but made it hard to spread as it would move around too much.</li>
            <li> Clearly you need the heater for this</li>
            <li> (this wax is gentle enough where it shouldn&#x27;t be aproblem-it wasn&#x27;t for me, and I have fairly sensitive skin that is prone to irritation).</li>
            <li> I did not know that my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I had been waxed professionally before, but grew weary of the price tag and decided to try it myself.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin but only to the hair which makes waxing so much easier and bearable.</li>
            <li> Before using this product, I had never had a wax done professionally or by myself.  </li>
            <li> The first time it took me twice as long, but after I got used to things, my time improved.  </li>
            <li> I even used it on my face and it didn&#x27;t cause any problems with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I would not waste your money with this brand.</li>
            <li> I am also very squeamish and a big baby, but I can deal with the pain.  </li>
            <li> let it get completely brittle before you pull and</li>
            <li> My girlfriend also has sensitive skin, so that says something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for almost a year with GiGi products (sensitive wax), and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it</li>
            <li> though it by no means makes you a professional, go out to a salon and get one done</li>
            <li> So far I have used it to wax my eyebrows, face, legs, and</li>
            <li> I know that strips are for soft waxes</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It heats up well, attached well to the hairs and comes off well, as long as you pre-treat the area with oil first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried strips and seriously am surprised I even wanted to try waxing again after that trauma 😣</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> The wax is gentle enough for my bakini area</li>
            <li> I also use a lidocaine spray that decreases the pain with sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I tried for literally two whole days to melt this enough to use it....</li>
            <li> I do brazilian, so absolutely nothing is left after I get to it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have nails, you can use an old butter knife to help scrape it off.  </li>
            <li> I can also get a thinner layer than I can get with the soft wax.</li>
            <li> Plus, no added fragrances, just the natural pine smell of the resin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wax tends to get more the tiny peach fuzz hair and the medium coarse hair; that&#x27;s perfect for me, because those are the ones I hate trying to tweeze!</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t had any growback so far.  </li>
            <li> Rub baby powder over sensitive areas before applying (keeps it from sticking to your skin, but not the hair).</li>
            <li> Like it so far</li>
            <li> Now, I have used Gigi microwave stripless wax, and it is nowhere near as sticky as this one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it affecting those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use soft wax for brazilian waxing.</li>
            <li> I read nearly every review</li>
            <li> I had always felt like it was pricey to go to a professional but</li>
            <li> I would completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It did take some getting used to, as I started with the soft wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I put sown an old sheet on the bathroom floor and go for it.</li>
            <li> whereas the soft (Honee) wax removes almost EVERYTHING in one pull.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad at least that the Honee wax works well for me, because this stuff is MYSTIFYING.</li>
            <li> I had a professional wax and this is what they used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so versatile, I&#x27;ve eliminated soft wax from all but the most delicate of hair removal protocols.</li>
            <li> If you pull too early it may be gooey in last applied area of swathe and stringily stretch apart, and if you let it cool too long</li>
            <li> more feel of thick candle wax on body</li>
            <li> I bought this wax a month ago because I was tired of making my own sugar wax and having to use strips.</li>
            <li> Its good, but expensive.</li>
            <li> that didn&#x27;t stick for me and i was hurting more because I was pulling slow.  </li>
            <li> It should be spread thick enough that it can be peeled off while still slightly warm and still malleable.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you do not put it on too thick.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like the cooler the wax was, I had to pull more slowly.  </li>
            <li> Using it with strips brought my (full Brazilian) waxing time from 60 minutes down to 20 minutes</li>
            <li> You put it on let it cool down, and pull with your fingers.</li>
            <li> wax is by far superior to any other hard wax I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, after a pretty easy learning curve, I would recommend this product to anyone is tired of shaving.  </li>
            <li> The wax dries fairly quickly so u don&#x27;t have to wait a long time, also remains solid when u pull it and doesn&#x27;t tear.</li>
            <li> The Brazilian Body Hard Wax is easy to work with, doesn&#x27;t create a sticky mess, and leaves skin feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I spent hours trying to get the \\&quot;flick\\&quot; of pulling the tab of wax in just the right way for it to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my significant other&#x27;s back and it worked like a charm, but it&#x27;s also gentle enough to use on my face and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t judge), which worked except that the wax cools down extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is great, but not for the faint of heart!</li>
            <li> I think over 50% pulled out by this wax was pulled completely out with all of its roots and caused slight bleeding in those but not excessively, actually it was at most a tiny drop the size of the tip of a pencil.  </li>
            <li> Immediately press down on that spot with your free hand for a few seconds to calm the skin and minimize bleeding.</li>
            <li> I soaked a little isopropyl alcohol in a cotton ball to clean the areas to be waxed, pat dried them with a paper towel and then applied baby powder pretty much everywhere.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, and captures the small hairs.</li>
            <li> a few tips - don&#x27;t forget your aspirin, have everything set up and prepared before getting started, don&#x27;t let your wax get too hot/thin, have some muslin nearby just for keeping your hands clean</li>
            <li> I mainly do Armpit and upper lips with this.</li>
            <li> Luckily I only applied to a small area and I was able to remove it -</li>
            <li> product only makes sense if you&#x27;re willing to shell out the money for the wax warmer by the same company though.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands of hard and soft wax, wax strips, and sugaring paste, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> There is no other wax to use as far as I am concerned.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on high with the cover OFF for about twenty minutes then leave it on low with the cover on for the rest of the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heat for 20 minutes on high, then turn it on low.</li>
            <li> I have a high pain threshold, and I&#x27;m used to waxing in salons and at home, so maybe I&#x27;m biased in favor of it.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that a lot of people commented, and I definitely agree</li>
            <li> It works so well with minimal pain and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It makes for a smooth wax, with very little of the rashy aftermath.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected, it has a slight pine scent to it, nothing overwhelming</li>
            <li> Hard wax is definitely the way to go for more sensitive areas like underarms or brazillian/bikini.</li>
            <li> gradually peel up enough of one end and rip away once hard and pretty cool.</li>
            <li> They never get the hair (I have coarse hair) and leaves a huge sticky mess.</li>
            <li> Removes every small hair from my face and body, and leaves my skin smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I checked the directions, just to be sure what I was doing, and unlike all my other Gigi products, only the ingredients we listed in English, for only some of the products.</li>
            <li> You do not need muslin strips to press on top of it--you just spread the wax on in a little area, let it cool until it&#x27;s not gooey anymore, and slowly peel it off in opposite direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li> This stuff takes a little bit of skill and it will hurt something fierce the first time you use it on a sensitive area with thick hair, but once you get the timing down and learn a few tricks - it works great!  </li>
            <li> Always wanted to be hair free in an area that I consider a little private to show off at the salon.  </li>
            <li> I know some say it was hard to get off but for me i just used my nails and scrapped it off easily.  </li>
            <li> Wax was easy to spread but hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for many years and always used the blue hard wax</li>
            <li> it takes more time to get hard enough to pull of!</li>
            <li> I love the hard wax, the only think I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> Hair starts to grow back relatively quickly in comparison to other waxes or wax strips.</li>
            <li> I like the hard wax much better than regular wax as well.</li>
            <li> I watched SO many videos on youtube on the specific techniques of applying &amp; using hard wax, and I&#x27;m at a loss as to what the problem is.</li>
            <li> You need not use any cloth strips, just a thick coating of the wax, cool, rip and it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> I love using the GiGi hard wax system!</li>
            <li> I love hard waxes too!</li>
            <li> Be carful not to use really hot water or satay in too long because you don&#x27;t want to open up your pores too</li>
            <li> I do my own waxing, because it gets expensive to have a professional do it.</li>
            <li> Finally, you definitely want to moisturize with something gentle.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t work as well, and lay it on THICK especially at the top of the strip where you are going to start your pull.</li>
            <li> Make sure it is thick enough on area where you want to remove.  </li>
            <li> This wax gets the job done, but took forever to melt and was super messy.</li>
            <li> Coming back to this wax, it leaves a very soft skin.</li>
            <li> it does dry, or if I mess up with the strip, it&#x27;s still easy to pull off once it hardens.</li>
            <li> whole area gets really sensitive and it takes a long time when you first start, so if you find it getting unbearable, do your armpits or your legs or stomach or whatever for fifteen or twenty minutes and give it a little rest.&lt;br /&gt;*Look</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever waxed or anything other than shaving for manscaping (yes i am a man).</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and other areas of the body first, and they went over ...</li>
            <li> (I use this to wax myself, not other people).  </li>
            <li> It also smells good in my opinion (like beeswax), and I noticed a lot less irritation with this vs. whatever they used in the salons and a LOT less irritation than with sugaring, and far less pain in my case than when I paid to get it done.</li>
            <li> This makes the removal process more effective and less painful since it doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have found that using them when bikini waxing makes the process much faster, I don&#x27;t get as much wax in my fingernails from pulling the strips, and it&#x27;s overall less</li>
            <li> wax is more brittle, speads less well, holds hair less well, leaves more residue, removes less hair and is less</li>
            <li> /&gt;Learning curve was very small, I got used to this stuff very quickly.</li>
            <li> They have a buy 1 get 1 free of the hard wax and the wax warmer was on sale.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this GiGi hard wax for anyone looking for a quality hard wax that is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Has a very slight but not unpleasant medicinal smell when heated.</li>
            <li> little tip I learned with using it (and oil, don&#x27;t forget the oil) is to pull it up a lot more slowly than you might think you should, as this prevents the hair from breaking as much</li>
            <li> Got this for the wife and it works better than the honey and less mess.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to all of my family and friends, when I recieved the product I was shocked on how great this product it.</li>
            <li> I use sugar wax on my eyebrows, but honestly that&#x27;s pretty painful</li>
            <li> If you wait too long, it will obviously harden too much.  </li>
            <li> But obviously, since I had been to a spa once and gotten it done, I was a professional.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It still hurts, especially if you have sensitive skin like me, but it gets better!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It still hurts, especially if you have sensitive skin like me, but it gets better!&lt;br</li>
            <li> it adheres to only the hair and doesn&#x27;t rip it off with skin like soft wax can.</li>
            <li> I barely felt it.</li>
            <li> a local Sally Beauty near you and get the membership card, gives you a discount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a fast rip like with the strip waxing I tried, and I found if I pulled too fast, I would pull off a chunk.  </li>
            <li> I do actually use it for a brazilian wax,other than normally puffiness and red irritation that comes with a wax, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> All of them have failed spectacularly.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s kind of weird to have someone else do a brazilian wax on me.</li>
            <li> After some failed attempts to make my own sugar wax (which is basically burned sugar on the stove)</li>
            <li> and it really doenst get hard enough to pull off quickly with one big pull.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re sporting a forest down there, cut it first.</li>
            <li> I did this because I heard that although it is more painful, it is better than soft wax because it leaves your skin less irritated.</li>
            <li> I feel like it hurt me less to wax myself than to have the job done professionally, but it did take me much much longer to get it done (</li>
            <li> It is easy to get used to after a few tries you will be an expert at it.</li>
            <li> It dried so quickly and deeply that it pulled off</li>
            <li> I would advise growing hair to at least 1/4 inch before attempting the wax unless you dont mind it being less effective.</li>
            <li> Could be less messy, but it gets the job done mostly.</li>
            <li> (I think there was a slight learning curve, plus I was super nervous the first time as I thought it would be much more painful than it was).  </li>
            <li> At best you&#x27;re going to end up with a painful, goopy mess.</li>
            <li> Cleaned the area and started to clean the sides as I worked through the middle - which I think was the most painful part.</li>
            <li> I bought my first pot from a beauty supply store, and then thought to check Amazon and found that it was literally half the price...</li>
            <li> The wax does have a slight learning curve if it is the first time you&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> Even used pretty thickly, half a can is all you need for both legs&lt;</li>
            <li> I used to use Bliss Poetic hard wax</li>
            <li> This worked pretty well, but leaves a sticky mess on the skin.</li>
            <li> I do recommend using the pre waxing oil liberally as this is hard to clean up</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a whole other \\&quot;ball of wax\\</li>
            <li> The other 50% had roots too but not the whole root</li>
            <li> I use to have a license to wax  amongst other things, This product really works well if you develop a technique</li>
            <li> We were unable to make this work with strips, as other reviewers recommended, but did find, as said before, that with a little practice, the wax gives you a nice, smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just bought the wax warmer, the hard wax (with 1 free) and a big popsicle stick to spread</li>
            <li> I did find myself having to pinch little bits and pieces of wax (along with hair) at a time, which was excruciatingly painful, but this is my own fault for not being able to pull fast enough.</li>
            <li> As a novice home-waxer, I bought this at the same time as the All Purpose Honee wax, after hearing that harder wax was much gentler on the skin.</li>
            <li> Also, after your wax has gotten hot and melted , turn the setting down to LOW and leave it for another 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the wax cool hard.  </li>
            <li> The hard wax is just the best at getting thick hairs out of those hard to reach places without me having to grow them out for a month.</li>
            <li> Better than other hard waxes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> (make sure they use the hard wax like European Wax Center).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting Brazilians and my underarms done for several years, so I knew the general gist of how to use the product.</li>
            <li> Second, the wax should be just barely melted.</li>
            <li> At first I had trouble pulling the wax off.</li>
            <li> It gets a bit messy the first time you use it</li>
            <li> but I read a few reviews, tips and watched a YouTube video then proceeded to my first attempt with a diy Brazilian.</li>
            <li> This wax did the trick, more or less, but I found it very messy.</li>
            <li> My routine consists of first turning the machine on high at least an hour before you want to start waxing to melt the wax, and then after its all melted I alternate between low and turning it off for a few minutes, otherwise it gets too hot.  </li>
            <li> I originally had the normal wax from Gigi and that stuff was a mess, hard to work with, and hard to clean up...</li>
            <li> Love this hard wax!!</li>
            <li> It gets hard too quickly and i don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> spread a thin layer thinking less is better, It is not!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as other waxes I&#x27;ve tried, and after using it a few times, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!</li>
            <li> The whole process (brazillian and underarms) took me around an hour and a half to two hours, but I took my time and was distracted by watching some Netflix.  </li>
            <li> I heat it for a little while on hot, then to extra low.  </li>
            <li> I know which areas are more or less sensitive, so I can alternate between the painful and not painful areas.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get the pre-epilator oil or the wax removal because I&#x27;ve checked the youtube videos and some other reviews which says normal baby oil works as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single hard wax available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine art though, because if its too thin you get a lot of leftover flaky wax which is a pain in the butt to get rid of.</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s really messy and stringy, but I&#x27;m fairly certain all wax is like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was always OK but sorta messy and sticky, but the hard wax is a completely different experience</li>
            <li> The longer the hair, the better it works, however if applied correctly as mentioned above it will even remove thick shorter hairs (1/4 inch long or less).</li>
            <li> Not much of a mess if you are careful.       </li>
            <li> One other reviewer said to go and get professionally waxed and then use this product to maintain the wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never &amp;#34;waxed&amp;#34; before so I can&#x27;t compare this to any other product or procedure (whether personally or professionally) used.  </li>
            <li> This wax is a little drippy when hot, be careful otherwise you will get it all over the place.</li>
            <li> * Also set out a small bowl of cornstarch with a basting brush (or small paintbrush), a bottle of Olive oil, cotton balls, good tweezers, small trash can, and a mirror of some sort (if you plan on bikini waxing).&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> be very careful, place an old towel underneath the area you will be working in.</li>
            <li> And since i only use it for eyebrows its going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> so it will not last as long as regular strip waxes.</li>
            <li> After a few months of waxing steadily with this wax I have some additional input on its performance.</li>
            <li> Follow directions listed in other reviews, watch you tube videos, or at least go get one professionally done first to learn.</li>
            <li> You have to lay on a super thick layer, but even when it is super thick as you lay on this stuff, there can still be that ONE little hair left.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using hard wax and it was a learning curve.</li>
            <li> The first wax that was ever done on me was with a hard wax</li>
            <li> This is my first time using hard was</li>
            <li> but this was my first using hard wax</li>
            <li> I had this happen on the first side I did and learned my lesson the hard way - ouf.  </li>
            <li> I have finally mastered the art of waxing with strips and decided to try the hard wax because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The only thing I was a little surprised by was the bits of residue that were left on the skin after removing a patch of wax.  </li>
            <li> Two stars only because it hurts less than soft wax.</li>
            <li> My skin typically gets really sensitive and red after a wax, but this product did not do that to my skin!</li>
            <li> Use a popsicle stick and put a small ball of wax on the end, let cool slightly and pop inside.</li>
            <li> I was completely embarrassed by my dark armpits and bikini line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried doing the Brazilian wax but the pain is not worth it for me,  at home or professionally.</li>
            <li> Try cirepil or lycon or something, especially if you are not a professional.</li>
            <li> I am from Brazil (where we do wax all year long all, different parts of the body).</li>
            <li> Looks like it will last a long time .</li>
            <li> I just wish it came in the smaller 8 oz size so it wouldn&#x27;t take so long to melt.</li>
            <li> Saves me tons of money, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and the results last a long time.</li>
            <li> (practice).Baby oil will remove any mistakes, so don&#x27;t rib off if left on too long.</li>
            <li> A jar of wax might last you a long time depending on amount of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I normally put on some netflix, slap on the wax and sit there for a few minutes before torturing myself.</li>
            <li> Advice - lay news papers, an old sheet, something down on the floor</li>
            <li> The wax is good but alittle bit hard than I thought and if u leave too long on ur skin it will be fragile and broke and difficult to remove it  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and used this product for the past several years and I highly recommend it to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (yes, one half of my leg is much smoother than the other...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a honey-yellow, which doesn&#x27;t really stand out enough for a hard wax.</li>
            <li> First, use lots of oil (and I mean LOTS) before letting that wax touch your skin.  </li>
            <li> After checking the seller&#x27;s instructions, I&#x27;m sure of it, as they (dangerously) blend instructions from different products.</li>
            <li> So, after trying to pull it out with no luck, I heated up my soft wax and tried to wax it off that way, which removed about half of it.</li>
            <li> it makes it harder to see any wax left behind when doing clean up.</li>
            <li> and it did in fact hurt less than with soft wax</li>
            <li> it goes on too thin and takes too long to cool...</li>
            <li> so I have very coarse hair, and it got every single hair on my bikini area.</li>
            <li> Unless you are a professional waxer...just go to a salon and pay a professional to do the job rather than mess with this mess.</li>
            <li> It was when I got to the denser areas that I really ran into trouble, which I think was also exacerbated by the fact that the wax had gotten too hot and thin in consistency by that time.  </li>
            <li> The hard wax would not remove my (black, dark) leg hair, nor would it remove my stray (darker) eyebrow hairs, hair from my bikini line/underarms, nor the fine blonde hairs on my forearm.</li>
            <li> I had a mess the first few times that I tried using it.</li>
            <li> Takes a while for wax to melt, due to its size, you can&#x27;t expect to hurry up and get wax onto your skin, it takes about an hour to two, let it sit in low heat prior putting on any wax onto your face, armpit, etc.</li>
            <li> Not only do you have to wait for it to dry, causing anticipation/apprehension, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t fully dry.</li>
            <li> The hard wax is MUCH easier to use.</li>
            <li> I really like this hard wax a lot, I use it for everything from bikini waxing to my cleaning up my brows.  </li>
            <li> Not even GiGi&#x27;s brand but some random cheap wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flaky, doesn&#x27;t harden completely and is not good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The cheapo cold wax strips did better than this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is important to place a towel on the area where you will work, because the wax is difficult to remove from surfaces like floors and walls.</li>
            <li> the most dirty wax i have ever used.</li>
            <li> It takes too long to wait until it dries to peel it off.</li>
            <li> Too long</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t used it for long.</li>
            <li> maybe because I&#x27;m not a professional</li>
            <li> I have never gone to a salon to get a brazilian, never waxed anywhere ever, and only started plucking my eyebrows recently in the last few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really strange.</li>
            <li> Spread the wax on a small area, wait about 3-5 seconds, and put the tip of the popsicle stick on the end of the wax area (the area you would normally lift the wax and rip) and rip.</li>
            <li> The wax can get brittle and break if you leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> Nothing lasts as long as this.</li>
            <li> It can be messy, so be prepared with an old towel on the floor.</li>
            <li> And whatever you do...don&#x27;t let the wax sit on the hair too long and harden...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait too long</li>
            <li> I am not a professional, so that might have been why.  </li>
            <li> I also bought some wide popsicle sticks at my local craft store to apply the wax on the designated area</li>
            <li> I recommend that you don&#x27;t wait too long before removing or else</li>
            <li> It takes off hair with ease and minimal pain, but the Brazilian does not last as long.</li>
            <li> I would really suggest not piling it on too thick.</li>
            <li> Waxing day, put baby oil on skin, let dry, then apply hard wax (test on finger tip) and put it on fast.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put thick coat or let it dry too much ...</li>
            <li> you put the wax in the warmer for about 45min, it turns into a sticky but not runny form (test: when you scoop the wax out from the warmer it should form a slight ball at the top and slowly slip down the stick, not slip down the stick like liquid)</li>
            <li> You have to make sure it&#x27;s applied thick enough, otherwise you end up with little patches of wax that are hard to remove.</li>
            <li> and I can dispose of them with no other mess.  </li>
            <li> It hurts like CRAZY, and it doesn&#x27;t help that I have to do the same area several times to get the area clean.</li>
            <li> If you let it dry to long</li>
            <li> /&gt;One tin will last me two months, I just did my bikini, underarms and legs and only used an eighth of the tin.&lt;br /&gt;The trick to making this less painful is to take an aspirin an hour before, hold a warm wet wash cloth over the area</li>
            <li> I originally used Cerepil&#x27;s Blue Hard wax but realized it was a bit expensive considering the cost of other hard waxes available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Then, the day following I would develop little white heads all over the waxed area.  </li>
            <li> but is not consistent enough!</li>
            <li> Also, you have to be extremely diligent to get the same thickness each time you put the wax on, otherwise part will rip off and part will stay on your skin.</li>
            <li> (All other Gigi products contain ingredient lists and instructions in like 6 languages, for several waxes).</li>
            <li> (European Wax Center go check it out, Brazilians for around 30 bucks!)</li>
            <li> Other brands seem to make hair grow back quicker than this one.</li>
            <li> Does not work well in other parts such as legs, etc.</li>
            <li> When I ordered the GiGi hard wax kit, I had only had one professional brazilian wax done.  </li>
            <li> and she was surprised to see a different product (Andrea Brazilian Hard Wax, 4 ounce).</li>
            <li> my first waxing product, this wax gets very hard, still trying to figure out the optimal coolness when using strips to remove.</li>
            <li> The hemp wax was an awful kind of sticky and hard to clean up, so I went for Moom, because I found it locally.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Gigi Brazilian Hard Wax.</li>
            <li> Then, when that&#x27;s dry, I use baby powder.  </li>
            <li> dry well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I had no issues since I didnt let it be fully dry</li>
            <li> Dry the area, then apply a powder to suck up the remaining moisture.  </li>
            <li> All you have to do is heat it up and apply to the area where you want and wait for it to dry before ripping it off.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s turned up to dry, making it easier to grip - then rip off.  </li>
            <li> Few hours later, a tiny shard of wax popped out with the tiniest speck of root.</li>
            <li> Few hours later, a tiny shard of wax popped out with the tiniest speck of root.</li>
            <li> I bought the actual kit from Gigi a few months ago, when I ran out of the actual hardwax that was when I bought this.</li>
            <li> If you apply a thin layer or don&#x27;t pull the wax off for too long, the wax will break and leave a little residue which you can clean up using baby oil.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m not new to waxing</li>
            <li> Never seemed to get hot enough to burn even when fully melted so confused why other people complain about this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, there&#x27;s a little bit of a learning curve to DIY waxing, but once I got the hang of it, my monthly waxing was barely a chore.  </li>
            <li> I was also really attracted to the idea that you didn&#x27;t need muslin cloths to remove the wax (less waste!)    </li>
            <li> I fell in love with hard wax when I purchased an expensive blue one from ulta that comes in a microwaveable cup.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s hard not to compare it with my favorite wax, which unfortunately isn&#x27;t sold here in the US.</li>
            <li> First time I used it I had difficulty taking it off because I applied to thin of a layer.</li>
            <li> The wax tends to be difficult to get started on an edge, we found that if you take the time to make sure the edges are thick enough, this problem can be mitigated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Use cloth strips to cut down on waxing time by waxing larger areas</li>
            <li> you move down towards your netherparts, get a mirror and sit on the floor back on the wall.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll never purchase such thing Thumb down</li>
            <li> Only down side; it takes about 30 minutes to melt.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend using a thin layer of coconut oil prior to applying wax, since it keeps the wax from adhering to the skin, and prevents a lot of the cracking problems, not to mention the pain of ripping skin.</li>
            <li> It is super time consuming, messy, and at times can rip off in pieces, even if you&#x27;ve had a thick layer!</li>
            <li> Let the hair grow for a month and waxing will become painful again, but it has never hurt as much as the first time.  </li>
            <li> I find my skin stays less red afterwards when using these products.</li>
            <li> I find myself having to wax less often when using this wax in comparison to the blue wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black American</li>
            <li> Overall, it took me about an hour and a half.  </li>
            <li> TOO DRY AND TOO WET.</li>
            <li> It uses a ton of wax to peel anything off, and half the time, would break and leave me picking off tiny bits of wax from my skin and hairs.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this type of wax over any other because of the simple fact it doesn&#x27;t rip off your skin and leave you with bruises, like the other types of wax.</li>
            <li> It actually hurts less than plucking since its all at once</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t make a big mess.</li>
            <li> Unlike other waxes that remain sticky or take a long time to harden.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ever get the sugar wax to work, it just made a big mess.  </li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s easy to remove and it wasn&#x27;t so painful as regular wax.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that as long as I remembered to use baby oil before applying the wax I didn&#x27;t pull a lot of skin with it, and had very minimal bleeding.</li>
            <li> it was not what i ordered, it made a big mess, it was not clear on the cover what it was!&lt;br /&gt;bummer,&lt;br /&gt;i usually have the same wax everytime,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hard wax fanatic, and Gigi&#x27;s Brazilian Body Hard Wax is my hands-down favorite.</li>
            <li> This hard wax does not hurt like the soft wax.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m going to return the hard wax and exchange it with the sensitive - since I already know the technique.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using Gigi&#x27;s hard wax a complete disaster.  </li>
            <li> I use soft and hard waxes a lot</li>
            <li> but it took forever to heat up and was never very hot once it was.</li>
            <li> The wax is a little tough to keep at the right temperature, but once you get the hang of it, it works well for taking out the hairs without damaging the skin.</li>
            <li> and I finally covered less area due to frustration with the product.</li>
            <li> If it gets really hard and crumbly and you simply can&#x27;t do it, you can sometimes pull it up enough to cut off the hairs and the wax.</li>
            <li> If it gets really hard and crumbly and you simply can&#x27;t do it, you can sometimes pull it up enough to cut off the hairs and the wax.</li>
            <li> Overall, definitely buy it if you are looking for hard wax/Brazilian.</li>
            <li> I will never use this garbage again and will gladly go back to using Cerepil&#x27;s Blue hard wax.  </li>
            <li> I would advise to use soft wax in larger areas like legs, arm pits and bikini and use hard wax for small or hard to access areas such as Brazilian, eyebrows, and face in general.</li>
            <li> I was so scared to buy it since i have been suffering from wax problems for a long time.. but not anymore!!!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, waxing is a zillion times more painful when it takes your skin with it.</li>
            <li> For me, the \\&quot;landing strip\\&quot; was the most painful part to take off.</li>
            <li> It was the worst wax I ever experienced.</li>
            <li> So, I had really no idea what to expect.  </li>
            <li> Then next few times I shower, I exfoliate and use the gel/baby powder again.  </li>
            <li> A FEW EXTRA NOTES:</li>
            <li> just until it&#x27;s firm enough to pull.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It leaves few tiny hair .</li>
            <li> Keep turning it off and low to maintain the heavy honey texture.</li>
            <li> But for all the time I&#x27;m putting in, it&#x27;s getting harder to convince myself</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> Frustrating to have the removal be a breaking of the hair instead of real removal.</li>
            <li> If you spread it too thin it gets brittle really fast.</li>
            <li> it was such a waste of money</li>
            <li> The skin will turn slightly pink just apply a calming lotion and all will be well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> When yougo get your salon wax, carefully watch how they do</li>
            <li> only trouble I had was when I did the Brazilian wax.</li>
            <li> But that is to be expected because I have not had a lot of experience waxing.</li>
            <li> If thin layer it really hurts to remove.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> It will be harder to remove.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected.</li>
            <li> This was what I expected and works well for body waxing.</li>
            <li> But after a few deep breaths, I pulled my skin taunt and yanked the wax ...</li>
            <li> This is not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> its harder to get the bits</li>
            <li> it was a waste for me totally so 1 star</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s the person on whom the wax is being used (and her epic failure with beauty</li>
            <li> Finally got down the concept that less is more (and less painful than the glob approach).  </li>
            <li> Which is tolerable for small areas like brows but absolutely not for armpits, bikini and larger surfaces like legs.</li>
            <li> For me, I have noticed few ingrown hairs ( small hairs that curl on the surface) after waxing, but when I use soft wax I don&#x27;t get ingrowns.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a mess, a big mess.</li>
            <li> The wax was what I was looking for and works how I need it to work, however I just feel like it&#x27;s a bit messy and takes a few minutes to dry in order to actually use it.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my underarms (no pain whatsoever) and my bikini line (very little pain, especially compared to strip wax).</li>
            <li> Be fast and dont psych yourself out, it will sting but its much worse if you stop half eay through the strip.</li>
            <li> wax is also less painful than many of the other waxes I have used on my pubic</li>
            <li> With a thin coat of coconut oil, it hardly hurts, it&#x27;s not nearly as messy as soft wax,</li>
            <li> I would hope any salons I&#x27;ve gone to haven&#x27;t reused other people&#x27;s wax on me, but I looked into it</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT (and regimen) HAS WORKED EXTREMELY WELL FOR ME.ng</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT (and regimen) HAS WORKED EXTREMELY WELL FOR ME.</li>
            <li> However, for legs, it takes forever because you can only wax a small area at once.</li>
            <li> The directions were in 3 other languages.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other displeased reviews.  </li>
            <li> My last tip would be to get the small wax spatulas that GiGi makes.  </li>
            <li> Use one hand to pull the skin and the other hand to pull the wax.</li>
            <li> This wax does not require backing with cloth after application due to its stronger nature.</li>
            <li> a small area on you inner thigh and follow the instructions for technique.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not had this problem with other wax.</li>
            <li> Will have to see other brands to compare.</li>
            <li> Again, maybe it was in comparison to the other product I&#x27;ve used that</li>
            <li> But waxing your head with this is extremely risky.</li>
            <li> So for myself I would try one of the other GiGi waxes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it would work in a smaller application area.</li>
            <li> I have used other GiGi products over the years.</li>
            <li> It can be tricky when you can&#x27;t exactly see the direction of hair growth, and you may unfortunately have to wax twice</li>
            <li> All in all I really love this wax and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> i will never purchase any other wax than this.</li>
            <li> use the other Gigi products with it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as expected!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It got some hairs the other wax missed on me</li>
            <li> I tried switching to hard wax and for me it didn&#x27;t work, you really need to know the technique of hard wax before using it.</li>
            <li> You might can, but it is a lot harder when it comes down to</li>
            <li> A little painful but better that other products for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Leaves wax due to the same reason and gets tough to remove later!</li>
            <li> If you have to, shave 1 time and let the hair regrow to a very minimal 1/2 inch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried giving myself a Brazilian wax several times and could never really get the job FULLY done...until I tried GiGi Brazilian Hard Wax.</li>
            <li> I am new to waxing, and decided that I was tired of shaving all the time.</li>
            <li> This wax is easy to use, and makes waxing les painful.</li>
            <li> I brush the cornstarch onto the area to be waxed, follow the waxing instructions, tweeze the inevitable stray hairs, and use the olive oil to remove any wax residue left behind anywhere.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It hurts way less than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be doing another round of waxing before I leave for vacation, since I&#x27;ve missed quite a few, and the ones that broke need to be collected, but I have plenty left for this.</li>
            <li> The hard wax also gets a little too brittle, and it&#x27;s hard to know exactly when to pull it off between when it hardens enough to come off and before it gets so hard that it will break.</li>
            <li> I read previous comments that said this wax turns flaky during use, what I found was that it turns flaky if you use a very thin layer of the wax on your skin or if you left the wax on the warmer until it turned runny -- this happened during the later part of my waxing session while I was doing my chacha (big mistake, but I did manage to get all the hair out of there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This wax has a really narrow window between being too soft to remove and being hard and crumbly--it may take a few tries before you get the knack.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard enough figuring out the pattern of your hair growth when you&#x27;re not dealing with all the other variables.</li>
            <li> I know that this is different than what is suggested with waxing the other body parts where you want some pliability and remove before the wax is fully hard.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry and it is not easy to get off the skin.</li>
            <li> The hard wax (unlike strip wax) only sticks to the hair, not the skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The key to using hard wax is not overheating it.  </li>
            <li> Gets all of the hair off well every time, this is the third jar of hard wax I&#x27;ve purchased from GiGi, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing my girlie bits for about 2 years now and this is my definite go to hard wax.</li>
            <li> I have had hard wax used on me before but only in a salon.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hard wax because it&#x27;s the only type I&#x27;ve encountered since I&#x27;ve started getting a Brazilian.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple of different hard waxes and thought that I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this wax as it is very similar to their non hard wax.</li>
            <li> So hard wax was next on my list.  </li>
            <li> The only hard wax I will buy or use.</li>
            <li> before the wax is completely dry scrape up a little bit of the applied wax so that you can have a little flap to grasp when removing the wax.&lt;br /&gt;*Use</li>
            <li> I prefer the dark honey wax that&#x27;s used with the stripes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely difficult for me to get the hang of using this, but when it works it works really well.</li>
            <li> For small sections like eyebrows it&#x27;s not a big deal, but for the legs it gets to be a waste of wax and money and time -- shaving is easier.</li>
            <li> Lastly, apply it thick, in small area&#x27;s at a time, and don&#x27;t wait too long to pull it off.  </li>
            <li> also if  ididnt put a thick enough layer on it would chIP.</li>
            <li> It is not messy and my wax lasts approximately up to 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> Gets easier with each use and the hair no longer grows back as thick or dark.</li>
            <li> You really do not need strips w/ this wax as long as you put it on a bit thick.</li>
            <li> I suggest make patterns of it out of board or thick paper for future use.</li>
            <li> I saw that my previous salon uses European hard wax</li>
            <li> The fact that you don&#x27;t need any strips reduces the hassle and the mess, and also allows you to focus on small little bits and pieces at a time, which for me was absolutely necessary.</li>
            <li> it should be dark green or red like other hard waxes, so that it&#x27;s easier to see where you&#x27;ve applied the wax</li>
            <li> lay down</li>
            <li> it get too runny, turn it off and wait for the heat to go down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d to eventually get that down to the 30 minutes my esthetician could do it in.  </li>
            <li> For after care i used aquaphor and within a day the redness and sensitivity went way down.</li>
            <li> Now that I have it down, I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> and it takes multiple, I mean 5+ coats, for it to work.</li>
            <li> it removes all the hair with no problem other than the pain!</li>
            <li> For me, I am totally sold on waxing after shaving for the past 30+years!  </li>
            <li> Even stray hairs that get left behind are usually removable with just your fingers--no tweezers necessary!  </li>
            <li> With my chin and lips, the wax didn&#x27;t take off the very small hairs the last two times</li>
            <li> I have used other kinds of waxes: GiGi honey wax, a green wax of which its brand I don&#x27;t even remember, lemon and sugar wax.</li>
            <li> Way less messy than the Honee or any other non-hard wax.</li>
            <li> So much LESS pain as well.</li>
            <li> It took me longer than it does at the spa, but if you include travel time, it is less.  </li>
            <li> If I could give this less than one star, I would.  </li>
            <li> time that worked for me was about a minute to a minute and a half.</li>
            <li> you get clammy from the pain, the coconut oil does jack, so put some baby powder on for half a minute or so and then re-oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you get clammy from the pain, the coconut oil does jack, so put some baby powder on for half a minute or so and then re-oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also think it hurts less than using strips.  </li>
            <li> I think it hurts less.</li>
            <li> I got this in a kit about a week and a half ago.  </li>
            <li> I would spend anywhere between half an hour to an hour trying to oil</li>
            <li> The faster, the less it will hurt.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot less painless than tradition waxing.</li>
            <li> about half way up the can.</li>
            <li> - I use a numbing gel (lidocaine, which is prescribed to me) and let it soak in for a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> but I find it not effective enough for heavily hairy places like legs or bikini or brazilian.</li>
            <li> The hair removing capability of this wax seemed less.</li>
            <li> (I wiggled around and did one half turn of the popsicle stick once inside); and 3)</li>
            <li> It takes so darn long when you can hardly see what you&#x27;re doing, even with mirrors propped at all sorts of angles.</li>
            <li> You have less of a mess</li>
            <li> so when it drips it won&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> It was a sticky, gooey mess.</li>
            <li> So i was stuck with a goey mess in my hair.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use a thick layer with this wax, as a thin layer will make it difficult to remove and it will keep breaking.  </li>
            <li> This 14 ounce jar lasts me a little over half a year.</li>
            <li> After a few times, I got it down to 1.5 hours, not too shabby.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of people complaining that it was too hard to remove after it was dry.</li>
            <li> Once on the skin and dry it flakes away and makes it hard to take off.</li>
            <li> and this is the only hard wax that works on me!</li>
            <li> Once you get all the initial hair out, the new hair is much less painful to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past, whenever I used honey wax and strips on these specific areas, I would pull slowly and the strip would come off</li>
            <li> Also If you have some long hair it is going to make for a nightmare experience as it makes the pain much worse and much harder to pull off.</li>
            <li> You are not a sissy for popping a few advil half an hour before use though, that&#x27;s what I did and it seemed to help a lot.</li>
            <li> Below I have listed my regimen for all those who would like to save a little $$.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I had little sticky pieces of wax on my skin for days after.</li>
            <li> It makes sense, put in a little time for your hair maintenance, and reap the benefits for two glorious weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it turns brittle and will just break off in little pieces instead of pulling off as a strip.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I can do a little over 1 hour.</li>
            <li> Little by little the hair will get finer.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s like $50 per little cup</li>
            <li> I sometimes overlap an area 5 times (a little bit OCD), with no consequences ;</li>
            <li> Put a little baby powder on before using and it comes off with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Even after all of that, trying to get it off my skin using baby oil and everything else under the sun, it was still days of picking off little bits of missed wax.  </li>
            <li> Just a little sticky.</li>
            <li> so you have to do it little by little....too time consuming.</li>
            <li> Maybe because without the warmer, the wax had cooled a little.</li>
            <li> I wish it cooled a little faster.</li>
            <li> Once, the wax got a little too close to the wife&#x27;s lady</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to apply a little amount of oil or powder (I applied both), so the wax will just pull out hair and not skin.  </li>
            <li> Use a little talcum powder underneath for a stronger take when the wax is setting.  </li>
            <li> I had previously used pre-packaged wax strips for years, but recently ended up having it rip off a thin layer of skin.  </li>
            <li> got the warmer in a deal at a local store, then ordered this wax as it was the one they used at my salon that worked well on tough</li>
            <li> I am Puerta Rican, so I have very thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> This stuff is way less messy than wax that doesn&#x27;t harden (what a mess!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get little pieces left behind.</li>
            <li> Waxing can be painful and troublesome but worth it.</li>
            <li> I also tried the roll on ( it was messy).</li>
            <li> Sometimes I even turn it off for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Still have to pluck a few with tweezers, but this stuff makes my job easier when helping him.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just to messy for my liking.</li>
            <li> Wish it wasnt so messy to remove from hands...</li>
            <li> Towards the end it gets messy.</li>
            <li> - figured I&#x27;d try this to save a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve learned that you need to keep the wax at a heavy honey consistency.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not a sissy for popping a few Advil 30 minutes before.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had a few strays here</li>
            <li> For all those who are tired of shaving there bikini ares and are tired of the red itcky bumps I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Its just a waste of time.</li>
            <li> and it got dried on my skin by the time i was taking the wax strips with the result that i had all the wax on my leg</li>
            <li> waste of money i swear</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to remove misplaced wax.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> Maybe watch a few if you are a beginner....hot wax</li>
            <li> Tried a few methods.</li>
            <li> Wasted money at drug stores and salons.</li>
            <li> ...and I&#x27;ve tried a few.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t as messy as I imagined.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff a few weeks ago and just got around to using it.  </li>
            <li> although can be messy (as all wax can be).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for few years</li>
            <li> few points</li>
            <li> Then I apply some baby powder to the region to get rid of any excess moisture, and then I apply the wax in a moderate amount in the direction of the hair growth, trying not to spread it out too thin.</li>
            <li> i tired different ones, and they either too sticky or break in pieces.</li>
            <li> So at the end you have a lot of parts that are messy and</li>
            <li> A few drops are on my carpet that I couldn&#x27;t remove them at all plus that I had to put in garbage one of my cloths that some drops of this wax was on it because you can not wash it away once it drops some where even on your skin.</li>
            <li> No allergy, no hair left behind.</li>
            <li> messy messy messy</li>
            <li> Doing it slower helped me not break hairs, and it hurt waaaaaay less than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li> Plus it requires less stuff (no fabric strips needed!)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much less hair than before, &amp; thinner too!</li>
            <li> BTW, I prefer the hard Wax versus the other we need a cloth to remove it.</li>
            <li> And you have to be very careful about drips and strands of wax getting on surfaces and fabric because it&#x27;s hard to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hard wax to use for removing nose hair (I am not a professional nor have I ever had my nose waxed) and came across GiGi Hard Wax.  </li>
            <li> This was terrible because that meant that if I had to be waxed for a special occasion I would have to get it done 3 or 4 days before in order to conceal the redness/puffyness and the white heads.  </li>
            <li> it just plain rocks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but, then again, that is what I expected from violently ripping my body hair off with hot wax....</li>
            <li> Overall this product does do its job by removing hair, however it is quite difficult to use for your pubic region if you want to remove 2/3 or all of the hair down there --</li>
            <li> It claims to work for brazilian wax as well, but so not true!</li>
            <li> OMG what I mess I make!</li>
            <li> There is SOOO much less mess when you don&#x27;t use the paper or cloth strips!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let it dry completely, because when you strip it off it will just crack off like plastic and it hurts bad.</li>
            <li> I am a newbie to waxing myself, but after 3 times it was much easier and less painful each time I waxed my bikini area.</li>
            <li> resorted to hot wash cloths and the BS wax remover from this bad company...</li>
            <li> This is my first BAD experience with a GiGi product</li>
            <li> When I had gone to salons to get waxed, it was always incredibly painful and my skin would turn purple and was irritated (and puffy) for the first 24 hrs.  </li>
            <li> The first couple wax sessions are painful, and this way you can learn the technique.</li>
            <li> After my rather terrible experience with this, I resolved to get my more difficult waxing done professionally</li>
            <li> it will also break off in small chunks due to lack of flexibility unless you applied it too thick.</li>
            <li> If you are unfamiliar with *hard* wax, as I was, take the time to wax a patch of hair (not fuzz) from your leg, which will be a much much less painful area to practice on than your genitals ;)&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a wax, glue would be the proper term, because it was so hard to remove!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt bad at all would definitely recomend l, especially for the bikini area!</li>
            <li> Left both my mom and me with painful red welts.</li>
            <li> It just was a mess, it was hard to remove it from my skin, in fact the wax tore all my wax strips</li>
            <li> No matter how I tried applying (thin, thick, with or without a lip) it would constantly rip apart leaving pieces stuck on me.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the little pieces of wax off ouch!</li>
            <li> Just apply the wax, let harded a little, and rip it off!</li>
            <li> Takes a little to get used to the application process, but after that works like a charm!</li>
            <li> It takes way too long for the wax to dry and is very difficult to remove from your skin and residual pieces do not come off with baby oil like other hard waxes.</li>
            <li> A little too sticky, I&#x27;d go with the GiGi all purpose hard wax.</li>
            <li> But when I used strips I had very little issues.</li>
            <li> It was so painful to get that wax of my armpit, without the oil, it really, really hurt (that&#x27;s why I say it&#x27;s sticky).</li>
            <li> The market place has gone to small containers, micowaveable.</li>
            <li> Use it on small areas.</li>
            <li> I waited up to 7 minutes (well over the usual 30 seconds) for it to harden, but it just stayed in a putty form that I had to scrape off my skin.</li>
            <li> At one Brazilian a month, I usually buy about three to four cans a year.</li>
            <li> I bought this wax instead of my usual Surgi Brazilian wax kit because I noticed that you get triple the product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have the pot warmer, than heat it up in a small aluminum pot with water on a stove.</li>
            <li> But when waxing your legs with this it does take longer because you have to do small sections at a time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to shave ON TOP of the waxing because of the horrible job its done</li>
            <li> I prefer something like Nad&#x27;s or something usually and plan to go that way, leave this wax to the professionals, because I for one didn&#x27;t like using it myself.</li>
            <li> wrong product delivered.. not even the same brand</li>
            <li> Not sure about this one.  </li>
            <li> I love this wax, I hate buying those strips and when I discovered this existed where you could just wait til it hardened and rip it off yourself, YAYYY!!!!</li>
            <li> i put some in a small glass gar and microwaved for1min</li>
            <li> A thicker wax layer is not necessarily better.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am an amateur at this diy waxing stuff.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I am doing something wrong (which is highly likely.)</li>
            <li> i dont know if this is a fake one or made from different material but compare to the one I bought from sally hansen</li>
            <li> no more face burns.</li>
            <li> (would turn out to be too expensive to cover larger areas).</li>
            <li> - I sprinkle baby powder to keep the wax from sticking to my skin (not sure if this is a legit method, but the wax repels from my skin and attaches to the hair)&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why?</li>
            <li> You usually need to make it a thicker</li>
            <li> Usually waxes have one purpose and that&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t leave it too long and put a thick layer Cz if u put A thin layer</li>
            <li> : use a small utensil to apply wax to face.</li>
            <li> No more shaving for me, just a waxing maintenance once every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> and I usually work with cremes.</li>
            <li> If spread to thin, the wax dries quickly and when you try to rip it off, it cracks and crumbles and can be quite painful.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and its very messy no matter the temp.</li>
            <li> This one hurts worse than the other waxes do.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have any problems with this wax irritating my skin as other brands have.</li>
            <li> but I probably won&#x27;t be buying this again (unless the other ones I try are worse than this one).</li>
            <li> As a professional waxer this, by far, is the WORST wax I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I usually use microwaveable wax but its hard to find now.</li>
            <li> It hurt horribly, but that&#x27;s because after YEARS of shaving my hair was dark, thick and full.</li>
            <li> It is very stiff and I could not use it without warmer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to use plenty of the oil before applying wax, makes it so much easier and less painful to pull off!</li>
            <li> There were a lot of bits of wax stuck to my skin, which were very hard to get off, and I&#x27;ve also found little bits of wax all over the floor.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and bad allergies.</li>
            <li> It just makes an unnecessary mess.</li>
            <li> Too hard</li>
            <li> I recommend the brazillian body hard wax to all my friends that wax at home.</li>
            <li> Also, you may not realize this, but hard wax can be reused.</li>
            <li> It does get hard as stated.</li>
            <li> When you use the pre-epilation oil, there is hardly any pain at all.  </li>
            <li> There was nothing hard about it.</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to hard wax for waxing my nostrils.</li>
            <li> I have tried the hard wax and honey wax.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has used this brand of hard wax for years.</li>
            <li> When I applied the hard wax (something I&#x27;ve done dozens of times before)</li>
            <li> I always use this hard wax for my Brazilian bikini waxes at home</li>
            <li> hard wax fir the bikini</li>
            <li> The salon I went to used hard wax</li>
            <li> If you are a hard waxer, you must try GiGi hard wax.</li>
            <li> I keep reordering it over and over, although I do like all purpose hard wax as well.</li>
            <li> and it dries and gets hard.</li>
            <li> But I also decided to pick this hard body wax up in case</li>
            <li> I use hard wax for face hair removal and bikini areas.</li>
            <li> It is extremely hard wax( like stone).</li>
            <li> I even bought a hard wax refill too.</li>
            <li> I used to use the microwaveable Gigi Honee wax, but one day I came across a YouTube video about the Gigi Hard Wax.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews on the Gigi Brazilian body hard wax and decided to give it a shot...</li>
            <li> It is really hard to use hard wax alone.</li>
            <li> You will not receive the product pictured but rather, a 4 ounce container of Andrea Brazilian Hard Wax that is labeled as the product in the picture.</li>
            <li> Now this did not happen with the hard wax.</li>
            <li> so I wanted a hard wax</li>
            <li> This hard wax takes off all the hair</li>
            <li> hard wax</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s hard wax</li>
            <li> (I use vitamin E oil)&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t use waxing strips (with this hard wax, because you don&#x27;t need them)&lt;br /&gt;*Test</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced this stuff wasn&#x27;t hard wax, and was intended to be used with those cloth strips.  </li>
            <li> I do always hold on to a container of strip wax to get those hard to reach places, though.</li>
            <li> Maybe not for the beginer but isnt hard to use at all.</li>
            <li> For anyone who loves being waxed but hates paying the price I would invest in the Gigi machine and the hard wax.</li>
            <li> When I rub it on skin, it becomes so hard and doesn&#x27;t seperate from body.</li>
            <li> it becomes so hard that you can not remove it.</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time keeping up with beauty appointments.</li>
            <li> I have been using GiGi hard wax for over a year now</li>
            <li> a quality hard wax.  </li>
            <li> But some times its hard to take out after applying for me</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Gigi Hard Wax.</li>
            <li> *Set the wax to warming in the warming pot at least an hour before you plan to wax.</li>
            <li> You can use the wax over and over, I&#x27;ve gotten at least 5 leg waxes</li>
            <li> , it sucks but stick with it -</li>
            <li> (I think I&#x27;m allergic to pine resin, which is commonly used in them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> If you try this at least buy it at a store where it costs nothing to return it.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend trying this without getting it done professionally at least once though, so you know what to expect.  </li>
            <li> spread it on too thickly.</li>
            <li> When I pulled slowly the wax did break, but the hair did come off with the wax.</li>
            <li> I tell myself &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; but end up chickening out and pulling really slowly.</li>
            <li> If you pull slow the strip might break (not to mention it will hurt like hell).</li>
            <li> if you have thick hair growth.</li>
            <li> pulls out even thick stubborn hairs, not stubbly hairs though, they have to grow a bit longer</li>
            <li> I had the lady start on my shoulders and the wax was so thick that after taking off SOME hair the wax was stuck on my skin.</li>
            <li> Its time consuming, or maybe I was just slow.</li>
            <li> No matter how thick you put it, it does not pull off, it cracks and breaks.</li>
            <li> They recommend using a thick coat of wax</li>
            <li> Just make sure the wax layer is not TOO thin on very painful areas as a slower pull combined with thin layer or wax will cause the wax to break.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> What I mean by that is it seems a bit runny instead of as thick as I would like it.  </li>
            <li> Usually if that happens it&#x27;s user error, not any fault of the wax!</li>
            <li> Very very messy!</li>
            <li> The biggest trick is apply in very small sections.</li>
            <li> small and start thin.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> It was seriously a miracle, and that&#x27;s why I continue to wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was super painful, took forever, the results were terrible, and I had hair again in about ten days.  </li>
            <li> This wax breaks off in pieces making it extremely hard &amp; frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> waxing those private areas is extremely painful.</li>
            <li> Some of the waxes were not good.</li>
            <li> This is not a good quality wax.</li>
            <li> I was using different types of wax and using paper or cloth strips and getting so frustrated.  </li>
            <li> On legs, I still use pre-waxed strips which are not good for using anywhere else.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just not good.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> If its thin it will break so I applied thick layer of it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want paper thin, but not too thick.</li>
            <li> TOO THIN TOO THICK</li>
            <li> I tried applying it thickly, I tried applying it thinly.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE WITHOUT, seriously the pre epi oil is an at home waxing game changer.</li>
            <li> Welp, one epidermis, dermis and partial sub-q layer later... this stuff is AWFUL!!!</li>
            <li> Boy, was I in for a rude awakening!</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;m not really sure what went wrong.</li>
            <li> At worst, serious injury to sensitive parts of the body which hard wax is meant for.</li>
            <li> Hard wax is generally less painful than strip wax, but it has it&#x27;s downsides.</li>
            <li> and it was a painfree experience to say the very least.</li>
            <li> I use it in a very thick layer</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, that any sugar based wax/ roll- on wax does not work for me.</li>
            <li> The hard wax too expensive and time consuming for leg</li>
            <li> I tried veet wax strips but it removed parts of the thin skin</li>
            <li> I tried it on lighter hair on my legs, sometimes it leaves the hair behind.</li>
            <li> I have been tired of shaving every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> For me it was actually worse.</li>
            <li> I had to write a review because of all these random reviews leaving negative comments like &amp;#34;it&#x27;s messy,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;it</li>
            <li> I tried a thin layer, medium and thin, it still kept clinging to my skin.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t work on the areas where you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> It is irritating to the armpits.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Works well but does leave some hair behind.</li>
            <li> Four stars because thin layers don&#x27;t work that</li>
            <li> poor results.  </li>
            <li> This wax is so thin, I cannot grab the end to pull.  </li>
            <li> But this one is worse I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Frustrating.</li>
            <li> I wad never good at using the strips and going out is too expensive.</li>
            <li> Way less painful that way.</li>
            <li> I am amazed for two reasons: 1) it was much less painful than I thought it would be and;</li>
            <li> Plus, each time it gets less painful.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does work...and as a generality it is less painful than strip wax.</li>
            <li> the easier and less painful</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s much less painful than using strips.  </li>
            <li> This wax is harder to use, clean up is awful, gets stuck to your nails really bad!!</li>
            <li> It will get rid of difficult, tough hair no problem.</li>
            <li> You want it to be about as thick as cold honey).    </li>
            <li> Wow, how horrible this stuff truly is.</li>
            <li> I spent literally 6 hours between preparation, application, and showering to get the remnants off in just trying to get this crap off my chest.  </li>
            <li> I have awfully awful coarse, hard to remove hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also a difficult technique to master.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s horrible getting the tiny pieces off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy guy and and attempted to wax my back and this stuff horrible.</li>
            <li> but yeah its expensive and a lot of work.</li>
            <li> but boy was i wrong.  </li>
            <li> I cannot imagine how difficult it would be without the warmer.&lt;br /&gt;*Make</li>
            <li> Some people recommend baby oil, but I didn&#x27;t have it around for the infamous armpit of 2012 episode.&lt;br</li>

            <li> so I&#x27;ve tried several waxes and this is the worst wax I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I always purchase it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The residual wax bits are difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> approximately 2 hours!)</li>
            <li> and thats difficult for me,</li>
            <li> I must be doing it wrong because my pubes do not come off...</li>
            <li> For $10, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this wax.</li>
            <li> Expensive for the amount they give you.</li>
            <li> Works well for arm pits and upper arm, horrible for legs and arms.</li>
            <li> This wax was difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, this stuff just doesn&#x27;t remove hair from my body.</li>
            <li> This wax will remove MAYBE 3 or 4 hairs in one pull (wtf?)</li>
            <li> It was very irritating.</li>
            <li> This is very false.</li>
            <li> For those areas which you know you might chicken out because they are extremely painful, try waxing very small portions (nickel or quarter sizes worked for me).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve always been a shaving girl, but I was sick and tired of having to shave every day and started looking for something</li>
            <li> very bad not easy to use</li>
            <li> Well, in reality what it is is a sticky miserable gummy mess.  </li>
            <li> It desperately needs cloth strips in order to use this wax.  </li>
            <li> My usual 45 minute wax has taken 3 hours with terrible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was very uncomfortable an itchy.</li>
            <li> does nobody say about how impossible it is to get off of your nails (shellac), your skin (rubbing, oils, etc) and, well, your towel?</li>
            <li> Also, it is almost impossible to remove all of the wax.  </li>
            <li> Worst product ever... hard as rock :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not all bad</li>
            <li> The bad reviews are user error.</li>
            <li> The bad reviews are user error.</li>
            <li> It looks like it would hurt really bad.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad experience at a spa where I got burned...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bad product for one reason</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really bad</li>
            <li> so it couldn&#x27;t have been that bad.</li>
            <li> As a result of pcos and bad laser hair removal treatment</li>
            <li> Works as it should, just wish it wasnt so painful waxing bikini area.  </li>
            <li> Item is as described this purticular brazilian wax can be painful</li>
            <li> Still really painful, but hey, I could say I got 85% of what I intended to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having to pick out the pieces was time consuming and painful.</li>
            <li> Its just knowing how to use it and its painful when using it against your skin ripping your hair off.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s painful to take off.</li>
            <li> Extremely annoying to work with- the wax is very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t come off from skin:(  I used oil</li>
            <li> I was always disappointed</li>
            <li> At the end of it, I was sore and disappointed.</li>
            <li> The microwaving was annoying</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t hate your life afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hate to break it to you, but it&#x27;s WAX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Terrible quality! Too hard and it takes multiple, I mean 5+ coats, for it to work. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great wax if you need to wax</li>
            <li> Good Lord, this stuff takes some getting used to !  I had a mess the first few times that I tried using it. But I didn&#x27;t give up, mainly because I had ordered 10 cans of it,  Lol&lt;br /&gt;It takes practice and perseverance,  but you&#x27;ll eventually get the hang of it.  Advice - lay news papers, an old sheet, something down on the floor so when it drips it won&#x27;t make a mess. Also, after your wax has gotten hot and melted , turn the setting down to LOW and leave it for another 30 minutes. This wax drips everywhere when its too hot, once its had time to cool down its much easier to work with.  Believe me, much easier. Lastly, apply it thick, in small area&#x27;s at a time, and don&#x27;t wait too long to pull it off.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> There are much better waxes out there if you are a professional.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about this product! It works so well and even better if you use the pre epi oil also by Gigi. The oil saves your skin! DO NOT USE WITHOUT, seriously the pre epi oil is an at home waxing game changer. Also I love this wax. I use to do a Brazilian wax, lip, eyebrows, inner nose ect and it works so well! Also I recommend getting a post wax remover/ oil. It get rid of the wax and smooths the skin</li>
            <li> Came in on time, was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I love this wax! its one of my favorites out of the many I&#x27;ve tried. It melts in no time and goes on smooth along with drying fast which makes for removing less painfull. I recommend the brazillian body hard wax to all my friends that wax at home.</li>
            <li> It is the best. I did not know that my skin is sensitive. I tried veet wax strips but it removed parts of the thin skin and so it became darker. I also tried the roll on ( it was messy). This one is perfect , until now. It did not hurt my skin and removed the hear from the roots plus you dont need to clean the room after using it as there will be no mess. If you are looking for safe and clean use . This is the best</li>
            <li> I had been waxed professionally before, but grew weary of the price tag and decided to try it myself. This wax works much better than the kind they had at my salon. Goes on smooth and easy to peel off once you get used to it. Also, you may not realize this, but hard wax can be reused. I would hope any salons I&#x27;ve gone to haven&#x27;t reused other people&#x27;s wax on me, but I looked into it and it&#x27;s perfectly legal in most places to reuse hard wax. Since I&#x27;m the only one who uses it, it seems sanitary enough to reuse my own leg wax. I just filter the hot wax through clean pantyhose, leaving all the hair behind and resulting in nice clean wax that can be reused for the next time. This is my second tub and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this right after I bought the waxing kit here on Amazon. I wanted to make sure that it worked well, but this is a great value and it works fantastic. It&#x27;s a must-buy when you buy the GiGi waxing kit (especially if you&#x27;re as hairy as me). It can last you quite a while, it has lasted us many waxing sessions, probably over 10-15 all together.</li>
            <li> Love this hard wax!! It doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin but only to the hair which makes waxing so much easier and bearable. This 14 ounce jar lasts me a little over half a year. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Before using this product, I had never had a wax done professionally or by myself.  So, I had really no idea what to expect.  I use sugar wax on my eyebrows, but honestly that&#x27;s pretty painful and I thought that if people are using this hard wax on their bikini areas, it MUST be better than sugar wax!  Well I bought the kit that comes with the warmer.  I also bought the cardboard rings that go around the can to keep the warmer clean.  The kit comes with a DVD.  I watched it, and it seemed doable.  I am not a very hairy person, and my hair is fine, too.  Anyway, after a pretty easy learning curve, I would recommend this product to anyone is tired of shaving.  I have used it on my underarms, which works phenomenally.  I use it to wax my bikini area, and I really can&#x27;t believe that it doesn&#x27;t hurt more than it does.  The pre-waxing oil seems to work great.  I do get some ingrown hairs, but bought an antiseptic gel to use immediately after waxing.  Then, when that&#x27;s dry, I use baby powder.  Then next few times I shower, I exfoliate and use the gel/baby powder again.  The ingrown hairs are much, much better!  The real trick is to use the wax when it is not runny at all.  It should be \\&quot;gloopy\\&quot;.  I heat it for a little while on hot, then to extra low.  Sometimes I even turn it off for a few minutes.  The wax does not need to cool that much before you pull it off again.  If you wait too long, it will obviously harden too much.  Also, you will learn that you need some \\&quot;lead area\\&quot; (i.e. a hairless starting point) for getting a grip on the wax.  So, apply it just outside the hair growth, and that&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll hang onto it to remove it.  Way less painful that way.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, I have been waxing for years and I in the last few years started waxing myself. I used GiGi honee for a while and it was always OK but sorta messy and sticky, but the hard wax is a completely different experience, It&#x27;s easy to remove and it wasn&#x27;t so painful as regular wax. I recommend, just read the instruction before and Use oil before application, that makes all the difference, a little oil other wise the wax doesn&#x27;t stay.&lt;br /&gt;good luck!</li>
            <li> I usually use microwaveable wax but its hard to find now. This wax is a little drippy when hot, be careful otherwise you will get it all over the place. It does get hard as stated. I works and does the job. I have not had any skin reactions.</li>
            <li> I was new to waxing when I purchased this product.  I read lots of reviews and decided that this one sounded the best.  I have continued to buy this product for all my waxing needs as I am very satisfied with it. I also had to purchase a warming pot and spreading sticks, but I have not bothered to use the pre- or post- epilation oils. Below I have listed my regimen for all those who would like to save a little $$.&lt;br /&gt;  *Set the wax to warming in the warming pot at least an hour before you plan to wax. I leave it on high with the cover OFF for about twenty minutes then leave it on low with the cover on for the rest of the time.&lt;br /&gt;  * Set out a comfortable pillow covered by a large towel that you won&#x27;t mind getting ruined in the place you plan on waxing.&lt;br /&gt;  * Also set out a small bowl of cornstarch with a basting brush (or small paintbrush), a bottle of Olive oil, cotton balls, good tweezers, small trash can, and a mirror of some sort (if you plan on bikini waxing).&lt;br /&gt;  *wash all areas to be waxed (I just hop in a slightly warm shower and do a quck wash.  Be carful not to use really hot water or satay in too long because you don&#x27;t want to open up your pores too much)&lt;br /&gt;  * dry well.&lt;br /&gt;  * I brush the cornstarch onto the area to be waxed, follow the waxing instructions, tweeze the inevitable stray hairs, and use the olive oil to remove any wax residue left behind anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;  A FEW EXTRA NOTES: I always wax after my kids are in bed for the night. (Does anybody want to chance their kids walking in on them in the middle of this?)  I only do my bikini area, but I do as close to a full Sphynx wax as I can (that&#x27;s everything, Ladies!) and it takes me a good 2 hours.  The first time it took me twice as long, but after I got used to things, my time improved.  Also, I do this set up in front of a TV in my basement.  If I had better lighting and didn&#x27;t get distracted by what&#x27;s on screen occasionally, I could prabably do this in an hour and a half or less.&lt;br /&gt;  The morning after waxing and all the days following, I make sure to exfoliate the waxed area with a loofah to prevent ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;  THIS PRODUCT (and regimen) HAS WORKED EXTREMELY WELL FOR ME.ng and all the days following, I make sure to exfoliate the waxed area with a loofah to prevent ingrown hairs.    THIS PRODUCT (and regimen) HAS WORKED EXTREMELY WELL FOR ME.</li>
            <li> I had never waxed myself until I got this wax.  I am amazed for two reasons: 1) it was much less painful than I thought it would be and; 2) it did not irritate my super sensitive skin.  When I had gone to salons to get waxed, it was always incredibly painful and my skin would turn purple and was irritated (and puffy) for the first 24 hrs.  Then, the day following I would develop little white heads all over the waxed area.  This was terrible because that meant that if I had to be waxed for a special occasion I would have to get it done 3 or 4 days before in order to conceal the redness/puffyness and the white heads.  With this wax, I only got red afterwards and it only lasted about 2 hours.  Plus, no white heads of any kind and no ingrowns.  I am amazed!  I even used it on my face and it didn&#x27;t cause any problems with my sensitive skin.  I must admit, I didn&#x27;t get all the hairs off the bikini line the first time I did it, but my skin handled it so well that I tried again the following day and it worked much better the second time (I think there was a slight learning curve, plus I was super nervous the first time as I thought it would be much more painful than it was).  I also got the anesthetic spray and used it afterwards.  Before I waxed the first time, I did a bunch of tests on my arms (using rubbing alcohol before waxing, using alcohol + oil, using oil only, using nothing, using the spray) and the best results were obtained from not using anything on my skin prior to waxing.  Also, after the anesthetic spray, I put neosporin on all the waxed areas just in case.  Make sure to use a thick layer with this wax, as a thin layer will make it difficult to remove and it will keep breaking.  Overall, I am very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> This wax is perfect. I recently began to wax my legs, brows and...wait for it...armpits. Yes, I&#x27;m that kind of brave. I researched the h3// out of waxes before I bought this with the warmer and this wax had rave reviews for a reason. Unlike other waxes I&#x27;d tried, It melts to a good texture, is easy to apply and removes the hairs with minimal hair breakage (due to user error). Suggestion---don&#x27;t try to use any kind of waxing cloth/paper with this. It just makes an unnecessary mess.</li>
            <li> Smells great and applies evenly. Some of the best hard wax on the market.</li>
            <li> The best hard wax I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Very nice hard wax. Simply warm it up in the wax warmer until it gets to be a caramel thickness to it (we do not go with full liquid because OUCH, it&#x27;s hot!). We also use with the Pre-Epilation Oil before the wax and the cooling gel afterward. I recommend getting the full Gigi Brazilian Waxing Kit and watching the video (warning - you do see some nakedness as they are doing a &amp;#34;brazilian&amp;#34; wax in it). Anyway, don&#x27;t let it overharden before removing - should still be pliable. Simply list a corner and PULL. We use this on my husband to remove a patch of very coarse back hair that irritates him (rubs and catches on his shirts). Still have to pluck a few with tweezers, but this stuff makes my job easier when helping him.</li>
            <li> Works great , feels amazing , grabs every single hair. Don&#x27;t put thick coat or let it dry too much ...you will bleed !</li>
            <li> I would not waste your money with this brand. Try cirepil or lycon or something, especially if you are not a professional.</li>
            <li> Very very messy! This wax is obnoxiously sticky and will ruin most things if it happens to drip on it. It will definitely pull your hair off but it&#x27;s just to messy for my liking.</li>
            <li> This wax is amazing. Sticks to the hair but not the skin. My only problem is getting the temperature control just right.</li>
            <li> I have awfully awful coarse, hard to remove hair! I have tried Nars, Veet, Sally Hansen probably EVERY kind of wax possible! Nothing removes the hair like this one! It is very painful so maybe have a close friend pull it off but you have the guts to pull it then go for it! it removes all the hair with no problem other than the pain! Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  When you use the pre-epilation oil, there is hardly any pain at all.  The hard wax (unlike strip wax) only sticks to the hair, not the skin.  So you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re ripping the flesh off your body when waxing.  I use this on my underarms (no pain whatsoever) and my bikini line (very little pain, especially compared to strip wax).</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews . Most of them say it&#x27;s a good product I tries everything they said but the wax stick to my skin and wont come off</li>
            <li> This wax is waayyyyyyy better than the conventional wax that you have to use with strips. So easy to use. Just put on an even layer, let it harden for about a minute, and pull off. So much LESS pain as well. Love it! Never going to have to sit and cut strips again!</li>
            <li> Its very messy but does job effectively. I am newbie so took time for this. If its thin it will break so I applied thick layer of it. I mainly do Armpit and upper lips with this. I personally feel that for upper lips sugar wax is best as they pain less but for armpit this is great.</li>
            <li> i love this body wax!</li>
            <li> When I ordered the GiGi hard wax kit, I had only had one professional brazilian wax done.  Having used the kit for self removal for the first time, I can really say that I am happy about it.  It took me longer than it does at the spa, but if you include travel time, it is less.  Plus I save 35-40 per treatment so I can&#x27;t complian.  I am also very squeamish and a big baby, but I can deal with the pain.  The key is to move quiclky and \\&quot;get er done\\&quot;!!  When I had it done at the spa, it hurt more, and I took two ibuprofin before I went.  I forgot to take it at home so that may be even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I realize though is that we are all different and just because I can endure it and the pain (which really is a big thing for me), I cna&#x27;t say what another&#x27;s experieince will be.  I did a fairly comprehensive job and withnesed long hairs extracted even though they didn&#x27;t seem that long at upon application.  I guess it was the roots.  I am looking forward to the hair thinning and having more time in waxes.</li>
            <li> Seriously love this stuff! So much better then soft wax.</li>
            <li> Works as it should, just wish it wasnt so painful waxing bikini area.  Ouch...  Wish it wasnt so messy to remove from hands...</li>
            <li> This wax is finicky, but boy, does it stick to hair.  Even stray hairs that get left behind are usually removable with just your fingers--no tweezers necessary!  I got perfect results the first time I used it, and things have only gotten better with practice.    Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned.   First, use lots of oil (and I mean LOTS) before letting that wax touch your skin.  Better too much than too little, because you can always rub some off if you need to. Don&#x27;t worry--the oil won&#x27;t keep the wax from sticking to your hair, but it will keep you from losing two layers of epidermis. Second, the wax should be just barely melted. It works best when it&#x27;s on the thick side. This wax has a really narrow window between being too soft to remove and being hard and crumbly--it may take a few tries before you get the knack.     If it feels warm or drips and runs, it&#x27;s too hot and you&#x27;ll have a hard time peeling it off in one go.  To keep it at the right temp, go between Low and Off on your heater while you&#x27;re using it. (To get it to the right temp, leave the lid off while you&#x27;re warming it, and stir frequently to test it.  You want it to be about as thick as cold honey).    Given how tricky this is to use, you might wonder whether it&#x27;s really suitable for DIYers. I&#x27;d still recommend it to waxing virgins, and here&#x27;s why: as long as you use the oil, you are going to get perfectly smooth skin* using this. It doesn&#x27;t really matter whether you hit the window of pliability or not.  It&#x27;s more comfortable and faster if you do, but the hair will be gone regardless.     *Anywhere but on your legs.  It&#x27;s not impossible to use it on your legs, but you can&#x27;t do a big area at a time, so it takes forever.</li>
            <li> Great and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> always works well with the warmer kit I bought on Amazon for GiGi brand.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. I tried Depileve brand and hated it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let it get completely brittle before you pull and your skin will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Wait just until it&#x27;s firm enough to pull.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason it makes it almost non-irritating.</li>
            <li> does not pull hair...more feel of thick candle wax on body</li>
            <li> This wax is perfect for underarms and facial waxing at home, for busy people like me who do not have a lot of time to waste in salons. You can wax yourself any time you want.</li>
            <li> Have not actually used this one yet. The waxing kit came with one. And since i only use it for eyebrows its going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!! First time I used it I had difficulty taking it off because I applied to thin of a layer. But I got the hang of it now I&#x27;m good to go. It grabs on to the hairs really good and when you pull it all gone. :-) I recommend this product 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> I am from Brazil (where we do wax all year long all, different parts of the body). It is great for legs, bikini, Brazilian wax bikini, etc. A little hard for the face, but it does a great job removing the hair.</li>
            <li> This wax is pretty good. Smells fine. Towards the end it gets messy.</li>
            <li> If I could give this less than one star, I would.  This is supposed to be &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; wax - the kind that you use without strips.  Well, in reality what it is is a sticky miserable gummy mess.  You could seriously do better removing hair with chewed up bubble gum.  I&#x27;ve been waxing for many years and always used the blue hard wax - figured I&#x27;d try this to save a few bucks.  Lesson learned, never again!</li>
            <li> great for Brazilian... goes on cool, sets up quickly</li>
            <li> wax is not that great .Getting hard quickly and leaves residue.</li>
            <li> I bbought this product because of all the great reviews and I wanted to start doing my own wax at home.  I bought the whole brazalian kit which was a great buy. I gave my self a bikini wax and it came out really great, soft and smooth and was very proud of myself. However, about a week later when the hair started growing back I broke out in bumps epecially around the creases which never happened to me before. It was very uncomfortable an itchy. Since this has not happened before I have to blame the wax. I saw that my previous salon uses European hard wax so I will try that next time. good Luck</li>
            <li> I have used this wax with gigi wax warmer on my under arm without wax stripp. It leaves few tiny hair . I would buy wax strip and try it next time. I like Gigi wax heater. It provides perfect warm and it didn&#x27;t burn my skin . I am glad to purchased both the items( Gigi wax and Gigi wax heater).</li>
            <li> Not an accurate description. There was nothing hard about it. It was a sticky, gooey mess. I dumped it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I am new to home waxing, but I really like this brand. It does a great job of grabbing the root of the hairs. I use this with the GiGi brand pre oil and post cooling gel. I find my skin stays less red afterwards when using these products. I also own the cirepil blue wax and have found that the GiGi brand is less messy/stringy than the blue wax and also does a much better job of grabbing the hairs by the root. I find myself having to wax less often when using this wax in comparison to the blue wax. With a great price I will continue using this brand.</li>
            <li> I was disapointed with the body wax that they sell here. But this is very good!</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to hard wax for waxing my nostrils. He bought this and brought it over, promising to change the way I experience nose breathing. It exceeded his promises! It hurts way less than I expected. I quickly ordered my own jar (as my wife already had the warming pot).</li>
            <li> This hard wax does not hurt like the soft wax. It only sticks to the hair and not to skin.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this wax for at-home waxing to save some money. I also purchased the Gigi wax warmer separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly it&#x27;s a good wax, which is why I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars, but for some advice to anyone purchasing it, go on YouTube and watch videos on how to apply and use hard wax. It&#x27;s really important you know the temperature and consistancy to heat the wax to so you don&#x27;t burn yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a difficult technique to master. At first there are little pieces of wax left on your skin, but you&#x27;ll soon find that you get better at it. Usually if that happens it&#x27;s user error, not any fault of the wax!</li>
            <li> Can not find this size product in my drugstore any more. The market place has gone to small containers, micowaveable. This is a large quantity and will last for some time. I bought the warmer as well, which works well. The product is fine, and captures the small hairs. Be sure to let it heat so it is hot enough to catch the small hairs.</li>
            <li> Do not use this product on your legs. It takes too long to wait until it dries to peel it off. Use it on small areas. I think you should practice on your legs first, just a couple of strips, so you get the feeling on how to use it. Don&#x27;t let it dry completely, because when you strip it off it will just crack off like plastic and it hurts bad. If this happens (like it did to me) get a hair dryer and use it to heat the wax up on your leg again, so the wax can become flexible to peel it off properly. I liked this product a lot!</li>
            <li> Not what I received. Not even the same brand ...</li>
            <li> LOVE this wax. I use it for legs, underarms and bikini area and will never use any other.&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that it kind of smells like sap, and sometimes you do get bits sticking, (though this is easily resolved with the gigi prewax oil) but it doe&#x27;s a great job.&lt;br /&gt;One tin will last me two months, I just did my bikini, underarms and legs and only used an eighth of the tin.&lt;br /&gt;The trick to making this less painful is to take an aspirin an hour before, hold a warm wet wash cloth over the area your going to wax for several minutes (this opens up the follicle) and  use the prewax oil, it really keeps it from tearing at your skin, and it&#x27;s really inexpensive (if you buy the warmer it comes with a  thing of it).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this wax is the bomb and probably the best stuff out there. Once you get the hang of it, it makes waxing a breeze</li>
            <li> This wax is seriously the best I&#x27;ve ever tried! Works great takes 99.9 of hairs even the thicker ones. I wouldn&#x27;t try anything else.. I leave it on high for 45 mins n then on low for 15 I set a towel on the floor lay down n start waxing, it used to take me an hour at first but now I get it done in 40 mins. I know it hurts a lot at first but it gets easier don&#x27;t give up!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay the $70 or more that area salons are charging for bikini waxes, so I decided to DIY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the warmer in a deal at a local store, then ordered this wax as it was the one they used at my salon that worked well on tough hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on my arm pits...and I love it! I used to shave this area every 2-3 days. I&#x27;ve had to wax about once every 2 weeks to get rid of regrowth. So much easier than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax is especially handy for doing at home bikini waxes. It will get rid of difficult, tough hair no problem. I tried it on lighter hair on my legs, sometimes it leaves the hair behind. I&#x27;m going to pick up some Honey wax and cloth strips for my legs. The hard wax too expensive and time consuming for leg hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: I&#x27;ve learned that you need to keep the wax at a heavy honey consistency. Heat for 20 minutes on high, then turn it on low. Keep turning it off and low to maintain the heavy honey texture. Use baby powder before applying the wax. The biggest trick is apply in very small sections. One other reviewer said to go and get professionally waxed and then use this product to maintain the wax. It&#x27;s not a bad idea. Make sure to cut the hair down to 1/2 inch. Too long and it hurts more, and it&#x27;s messier.</li>
            <li> Best Hard Wax I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> This worked pretty well, but leaves a sticky mess on the skin. It does remove hair very well. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my underarms because of the stick-factor... but it did work well on my legs and bikini line. However, I had little sticky pieces of wax on my skin for days after. I&#x27;m sure it would have come off if I spent some time with oil or a scrubber, but I don&#x27;t like to spend extra time which is why I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. So far MOOM is the best natural wax that I&#x27;ve come by and cleans up well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast, love this product  easy to use</li>
            <li> my wife loves this wax. used along with the gigi warmer she is able to do any touch up work at home in between salon visits, which saves us both time and money. Especially since we live in a rural community, and her favorite salon is hours away.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper and more convenient than go to the wax salon. But I haven&#x27;t used it for long. Need to wait and see the long-term effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product its great for the legs and bikini area! Doesn&#x27;t hurt bad at all would definitely recomend l, especially for the bikini area!</li>
            <li> Love this wax.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time. This was ordered as an extra for my waxing kit, so I have not used it yet. However, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Works the same as I was buying from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store but cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have tried the hard wax and honey wax. The hard wax is MUCH easier to use. You don&#x27;t need strips. I do recommend using the pre waxing oil liberally as this is hard to clean up</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I didn&#x27;t put anything on my legs. I couldn&#x27;t get the little pieces of wax off ouch! The second time around I used some e.v.o.o. and it was like butter! I have acrylic nails the first time I thought the wax ruined it. I kept taking the gloves off. Second time around using the oil I was able to keep the gloves on the entire time. The kit I purchased came with regular wax and strips. After two strips I was done didn&#x27;t like that stuff. I&#x27;m sticking with this!</li>
            <li> Its easy to melt n use and has good results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work so well for me. It doesn&#x27;t get all the hair when I wax...</li>
            <li> I tested other hard wax before... and this works fine... but is not consistent enough! it takes more time to get hard enough to pull of! still does get the hair off...</li>
            <li> I have been waxing for several years using Wax-cellence.  I tried this product for a bikini line.  The hair re-grows very quickly and , for the first time, I had ingrown hairs and bumps. This product also leaves the skin very sticky.  The stickiness does not wash off with soap and water.  I have thrown this product away and returned to Wax-cellence, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has used this brand of hard wax for years. She really testifies to its quality and peel. I can testify, too. It makes for a smooth wax, with very little of the rashy aftermath. My girlfriend also has sensitive skin, so that says something.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use. The best wax for bikini line and brazilian</li>
            <li> Best body wax ever. content count is awesome, too.</li>
            <li> Easy to use in the Gigi Brazilian waxing kit. Perfectly removed unwanted hair. Fits just right in the hot wax warmer.</li>
            <li> It gets hard too quickly and i don&#x27;t like that. plus it leaves residue. maybe because I&#x27;m not a professional but i really don&#x27;t like it. it is very chunky too as far as removal because it gets really hard and very quickly so it doesn&#x27;t come off smoothly.</li>
            <li> Fed up with constant shaving, I decided to indulge in some wax. It makes sense, put in a little time for your hair maintenance, and reap the benefits for two glorious weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax mostly just rips my hair, it doesn&#x27;t rip it out. I can&#x27;t figure out why; I have ample hair stubble before starting, I warm it, wait for the right consistency, turn it down, spread it on in the direction of the hair growth, wait for it to be pliable and let &#x27;er rip. I even exfoliate constantly in the interim to decreases ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it doesn&#x27;t rip it off, it often doesn&#x27;t rip anything at all. I&#x27;ll go back for seconds (sometimes three or four passes) because I don&#x27;t expect it to get it all in one fell swoop, and some spots are just super stubborn and refuse to come clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not all bad and sometimes I&#x27;ll get some really nice patches that stay nice for two weeks. But for all the time I&#x27;m putting in, it&#x27;s getting harder to convince myself it&#x27;s worth it. I will say though that I haven&#x27;t been waxing too long and the hair already seems sparser, which is lovely. I guess when it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s on and when it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> I have finally mastered the art of waxing with strips and decided to try the hard wax because of the positive reviews. This is a great product if you only wax small areas, like eyebrows or lips. However, for legs, it takes forever because you can only wax a small area at once. If you do too large of an area, the wax breaks apart and it&#x27;s horrible getting the tiny pieces off. Also, you have to be extremely diligent to get the same thickness each time you put the wax on, otherwise part will rip off and part will stay on your skin. I don&#x27;t have time or skill for this. Back to my strips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to work with but just breaks the hair off.  It doesn&#x27;t pluck the hair out.  Frustrating to have the removal be a breaking of the hair instead of real removal.</li>
            <li> First time using this product, just at home with the Gigi warmer. Worked better than any other waxing product I&#x27;ve tried. You do not need muslin strips to press on top of it--you just spread the wax on in a little area, let it cool until it&#x27;s not gooey anymore, and slowly peel it off in opposite direction of hair growth. Doing it slower helped me not break hairs, and it hurt waaaaaay less than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!  I just used a plastic disposable butter knife to spread it on and it worked fine. If you let it dry to long it turns brittle and will just break off in little pieces instead of pulling off as a strip. If you spread it too thin it gets brittle really fast. Wait time that worked for me was about a minute to a minute and a half.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, gets down to the roots and easy to apply. The wax dries fairly quickly so u don&#x27;t have to wait a long time, also remains solid when u pull it and doesn&#x27;t tear. Very Contnent</li>
            <li> The great thing about Hard Wax is that you don&#x27;t need strips and it only sticks to the hair.  This makes the removal process more effective and less painful since it doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to using hard wax is not overheating it.  It should have the consistency of honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would recommend to start on medium heat in the warmer occasionally testing the consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having it too hot makes it runny hence making the application and removal process impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it get too runny, turn it off and wait for the heat to go down.</li>
            <li> Being completely new to wax i found this fairly easy to use. I used the double can on the stove method to heat up. Never seemed to get hot enough to burn even when fully melted so confused why other people complain about this. One can &#x3D; two body waxes. What a great savings over pro. worked on legs, bikini, and face! (very different hair types) Of course, steep learning curve. I will be buying the auto heater to save time  vs  heating on stove-- but it is possible to do on stovetop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, I LOVE this stuff. I will never use another wax/creme. You can use the wax over and over, I&#x27;ve gotten at least 5 leg waxes and I don&#x27;t see why i can&#x27;t get another 5 from it! Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;m a wuss...it doesn&#x27;t hurt...on your legs. Face, bikini, armpits...that&#x27;s a whole other \\&quot;ball of wax\\&quot; (pun intended:) I have had it completely melted and instantly put it on my legs and it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> Excellent for use on bikini and underarms</li>
            <li> Gigi is a fine brand and I&#x27;ve used it many times over to wax myself as well as others. This seller sent me a dented container. When I applied the hard wax (something I&#x27;ve done dozens of times before) I waited up to 7 minutes (well over the usual 30 seconds) for it to harden, but it just stayed in a putty form that I had to scrape off my skin. I checked the directions, just to be sure what I was doing, and unlike all my other Gigi products, only the ingredients we listed in English, for only some of the products. The directions were in 3 other languages. (All other Gigi products contain ingredient lists and instructions in like 6 languages, for several waxes). This led me to believe that this was some brand counterfeiting. After checking the seller&#x27;s instructions, I&#x27;m sure of it, as they (dangerously) blend instructions from different products. My usual 45 minute wax has taken 3 hours with terrible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy from this seller. At best you&#x27;re going to end up with a painful, goopy mess. At worst, serious injury to sensitive parts of the body which hard wax is meant for.</li>
            <li> This does the job. Like this and will get more when I need it. Looks like it will last a long time .</li>
            <li> Perfect. I always use this hard wax for my Brazilian bikini waxes at home</li>
            <li> This wax works wonders. I&#x27;m black American so I have very coarse hair, and it got every single hair on my bikini area. I do full brazilians and it is super safe for my sensitive parts. I even dropped some on my carpet by mistake. I just waited for it to dry, and it peeled right off the carpet. It&#x27;s great ! Way better than satin smooth hard waxes.</li>
            <li> For me works perfect, I love it. Once you learn how to use it, you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with hard wax when I purchased an expensive blue one from ulta that comes in a microwaveable cup.  The microwaving was annoying so I decided to buy a warmer and went with this &amp;#34;hard wax&amp;#34; because of the reviews-  this does not shrink wrap your hair like the fancy blue stuff-  its sticky and takes forever to take off.  I will never buy this again-  it was such a waste of money</li>
            <li> This is GARBAGE. Pure and simple garbage. I&#x27;m a hairy guy and and attempted to wax my back and this stuff horrible. It dried so quickly and deeply that it pulled off skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve resorted to hot wash cloths and the BS wax remover from this bad company...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not working. Help.</li>
            <li> I really like this hard wax a lot, I use it for everything from bikini waxing to my cleaning up my brows.  Gets all of the hair off well every time, this is the third jar of hard wax I&#x27;ve purchased from GiGi, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> It hardens way to fast and doesn&#x27;t rip off great</li>
            <li> I really like it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s hard not to compare it with my favorite wax, which unfortunately isn&#x27;t sold here in the US. I&#x27;m Brazilian, and back home we have a microwavable Veet formula that&#x27;s just perfect. The problem with GiGi, for me, is that it&#x27;s a little too sticky for my taste, comparing to my favorite one. That being said, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried here in the US, and it&#x27;s very easy to use, once you got the hang of it. I bought the kit with the warmer and the oils, and I&#x27;m really pleased with it. It takes some time to get used to the right temperature, but once you get it, it&#x27;s not difficult at all. I have a high pain threshold, and I&#x27;m used to waxing in salons and at home, so maybe I&#x27;m biased in favor of it.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that a lot of people commented, and I definitely agree, is that you HAVE to use the oil, prior to putting the wax on your skin. At first, I tried without it (like I used to do, with the waxes back in Brazil, and they work just fine that way). Boy, was I in for a rude awakening! It was so painful to get that wax of my armpit, without the oil, it really, really hurt (that&#x27;s why I say it&#x27;s sticky). But once you use the oil, it&#x27;s a breeze, and the results are really good.</li>
            <li> Returned, cause I got a totally different item Andrea Brazilian hard wax fir the bikini, Also, the product we received had a label with barcode and description referring to the product I bought. A real SCAM!</li>
            <li> Amazing wax! Buy waxing strips so much easier!</li>
            <li> Most salons I go into have this wax and a GiGi warmer - you can do it at home and save so much money.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use! It took a little getting used to since this was my first time waxing, but really very easy.</li>
            <li> I bought this wax a month ago because I was tired of making my own sugar wax and having to use strips. You do NOT need strips to use this wax.I bought mine from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for around $11.99. I totally forgot to grab a warmer and wood sticks(or popsicle sticks) which you are definitely going to need. I tried warming it in a pot on a stove so that I could transfer it into a microwavable container (Sally&#x27;s is over an hour away from me..don&#x27;t judge), which worked except that the wax cools down extremely quickly. I would have to reheat it constantly just to wax a tiny area.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this wax is the smell. It smells like....pine cones or tree sap. I wish I could have something else to compare it to but I don&#x27;t. Ordered the warmer and it&#x27;s been heaven ever since!</li>
            <li> Works great for bikini waxing, but if you want to use it on your legs or arms, I would suggest using sugar-based soft wax (to be used with strips). This one would still work okay, but is hard work and takes longer time. I am pleased with the purchase and will definitely buy again. Some suggestions for the beginners: spread a large [old] bed sheet on the floor, have a mirror handy, wear examination gloves (unless you don&#x27;t care for your fingernails), sit on the floor and lean against the wall. The above setting will help you accomplish the task more efficiently, faster and with a minimum mess.</li>
            <li> Its good, but expensive. I think we cn have cheaper qualities available. I will like to switch to them. As such I like the way it works...but yeah its expensive and a lot of work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been getting Brazilian waxes for almost two years before I moved away from my favorite salon (European Wax Center go check it out, Brazilians for around 30 bucks!) and just couldn&#x27;t afford to fork over over 55 bucks a month on waxing. The salon I went to used hard wax so I thought I&#x27;d give this stuff a try. I LOVED it! It works great at removing coarse hair and worked pretty good at eyebrows but hurt a little bit more than strip wax. Recommendations when using it: make sure it&#x27;s about the consistency of honey, any thinner and it doesn&#x27;t work as well, and lay it on THICK especially at the top of the strip where you are going to start your pull. For any waxing first-timers out there apply wax in the direction of hair growth and pull off in the opposite direction. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> So far so good it does a good job as in waxing, will continue to test</li>
            <li> Gets the job done without peeling off skin.</li>
            <li> this is beautiful magic ladys and no need foor strips works so well on my extra sensitive skin thxs gigi</li>
            <li> Did the waxing myself for the first time using this wax and it works amazing! I would recommend this to anyone. Getting ready to order more</li>
            <li> Great wax! Make sure you have some hair to pull out first tho, otherwise, you&#x27;ll be wasting your time.</li>
            <li> Basic, best product! It does the job just perfectly.</li>
            <li> GiGi is equal to the best hard wax that I have used.  GiGi is priced better than most hard waxes.  If you are a hard waxer, you must try GiGi hard wax.</li>
            <li> Maybe since I&#x27;m not super experienced with hard wax but did more pain then removal of hair. I prefer the dark honey wax that&#x27;s used with the stripes.</li>
            <li> Fifty percent of my clients get Brazilians (the other 50% are massage) and it is the most consistent among my clients.</li>
            <li> works great, wonderful stripless wax</li>
            <li> Has a very slight but not unpleasant medicinal smell when heated. Did not irritate my skin. Removes hair very well and heats fairly quickly, very convenient for touch ups.</li>
            <li> WORKS SO WELL!! I can&#x27;t believe how affordable this is compared to going to a salon, and in my opinion it works BETTER! I had virtually NO pain with this wax where I would feel pain at a salon. Maybe that&#x27;s just me, but I am beyond happy with this purchase and have already recommended it to friends!</li>
            <li> I have never gone to a salon to get a brazilian, never waxed anywhere ever, and only started plucking my eyebrows recently in the last few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said... let me tell you my first experience with this wax and of waxing period.&lt;br /&gt;First off, this wax was so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had on my first try was that I was a bit of a coward.  So the problem was me and not the wax.  They say mind over matter... that didn&#x27;t stick for me and i was hurting more because I was pulling slow.  I know i was hurting more because of my slowness because later when i took a deep breath and pulled fast, i only felt a sting and not the pain I was feeling from pulling slowly.&lt;br /&gt;I thought this wax wouldn&#x27;t be able to get my hair because I have never had it plucked or waxed before and thought it may be too coarse but boy was i wrong.  This wax held onto all of it and pulled it out really good.  Actually, too good.  I think over 50% pulled out by this wax was pulled completely out with all of its roots and caused slight bleeding in those but not excessively, actually it was at most a tiny drop the size of the tip of a pencil.  The other 50% had roots too but not the whole root so no bleeding there at all.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and on the very first wax, i forgot to use the gigi&#x27;s pre-epilation powder that is supposed to help the wax not stick to the skin.  I was really scared after realizing that but it was unnessary.&lt;br /&gt;If any of the wax did stick to my skin, it was where the wax was the thinnest.  I know some say it was hard to get off but for me i just used my nails and scrapped it off easily.  And if there were any left after that, it all came off after i showered and scrubbed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time took me almost 3 hours... and my arm and neck hurt more than the area that was waxed.&lt;br /&gt;There was no lasting pain with the brazilian and I would do this again and with this same wax.</li>
            <li> Wax works great but it is not for me...waxing those private areas is extremely painful. I think I stick with waxing eyebrows.</li>
            <li> it is supposed to come off easily and it really doenst get hard enough to pull off quickly with one big pull. leaves residue more than i planned.</li>
            <li> Bought this and the starter kit with warmer device, wooden spatulas, and lotions in order to save on Brazilian waxing. Yes, it takes me a lot longer than the 30 minutes at the salon, but if your priority is to save money, like $80 per Brazilian, then this wax is the way to go! The first time, it took me 3-4 hours, yikes. It hurts only a little more than the salon, but only because you have to apply and yank off so many times. It takes so darn long when you can hardly see what you&#x27;re doing, even with mirrors propped at all sorts of angles. After a few times, I got it down to 1.5 hours, not too shabby. Sometimes I can do a little over 1 hour. One can lasts about three Brazilian waxes for me. At one Brazilian a month, I usually buy about three to four cans a year. If you have the time, home Brazilians are a great bargain with this wax.</li>
            <li> Didnt like the product. I will stick with reg wax</li>
            <li> Best product ever! This was my first time using hard wax and it was a learning curve. I read the reviews of people complaining that it was too hard to remove after it was dry. I had no issues since I didnt let it be fully dry, just let it air out a bit and then puff. I would advise to use soft wax in larger areas like legs, arm pits and bikini and use hard wax for small or hard to access areas such as Brazilian, eyebrows, and face in general.</li>
            <li> my coochie is quite smooth, im happy, my boyfriend&#x27;s happy, his chin and balls are happy! what more can a girl ask for?</li>
            <li> My wife loves this wax.  This is the second time ordering it; she uses it for her bikini area and it works perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for almost a year with GiGi products (sensitive wax), and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it actually I loved how smooth my legs feels after waxing. I tried switching to hard wax and for me it didn&#x27;t work, you really need to know the technique of hard wax before using it. Luckily I only applied to a small area and I was able to remove it - it took me several minutes to remove the wax. That being said, I&#x27;m going to return the hard wax and exchange it with the sensitive - since I already know the technique.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Waxing isn&#x27;t fun but this product works very well and is easy to use. Their wax warmer is great to Go with this and works very well to heat this up.</li>
            <li> I bought this wax instead of my usual Surgi Brazilian wax kit because I noticed that you get triple the product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I should note, I DO NOT have the GiGi wax warmer. I figured I would just buy the wax and heat it in the stove in a pot if hot water- which by the way works perfectly. No need to buy the GiGi wax warmer if you are trying to save some money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax is by far superior to any other hard wax I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is perfect, and easy to remove from counter-tops and skin if some of the wax strays.&lt;br /&gt;I used this wax with cloth strips that I cut myself, but it works fine without the cloth as well. Using it with strips brought my (full Brazilian) waxing time from 60 minutes down to 20 minutes flat!&lt;br /&gt;This wax is also less painful than many of the other waxes I have used on my pubic region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;-Apply a tiny amount of olive oil to the area to be waxed to minimize sticking and discomfort&lt;br /&gt;-Use cloth strips to cut down on waxing time by waxing larger areas</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have the pot warmer, than heat it up in a small aluminum pot with water on a stove. (medium heat for  40 min). Prep the skin extremely important! 2 days before lightly exfoliate. Moisturize VERY WELL every day. Waxing day, put baby oil on skin, let dry, then apply hard wax (test on finger tip) and put it on fast. (If you let it cool too long it will not work).&lt;br /&gt;  The wax adheres to the hair ONLY! Pull it off after 10 seconds with either the stick or the side--IT WORKS! The hair is pulled out of the follicle! Doesn&#x27;t pull skin! IT DOESN&#x27;T PULL SKIN! AMAZING. The skin will turn slightly pink just apply a calming lotion and all will be well.&lt;br /&gt;  I tried this on coarse hair. Some strays but got 80% of them. I&#x27;m pleased and can&#x27;t wait till the next session. Little by little the hair will get finer. (Stomach hair).</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is very easy to use and also make sure you have the right texture so you won&#x27;t make a big mess.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I was so scared to buy it since i have been suffering from wax problems for a long time.. but not anymore!!! It is so soft and easy to warm and use. I used it on my face, my arms and legs and it worked perfectly! I would recommend it for everybody like me ;)</li>
            <li> Used it to wax my chest, It turned out to be a great product even for a novice like myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the quality is good...but I don&#x27;t know how to use it very well, so I&#x27;m not gonna buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this wax. I keep reordering it over and over, although I do like all purpose hard wax as well. It takes the hair off from different areas of the body pretty much every time. If not, you can just reapply it as many times as you need to, if hair is super stubborn you can just grab the tweezers and get the hair yourself with no effort. Super easy to tweeze if wax didn&#x27;t take care of that one or two hairs. This is my 5th or 6th jar of this particular wax. Make sure that you use pre-epilation oil prior to waxing.</li>
            <li> Good wax for home use, but way surpassed by Cirepil Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax is more brittle, speads less well, holds hair less well, leaves more residue, removes less hair and is less comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went through two tins of this wax before switching to the Cirepil and will not be switching back.</li>
            <li> Well, this is going to be a long one filled with info so you don&#x27;t hate your life afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I did it, that was me. There is a learning curve and it doesn&#x27;t matter how many reviews you read, everything is hard to remember when you&#x27;ve accidentally globbed on a chunk of wax on your armpit and you stalled just long enough or haven&#x27;t gotten it warm enough and it dries and gets hard. That was really freaking painful.&lt;br /&gt;So my tips in bullet points:&lt;br /&gt;*a lot of people suggest watching videos. Probably a good idea. Based on my first experience with doing this on my own, I probably should have done that. But obviously, since I had been to a spa once and gotten it done, I was a professional. This is very false. Don&#x27;t assume that you can just man up and do it. You might can, but it is a lot harder when it comes down to it.&lt;br /&gt;*It hurts like a bitch. You&#x27;re not a sissy for popping a few Advil 30 minutes before. Do it.&lt;br /&gt;*Even though it by no means makes you a professional, go out to a salon and get one done so you kind of know what to do and what your pain tolerance is going to be.&lt;br /&gt;*Shell out the extra twenty bucks to get the kit. I cannot imagine how difficult it would be without the warmer.&lt;br /&gt;*Make sure wax is warm enough but not too hot. Someone suggested getting it melted and then putting it between off and medium. Excellent advice. It takes AGES to melt the first time, so don&#x27;t think your warmer is rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;*Before you start, make sure you have baby powder, coconut oil (or the oil in the kit) and scissors handy. Baby powder is in case you get sweaty and clammy. Dries the skin before you put the oil on. I&#x27;m in love with coconut oil and it did an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;*DON&#x27;T FORGET TO OIL!! Seriously. Put it all over everywhere you&#x27;re going to do before you start just in case you forget between times. Let me tell you, waxing is a zillion times more painful when it takes your skin with it. And there is such a thing as under oiling. If you overdo it, wait like thirty seconds and you&#x27;re fine.&lt;br /&gt;*If you&#x27;re sporting a forest down there, cut it first. 1/4 of an inch seems to the the rule of thumb. This part is as important as oiling.&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t spread it on too thickly. It gets chunky and hardens faster and you&#x27;re stuck with blobs of wax in your netheryayah. Not fun.&lt;br /&gt;*Start on your legs. Get it right on your legs first, and know you&#x27;re going to mess up on your lady parts anyway. It is just a matter of of how many times you mess up.&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve said it before, but, don&#x27;t forget the oil.&lt;br /&gt;*Once you feel as though you have graduated from your legs go to a practice strip on your armpits. This is as painful as your upcoming bikini, so it is a good test to see if your Advil has kicked in yet. But to be fair, there isn&#x27;t really enough Advil to make it not hurt at least a little.&lt;br /&gt;*Start small and start thin. You don&#x27;t want paper thin, but not too thick. This is where your first learning curve comes in.&lt;br /&gt;*Once you have done a strip or two on your armpits, head downtown.&lt;br /&gt;*Start on the outsides and work your way in. For me, the \\&quot;landing strip\\&quot; was the most painful part to take off. This is really only a problem if you are doing the full Monty though.&lt;br /&gt;*When you move down towards your netherparts, get a mirror and sit on the floor back on the wall. If you can get gyno style with your back supported and your feet pushing on something, you&#x27;re going to be better off.&lt;br /&gt;*Be careful around the really sensitive areas and try not to double wax. Don&#x27;t freak out if you accidentally do, but try to avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t forget your oil.&lt;br /&gt;*The whole area gets really sensitive and it takes a long time when you first start, so if you find it getting unbearable, do your armpits or your legs or stomach or whatever for fifteen or twenty minutes and give it a little rest.&lt;br /&gt;*Look away when you pull and remember to pull the opposite direction of the hair growth. And don&#x27;t yank up. When yougo get your salon wax, carefully watch how they do it.&lt;br /&gt;*If you get clammy from the pain, the coconut oil does jack, so put some baby powder on for half a minute or so and then re-oil.&lt;br /&gt;*If you pansy out, you&#x27;ve just shot yourself in the foot. But if you do, those scissors you have handy find another use. If it gets really hard and crumbly and you simply can&#x27;t do it, you can sometimes pull it up enough to cut off the hairs and the wax. Just watch your skin. They make wax remover but I didn&#x27;t have any, and once it is on and solid, the oil doesn&#x27;t help you at all. Some people recommend baby oil, but I didn&#x27;t have it around for the infamous armpit of 2012 episode.&lt;br /&gt;All of that said, the stuff really is awesome. The bad reviews are user error. I refrained from writing a review after my first time because I figured I would try again before I made a judgement on the product. Glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;It still hurts, especially if you have sensitive skin like me, but it gets better!&lt;br /&gt;Oh! And also- if you get any bumps that come to a head, you&#x27;re not supposed to pop them, but I had a really big, itchy one that I accidentally scratched and it popped. Few hours later, a tiny shard of wax popped out with the tiniest speck of root. I assume it was a pore that had two and only one if them came out. So just FYI, if you get a big itchy whitehead, put some Neosporin and a band aid on it and let it soften and see when it does.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck! :)go get your salon wax, carefully watch how they do it.&lt;br /&gt;*If you get clammy from the pain, the coconut oil does jack, so put some baby powder on for half a minute or so and then re-oil.&lt;br /&gt;*If you pansy out, you&#x27;ve just shot yourself in the foot.

            <li> I cried while waxing and after at how beautiful my skin looked</li>
            <li> I am new to waxing, and decided that I was tired of shaving all the time. I am Puerta Rican, so I have very thick, coarse hair. This Christmas I looked into waxing options, and decided to buy a Gigi waxing kit. I bought the student kit that comes with the warmer, all purpose honee, spatulas/strips, and lotions. But I also decided to pick this hard body wax up in case I didn&#x27;t like the all purpose wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I bought this wax. At first I had trouble getting the consistency right, but having the warmer makes it easy to adjust the temperature. So far I have used it to wax my eyebrows, face, legs, and given myself a Brazilian wax. Waxing my eyebrows &amp; face was the easiest. I loved the result. I also had great results when I did my legs. But when waxing your legs with this it does take longer because you have to do small sections at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only trouble I had was when I did the Brazilian wax. But that is to be expected because I have not had a lot of experience waxing. At first I had trouble pulling the wax off. But when I used strips I had very little issues. I know that strips are for soft waxes but I have found that using them when bikini waxing makes the process much faster, I don&#x27;t get as much wax in my fingernails from pulling the strips, and it&#x27;s overall less frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product because it&#x27;s very easy to use. It gets the hairs and leaves you silky smooth. I also noticed that as long as I remembered to use baby oil before applying the wax I didn&#x27;t pull a lot of skin with it, and had very minimal bleeding. It also is very easy to clean up. I have not had any spills or issues with clean up.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to all of my family and friends, when I recieved the product I was shocked on how great this product it.</li>
            <li> Great bikini wax product! I started doing my own waxes after getting fed-up with paying $70+ for a patchy job... Bought a GiGi melting pot and this wax and have never regretted it! I get no reaction from the wax and I have sensitive skin. It heats up well, attached well to the hairs and comes off well, as long as you pre-treat the area with oil first. Still comes off skin well enough with warm water and soap if you don&#x27;t pre-treat with oil.</li>
            <li> very bad not easy to use</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great wax for sensitive areas</li>
            <li> Received an entirely different product. Really strange. Returned.</li>
            <li> Works great! Love not having to go to the salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li> I had no clue where to start for waxing, let alone doing a Brazilian. While researching i seen someone suggest this &amp; decided to try it &amp; it worked great. I&#x27;ve tried strips and seriously am surprised I even wanted to try waxing again after that trauma 😣 This wax is so easy to use I managed to wax everywhere I didn&#x27;t even plan on waxing! I use this on my upperlip, underarms and bikini. I tried it on my arms and legs, but it didn&#x27;t work out very well. It can get messy, as most wax is💁, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> Great wax for the do it yourself at home Brazilian waxer. Its the best wax ive worked with so far ive tried clean and easy but this works way better.</li>
            <li> Waxing can be painful and troublesome but worth it. This wax picks up hair well and lasts a good while, depending on climate, body hair texture, growth and re-growth. Some areas may need to be waxed more than once but be careful because the area will become more sensitive after the first wax. I do not recommend waxing any area on your face more than once ever, and for more sensitive people, this rule of thumb should apply to underarm and bikini area - do not wax more than once in one setting. Wait 3-7 days before attempting to wax the area again. Hard wax is able to be picked up by hand.</li>
            <li> I love this wax! It&#x27;s gentle on skin but adheres to hair really well. I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t get a lot of redness. A thinner application is best and gets rid of all unwanted hair!</li>
            <li> Perfect smoothness achieved at fraction of the price of spa/salon waxing.  I&#x27;ve done this twice now.  The first time was essentially a disaster, because I hadn&#x27;t read any of the tips from the reviews, and forgot to use the pre-epilation oil (no words can describe how important that step is.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even still, the first half of my first Brazilian attempt was actually easy and painless.  It was when I got to the denser areas that I really ran into trouble, which I think was also exacerbated by the fact that the wax had gotten too hot and thin in consistency by that time.  Anyway - I learned a lot, and went back and read through all the helpful review tips before I made a second attempt, which went wonderfully.  Overall, it took me about an hour and a half.  I&#x27;d to eventually get that down to the 30 minutes my esthetician could do it in.  But, I was also able to do the top halves of my legs in that time (got bored waiting on the thicker strips in denser areas to completely harden for removal.)  I think as time goes on, it will only get easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few tips - don&#x27;t forget your aspirin, have everything set up and prepared before getting started, don&#x27;t let your wax get too hot/thin, have some muslin nearby just for keeping your hands clean (it works amazingly for this), and as many others have said - do NOT forget the pre-epilation oil!  I also keep the after-wax cooling gel at hand to apply as I go to any areas that get particularly red.  Overall, this is totally worth the money, and completely diy doable.  I&#x27;m very, very happy with the product and with my experience.</li>
            <li> There is no other wax to use as far as I am concerned.  This is the easiest and the neatest wax to use.</li>
            <li> This wax is terrible. It comes off in chunks so I have to pick it off piece by piece. Which is tolerable for small areas like brows but absolutely not for armpits, bikini and larger surfaces like legs. I&#x27;m a cosmetologist so I&#x27;ve tried several waxes and this is the worst wax I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to paying close to 100$ to get full legs, bikini, and underarms done at a salon.  Granted, it takes me longer to wax myself, but I&#x27;m getting better.  This stuff is way less messy than wax that doesn&#x27;t harden (what a mess! you&#x27;re always sticky for days).  I love being able to just scrape it off a linoleum floor or peel it off of myself, if needed.  I also think it hurts less than using strips.  Some tips: pull the skin taught (especially on underarms) while you rip off the wax.  Use thinner strips on your legs and maybe do it with a friend (doing the back of your own legs is really hard).  Make sure the hair is long enough, even if it&#x27;s tempting to get rid of them as fast as possible.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price for the amount you get. I use hard wax for face hair removal and bikini areas. It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I was a first time waxer and I had no serious issues using this product.  The only thing I was a little surprised by was the bits of residue that were left on the skin after removing a patch of wax.  And you have to be very careful about drips and strands of wax getting on surfaces and fabric because it&#x27;s hard to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still I was very satisfied with the experience and plan to use again.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing my girlie bits for about 2 years now and this is my definite go to hard wax. Works great.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. Easy to use and works the way it should. Just as good as the spa!</li>
            <li> I love using the GiGi hard wax system! It works so well with minimal pain and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Wow, how horrible this stuff truly is. I cannot fully describe in words how I feel after LITERALLY just using this stuff, but it is absolutely horrible. Not only do you have to wait for it to dry, causing anticipation/apprehension, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t fully dry. You have to lay on a super thick layer, but even when it is super thick as you lay on this stuff, there can still be that ONE little hair left. REALLY?!?! I did this because I heard that although it is more painful, it is better than soft wax because it leaves your skin less irritated. I have been tired of shaving every 2-3 days. I used it on my left armpit and right leg. It is super time consuming, messy, and at times can rip off in pieces, even if you&#x27;ve had a thick layer! Not only that, my skin is SO irritated and red from having used this stuff, I can&#x27;t even believe it! Yes, my skin is softer because I just ripped out hair of their roots, but for the irritation I got in return? Not even worth it one bit. I had to shave ON TOP of the waxing because of the horrible job its done and now I am just SUPER IRRITATED. Don&#x27;t waste your time. I am NOW hearing that soft crème wax with strips are 1,000 times better than hard wax. I&#x27;m going to give it a shot because I&#x27;m truly done with shaving every 2-3 days and anything to help my hair eventually STOP growing or stunt it in any way is better any time.</li>
            <li> This wax is the most smooth that i have found. You get a cheap wax, and you got a big problem. You get rashes, and lets not even go there. This wax is good.</li>
            <li> great buy and much cheaper then at stores. it worked just as described and I suggest you give this wax a try, its economical and gets all the hair out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this but my partner does.  It looks like it would hurt really bad.  She seems to like it and she has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for chin and upper lips, underarms, legs, hands and brazilian. Possibly the best wax product for brazilian and under arms. With my chin and lips, the wax didn&#x27;t take off the very small hairs the last two times i tried it. But it works effectively (98%). Good for underarms, legs and hands too but as hard wax requires a slightly thick application, I think its best to go for soft wax for those. Otherwise you will easily exhaust your can in one sitting for all of the above. For me, I have noticed few ingrown hairs ( small hairs that curl on the surface) after waxing, but when I use soft wax I don&#x27;t get ingrowns. If you apply a thin layer or don&#x27;t pull the wax off for too long, the wax will break and leave a little residue which you can clean up using baby oil. Pre-epilation oil is good for reducing the pain ( Brazilian). Overall, definitely buy it if you are looking for hard wax/Brazilian.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this. I accidentally bought it thinking it would work on my legs. I used a pot with boiling water to melt the wax. Wax was easy to spread but hard to get off. None of the cloth strips/paper strips I owned work. On top of that  It was a pain to get it off. literally had to scrape the residue with. I will stick to basic sugar waxes. None of this plastic-like wax.</li>
            <li> The wax was what I was looking for and works how I need it to work, however I just feel like it&#x27;s a bit messy and takes a few minutes to dry in order to actually use it.  What I mean by that is it seems a bit runny instead of as thick as I would like it.  It has to cool a second on the stick so it doesn&#x27;t drip everywhere.  I normally put on some netflix, slap on the wax and sit there for a few minutes before torturing myself.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come off the skin quite as easily as I would like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely difficult for me to get the hang of using this, but when it works it works really well. I just need to get better at it.</li>
            <li> Really good product! I recommend!</li>
            <li> works much better than soft wax/wax strips. I wish I had known of this first. be very careful, place an old towel underneath the area you will be working in.</li>
            <li> my first waxing product, this wax gets very hard, still trying to figure out the optimal coolness when using strips to remove.</li>
            <li> The best wax for hair removal.  It works as stated.  Make sure it is thick enough on area where you want to remove.  If thin layer it really hurts to remove.  Have bought it twice and will again.</li>
            <li> It is extremely hard wax( like stone). Don&#x27;t try on your skin, it will rip off your skin. Both of my sisters did and it ripped our skin. We need to SUE THEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand where these good reviews are from...&lt;br /&gt;FAKE GOOD REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it and cheaper than Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is my first BAD experience with a GiGi product it&#x27;s just a mess, a big mess. Just throw your money into a garbage can instead of buying this product!! I order the GiGi wax kit after reading reviews there were many negative reviews, but there were enough positive reviews to make me buy it. I even bought a hard wax refill too. When I got it I used it. It took me 3 hours to wax my legs. But my 3 hours went to waste, because I didn&#x27;t get good results from the GiGi. It just was a mess, it was hard to remove it from my skin, in fact the wax tore all my wax strips it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t come off from skin:(  I used oil but it still didn&#x27;t work. This wasn&#x27;t a wax, glue would be the proper term, because it was so hard to remove!! Gigi&#x27;s Wax Warmer doesn&#x27;t warm, it probably took an extra hour to warm the wax, my toaster warms up faster and is more efficient then Gigi&#x27;s Wax Warmer!!</li>
            <li> I love the hard wax, the only think I don&#x27;t like is that it haas no smell.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other displeased reviews.  I made sure to prep the skin areas well, as I do with the soft wax, used powder, and everything, and it still took skin with it.  After my rather terrible experience with this, I resolved to get my more difficult waxing done professionally so I&#x27;d never have to deal with that again, and my now-regular Waxing Lady agreed, this is NOT something you use on someone you don&#x27;t want to suffer.</li>
            <li> I always have been a fan of gigi brazilian body hard wax, i absolutely love it</li>
            <li> I bought the set and enjoyed it. Didn&#x27;t have to remove any hair for a week. If interested in waxing, should by the kit and text it and the refill is great</li>
            <li> Clearly you need the heater for this but I love this wax! I wad never good at using the strips and going out is too expensive. I&#x27;ve tried stuff from cvs for the microwave but they took away the brand I liked and upped the prices of the others....I also bought one of the burners from there but it took forever to heat up and was never very hot once it was. I decided to look at brands online and found this one, I&#x27;ve ordered the heater kit and now three refills. Still goin strong and I&#x27;m still hairless. The wax is gentle enough for my bakini area but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s made for the most sensitive skins for that area.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hard wax. It&#x27;s the one I am used to using. I also just started the blue hard wax which is also great but I can&#x27;t stand the smell. I easy to use and comes off easily. If you use the prewax oil.</li>
            <li> I have used this wax for many years. I do my own waxing, because it gets expensive to have a professional do it. I have used it all over my body. Any body part that has hair, I have used it on. I have very sensitive skin and bad allergies. I can say that this has not caused any allergic reaction. I also use a lidocaine spray that decreases the pain with sensitive areas. I like that you do not have to use strips to take it off.  You put it on let it cool down, and pull with your fingers. You have less of a mess and you save money. Eventually, I want to try laser removal, but for now I will stick with this wax.</li>
            <li> Nice wax.  I use a pot and pan with water on the stove to melt, instead of buying the wax warmer.  It works well and is exactly what I was looking for.  It is nice to not have to use the strips.</li>
            <li> This wax was ok, and this noted for professional use only, but I bought it anyways. This wax gets the job done, but took forever to melt and was super messy. I prefer something like Nad&#x27;s or something usually and plan to go that way, leave this wax to the professionals, because I for one didn&#x27;t like using it myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never &amp;#34;waxed&amp;#34; before so I can&#x27;t compare this to any other product or procedure (whether personally or professionally) used.  For me, I am totally sold on waxing after shaving for the past 30+years!  This was not an easy process the first use and took some effort and trial/error to get it down but by the end of the first session, I was sold.  This wax works well for me, (I bought the full kit originally) and I&#x27;ve no complaints.</li>
            <li> Item is as described this purticular brazilian wax can be painful I use powder to protect my skin. Overall it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love this wax.  It is the only kind I use at home.  I used to use the microwaveable Gigi Honee wax, but one day I came across a YouTube video about the Gigi Hard Wax.  I bought my first pot from a beauty supply store, and then thought to check Amazon and found that it was literally half the price... Needless to say, I always purchase it here on Amazon.  The price seems to fluctuate by a few dollars, but it is still much cheaper than I have seen it in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with the Gigi wax warmer and love it.  The warmer is good for regulating the temperature, and if I find that it has gotten too hot/cold, I just adjust the setting (low, medium, high) and wait a few minutes.  The wax does have a slight learning curve if it is the first time you&#x27;ve used it.  If spread to thin, the wax dries quickly and when you try to rip it off, it cracks and crumbles and can be quite painful.  It should be spread thick enough that it can be peeled off while still slightly warm and still malleable.</li>
            <li> wrong product delivered.. not even the same brand</li>
            <li> I tried for literally two whole days to melt this enough to use it.... Never even got soft!!!! Garbage!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure about this one.  I had some kind of allergic reaction to this. I will be looking for another brand!!! It doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair and I ended up having to us a tweezer and I hate tweezers!!</li>
            <li> I love this wax, I hate buying those strips and when I discovered this existed where you could just wait til it hardened and rip it off yourself, YAYYY!!!!</li>
            <li> Ok you guys, I am European. Which means all different brands and textures from the US. Back home I would go to my fave salon, but here I don&#x27;t know anyone yet, so decided to get back to doing my bikini myself. I got this wax after reading all the reviews. My hair is very fair, bikini and armpits are darker and thicker hair. This said, I set off. Mirror, towel, spatula and all. Let me tell you something - this wax may seem on a cheaper side, but lower legs+bikini - and your jar is done. I do brazilian, so absolutely nothing is left after I get to it. Well, pardon me, but the wax is so sticky even after a minute sitting there, that I couldn&#x27;t get the very-very back done. It doesn&#x27;t do a good job on thinner hair on my legs, but the bikini area... it got layers of my skin with that hair.&lt;br /&gt;Why does nobody say about how impossible it is to get off of your nails (shellac), your skin (rubbing, oils, etc) and, well, your towel? Say goodbye to the towel you are using, ladies and gentlemen. and anything it gets on, I had to scrub it off with a spatula for minutes! Dropped by Ulta today and got the sugar wax, MOOM, just to try as an alternative. Don&#x27;t even bother with this wax, if you can get MOOM - run and get it. Smoother than smooth, and absolutely no problems with stuff sticking and leaking. Its sugar. You can just wash the thing off.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, yeah, and I got the warming device, too. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and shopped around for a brazilian wax.  Turns out that everywhere I found that even offered brazilians for men (most of them do not) wanted to charge twice as much as they do for a female brazilian wax.  I don&#x27;t have that kind of money sitting around to have my hair removed, so I went ahead and got a can of this stuff, some applicators, and a wax warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright, so the first time I used this stuff, it sucked big time.  It was super painful, took forever, the results were terrible, and I had hair again in about ten days.  Hair grows in stages, though, so I gave it a second go.  Still really painful, but hey, I could say I got 85% of what I intended to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, the whole process has gotten worlds easier.  This is one of those things you get better at the more you do it.  I&#x27;m better at getting the wax only where I want it.  I&#x27;ve figured out the best size of patch to do at a time.  I know which areas are more or less sensitive, so I can alternate between the painful and not painful areas.  Plus, each time it gets less painful.  At this point, it&#x27;s really just a discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend exfoliating the area beforehand to help prevent ingrown hairs.  Wash your hands as well.  Dry the area, then apply a powder to suck up the remaining moisture.  People have recommended baby powder, but I can&#x27;t stand the smell.  Burt&#x27;s Bees makes a talc-free powder that just has a light honey scent to it, and I&#x27;ve had good experience with that.  Afterwards, I use regular olive oil (do this in the shower) to remove the excess bits of wax.  If you don&#x27;t have nails, you can use an old butter knife to help scrape it off.  After a rinse, I apply aloe vera gel which helps reduce the redness and irritation.  After a couple minutes I rinse that off and step out of the shower.  Finally, you definitely want to moisturize with something gentle.  Again, Burt&#x27;s Bees makes a hand salve called farmer&#x27;s friend.  This is excellent stuff to use after waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, it sucks but stick with it - it&#x27;s worth it in the long term.  My last tip would be to get the small wax spatulas that GiGi makes.  They give you better fine control over where the wax ends up.</li>
            <li> i am a 1st time waxer. there is a technique to waxing. i think this wax works prety well althou i have tnothing to compare it to. i suggest wayching youtube vids and reading on how to use. id say it took out about 90%of the hairs but ive only just learned how to use. i put some in a small glass gar and microwaved for1min then put i on top of my candle melter to keep it warm.it cools very fast but also heats fast on the candle melter(no need to buy eexpensive melter things) i found that the longer i let it cool on my skin the more hair it took off. also if  ididnt put a thick enough layer on it would chIP. THERES A FINE LINE BETWEEN TOO THIN TOO THICK TOO DRY AND TOO WET. just have to trial and error and do some research!!  did my mustache lol spot on my arm and some of my leg. seams to work on all hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this; I&#x27;ll never use soft wax again. Unlike the non-warming variety, this doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin even after you&#x27;ve pulled off the paper strip. I think it hurts less. I can also get a thinner layer than I can get with the soft wax. Plus, no added fragrances, just the natural pine smell of the resin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fits just fine into my space saver warmer. I just wish it came in the smaller 8 oz size so it wouldn&#x27;t take so long to melt.</li>
            <li> I recently received this wax in the GiGi Brazilian Waxing Kit Bundle off of Amazon. The Brazilian Body Hard Wax is easy to work with, doesn&#x27;t create a sticky mess, and leaves skin feeling so soft and smooth. The Brazilian Body Hard Wax also sticks directly to hair and not skin, which is another factor that I really love. I had purchased the GiGi Espresso Wax after reading some happy reviews, and I regret not buying another 14 Ounce of the Brazilian Wax. It smelt great, but stuck to my skin and was such a mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use for beginners, and well worth the buy. I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I love this wax but the can came dented which caused the wax to spill when melted</li>
            <li> A+ Service and Product!</li>
            <li> THE best wax I have found to date. The hard wax is far superior to cream wax used with muslin strips. Less pain, more effective, and less redness overall.  I don&#x27;t like the smell (like burnt sausage) but I use it religiously and deal with the smell for the results.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! This wax is awesome! I used to use Bliss Poetic hard wax but it&#x27;s like $50 per little cup but this stuff does as good of a job at a fraction of the price and it covers way more body parts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do your own waxing, buy this stuff - it truly rocks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a shower curtain from a dollar store so it makes clean-up easy, just a helpful hint :)</li>
            <li> They say not to go over the same area more than once or twice, but this is completely non-irritating. I sometimes overlap an area 5 times (a little bit OCD), with no consequences ;-)&lt;br /&gt;This wax tends to get more the tiny peach fuzz hair and the medium coarse hair; that&#x27;s perfect for me, because those are the ones I hate trying to tweeze! I wipe 90% of my hair out with this, then pluck the very coarse stragglers. Feels great!</li>
            <li> I am not to experienced in the waxing, but I thought this product was great. I didn&#x27;t have the warmer but it melted nicely in a pot of boiling water. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I really prefer to wax myself because of the money I save. Hard wax is definitely the way to go for more sensitive areas like underarms or brazillian/bikini. This is the best wax in large containers out there. I do have to admit that surgiwax is better than this wax, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in large containers.</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I have never been to a salon for a waxing. That said I have tried many waxes over the years to do my bikini area.  All of them have failed spectacularly. I put the wax on, then stick on the strip, and pull.  They never get the hair (I have coarse hair) and leaves a huge sticky mess. I was always disappointed and I would think I&#x27;m never doing that again.    I got this in a kit about a week and a half ago.  It is very easy to use. MOST OF THE HAIR CAME OFF. I had a few strays here and there but no biggy when the wax actually did what it wa supposed too.  Not much of a mess if you are careful.       For all those who are tired of shaving there bikini ares and are tired of the red itcky bumps I definitely recommend. That was the reason I started waxing.  I got ingrown hairs EVERY time I shaved.  It was very irritating. With this wax I have not gotten one yet. I also haven&#x27;t had any growback so far.  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Well, like many people, I&#x27;ve been making an effort to do my own beauty stuff to save money, and this has extended to DIY waxing of various body parts. I tried the Clean N Easy sensitive wax on the bikini area, and while this wax works well for eyebrows and legs, it is not so good for underarms or bikini area. I read the reviews on the Gigi Brazilian body hard wax and decided to give it a shot...it&#x27;s pretty cheap on Amazon, and if you have Prime, you don&#x27;t have to even take the time to drive to the beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;In any case, some observations: This stuff does work...and as a generality it is less painful than strip wax. I say as a generality...because there is a decent learning curve here. It sounds easy to slop on a strip of wax, wait for it to cool a bit, then pull it off in one swoop...but an entirely different thing to do it. The wax tends to be difficult to get started on an edge, we found that if you take the time to make sure the edges are thick enough, this problem can be mitigated. The residual wax bits are difficult to get off. This might be easier with the recommended Gigi product, but I just used the stuff I had. The hair DOES come off with this product...even the more dense areas, but if you aren&#x27;t careful, you won&#x27;t be able to get the wax off at all! Fruitlessly pulling at bits of hardening wax on my bikini area is not my idea of fun! We were unable to make this work with strips, as other reviewers recommended, but did find, as said before, that with a little practice, the wax gives you a nice, smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion: Try the wax. It seems to work pretty well for the bikini area. If you are unfamiliar with *hard* wax, as I was, take the time to wax a patch of hair (not fuzz) from your leg, which will be a much much less painful area to practice on than your genitals ;)&lt;br /&gt;Once you get it straightened out: enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;*tip* read the instructions on the can before you start...the paper instructions on the lid are only in Spanish &amp; French! Good luck!uck!</li>
            <li> works great for delicate areas that need a bit more protection during waxing.</li>
            <li> I love this wax! comes out easily and it&#x27;s very easy to use. Once you get the hang of it you get smooth skin in no time :)</li>
            <li> It is really hard to use hard wax alone. Maybe it is not the product&#x27;s fault. But I can not say I like it. I am not sure how hot the was needs to be for waxing. I suggest go professional waxing first and then consider whether you want to do wax by yourself.</li>
            <li> Good product, takes a little longer to dry on the skin than some I have used in the past, but overall it&#x27;s fine and cools off relatively fast.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> messy messy messy but the benefits are amazing! great stuff!</li>
            <li> Best wax ever! After I got my wax warmer, I bought serval waxes to try out. Some of the waxes were not good. They didn&#x27;t pull out all the hair or the wax pulled off my skin along with my hairs. This ones the best so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. I love hard waxes too! Check them out.</li>
            <li> My sisters and I both use this wax. It melts fast and hardens fast. It pulls hairs great and does not leave behind much residue. If it does, the residue is easy to clean off since it hardens. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This wax is terrible. I used it for an underarm and bikini wax. It breaks-a lot! Having to pick out the pieces was time consuming and painful. I&#x27;d either have to pick the pieces out or apply more wax to try again. The waxing took forever. I&#x27;m going back to using the Ceripil which is an amazing product. You do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> cheap, good, and prompt delivery. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Horrible wax.  It did not come off easily.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff monthly for my bikini area. It works pretty well, have to keep the area dry in order for it to stick appropriately to the hair, so make sure to keep some baby powder next to you</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and is amazing, HOWEVER- Definitely not for beginners!! I recommend if you are thinking of starting waxing at home try Sally Hansen strip free wax because it is very easy to work with and in small containers that heat quickly, and easier to clean. FOr the experienced waxer though, this is far more product for your dollar. It has a sugaring/ honey like quality to it, translucent and very very sticky. I love the results and can achieve more control with it, but the large container takes a very long time to heat (hour +) and itll make a heck of a mess if you drip.</li>
            <li> The best waxing that I have ever had. Really easy to use. Love it.</li>
            <li> it require too much work</li>
            <li> This wax is by far my favorite, and I have tried many. It works great for eyebrows, armpits, and privates.</li>
            <li> Love this wax. What more can I say. Love how you don&#x27;t need the paper wax strips. Just apply the wax, let harded a little, and rip it off! Hair comes off clean!</li>
            <li> First time DIY waxer and it was easy to use. Worked better then I thought. It is easy to get used to after a few tries you will be an expert at it. Workes best with the warmer.</li>
            <li> Do not order this product! You will not receive the product pictured but rather, a 4 ounce container of Andrea Brazilian Hard Wax that is labeled as the product in the picture. Total scam!!!</li>
            <li> excellent product.  It takes time to learn how to use it but once you do its awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this! It works amazingly. It&#x27;s great for at home waxing. I would definitely suggest this and the GiGi wax warmer for anyone doing at home waxing.</li>
            <li> We got a kit with a warmer and some sticks. When those sticks ran out, I shaped my own out of tongue depressors. The system works really well and beats having to go to someone to get waxing done. The wax is a little tough to keep at the right temperature, but once you get the hang of it, it works well for taking out the hairs without damaging the skin. Still requires some tweezing afterwards, but I would assume all waxes are like that.</li>
            <li> When it hardens it breaks off in pieces. If you try to remove too soon it sticks and doesn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried giving myself a Brazilian wax several times and could never really get the job FULLY done...until I tried GiGi Brazilian Hard Wax. I have used other kinds of waxes: GiGi honey wax, a green wax of which its brand I don&#x27;t even remember, lemon and sugar wax. All these waxes were ultimately either ineffective in removing all my course hair or they were just too sticky. I would end up still hairy and with residue wax all over my body and wax all over my floors. Clean up used to be a nightmare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this hard wax was perfect! The fact that you don&#x27;t need any strips reduces the hassle and the mess, and also allows you to focus on small little bits and pieces at a time, which for me was absolutely necessary. I didn&#x27;t buy any of the pre-wax products-- I soaked a little isopropyl alcohol in a cotton ball to clean the areas to be waxed, pat dried them with a paper towel and then applied baby powder pretty much everywhere. Make sure you don&#x27;t forget the baby-powder! If you forget to powder up the wax will stick to your skin and remove it along with your hair (Ouch!). Because no trips are used, I was actually able to wax parts that I have never been able to before. In the past, whenever I used honey wax and strips on these specific areas, I would pull slowly and the strip would come off but the wax would stay on my body. I would spend anywhere between half an hour to an hour trying to oil rub the wax off my skin, and then I would just give up waxing altogether. Now this did not happen with the hard wax. When I pulled slowly the wax did break, but the hair did come off with the wax. I did find myself having to pinch little bits and pieces of wax (along with hair) at a time, which was excruciatingly painful, but this is my own fault for not being able to pull fast enough. I was able to wax everything off with some trial and error. Once you learn to use the wax, and to pull fast, you will absolutely love it! I feel like it hurt me less to wax myself than to have the job done professionally, but it did take me much much longer to get it done (approximately 2 hours!). The wax did leave some stray hairs, but it was nothing my tweezers couldn&#x27;t fix. Cleanup was also very easy. I used my nails to chip off hardened wax that fell on my floor (a butter knife would also be useful if you don&#x27;t want to risk damaging your nails). Rub on any type of oil (baby, almond, olive, coconut oil, etc.,) to remove any wax residue from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips for waxing:&lt;br /&gt;- Taken an advil or two (if you are not allergic of course) thirty minutes prior to waxing. This really helps with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;- Clean and pat dry areas that are going to be waxed.&lt;br /&gt;- Powder up!&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure your skin is taut. Use one hand to pull the skin and the other hand to pull the wax. Some areas are more difficult to make taut than others. Experiment pulling different directions until you find one that is sufficiently taut. It really reduces the pain when your skin is not being pulled and dragged along with the wax!&lt;br /&gt;- Pull fast! The faster, the less it will hurt.&lt;br /&gt;- If you are like me at all, mind over matter is easier said than done. I tell myself &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; but end up chickening out and pulling really slowly. If you pull slow the strip might break (not to mention it will hurt like hell). For those areas which you know you might chicken out because they are extremely painful, try waxing very small portions (nickel or quarter sizes worked for me).&lt;br /&gt;- A thicker wax layer is not necessarily better. For me it was actually worse. Just make sure the wax layer is not TOO thin on very painful areas as a slower pull combined with thin layer or wax will cause the wax to break.&lt;br /&gt;- I found it helpful to wax from outside to inside. Start with your bikini area (thigh) and then continue moving towards the center.&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t forget to bring a hand mirror to the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;- Play some soothing music to distract you from the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> The first wax that was ever done on me was with a hard wax so I wanted a hard wax and since I&#x27;m trying the DIY-waxing all my wax products came from Gigi.  The reviews on this wax were for the most part were great, and for newbies like myself it takes a lot of practice to use this wax (mind you I did a sphinx wax on my chacha and did my underarms using this wax).  I read previous comments that said this wax turns flaky during use, what I found was that it turns flaky if you use a very thin layer of the wax on your skin or if you left the wax on the warmer until it turned runny -- this happened during the later part of my waxing session while I was doing my chacha (big mistake, but I did manage to get all the hair out of there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you put the wax in the warmer for about 45min, it turns into a sticky but not runny form (test: when you scoop the wax out from the warmer it should form a slight ball at the top and slowly slip down the stick, not slip down the stick like liquid) -- this is how you should use the product.  Overall this product does do its job by removing hair, however it is quite difficult to use for your pubic region if you want to remove 2/3 or all of the hair down there -- esp. if you have thick hair growth.</li>
            <li> pulls out even thick stubborn hairs, not stubbly hairs though, they have to grow a bit longer and then it can pull them out. doesn&#x27;t pull on skin. i have an issue with gripping it to remove, you have to bend the edge a bit and thats difficult for me, but maybe I didnt get the hang of it yet. nevertheless, im still going to use it because once you do get to pull it off, it gets rid of any hair it touches. it doesnt rip the hair also, it gets it out from the root.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks, love the hard wax. Way less messy than the Honee or any other non-hard wax. I use non-woven wax strips just because it makes it easier to pull off.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands of hard and soft wax, wax strips, and sugaring paste, and this is by far my favorite. It heats up evenly in the GiGi heater, goes on smoothly, and most importantly comes off easily and takes all of the hair with it without irritating my skin. Be sure to use pre-wax oil or coconut oil to help prevent it from sticking to your skin. I&#x27;ve found that makes using this wax nearly painless in most areas.</li>
            <li> Best American wax in this country</li>
            <li> Unless you are a professional waxer...just go to a salon and pay a professional to do the job rather than mess with this mess.</li>
            <li> This wax is wonderful! You need not use any cloth strips, just a thick coating of the wax, cool, rip and it&#x27;s gone! If any wax sticks, use the wax that you just pulled off to remove the left over wax, just stick it onto the left over wax and it comes off ( like you would hold a blob of gum and stick it to more gum to get it off). This removes the toughest hair and even fine hair ( I tried it ALL over, just to see). Smooth, soft and tingly after a good waxing! This wax is the best I have tried and I have tried a lot ...</li>
            <li> I have been using this wax for a couple of years ago and it&#x27;s always worked for me. Delivery was quick and the price is a couple bucks cheaper than my nearest Beauty supply shop.</li>
            <li> This is a really good quality wax. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> A little too sticky, I&#x27;d go with the GiGi all purpose hard wax.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever waxed or anything other than shaving for manscaping (yes i am a man). This wax did a fantastic job, It really grabs onto the hair and doesnt let go. If you do not have a warmer like me what i did was use the hot plate from an old basic on/off coffee maker. Clean it to prevent any water getting in the wax, set the wax can on the hot plate and turn on. After about 45 minutes the wax was mostly melted and ready for use. I tried baby powder and baby oil to prevent the wax from grabbing the skin and oil definitely helped out more but made it hard to spread as it would move around too much. With trial and error you figure out the consistency that is easy to work with, i found that a thicker consistency of a cold honey worked best as it wasnt scalding hot on the sensitive areas and still workable. Place one strip on then another. After the second strip the first should be mildy cool and that is when you pull the skin tight and let em rip. Be fast and dont psych yourself out, it will sting but its much worse if you stop half eay through the strip. Also If you have some long hair it is going to make for a nightmare experience as it makes the pain much worse and much harder to pull off. If you have to, shave 1 time and let the hair regrow to a very minimal 1/2 inch. That will get the wax close to the skin and make the hair come out easy otherwise you might as well just grab the hair and pull it out by hand. For after care i used aquaphor and within a day the redness and sensitivity went way down. With experience the time it takes to wax will fo down, it took me about 3 hours of trial and error before the process was working in a way that allowed me to be comfortable. Im sure future waxes will be easier but take the first time slow. Good luck and dont burn yourself!</li>
            <li> If you do Brazilian Waxing then this product is for you. The wax has a nice scent and hardens very well. It gets most of the hairs on the first pull.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this and she was surprised to see a different product (Andrea Brazilian Hard Wax, 4 ounce). Its just a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Love GiGi products and this one is great for the bikini line.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I ordered. Not even GiGi&#x27;s brand but some random cheap wax. Definitely not matching the description. It&#x27;s supposed to fit a wax warmer instead it&#x27;s something you have to heat on the microwave. Once on the skin and dry it flakes away and makes it hard to take off.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive and this wax works wonders!! No funky smell and goes on smooth.  Put a little baby powder on before using and it comes off with no problem.  Does a great job removing hair and has yet to burn at all.</li>
            <li> Love to use this wax for armpits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving myself Brazilian waxes for about 2 years now and this is what I use every 4 weeks. Get&#x27;s everything. Great stuff! It&#x27;s not that great for facial hair so I rarely use it for that.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> Its a good product. I used it with no issues. Its just knowing how to use it and its painful when using it against your skin ripping your hair off.</li>
            <li> Great fast shipping and the wax works great. This is my fourth order and the wax pulls off every hair. It&#x27;s a lot less painless than tradition waxing. It gets a bit messy the first time you use it but you&#x27;ll get use to it in no time. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t go back to honey wax after this. I use this wax for everything, even the face. Soft wax just can&#x27;t compare to this stuff! Love it!</li>
            <li> this wax product is terrible!!!&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use it and it got dried on my skin by the time i was taking the wax strips with the result that i had all the wax on my leg and I had to take it away with my nails and my leg now is injured.</li>
            <li> This wax drys out on your skin! it damage your skin and also ruin your nails. Do Not Buy it!</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again. The wax sets up fast and hard for quick, clean hair removal... Unlike other waxes that remain sticky or take a long time to harden. This wax is easy to use, and makes waxing les painful.</li>
            <li> IT HURTS SO BAD! EVEN WHEN APPLYING.  waste of money i swear</li>
            <li> Got this for the wife and it works better than the honey and less mess.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. By far the best home waxing kit I have used (And I&#x27;ve tried a lot.) It gets ALL the hair...no matter how coarse or fine, and I absolutely love not having to deal with fabric strips. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The wax is good so far unless you know its application on skin. I am content with this product.</li>
            <li> Worst ever! Does not come off even after taking bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MANUFACTURER:&lt;br /&gt;Please write a method to remove this too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL - DON&#x27;T BUY THIS IN THE NAME OF HYGIENE!!!</li>
            <li> - Freaking  OUCH! Let me start by saying I am an amateur at this diy waxing stuff.  This kit honestly worked great on my eyebrows and my daughter&#x27;s eyebrows- No pain at all!  And trust me, she is 14 and a crybaby when it comes to pain, but not one wince from her. I don&#x27;t know if I am doing something wrong (which is highly likely.) I&#x27;ve only been to a pro for a brazilian, but this mother hurt on my kind parts! Like extreme torture kind of pain with blood and all! Oh, and its very messy no matter the temp. Also, it is almost impossible to remove all of the wax.  I do not recommend for the bikini parts at freaking all (unless you are into that torture feels great kind of thing!) Good luck with it! I will shop on...</li>
            <li> OK.  This stuff takes a little bit of skill and it will hurt something fierce the first time you use it on a sensitive area with thick hair, but once you get the timing down and learn a few tricks - it works great!  If you wax every two weeks or so, the pain will become very manageable.  When I follow this rule, it no longer hurts at all.  Let the hair grow for a month and waxing will become painful again, but it has never hurt as much as the first time.  1.  Rub baby powder over sensitive areas before applying (keeps it from sticking to your skin, but not the hair). 2.  Hold skin taunt, otherwise there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;ll get all the hair. 3.  Sprinkle baby powder on top of the wax after applying so that you can touch it sooner without it sticking to your fingers. 4.  Carefully work an edge free as soon as it starts to get gummy.  Don&#x27;t let the wax cool hard.  It will be harder to remove. 5.  Rip it off in one quick motion, against the grain if possible. 6.  Immediately press down on that spot with your free hand for a few seconds to calm the skin and minimize bleeding. 7.  Reapply baby powder in case you hit that same spot again.  Don&#x27;t apply over hair longer than 1/4 - 1/2&amp;#34;.  Trim first. Don&#x27;t apply wax that is too cool or too hot.  It should be the consistency of honey when you apply it. Don&#x27;t pinch the wax to start ripping it off, work an edge free first and use that, otherwise you&#x27;ll give yourself an impressive bruise. Don&#x27;t forget the baby powder.  Once you&#x27;ve gotten the hang of waxing, it will let you wax areas more than once per sitting - no problem. Don&#x27;t try to remove misplaced wax.  Let it cool first.  Baby oil can remove it from hair you want to keep after you&#x27;re done waxing.  As an athletic man, I can&#x27;t begin to describe how wonderful it feels to be smooth done there.  Even walking feels better!</li>
            <li> I must be doing it wrong because my pubes do not come off...</li>
            <li> I had to write a review because of all these random reviews leaving negative comments like &amp;#34;it&#x27;s messy,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;it hurts!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to break it to you, but it&#x27;s WAX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s messy. It&#x27;s going to get all of your nails, and mess up your perfectly manicured nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s going to hurt. It&#x27;s ripping out hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But guess what? Your saving tons of money by doing this on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My story: I was completely embarrassed by my dark armpits and bikini line. I have tried EVERYTHING to fix it but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to suck it up and wax for my first time, using the GiGi kit. It hurt horribly, but that&#x27;s because after YEARS of shaving my hair was dark, thick and full. After this, my parts became MUCH lighter. It was seriously a miracle, and that&#x27;s why I continue to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip that has helped a bunch: Buy a ton of large popsicle sticks. Spread the wax on a small area, wait about 3-5 seconds, and put the tip of the popsicle stick on the end of the wax area (the area you would normally lift the wax and rip) and rip. It&#x27;s MUCH easier to wax using this method.</li>
            <li> I have used many many waxes and this is the best least painful most efficient at removing hair hard wax.  I am a repeat buyer of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hard wax fanatic, and Gigi&#x27;s Brazilian Body Hard Wax is my hands-down favorite. It&#x27;s so versatile, I&#x27;ve eliminated soft wax from all but the most delicate of hair removal protocols. Great consistency at a comfortably low temperature, hardens quickly and completely and pulls like a champ.</li>
            <li> As a professional waxer this, by far, is the WORST wax I have ever used! It&#x27;s flaky, doesn&#x27;t harden completely and is not good for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ll stick to my Cirepil from now on.</li>
            <li> Best. Purchase. Ever.</li>
            <li> The wax is pretty hard and good i will love to shop more stuff.</li>
            <li> Pro:  It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and leaving my itching for two weeks like those pre-waxed strip products do (I think I&#x27;m allergic to pine resin, which is commonly used in them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Everything else.  It stuck to parts of my skin, despite even *powdering* before!  It uses a ton of wax to peel anything off, and half the time, would break and leave me picking off tiny bits of wax from my skin and hairs.  I tried all thicknesses, all temperature variations, waiting different lengths of time, etc.  It was just problem after problem.  What a pain!  For a wax that is advertised as not needing strips, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you.  It desperately needs cloth strips in order to use this wax.  Even after all of that, trying to get it off my skin using baby oil and everything else under the sun, it was still days of picking off little bits of missed wax.  On top of that, it still missed sections of hair!  Are you kidding me??  The cheapo cold wax strips did better than this!&lt;br /&gt;I watched tons of videos from professionals, the manufacturer, youtube enthusiasts, and read articles from all kinds of sources (beauty magazines, blogs, salon postings, etc) about every tip and thing to prepare before I did this.  This wax is kind of like having a baby, I guess.  You read the books and get the advice,  but when the time comes, it&#x27;ll all go out the window anyway because nothing works the way they say it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use this wax again.  Even with strips now.  AVOID</li>
            <li> i dont know if this is a fake one or made from different material but compare to the one I bought from sally hansen it way too sticky, hard to remove and does not remove completely most of the hair in the needed area</li>
            <li> Welp, one epidermis, dermis and partial sub-q layer later... this stuff is AWFUL!!! &amp;#34;Brazilian&amp;#34; wax huh? I used it on my face and other areas of the body first, and they went over ... just ok. After 2 hours, I never could quite get the right temperature, it was just too hot most of the time. Getting to the brazilian part was a NIGHTMARE! The wax just wouldn&#x27;t come off... I tried a thin layer, medium and thin, it still kept clinging to my skin. By the time I was done, I probably pulled out more hair pulling, rubbing and scraping with my fingernails than the actual waxing. I may not be professional, but I&#x27;ve used the all-purpose wax for a long time and it has worked fantastic (maybe a bit of residue at time). I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> cannot keep using the same strip as with nufree, will probably never try anything but nufree again</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected. I does not removed all hair, it took several wax applications, and still my skin was not looking like I wanted.</li>
            <li> I knew of the product from the salon so I was assure of what I was ordering.</li>
            <li> This wax works great heat it up and make sure its creamy and not too hot you will get all that hair off!!</li>
            <li> I use this product all over my body, even on my eyebrows. For $10, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this wax. It beats spending $50 every two weeks at the salon. It&#x27;s odorless, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and works really well. I love the results and I am noticing that my hair is growing back  thinner and thinner. I have reordered this product several times and don&#x27;t plan on switching anytime soon.</li>
            <li> This is not a good quality wax. It breaks when pulling strips. It takes forever to dry and it is not easy to get off the skin.</li>
            <li> This wax does not require backing with cloth after application due to its stronger nature. Be sure not to apply it too thick, it really works better with a thinner layer since it relies on flexibility when being yanked off to not break off. Also because of this, you should only wait about 15 seconds after application to begin peeling up an end and removing. If you pull too early it may be gooey in last applied area of swathe and stringily stretch apart, and if you let it cool too long it will also break off in small chunks due to lack of flexibility unless you applied it too thick. Pain is minimal in most areas if you apply baby oil to the skin (or my personal favorite, coconut oil) with a rag first, so the wax will then only adhere to the hair. You should apply just enough that you can tell its on the skin, as too much will also cause issues with the wax getting a good grip on shorter hairs. This wax was strong enough to remove thicker hair from underarms and crotch. The longer the hair, the better it works, however if applied correctly as mentioned above it will even remove thick shorter hairs (1/4 inch long or less). I would advise growing hair to at least 1/4 inch before attempting the wax unless you dont mind it being less effective. I am able to wax underarms, bikini, forearms, legs and still have around 1/2 can of product left over.</li>
            <li> So far better than other brands that I&#x27;ve tried. Other brands seem to make hair grow back quicker than this one. It takes about a week to start growing back but the others are about couple days. Like it so far</li>
            <li> Works great as hard wax.  I was able to do my nose and ears without a problem!  Plenty left for multiply times!</li>
            <li> This hard wax takes off all the hair you want it to! Takes a little to get used to the application process, but after that works like a charm! Saves me a lot of $ and I get to wax at home when I want to.</li>
            <li> Love this amazing product! I rebuy this like every couple months!</li>
            <li> Expensive for the amount they give you. You do not need to get wax strips. All you have to do is heat it up and apply to the area where you want and wait for it to dry before ripping it off. It takes some time getting use to using it and you do need to apply a good amount of it. It does not always work the first time you use it so you have to reapply to the same area sometimes. You can use up anywhere from half the can to 3/4 of the can or more if you want to wax off your whole body [for reference as to how much is in the can]. You don&#x27;t necessarily need the heating mechanism to heat it up and you can just place the can into a pot of boiling water with the water about half way up the can. It&#x27;ll take about 30 minutes or more to heat up a full can and small water droplets can condense into the can, but that&#x27;s not something you have to worry too much about. Just keep and eye on it and soak up any water droplets with a paper towel.</li>
            <li> effect body well. really. well. hard wax that no sting skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I originally purchased the whole kit and bought this refill 3 times. Since it&#x27;s hard wax it adheres to only the hair and doesn&#x27;t rip it off with skin like soft wax can. I use a tiny bit of baby oil to the areas I plan to wax and that also helps it not stick to the skin. I&#x27;ve tried doing the Brazilian wax but the pain is not worth it for me,  at home or professionally. So, I use this wax on everything else like underarms,  eyebrows,  etc. The pain there I can handle without any problems. I&#x27;ve tried a different hard wax refill before but this one is the best I&#x27;ve found. It may take a while to get,  but it&#x27;s way worth it not to go to waxing appointments when you&#x27;re able to do it at home and save all that money. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a good body hard wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 4 years now. I love it. I have very thick, coarse hair so the waxing kits bought in stores do not work well for me. The hair does have to be a certain length for it to work well and that&#x27;s all individualized. It&#x27;s much cheaper to buy the warming kit and then refill it as needed than to spend $65-85 a wax by professionals. I&#x27;ve used it on my under arms. I also use this to wax my mom&#x27;s lip and eyebrows and it has worked well.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about buying strips.</li>
            <li> Could be less messy, but it gets the job done mostly. I&#x27;ve also been burned.</li>
            <li> Best hard wax in the market. Great smell and texture. I use it with the Gigi warmer machine and is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> awesome product as usual</li>
            <li> It does the job very nicely, like a professional waxing experience!</li>
            <li> the best hard body wax I have used. The wax can get brittle and break if you leave it on too long. But it goes on easy and smooth, and removed the hair very well with no breakage.</li>
            <li> it ok but make a big mess</li>
            <li> The wax works well. It takes off hair with ease and minimal pain, but the Brazilian does not last as long. Hair starts to grow back relatively quickly in comparison to other waxes or wax strips.</li>
            <li> I am not new to waxing, but have always used Gigi&#x27;s soft waxes, for, well, ALMOST everywhere, the all purpose honee being my favorite. I always wax the upper bikini area with no problems, but decided to try this one for the lower part since it has so many positive reviews (the wax..not my lower parts ;P.&lt;br /&gt;First, please know how to use hard, stripless wax. Maybe, be a bit smarter than me and test it out on your leg or something first until you get the hang of it. Now, I have used Gigi microwave stripless wax, and it is nowhere near as sticky as this one. Second, make very sure that you have the oil to remove the wax handy. That&#x27;s very important. Very very important. I placed a sticky glob of this wax on a quarter sized area, and it stuck. Like a glue ball. So, after trying to pull it out with no luck, I heated up my soft wax and tried to wax it off that way, which removed about half of it. Then I ended up scraping the rest off in the shower with a cheap razor. Never ever again. I would give this product no stars. None. And give myself no stars for being an idiot as well. If you are going to try this wax, have the oil to remove it handy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. As long as you use oil freely beforehand (I used sensitive formula baby oil in cotton squares) the sticking to your skin fear is a mute one. Looking forward to having the $ in my pocket that I spend at the salon!</li>
            <li> This stuff does the trick! I&#x27;m 27 and have been to spas to get me face done and also have done at home treatments. To be honest, I have pretty coarse hairs and sensitive skin.  I had a bad experience at a spa where I got burned...so I stop the wax for some years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Youtube has some great \\&quot;how to\\&quot; videos.  Maybe watch a few if you are a beginner....hot wax is nothing to play with but it&#x27;s pretty easy to use&lt;br /&gt;*Pick a day to wax&lt;br /&gt;*Melt the wax on medium heat and once it has melted, keep it warm on low heat.  May take about 1 1/2 hours to melt up.&lt;br /&gt;(You don&#x27;t want to get burned)&lt;br /&gt;*Gather every tool you need within arms reach before beginning to wax&lt;br /&gt;*Make sure the skin is washed clean and apply generous amount of oil to the area before waxing..to protect the skin. (I use vitamin E oil)&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t use waxing strips (with this hard wax, because you don&#x27;t need them)&lt;br /&gt;*Test a small area on you inner thigh and follow the instructions for technique.&lt;br /&gt;*Just before the wax is completely dry scrape up a little bit of the applied wax so that you can have a little flap to grasp when removing the wax.&lt;br /&gt;*Use an alcohol free toner directly after waxing to sooth. (I use Thayers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck guys!</li>
            <li> The normal honey hard wax is better for underarm hair and pubic hair. Much better. I suggest using the normal one instead of this one. Who knows it could just be the same thing. I can&#x27;t tell any difference except I prefer the other one better. Used today actually.</li>
            <li> I really like using this wax better then other kinds. This works well and it last for a while. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different kinds and versions, but this is the only kind buy now.</li>
            <li> Wonderful wax. Just a little sticky. I hardly have to go over the same area twice; it does a good job at getting the hair the first pull. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it affecting those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best wax. My teacher in school told me about it so i ordered it and i am a new fan. This company packages it great. I was nervous that the wax would melt and be everywhere by the time i got it but it was packed very well. I also got it super fast. Thank guys :)</li>
            <li> This wax is great!! I just used it for the first time today. I do my own brazilian, and I wax my own armpits. It&#x27;s just makes sense to go this route money wise. Although I LOVE European Wax Center....I just cannot afford $60 plus tip every 4 weeks. For any newbies to the DIY brazilian I would recommend that you have a salon do it the first couple times (make sure they use the hard wax like European Wax Center). The first couple wax sessions are painful, and this way you can learn the technique. The one issue that I do have is the color of the wax...it makes it harder to see any wax left behind when doing clean up. Hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> Worst product ever... hard as rock :(</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used it for years and it is cheaper on Amazon!</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t work on the areas where you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> Great wax! Saves me tons of money, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and the results last a long time.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this wax before giving up!  I decided to do my own bikini waxing with mixed results.  I was using different types of wax and using paper or cloth strips and getting so frustrated.  I tried this product once and although my results weren&#x27;t perfect, they were 1000% better than what my results were previously.  This was really grabs onto the hair so ALL of it is removed!  There is SOOO much less mess when you don&#x27;t use the paper or cloth strips!! There is a learning curve to doing your own waxing but it is so nice to be able to do it in the privacy of your own home!  This was melts nicely and is super easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I use this product for my bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very painful to wax that ... area, so I recommend easing into it by doing small patches at first. Once you get all the initial hair out, the new hair is much less painful to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this in the summer. No embarrassing bikini line to worry about and no painful in grown hairs to deal with.</li>
            <li> This wax did the trick, more or less, but I found it very messy. There were a lot of bits of wax stuck to my skin, which were very hard to get off, and I&#x27;ve also found little bits of wax all over the floor. I have not had this problem with other wax. The hard wax also gets a little too brittle, and it&#x27;s hard to know exactly when to pull it off between when it hardens enough to come off and before it gets so hard that it will break. Maybe practice makes perfect, but I&#x27;m going to try a different type of wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I didn&#x27;t buy the warmer with it but read somewhere else you could use a candle warmer . It takes a few hours , but word just as good !</li>
            <li> Love the wax product! Takes a while for wax to melt, due to its size, you can&#x27;t expect to hurry up and get wax onto your skin, it takes about an hour to two, let it sit in low heat prior putting on any wax onto your face, armpit, etc. let it sit and hardened up before peeling the wax off, be sure to apply baby oil (yes you read it right.... A baby oil) to clean off the remaining wax pieces off then wash your face with regular soap, you will be happy, be sure to do it on the day when you don&#x27;t have any plans to go anywhere during the day or night time, let your skin heal up a bit (if you are first time waxing). I definitely will order some more wax product again soon!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite wax. It works really well and it&#x27;s pretty gentle as far as waxes go, plus one tin lasts me a good 6 months. Best of all, it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean up after, and you hardly need the oil if you keep your skin a bit damp.</li>
            <li> Works great.&lt;br /&gt;This is our second order.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only brand we would ever use</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works like magic. It is not messy and my wax lasts approximately up to 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I received everything, it was as described and works well. I use my Scentsy warmer to heat it up. :D</li>
            <li> I was accustom to going to the spa to get waxed but it became pricey so I decided to try it on my own. after going through a couple products I finally settled on this one. It&#x27;s great, works well and is almost the same salon quality without the salon price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not accustom waxing it would take some time getting used to it. I do actually use it for a brazilian wax,other than normally puffiness and red irritation that comes with a wax, I have no complaints. Every person is different, so it takes some time figuring out what temperature, thickness etc that works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product only makes sense if you&#x27;re willing to shell out the money for the wax warmer by the same company though. Won&#x27;t recommend it being used on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> It  good! I want use them more!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using hard was and I&#x27;m on the fence about this product. I waxed my under arms and it did in fact hurt less than with soft wax but I found that I had to go over areas more than twice to get all of the hair out. I also did a part of my leg and I had the same result only that I noticed it was not pulling all hair from root and was breaking the hair off in some areas. Two stars only because it hurts less than soft wax.</li>
            <li> The good stuff. Wax like a pro</li>
            <li> Performs as expected, it has a slight pine scent to it, nothing overwhelming and I use it to wax my nose hair.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This wax makes home Brazilians easy.  Better than other hard waxes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Tried a few methods. Wasted money at drug stores and salons. Razors cost a fortune. I feel smarter for using this.</li>
            <li> Best hard wash I have ever had. Removes every small hair from my face and body, and leaves my skin smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> Worked great! It was my first Brazilian ever and I did an awesome job all by myself because it was so easy to use :)</li>
            <li> I prefer this type of wax over any other because of the simple fact it doesn&#x27;t rip off your skin and leave you with bruises, like the other types of wax. It just takes a little more patience and skill. But, once you learn how to use it correctly, it shows the best results.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It is very effective in its purpose and the result looks professional. Special recommendations for use.&lt;br /&gt;1 should only be used on the bikini area. Does not work well in other parts such as legs, etc. It is irritating to the armpits.&lt;br /&gt;2. recommend using the oil - preepilation gigi for best results.&lt;br /&gt;3 It is important to place a towel on the area where you will work, because the wax is difficult to remove from surfaces like floors and walls.</li>
            <li> ...and I&#x27;ve tried a few. The hard wax is just the best at getting thick hairs out of those hard to reach places without me having to grow them out for a month. It&#x27;s also great because I can use it more than once over the same area in one sitting--which ensures removal of all the hair. It definitely hurts and takes some getting used to. You&#x27;ve got to develop a method of flicking and pulling that works for you. Now that I have it down, I won&#x27;t use anything else. Also, though the microwavable is the same wax, I wholly recommend using the standard with the warmer--much more consistently heated and simplifies the process, no reheating at the microwave, etc.</li>
            <li> Theres finitely a learning curve. Works good for legs and bikini area. Good for course hair but it sticks to your skin.</li>
            <li> Too much work and it hurts more. i bought this by mistake, i threw it out without finishing it. you can&#x27;t use a strip you have to apply it then take it off with your fingers. Problem is that the wax sticks to your fingers and it breaks so you have to do it little by little....too time consuming.</li>
            <li> Great product. Beats having to spend $100 plus for the same thing I can do right at home. Product works quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Horrible! I wish I could give it 0 stars. I normally use Satin smooth calendula gold wax but thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  Left both my mom and me with painful red welts.</li>
            <li> love this wax, i have try different ones, but this one is my favorite</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. Buy the whole kit at first. The warmer with lid is a plus.</li>
            <li> This was what I expected and works well for body waxing.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, love it!</li>
            <li> Works well if you have the patience for waxing</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used it and it works AWESOME, and as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has vowed never to put a razor near &amp;#34;the zone&amp;#34; again after the smooth long lasting difference of this wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am happy...no more face burns.</li>
            <li> I use GIGI all my life but, lately, their quality product is not so good. Will have to see other brands to compare.</li>
            <li> Works well but does leave some hair behind.</li>
            <li> Looooooooove! Works very well and saves me so much money at the salon!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I love love love love LOVE this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been to a waxing salon. I think it&#x27;s kind of weird to have someone else do a brazilian wax on me. Anyway, I&#x27;ve always been a shaving girl, but I was sick and tired of having to shave every day and started looking for something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried waxing last month (yes, I&#x27;m really new to waxing) using some sugar wax called Sugarpot. It claims to work for brazilian wax as well, but so not true! It hurts like CRAZY, and it doesn&#x27;t help that I have to do the same area several times to get the area clean. At the end of it, I was sore and disappointed. I almost gave up on waxing and wanted to return to shaving until I saw a youtube review on Gigi wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a bottle and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I don&#x27;t have a wax warmer, so I used the water bath method that people use for melting chocolates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the wax hardens relatively quickly, but I could use it for over half hour, which is more than sufficient time for me to do the brazilian. I even had time to test trial it on my arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t as messy as I imagined. I placed a towel on the floor, but I didn&#x27;t get it on the towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn&#x27;t apply it as nicely. Maybe because without the warmer, the wax had cooled a little. When I try to spread it on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t go as smoothly as those I see in youtube videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT IT STILL WORKS PERFECTLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain wise ... maybe I have pretty high tolerance, or maybe because the SugarPot wax experience was hell. By the way, spare yourself the torture. Don&#x27;t use soft wax for brazilian waxing. Maybe everyone knew, but I didn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to Gigi, when I was pulling up the edge to get a grip on the wax, the wax was already pulling out hair so it hurts a tiny bit. But after a few deep breaths, I pulled my skin taunt and yanked the wax ... nothing! I barely felt it. Again, maybe it was in comparison to the other product I&#x27;ve used that madethis painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little on the gross side: I could see the roots of my hair on the wax, which is great because it means the area will stay hair free for a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get the pre-epilator oil or the wax removal because I&#x27;ve checked the youtube videos and some other reviews which says normal baby oil works as well. I used olive oil, which I already have at home before and after waxing. Works just fine. The wax was easy to remove, a little messy, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the olive oil to remove all the wax, I did apply some Bee Magic to just sooth my skin. It wasn&#x27;t bleeding or hurting, I just thought it would be good for the skin to have some healing &amp; moisturizing cream after waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never going back to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now all I ask is for Gigi to make a 220v wax warmer!</li>
            <li> The wax WOULD NOT CURE. So i was stuck with a goey mess in my hair. When it was curing and hardening up. It was working well, i&#x27;m not really sure what went wrong. But waxing your head with this is extremely risky. Never again will i try it.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot more than prewaxed sheets!</li>
            <li> This is not what I had expected. This wax breaks off in pieces making it extremely hard &amp; frustrating to use. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Gigi wax works awesome!  After some failed attempts to make my own sugar wax (which is basically burned sugar on the stove) I decided to just order some that I knew would work.  I bought some popsicle sticks for dipping and they work well for a clean wax and I can dispose of them with no other mess.  I forgot to order the Gigi warmer so I just melt the wax in the oven since it is in a metal can.  When it heats up, it smells like a forest, kind of like fresh essential oils.  It smells really nice.  I have waxed my upper lip and my bikini line, all very easily.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Tried so many products for my underarm hair. Nothing lasts as long as this. So happy not to have to shave every freaking day. Generally easy to use. Gets easier with each use and the hair no longer grows back as thick or dark. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I set the can on a candle warmer and that works well. This wax works excellent! I am so glad I tried it and will continue to use it regularly.</li>
            <li> first of all I ordered this on the 27th of may and I got it literally the next day!! the shipping was free BTW!! the product is absolutely great, just what I needed :)</li>
            <li> You really do not need strips w/ this wax as long as you put it on a bit thick. I suggest pretty small patches. gradually peel up enough of one end and rip away once hard and pretty cool.</li>
            <li> This product is great, but not for the faint of heart! I have used it on my bikini line and boy howdy does it HURT! but, then again, that is what I expected from violently ripping my body hair off with hot wax....&lt;br /&gt; I use it mostly on my eyebrows and its great. It actually hurts less than plucking since its all at once then you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this a dozen times already, it&#x27;s a great product, highly recommended. Will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> This wax is super easy to use and better than them sticky pads that don&#x27;t remove the hair. This works great Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used. Though it takes a while to apply and wax, it is extremely efficient and I love it. Gets all my hairs off without any trouble and leaves me loving my skin afterwards. It also lasts several uses, so it&#x27;s worth its price 100%.</li>
            <li> This is a great wax... removes most hairs the very first time...don&#x27;t have to go back over again and again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bad product for one reason&lt;br /&gt;I made it warm then i wanted to use it&lt;br /&gt;but it sticked in my hand when i wanted to&lt;br /&gt;use it it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> When I used it first time I find it very nice.. Less pain easy to operate.. But when I used it on my legs second time I got red spots pimple kind of things on leg ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing</li>
            <li> I am a newbie to waxing myself, but after 3 times it was much easier and less painful each time I waxed my bikini area. It can be messy, so be prepared with an old towel on the floor. And whatever you do...don&#x27;t let the wax sit on the hair too long and harden...OUCH!!! I am speaking from experience! The pre-oil helps a ton too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and used this product for the past several years and I highly recommend it to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;I have the entire kit, and it is very easy to use! Also very very cost efficient.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product on my bikini, and armpits.&lt;br /&gt;It is very gentle and if I was to give a tip on how to use it, The thicker the layer is on your chosen area, the easier and less painful it is to \\&quot;wax\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spread a thin layer thinking less is better, It is not! Nice thick layers!</li>
            <li> This wax works well and I do not get bruised by it! I highly recommend Gigi Brazilian Hard Wax. BTW, I prefer the hard Wax versus the other we need a cloth to remove it.</li>
            <li> Always wanted to be hair free in an area that I consider a little private to show off at the salon.  I know they see it all the time but ... whatever.  Anyway, this sure did the trick.  I read nearly every review so I could figure it out before the first attempt.  I guess all I can add is to make sure the layer applied is super thin then with your finger, keep pulling up at one of the edges so it&#x27;s turned up to dry, making it easier to grip - then rip off.  Don&#x27;t wait too long - you&#x27;ll psych yourself out and then it hurts so much more.  Just be super fast with the entire thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toward the end, I figured out that when the wax was applied thinly enough to nearly qualify as &amp;#34;strands&amp;#34;, that seemed to be the easiest, least messy and ripped the  hair out the best, taking everything with it.  Finally got down the concept that less is more (and less painful than the glob approach).  I&#x27;m a very frugal person but saving the wax and straining it to use again isn&#x27;t for me.  Just toss it - the product doesn&#x27;t cost a fraction of what the salon does.  Pamper yourself - don&#x27;t cause more work.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff a few weeks ago and just got around to using it.  I originally used Cerepil&#x27;s Blue Hard wax but realized it was a bit expensive considering the cost of other hard waxes available on Amazon.  Boy the saying \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; cannot be more true in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Gigi&#x27;s hard wax a complete disaster.  It would constantly crack and break apart after pulling it along with the hair.  I&#x27;m convinced this stuff wasn&#x27;t hard wax, and was intended to be used with those cloth strips.  No matter how I tried applying (thin, thick, with or without a lip) it would constantly rip apart leaving pieces stuck on me. I spent literally 6 hours between preparation, application, and showering to get the remnants off in just trying to get this crap off my chest.  I will never use this garbage again and will gladly go back to using Cerepil&#x27;s Blue hard wax.  At least that wax didn&#x27;t rip apart when trying to remove and was easy to clean.  Gigi&#x27;s wax is cheap and clearly so because it&#x27;s garbage.</li>
            <li> the most dirty wax i have ever used. i am the most unsatisfied customer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a gum it&#x27;s really bad i&#x27;ll never purchase such thing Thumb down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 4 different waxes and this is the best so far! Also a good price.</li>
            <li> Works very well! Everything I wanted.</li>
            <li> Very good product although can be messy (as all wax can be). Make sure to have a towel or cardboard under you when using. Works best applied thick.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described. All Gigi products have always worked great for me and I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> really good wax, when you use it just make sure is really liquid without burning your skin because if is a little solid (because is cooling) then it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every time.  I don&#x27;t even care to try another. Works great and always ships on time</li>
            <li> As the title says it does the job. though wax doesn&#x27;t come off easily so it leaves it a mess. Be prepared.</li>
            <li> Extremely annoying to work with- the wax is very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! With a thin coat of coconut oil, it hardly hurts, it&#x27;s not nearly as messy as soft wax, it just plain rocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend using this stuff in a warm room, otherwise it cools to breaking point too quickly. I also highly recommend using a thin layer of coconut oil prior to applying wax, since it keeps the wax from adhering to the skin, and prevents a lot of the cracking problems, not to mention the pain of ripping skin. Even the drips of wax that ran down my legs ripped up hairs (by accident, but a happy accident)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping my hair wouldn&#x27;t break off when I used it, but that&#x27;s not the wax, that&#x27;s the person on whom the wax is being used (and her epic failure with beauty processes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning curve was very small, I got used to this stuff very quickly. I used a cheap candle warmer to heat it, and it took forever to warm up, but after that, it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little tip I learned with using it (and oil, don&#x27;t forget the oil) is to pull it up a lot more slowly than you might think you should, as this prevents the hair from breaking as much (yes, one half of my leg is much smoother than the other...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m thrilled. So much that I&#x27;m buying another can of it right now. True story. My last experience with home waxing was a misery, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything great from this, but I was very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And bonus, it&#x27;s super-cheap. Even used pretty thickly, half a can is all you need for both legs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s really messy and stringy, but I&#x27;m fairly certain all wax is like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be doing another round of waxing before I leave for vacation, since I&#x27;ve missed quite a few, and the ones that broke need to be collected, but I have plenty left for this. Awesome.</li>
            <li> I needed some wax refills since I do a lot of waxing at my job and at home. They did not even send the right product. It was a tiny free trial wax that was not even the same type. Do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I lived in Brazil and have been waxing Brazilian style for 22 years. Hard wax and a light baby OIL pre treat is the best for DIY bikini, lip and underarm areas. Use Honee and Pre treat with baby POWDER on legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I use it in a very thick layer therefore I don&#x27;t use it on legs (would turn out to be too expensive to cover larger areas). On legs, I still use pre-waxed strips which are not good for using anywhere else. This wax did work great and removed about all hair. Of course, it hurts but I am happy about its quality as I really don&#x27;t want to go through all the turmoil of setting up and pain only to discover that 3/4 hair are still in. I just want the hair to be gone and this wax does it. Four stars because thin layers don&#x27;t work that well but I will change the rating if I find out a good method.&lt;br /&gt;Under arms, it did remove only 1/2 hair but I believe it was because it was way too short, a couple of millimeters or 1/10 of an inch.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a wax that is easy to use at home. Not only is it easy to use it also gets all of the hair off without hurting your skin. I have had hard wax used on me before but only in a salon. Being able to get salon results at home has made this purchase worth it. The only advice I would give is that because of the extremely low melting point I would recommend leaving the heat setting low.</li>
            <li> Good product. I wish it cooled a little faster. I actually heated this product stove top in hot water. It took a while but worked just fine. I love that it does not require strips. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Perfect wax. Good quality. Gets the job done efficiently.</li>
            <li> Let me say that this stuff is great and gets the job done.  IF you have a partner to wax you.  AND you figure out the right consistency.  Getting the temperature dialed in is a feel thing and takes practice...you also need to adjust while you go to keep it right.  If it&#x27;s too hot it goes on too thin and takes too long to cool...poor results.  Still way better than having a stranger wax you and paying through the nose once a month!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to solo wax pubic area.  It can be done but will be to much hassle for most.</li>
            <li> this stuff was a nightmare, what a mistake.  terrible wax.  was not at all what i was expecting, disapointed :)</li>
            <li> As a cosmetologist, This is the only brand of wax I use, I am in love with this wax, it does not irritate the skin and does not leave and sticky residue, I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> Works well for arm pits and upper arm, horrible for legs and arms. Haven&#x27;t used on bikini area.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to paying the salon for a wax. Hard wax is generally less painful than strip wax, but it has it&#x27;s downsides. First, you need to use more wax to get a thick layer to pull off, so you go through a container a lot more quickly. This is a good time to note that keeping the wax at a low temperature will allow you to apply enough wax to be able to pull it off. I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend hard wax to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a fair amount of experience with strip wax. It&#x27;s hard enough figuring out the pattern of your hair growth when you&#x27;re not dealing with all the other variables. However, having said that, hard wax does kind of let you pull the wax out in any direction and still hold on to the hair. I do always hold on to a container of strip wax to get those hard to reach places, though. Sometimes waiting for the wax to cool is just not an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for where this falls in line with other hard waxes, it&#x27;s great. Lovely smell, no irritation. The warmer and accessories that come with the kit are great, too.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;ve always used the GiGi all purpose wax and love it but the Brazillain Body Hard Wax wasn&#x27;t so good.... I&#x27;ll use it till it&#x27;s gone but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  This wax was just breaking apart.</li>
            <li> I wound up being allergic to&lt;br /&gt;This so I can&#x27;t use it and I got a realllly bad rash!!!!! Will not buy again!!!!</li>
            <li> This product works! I was looking for a hard wax because it&#x27;s the only type I&#x27;ve encountered since I&#x27;ve started getting a Brazilian. I had always felt like it was pricey to go to a professional but never thought about doing it myself until my friend convinced me as she started waxing herself at home. So I did my research and stumbled upon this.. Now, I do not have experience with waxing but I read a few reviews, tips and watched a YouTube video then proceeded to my first attempt with a diy Brazilian. It took me about 20 mins from start to finish and surprisingly, it did not hurt at all!! I honestly don&#x27;t know why I use to pay $60 for the service plus pain!! My skin typically gets really sensitive and red after a wax, but this product did not do that to my skin! I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product!!</li>
            <li> Works well with my wax warmer. Love it and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I originally had the normal wax from Gigi and that stuff was a mess, hard to work with, and hard to clean up...I am not a professional, so that might have been why.  But the Brazilian wax has been so easy to use, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with cleanup.  Plus it requires less stuff (no fabric strips needed!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this wax. I use it to do my own Brazilians and it&#x27;s worked out well with my method:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - I take a high dose aspirin an hour in advance.&lt;br /&gt;2 - I use a numbing gel (lidocaine, which is prescribed to me) and let it soak in for a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;3 - I sprinkle baby powder to keep the wax from sticking to my skin (not sure if this is a legit method, but the wax repels from my skin and attaches to the hair)&lt;br /&gt;4 - I move quickly and use a wax strip instead of waiting for this to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it does dry, or if I mess up with the strip, it&#x27;s still easy to pull off once it hardens. Again, not a waxer, not sure if my method is &#x27;the best&#x27;, but it&#x27;s easy peasy for this long time DIYer.</li>
            <li> Use this to take the hair off my arms (don&#x27;t judge me). Fantastic product. Peels away nicely!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, convenient and very affordable. Got the heater with it and works perfectly. I like that you won&#x27;t need the fabric thingy to use it. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been waxing my back and shoulders for the last 6 months and after reading all the reviews I decided to give this a shot. It took me 1 full hour for the wax to warm up I had the lady start on my shoulders and the wax was so thick that after taking off SOME hair the wax was stuck on my skin. I&#x27;m not sure why? Can someone please help me?</li>
            <li> This wax is so thin, I cannot grab the end to pull.  I have even tried putting more than one layer of wax on the same spot to get it thick enough to be able to pull the end...no luck.</li>
            <li> Worked great.  I didn&#x27;t experience any brittle crumbling.  Be careful not to set the warmer to high and make sure you exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Stuff works great for the price, but make sure to use a nice thick amount, usually a couple layers thick, also make sure it is smooth so it wont break when you pull it off.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!! 3rd purchase, will buy again.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but I don&#x27;t care for the color. It&#x27;s a honey-yellow, which doesn&#x27;t really stand out enough for a hard wax. it should be dark green or red like other hard waxes, so that it&#x27;s easier to see where you&#x27;ve applied the wax (I use this to wax myself, not other people).  After a few months of waxing steadily with this wax I have some additional input on its performance. It&#x27;s great for facial hair but I find it not effective enough for heavily hairy places like legs or bikini or brazilian. Generally it always misses some hair and I need to wax the same spot 2 or more times. For small sections like eyebrows it&#x27;s not a big deal, but for the legs it gets to be a waste of wax and money and time -- shaving is easier.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much! I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell but that is because I dont like what honey smells like.Only thing stopping it from getting 5 stars is that the tin came dinged.  This did not effect its fit into the warmer but it did stop the plastic lid from fitting when cooled.</li>
            <li> I gave it five stars because it shipped here really fast and I love not having to use strips to take it off. It&#x27;s fast and easy!! It also gets all the hair at once compared to other waxes I&#x27;ve tried which is much better than having to re wax the area. Its by far the best wax I&#x27;ve used at least for me and I love being able to wax at home and save tons of money rather than having to go to a salon multiple times to pay to have my eyebrows waxed and etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to use cloth in order to rip this wax off.  It is thick and easy to apply and peels off easily.</li>
            <li> I love this wax because you don&#x27;t need cloth to pull it off. It&#x27;s easy to apply and not messy. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I would completely recommend this product. I love it so much I just ordered another! It&#x27;s great for facial and private areas. You usually need to make it a thicker so you can pull any coarse hairs away but, its better than any other wax I&#x27;ve used. Usually waxes have one purpose and that&#x27;t it. This wax is perfect for anything you may need to use it for. I just wish I could buy a bigger size. :)</li>
            <li> I wrote a review when I purchased the warming kit for this wax and I have used it often enough that I needed to get a refill wax!  I love the convenience of having the kit available when I want and the non-salon prices can&#x27;t be beat.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good price for this wax. However it does not work without the paper strips. It serves its purpose. . .</li>
            <li> This wax was difficult to use.  I tried the other GiGi waxes and they are great and easy to use.  On this Brazilian wax you have to be quick and know for sure where you are putting the strip or the wax dries to fast and will not get much off.  So for myself I would try one of the other GiGi waxes.</li>
            <li> love it. Is the same stuff that is used in the salon but you will need someone else to help you to do it</li>
            <li> This was is incredible !!! Perfect for bikini waxes. I&#x27;ve been using it for few years and it never disappoints me. I just let it warm up on medium for about 40 minutes while I do something else, and prepare the area with baby powder. I just have myself an Amazing Brazilian wax and I&#x27;m 37 weeks pregnant. If I can do it anyone can</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wax for over a year and continue to really like it. It did take some getting used to, as I started with the soft wax. You have to make sure it&#x27;s applied thick enough, otherwise you end up with little patches of wax that are hard to remove. If this happens, add more wax over that area, let it cool and then remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it on my eyebrows, just larger areas. I&#x27;m not sure how it would work in a smaller application area.</li>
            <li> The product does its job and gets the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;A few points though:&lt;br /&gt;- Do NOT use it if you dont know what you&#x27;re doing, especially your bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;- It is messy as most of the people do say.. its harder to get the bits out.&lt;br /&gt;- Its time consuming, or maybe I was just slow. If you have the patience to practice and get pro. This is quite neat.&lt;br /&gt;- Buy the warmer, its easier with the warmer.</li>
            <li> It worked well only on the coarse hair. A little painful but better that other products for the bikini area. Need a warmer to melt the wax, since I did not have one, I melted it in a pot filled with boiling water.</li>
            <li> Not for me at all ... it doesnt work with strips . it was a waste for me totally so 1 star</li>
            <li> Bought this when I bought the GiGi Student Starter Kit and I use this more than the all purpose wax that came in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No muslin strips are required here!  You simply apply and rip off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melts in the warmer in an adequate amount of time and is just like the wax you see in the salons.</li>
            <li> This system is the best out there for the home waxer.  I just do my eyebrows so the tub lasts for well over a year.</li>
            <li> I bought it a month ago, and just take it out to use it today. I hate it up with the wax warmer then put it on my leg to wax. the wax wont come off and it&#x27;s like candle wax, and it burned me.I hated it! It&#x27;s nothing like what I used. I&#x27;m very upset and I cant return it. So please people dont buy this wax. I&#x27;m a professional and I&#x27;ve been waxing for myself and clients for years. But this one is worse I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I tried this to see if I liked the hard wax better than the other. For me personally I didn&#x27;t like it better at all. This one hurts worse than the other waxes do. So it&#x27;s back to the regular kind for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great salon quality hard wax. It is difficult to use for first - timers, but once you know what you are doing, there really isn&#x27;t any better wax out there. I have very thick hair, that any sugar based wax/ roll- on wax does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I do not feel confortable going to a wax salon for a brazilian wax (besides the price that we have to pay every 15 days and so), so I ordered the entire kit and now I do it byself at home. Great Product!</li>
            <li> I have used the GiGi brand hard wax for a long time and I have been very happy with it. I have sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t have any problems with this wax irritating my skin as other brands have. I would recommend this GiGi hard wax for anyone looking for a quality hard wax that is good for sensitive skin. I have purchased this from Amazon.com several times and I have always had a good experience and it has arrived on time in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> this product is so much cheaper on Amazon I had to buy 2 of them. I use to have a license to wax  amongst other things, This product really works well if you develop a technique (practice).Baby oil will remove any mistakes, so don&#x27;t rib off if left on too long. It is very easy to leave on too long. It works great, All smooth:). With practice you get faster. I put sown an old sheet on the bathroom floor and go for it. Need warming pot. The warming pot with temp. variation; not just on and off.</li>
            <li> It takes some time to get used to waxing at home, but this wax is the way to go.  You don&#x27;t need to use fabric strips and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed for years using normal Gigi wax. I have had a full waxing done at the salon so I knew what to do. I used this on my legs first to get used to it. No matter how thick you put it, it does not pull off, it cracks and breaks. I worked with it for about an hour even though the first try told me what I wanted to know about it. I even tried using it with strips. Someone else mentioned that maybe this should be done. It doesn&#x27;t work with those either. It still breaks and stays on the skin. It took 3 days to scrub off what was left. I bought it at Sallys and because of that I was able to get my money back. If you try this at least buy it at a store where it costs nothing to return it.</li>
            <li> it was not what i ordered, it made a big mess, it was not clear on the cover what it was!&lt;br /&gt;bummer,&lt;br /&gt;i usually have the same wax everytime,</li>
            <li> Takes forever to melt and spreads okay - but breaks a lot when pulling it out! Leaves wax due to the same reason and gets tough to remove later! I like it - does the job but isn&#x27;t very great to continue buying it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My wife does my eyebrows and I do her.... well, you know. I feel I should get a job at a salon for how good I&#x27;m getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will share that you need to make sure the hair is trimmed properly as the wax can get away from you real quick if you&#x27;re inexperienced. Once, the wax got a little too close to the wife&#x27;s lady nibbin thingy and latched onto some of the hairs in that region. She wasn&#x27;t too happy after that. I insisted I could remove it without too much discomfort. She didn&#x27;t agree and kicked me out of the room almost in tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are still married and she still lets me wax her every 2 weeks so it couldn&#x27;t have been that bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the self waxing, but this stuff is amazing! I get over a month with no hair, then whrn it does start to grow back it&#x27;s much less hair than before, &amp; thinner too! I&#x27;m so glad I found this wax.</li>
            <li> This is great wax. Maybe not for the beginer but isnt hard to use at all. Cloth strips are not needed for this product and had a nice bees wax smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing for about 20 years. I have used other GiGi products over the years. I have used a couple of different hard waxes and thought that I would give it a try. I would not recommend this wax as it is very similar to their non hard wax. It takes way too long for the wax to dry and is very difficult to remove from your skin and residual pieces do not come off with baby oil like other hard waxes. It took more time to wax and I finally covered less area due to frustration with the product. The hair removing capability of this wax seemed less.</li>
            <li> I use this wax for my brows and bikini area.  There is definitely a learning curve, but it so much better than shaving!  I like the hard wax much better than regular wax as well.</li>
            <li> I use this wax at home when I cannot get into a salon or want to do touch ups and it works perfectly fine. I understand there are better hard waxes out there, but many aren&#x27;t for sale in small quantities or at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  You can&#x27;t beat the price and how much you will save in doing this yourself at home.  I followed another reviewers helpful advice and had my armpits done in no time and no pain.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this product. I&#x27;ve been getting Brazilians and my underarms done for several years, so I knew the general gist of how to use the product. I still watched several YouTube video&#x27;s beforehand, since I&#x27;ve never actually done it myself before. I would really suggest not piling it on too thick. It can get kind of taffy-like when you pile it on too thick and then doesn&#x27;t pull off as it should. It&#x27;s a fine art though, because if its too thin you get a lot of leftover flaky wax which is a pain in the butt to get rid of. But too much and it&#x27;s not as effective and hard to pull off. So I would say apply thin-ish layer but don&#x27;t dab it on, cause thats when it gets flaky and obnoxious. I would also recommend showering before you use this especially if you have used deodorant that day and are planning on doing your underarms, cause it needs to be washed off for the wax to be most effective. My routine consists of first turning the machine on high at least an hour before you want to start waxing to melt the wax, and then after its all melted I alternate between low and turning it off for a few minutes, otherwise it gets too hot.  Then I apply some baby powder to the region to get rid of any excess moisture, and then I apply the wax in a moderate amount in the direction of the hair growth, trying not to spread it out too thin. If you can get it applied in a solid line, that is optimal. DO NOT PAT IT ON with the stick around the edges of the initial spread of wax, that&#x27;s when you get it flaky and it&#x27;s a pain in the ass to get off. If you have to apply more wax I found it best to just apply it directly on top of the initial layer and then trying to evenly spread it out.  Then let it sit for around 30 seconds or until its hard and no longer warm. Then pull it off in the opposite direction of hair growth. It can be tricky when you can&#x27;t exactly see the direction of hair growth, and you may unfortunately have to wax twice (this wax is gentle enough where it shouldn&#x27;t be aproblem-it wasn&#x27;t for me, and I have fairly sensitive skin that is prone to irritation). I think most problems that come with this are from user error, and it&#x27;s a really good wax. It also smells good in my opinion (like beeswax), and I noticed a lot less irritation with this vs. whatever they used in the salons and a LOT less irritation than with sugaring, and far less pain in my case than when I paid to get it done. You are not a sissy for popping a few advil half an hour before use though, that&#x27;s what I did and it seemed to help a lot. For anyone who loves being waxed but hates paying the price I would invest in the Gigi machine and the hard wax. It&#x27;s super worth it.  I would say this is as good of a wax as any and at an extremely reasonable price. I would not recommend trying this without getting it done professionally at least once though, so you know what to expect.  Part of the reason it was so easy for me to use was because I had a lot done before I decided to do it myself, and I like doing it myself more than getting it done.  The whole process (brazillian and underarms) took me around an hour and a half to two hours, but I took my time and was distracted by watching some Netflix.  Don&#x27;t rush it or you will for sure mess it up and will have some regret.</li>
            <li> This wax is amazing. I have tried many other waxes and none work as well as this one does. You have to make sure that you oil your skin before applying it so that it doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin. I like to use coconut oil. I love how this wax doesn&#x27;t break like other waxes I have used and I don&#x27;t get little pieces left behind. It would be a good idea to go and get a few professional waxes before trying to do one on your self just so you know how to do it. Also there are some good you tube videos. All in all I really love this wax and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The wax is good but alittle bit hard than I thought and if u leave too long on ur skin it will be fragile and broke and difficult to remove it  so don&#x27;t leave it too long and put a thick layer Cz if u put A thin layer u never can remove it but over all it is very good</li>
            <li> This wax is absolutely amazing. I &#x27;m not new to waxing but this was my first using hard wax and it was a painfree experience to say the very least.</li>
            <li> worth the price. I have bought this product many times. love it</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all the great reviews on here. I&#x27;m glad I decided to try this wax. I&#x27;m a first-time self waxer and went straight to trying the Brazilian on myself. I read some tips online and watched a couple YouTube videos and figured I could handle it myself. Honestly, it does take practice and it will hurt, but I think the pain is the same as if you were getting it professionally done. You&#x27;ll have to play around with the wax a bit and work section by section (determining what&#x27;s best for you). I didn&#x27;t buy the wax warmer contraption but instead used a candle/hot plate I had lying around. I had to wait about 2-3 hours for it to heat up but that was ok. I also bought some wide popsicle sticks at my local craft store to apply the wax on the designated area (they worked great). I definitely recommend this product. It&#x27;s easy to use, remove and does its job!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! Removes hair without removing layers of your skin. I can even use on my face. I cannot love without this and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like this wax. It&#x27;s easy to use and seems to remove most hair from one use. Only down side; it takes about 30 minutes to melt.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  It melts quickly and does exactly what it is supposed to.  Because it hardens, cleanup is really easy in case you drip any (unlike regular waxes).  I was looking for a hard wax to use for removing nose hair (I am not a professional nor have I ever had my nose waxed) and came across GiGi Hard Wax.  I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re supposed to use it for that or not, but I sure did and am very pleased with the product.  Use a popsicle stick and put a small ball of wax on the end, let cool slightly and pop inside. Some tips: make sure that 1) you don&#x27;t put too far up in the nostril; 2). you wiggle it around once inside to make sure it coats all hair (I wiggled around and did one half turn of the popsicle stick once inside); and 3) most importantly, make sure it has COMPLETELY hardened before attempting removal.  I know that this is different than what is suggested with waxing the other body parts where you want some pliability and remove before the wax is fully hard.  But, if you don&#x27;t let it harden completely you will pull out the stick, but no wax (seriously!!)...leaving the wax inside for more torturous removal of smaller pieces one at a time!  I had this happen on the first side I did and learned my lesson the hard way - ouf.  Second time I think I left mine in for 3-4 minutes and make sure you pull straight down (not out) in one fell swoop or you will really just tug on your nose and be too freaked out to finish.  I even did the husbands nose and just outside the ear canal where guys grow hair and did the same popsicle technique and it worked great.  I haven&#x27;t used it for legs/arms/bikini so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but good product overall.</li>
            <li> This wax is harder to use, clean up is awful, gets stuck to your nails really bad!! Not a fan at all! And it&#x27;s painful to take off. I suggest buying a different kind of wax.</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW EASY IT IS TO APPLY AND REMOVE! I used to get the all-purpose wax from GiGi but now I will look forward to buying this one from now on! It doesn&#x27;t need any special strips and it doesnt hurt as much as the all-purpose one does. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have purchase this wax multiple times. Never fails.</li>
            <li> As a novice home-waxer, I bought this at the same time as the All Purpose Honee wax, after hearing that harder wax was much gentler on the skin. I was also really attracted to the idea that you didn&#x27;t need muslin cloths to remove the wax (less waste!)    Sadly, this stuff just doesn&#x27;t remove hair from my body. I don&#x27;t know what it is -  I have medium toned skin &amp; light brown/blonde hair. The hard wax would not remove my (black, dark) leg hair, nor would it remove my stray (darker) eyebrow hairs, hair from my bikini line/underarms, nor the fine blonde hairs on my forearm. I watched SO many videos on youtube on the specific techniques of applying &amp; using hard wax, and I&#x27;m at a loss as to what the problem is. Is my hair too fine? Is my hair too light? Is the problem the wax itself? (I always tone my skin &amp; apply powder before every waxing.)    I tried applying it thickly, I tried applying it thinly. I spent hours trying to get the \\&quot;flick\\&quot; of pulling the tab of wax in just the right way for it to remove the hair. And what do I get? This wax will remove MAYBE 3 or 4 hairs in one pull (wtf?) whereas the soft (Honee) wax removes almost EVERYTHING in one pull.    I can&#x27;t figure out what the problem is.  I&#x27;m glad at least that the Honee wax works well for me, because this stuff is MYSTIFYING.</li>
            <li> This is a great, great product. I am waxing for 5 years now (by myself) and this is by far the best wax ever. i tired different ones, and they either too sticky or break in pieces. I honestly became a fan of GiGi products and i just bought they numbing spray as well. Coming back to this wax, it leaves a very soft skin. I absolutely love the product. i will never purchase any other wax than this. I use it for ALL the areas of my body that need hair removal.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE HARD WAX. I DIDN&#x27;T HAVE TO USE THE STRIP OR EXTRA MATERIAL TO WAX.  I NORMALLY WOULD GET MINE AT THE SALLY BEAUTY SUPPLY FOR 16.00 BUT THIS WAS CHEAPER.</li>
            <li> It was the worst wax I ever experienced. When I rub it on skin, it becomes so hard and doesn&#x27;t seperate from body. When there is a particle that is left on your skin you it becomes so hard that you can not remove it. So at the end you have a lot of parts that are messy and some parts the hairs are removed. It was the most disastereble experience I had. A few drops are on my carpet that I couldn&#x27;t remove them at all plus that I had to put in garbage one of my cloths that some drops of this wax was on it because you can not wash it away once it drops some where even on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it multiple times. Bought it twice and it&#x27;s just not good. It&#x27;s gets hard too quickly and hurts a lot more than the regular wax</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret trying to wax myself. I am a working mother of 2 and I have a hard time keeping up with beauty appointments. I wanted to try to wax my arms myself. It was quick and easy, and it was my first time. This strip free wax is very good.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find better wax for brazilian waxing than this one. I have clients with all sorts of hair and this one removes it all. No allergy, no hair left behind. Perfection.</li>
            <li> I have been using GiGi hard wax for over a year now and I must say it works for course hair!</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product and I had to give it a try. I had previously used pre-packaged wax strips for years, but recently ended up having it rip off a thin layer of skin.  Not good.  But THIS stuff is amazing.  I don&#x27;t have the wax heater machine, so I warm it in my oven (remove the plastic lid and place the metal container inside).  Once it&#x27;s applied, you let it cool for about a minute and when you remove the wax a ton of hair is attached.  When you feel your skin afterward, it feels soft and smooth.  I have even used it multiple times on the same area with NO irritation. It has a pleasant smell too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I will only use this product from here on out.</li>
            <li> the only brazilian wax I&#x27;ve been using for 5 years</li>
            <li> Way better then any other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using GiGi brazilian body wax for a while now and this is the only hard wax that works on me!</li>
            <li> good stuff, it works well on the brazilian area and would recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a good wax for body hair removal, i&#x27;ve had it for over a year now, granted I don&#x27;t wax very often so it has lasted me awhile</li>
            <li> No cutting wax strips required. Follow directions listed in other reviews, watch you tube videos, or at least go get one professionally done first to learn. Other than that it&#x27;s a great way to DIY beauty and save all the money I was spending on monthly waxes. I primarily use this for facial waxing (lip and brow). Hint: use a small utensil to apply wax to face. It&#x27;s easier to control that way.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to use plenty of the oil before applying wax, makes it so much easier and less painful to pull off!</li>
            <li> I usually love GiGi Wax products and have used other brands of hard wax and love them. This brand just break off each time making the process very painful! Wont be using - Throwing away!!</li>
            <li> I bought the actual kit from Gigi a few months ago, when I ran out of the actual hardwax that was when I bought this. I works great, and fits well. This has been a huge time saver and money saver for me. Plus the product arrived on time. No more shaving for me, just a waxing maintenance once every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the only wax I use. It&#x27;s so easy and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as other waxes I&#x27;ve tried, and after using it a few times, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! It takes a while to heat up and melt, but is pretty quick to cool down and harden. One of the best things I like about this wax…NO MUSLIN STRIPS! Just apply with wooden stick, wait for wax to solidify and cool, peel up an edge, and strip away! It takes a few tries to get used to knowing when the wax is ready to be stripped off, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s pretty easy. I purchased this as a kit and it came with a video, which I highly recommend watching because it is pretty informative and gives some good tips on using this wax and will have you waxing like a pro in no time.</li>
            <li> This wax will get all the stubborn hair off of your hooha. There&#x27;s a video in YouTube that you can watch of a woman doing her own educational DIY Brazilian waxing. Watch it, I did and it helped me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at Sally Beauty. They have a buy 1 get 1 free of the hard wax and the wax warmer was on sale. I did not buy any pre-replication oil or creams. I just bought the wax warmer, the hard wax (with 1 free) and a big popsicle stick to spread the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you open the wax warmer, you&#x27;ll see a collar for the wax so it won&#x27;t drip. I suggest make patterns of it out of board or thick paper for future use. Saves you the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare your oil (I used olive oil), Baby powder, cotton rounds, trash can, mirror and tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat on a towel to catch any wax on the couch or seat. I did not take any Advil and pain was fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took me a good hour to get it done. Cleaned the area and started to clean the sides as I worked through the middle - which I think was the most painful part. Don&#x27;t forget to apply a little amount of oil or powder (I applied both), so the wax will just pull out hair and not skin.  Spread a medium sized amount of wax and pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most difficult part was getting rid of the hairs &amp;#34;back there&amp;#34;  I tried bending over and squatting, and I found that bending over with my foot and leg on a chair was the best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find a local Sally Beauty near you and get the membership card, gives you a discount. So I purchased mine not even close to $75. A jar of wax might last you a long time depending on amount of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest to buy the wax warmer. Definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Best wax there is. I loathe muslim strips and am so glad to have this available to me. I use it regularly and it works like a charm. Buying a wax warmer to heat this up finally solved the perpetual issue of paying $25 to be waxed or getting sally hansen&#x27;s microwave wax. Yes, I use this on my face only although it says it&#x27;s for body....it works great. Use a little talcum powder underneath for a stronger take when the wax is setting.  I will never be without this!</li>
            <li> It is very good! Good wax!</li>
            <li> I have to wax often, and I use this instead of sugar wax.  I couldn&#x27;t ever get the sugar wax to work, it just made a big mess.  This hard wax pulls off much better.  Though there are always remnants left on my face, so I do it at night, so the rest of the wax comes off overnight, before work the next day.</li>
            <li> a quality hard wax.  Just remember, don&#x27;t be cheap when you apply it on, and leave a little goop near the end so you can grab it easily when you pull.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for brazilian waxes on yourself. You don&#x27;t need the muslin strips for this because the wax hardens enough that you can just rip it right off. A tip though, make sure your hair is about a centimeter long. Any longer and the wax won&#x27;t be able to rip it off and it&#x27;ll be like taking bubblegum out of your hair. Very painful. GiGi is wonderful for home-waxing products. Extremely cheap, and worth way more than what you&#x27;re paying.</li>
            <li> I love this hard wax. I am African woman and have pcos. As a result of pcos and bad laser hair removal treatment I struggle with facial hair. Before I purchase the Gigi spa wax set I used to pay $50 + tip to get my full face wax at salon every week. A friend suggested I use this to save money. The best suggesting ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product. It is really easy to use and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waxing I use aloe Vera or rose water to avoid break out.</li>
            <li> second time ordering this product happy so far</li>
            <li> PERFECT!!! forget about going to a salon; this wax is exactly like the brazilian wax salons - and I can tell because I am brazilian!!! its perfect and worthwhile.</li>
            <li> It works good but OMG what I mess I make! And sometimes the entire wax doesn&#x27;t come off...ahhhhhh!! Frustrating. The awesome thing is that my hair grew out So much softer and I haven&#x27;t shaved for weeks!</li>
            <li> This stuff saves me SO much money compared to a salon waxing.  I&#x27;ll admit, there&#x27;s a little bit of a learning curve to DIY waxing, but once I got the hang of it, my monthly waxing was barely a chore.  Also, 14oz is a generous amount.  My first container lasted me about 13 waxings. The wax warmer, wooden sticks, and wax all pay for themselves within the first use.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product. Sit the can in my warmer and use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better hard waxes, but this gets the job done. I recommend that you don&#x27;t wait too long before removing or else you&#x27;ll risk the wax chipping off instead of ripping off the full strip/area. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin but I probably won&#x27;t be buying this again (unless the other ones I try are worse than this one).</li>
            <li> So, it definitely works. I like the fact that you don&#x27;t need a cloth. However, the level of pain you feel is a ton greater (well, for me) than using the cloth... I&#x27;ve decided to switch over to the regular honey wax with cloth instead of this kind. Love the brand. Dependable. Yup.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s great product &amp; i like it.. But some times its hard to take out after applying for me that&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars.</li>
            <li> took forever to get here and when it finally arrived. it was all dented up!! wax took forever to heat up &amp; not efficient at all!</li>
            <li> Works with the Gigi starting kit</li>
            <li> The Gigi Hard Wax is really great. I put the wax can into the wax warmer. Then when it is warm enough I take it out and follow the instructions to remove unwanted hair. The wax hardens and can be removed without strips as stated. I don&#x27;t need to buy strips but this wax finishes more quickly. They recommend using a thick coat of wax so it will not last as long as regular strip waxes. Don&#x27;t let the wax harden too much though so follow the instructions carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the other Gigi products with it. First I use the Gigi Pre-Hon then baby powder on the area. Then after I wax, I use the Wax Off to remove any leftover residue. Finish off with the Post Wax Concealer. All the products worked great together. I would recommend the Gigi Hard Wax.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you do not put it on too thick.  Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s much less painful than using strips.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried every single hard wax available on Amazon. After trying them all, I have decided on this one. It is cheap and it works great.</li>
            <li> Good wax to use with the Gigi system.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as expected!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying GiGi Hemp Wax and Moom to attempt a brazilian wax.  The hemp wax was an awful kind of sticky and hard to clean up, so I went for Moom, because I found it locally.  This was nice and I had great success, but I hated using strips.  So hard wax was next on my list.  Found this through an amazon comment on another wax reviews and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Placed it in the warmer for about 30 minues, and it was melted and smooth.  Application was easy, I used a chopstick to roll the wax on in the direction of the hair growth, and got a nice even layer.  I added a second layer of the wax with excess on the pulling end.  I allowed the wax cool for a while, and found that there is a nice window of where the wax will let off of your skin just enough to get a corner started and where it broke into bits from being cool.  It seemed like the cooler the wax was, I had to pull more slowly.  It&#x27;s not a fast rip like with the strip waxing I tried, and I found if I pulled too fast, I would pull off a chunk.  I could then continue with the rest of the area I&#x27;d covered, but this took a while longer to finish.  I even got this really satisfying ziiiip once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It got some hairs the other wax missed on me (of course, I am a novice and it&#x27;s been 2 weeks since that first experience with Moom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very fine and breaks easily (some growth from in the hemp waxed area, where I think I broke the hairs off instead of pulling them out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL IN ALL:  I am very satisfied with this product, stripless wax is the one for me.  It will now be my go to for bikini waxing needs.</li>
            <li> I love it. Great quality product. It does take a little practice to learn to use it properly, but it gives consistently great results. I use it on my face, underarms, and bikini area.</li>
            <li> I use soft and hard waxes a lot and i feel like this one hurts more than other ones. I think its because this one is more of a honey texture and I usually work with cremes. I don&#x27;t even like how the application feels. It does an okay job and getting the hairs off though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my significant other&#x27;s back and it worked like a charm, but it&#x27;s also gentle enough to use on my face and eyebrows. 10 Stars. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> So far this wax works great!  It takes a little bit of time to get used to the best consistency, thinkness and temperature but once you get it-it works everywhere.  Cleans up nice and not sticky and a good price for the amount.</li>
            <li> I did not like the wax. It is very stiff and I could not use it without warmer if you want to buy it you should buy a warmer too</li>
            <li> The only hard wax I will buy or use. I had a professional wax and this is what they used. The container lasts for several waxes, making it a great buy.</li>
