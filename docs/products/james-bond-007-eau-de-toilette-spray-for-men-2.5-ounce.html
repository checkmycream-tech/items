            <li>I love 007 everything so this was a must.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to keep the women away.</li>
            <li>My Dad was pleased with this as a gift.  </li>
            <li>this is a sexy, woodsy fragrance.</li>
            <li>My husband smells super sexy when he wears this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s along the lines of Drakkar or Tsar if you&#x27;re familiar with these!</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly, too.  </li>
            <li>Not too overly strong.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, cool bottle</li>
            <li>Like the light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I got this for free in a gift basket.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t smell near as good as the oil.</li>
            <li>Thought it would be fun since it is the 50th anniversary of the James Bond Films....got the movies too!</li>
            <li>I bought this because they sell an oil version at a fragrance shop in the mall near me that smells amazing.</li>
            <li>cool gift, arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Seller responded to message quickly and product as described.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend investing in this top notch spray.  </li>
            <li>an added bonus, the actual top of the spray opens in a gadget-like way which I thought was really cool!</li>
            <li>Fresh and sophisticated for agents who possess the same qualities.</li>
            <li>Cool twist down cap and nice bottle.</li>
            <li>This gets 5 stars for a slightly different reason...one that is very important to internet shoppers.  </li>
            <li>I think my fiancé likes feeling like his cologne was issued to him by Q ;)</li>
            <li>:) ... next up get the car and $$$ to match ..LOL!</li>
            <li>This definitely has is a nice masculine scent!</li>
            <li>I was afraid the scent would be cheaply bold, but it is very nice!</li>
            <li>Now I can finally smell like Sean Connery and all my friends are jealous on how good it actually smells.</li>
            <li>Bought this half as a joke as I have been a huge bond fan for a while now, and I also enjoy collecting colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent reminds me of those knock offs of real colognes sold at drug stores.  </li>
            <li>Will purchase more when this is empty.</li>
            <li>My husband has lost his sense of smell and squited too much and drove me out of the car.</li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle aroma that works (in my opinion) better as a daily cologne.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance but a little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find such a large bottle for such a good price (it&#x27;s more expensive for smaller bottles on other sites).</li>
            <li>My 14 year old son loves this cologne.</li>
            <li>I.  Fragrance is intoxicating but not heavy.  </li>
            <li>Or, maybe I have yet to discover the top secret compartment that stores the real James Bond scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only is the package sleek and sharp, the cologne itself is in my top three and smells of nothing other than elegance and class.</li>
            <li>an added bonus, the way the lid comes &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; to allow you to spray the cologne is very cool and secret agent-esque.</li>

            <li> I got this for free in a gift basket.  Smells as good as an Octopussy.  I was shocked to see this cheesy idea actually has an attractive smell.  I&#x27;m a cologne snob too, I have 8 bottles currently from Versace, Gucci, Burberry, YSL, etc so to not dog this was surprising.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, cool bottle</li>
            <li> My husband smells super sexy when he wears this!</li>
            <li> This cologne gives you secret agent status.  I highly recommend investing in this top notch spray.  It&#x27;s a game changer.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old son loves this cologne. Great scent!</li>
            <li> Smells great...Quite possibly a {!} magnet. ha!</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> This is great.  I  wish the manufacturere would use the same fragrance in an aftershave lotion.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, package in good condition.  I was afraid the scent would be cheaply bold, but it is very nice!</li>
            <li> Good smell, good price, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> My son loves this scent.  This gets 5 stars for a slightly different reason...one that is very important to internet shoppers.  I purchased this for my son for his birthday.  I didn&#x27;t know he had recently done the same and was already using it.  The return was PAIN FREE !!! Gotta love AMAZON and PRIME.</li>
            <li> Got a smaller, sample bottle of this earlier this year, both my fiancé and I love the scent of it on him. I was glad to find such a large bottle for such a good price (it&#x27;s more expensive for smaller bottles on other sites). Haven&#x27;t opened this yet because we&#x27;re still using the sample bottle, but I don&#x27;t foresee any issues.&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, the way the lid comes &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; to allow you to spray the cologne is very cool and secret agent-esque. I think my fiancé likes feeling like his cologne was issued to him by Q ;)</li>
            <li> It has a nice subtle aroma that works (in my opinion) better as a daily cologne. I plan on trying the other scents in the line.</li>
            <li> He smells great!  I like it, he likes it.  What else do you need?  It arrived very quickly, too.  Very nice purchase.</li>
            <li> Received as a gift.  The scent reminds me of those knock offs of real colognes sold at drug stores.  Or, maybe I have yet to discover the top secret compartment that stores the real James Bond scent.</li>
            <li> Bought this half as a joke as I have been a huge bond fan for a while now, and I also enjoy collecting colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the package sleek and sharp, the cologne itself is in my top three and smells of nothing other than elegance and class. I was worried after reading reviews that it would smell like apples... not hardly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, the actual top of the spray opens in a gadget-like way which I thought was really cool!</li>
            <li> Great smell but it doesn&#x27;t hold up through the day very long.</li>
            <li> if I could rate it zero stars I would, this is the worst smelling cologne that I have ever owned</li>
            <li> Smells great! My wife and everyone love it. Great sent for the price. I recommend</li>
            <li> I love 007 everything so this was a must. It smells great just don&#x27;t last long at all. Cool twist down cap and nice bottle.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband who is kind of picky.  He loves the smell and so do I! Thought it would be fun since it is the 50th anniversary of the James Bond Films....got the movies too!</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and it smell so good. Yummy!</li>
            <li> Now I can finally smell like Sean Connery and all my friends are jealous on how good it actually smells.</li>

            <li> This definitely has is a nice masculine scent! It&#x27;s along the lines of Drakkar or Tsar if you&#x27;re familiar with these! Very cool packaging too!</li>
            <li> got it for my husband.. not too overpowering which is good!. maybe need 3?? squirts if u want the fragrance to reach before u do :) ... next up get the car and $$$ to match ..LOL!</li>
            <li> Purchased for husband. He loves it and so do I.  Fragrance is intoxicating but not heavy.  Will purchase more when this is empty.</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a department store and I could not stop thinking about how awesome it smelled. So when I came home, I popped on Amazon to get it. I only took a whiff because I was laughing at how gimmicky and cheesy it seemed to have a cologne for the Bond franchise. I mean, it&#x27;s just a marketing thing. But my goodness. It smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Good price</li>
            <li> My Dad was pleased with this as a gift.  It smells nice.</li>
            <li> My hubby is a Bond fan and I bought this for Christmas. I don&#x27;t like his cologne so I thought this would be a gift for both of us. I love the fragrance but a little dab will do ya. My husband has lost his sense of smell and squited too much and drove me out of the car. One squirt is sufficient. this is a sexy, woodsy fragrance.</li>
            <li> He liked it....and I think it smells great.</li>
            <li> 100% authentic, made in Germany! Seller responded to message quickly and product as described. A+++++</li>
            <li> The only scent a man should wear. Fresh and sophisticated for agents who possess the same qualities.</li>
            <li> Husband loved his Valentine&#x27;s Day gift. And it smells Devine.</li>
