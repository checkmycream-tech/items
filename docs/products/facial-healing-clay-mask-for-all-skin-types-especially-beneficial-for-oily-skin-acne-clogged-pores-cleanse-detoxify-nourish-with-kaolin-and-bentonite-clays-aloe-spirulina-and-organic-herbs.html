            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and my face is super smooth and moisturized!!  </li>
            <li>Wash off with warm water and then apply cool water to close pores..</li>
            <li>What I love about this product is how easy it is to use, even as a mother always in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the product is smooth and not grainy and I love how my skin feels as the mask begins to work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and great afterward.  </li>
            <li>It feels great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great product leaves my face feeling refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>it happens I had some questions about the products for my skin type and was impressed with the quick, personal, and  and thorough response by the company  to my questions.</li>
            <li>But the absolute best part of using the Oshi-Glows Clay mask is how refreshed and soft my face feels after!</li>
            <li>O*SHI GLOWS clay mask is a true treat to use!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and ease to remove.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I love how clean my face looks and feels after using this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and glides on smoothy.</li>
            <li>Works well and is easy to remove</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin -- VERY sensitive -- and this is great!</li>
            <li>The O*SHI GLOWS Clay Mask is a pleasure to use with its pleasant and natural scent; smooth and light texture; and the cleansing and toning effect it has on the skin.  </li>
            <li>so I was a little nervous about using it, but I am very happy I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Seems to work best when followed by Pure Hyaluronic Acid serum, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again as I am not feeling or noticing an improvement in the skin - especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I CAN&#x27;T TELL A HUGE DIFFERENCE, BUT CAN TELL AN IMPROVEMENT.  </li>
            <li>I love that is had a nice and natural scent to it.  </li>
            <li>you too enjoy and believe in “O’Shi Glows’ products as I do.</li>
            <li>was not asked to try this product, I bought this completely on my own (as well as the serum), and really like</li>
            <li>It is not drying and washes smoothly off.  </li>
            <li>Leave it on for the 10 minutes rinse it off and your face is smooth as can be.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic clay mask.  </li>
            <li>I like the texture, clean smell, and easy application.</li>
            <li>You can feel this go on smooth and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the application because the end results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and charming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good.  </li>
            <li>It has a mild, pleasant, natural herbal scent which I do not react to at all!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mask a couple times, I like how it feels, and it dries pretty quick which is nice.</li>
            <li>Makes my favorite feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>and it is easy and quick to rinse it off there.</li>
            <li>The mask is very nice and my skin did feel great after, but definitely not for dry or combination skin.</li>
            <li>I was excited to keep useing it again.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried a variety of different mud/clay masks and this, by far, ranks as the best.</li>
            <li>I really do feel that my skin is clearer and even has more of a glow to it.  </li>
            <li>But the next day, I had 2 people take notice to my skin looking good.</li>
            <li>I love this so much</li>
            <li>There is no bad smells either, No alcohol smells or chemical smells.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth and has a light natural scent.  </li>
            <li>The scent is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>And as a person who is sensitive to scents, I love that there are no artificial or strong perfume smells in this product.  </li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly, even though I did not use the &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; shipping.</li>
            <li>Love it it makes my face feel lighter younger and tighter love it</li>
            <li>This is a great facial mask and I will more than likely be purchasing again when I run out!</li>
            <li>My face feels soft afterwards and it definitely is cleaning the pores, I like that it has so many good ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>My face feels great (slightly tingly) while I have the mask on</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>This stuff elimintes the redness after each use and really helps to smooth out my skin</li>
            <li>I rarely break out</li>
            <li>I have found it leaves my skin glowing and fresh looking for a couple of days after even.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft this is.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin and it leaves my face feeling smooth, clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This facial mask is so easy to apply and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin fresh, clean and much softer.</li>
            <li>By far the best mask I have used in years and unlike previous products, O*SHI GLOWS is made with largely organic ingredients and is NOT tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>and when i opened the lid the seal came right off.</li>
            <li>I have used this a few times and it makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel soft afterward but didn&#x27;t really help my skin look any better.  </li>
            <li>The Oshi-Glows clay mask has a natural fragrance and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and it holds up to your skin’s cleanness, but know how it energizes and makes your skin so very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and smooth after using it</li>
            <li>My skin looks more vibrant and my breakouts are fer and far between!</li>
            <li>I also appreciate how easily the mask washes off with warm and a small washcloth.  </li>
            <li>Dries very very fast.</li>
            <li>After the first time using it my skin felt very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend O*Shi Glows as an effective, high quality facial product with mostly organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I used the mask and saw a difference by the first use</li>
            <li>This is the first clay mask I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>My skin tone started to even out after the first use.  </li>
            <li>This made my face feel tighter and smoother and overall better appearance in that area as well.</li>
            <li>What I am absolutely over-the-top impressed with is the customer service delivered by OSHI Glows.</li>
            <li>12 hours later my face is still smooth as can be and not oily at all!</li>
            <li>I love that you only need 10 mins.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how light this feels even after it drys.</li>
            <li>So many masks are overloaded with extra fragrance</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>First let me say that I have a beard</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean and smooth afterwards and is starting to appear much healthier.</li>
            <li>The facial mask is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>My oily skin has been reduced but my blemishes have still not decreased its size..</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin and have noticed a change in how my skin looks already.</li>
            <li>I apply it while getting things ready</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This mask really does revitalize and refreshen your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something gentle for my skin</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I feel a gentle tightening and coolness.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend</li>
            <li>It leaves my face clean and not dry.  </li>
            <li>and I told her about this mask, and now she wants it too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very soothing mask.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>really seems to get deep in the skin leaving a very refreshed feeling after with soft skin and feels like your skin just breathes better.</li>
            <li>Do not notice much of a difference after using this product and not the quality I had hoped for the price.</li>
            <li>Although my skin felt a bit tight still after removing the mask, my face felt very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t stink like many other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>It felt plump, fresh and clean, and I even noticed less blackheads.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a product to help my skin feel less oily and more.... silky.</li>
            <li>Came off easily with a wet cloth.</li>
            <li>Slightly oily, smell is just ok...</li>
            <li>I would suggest using a damp hot towel first on your face to open your pores, and then I would apply the mask..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>For the cost I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>but this one is natural, very gentle and not messy.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me, you will have a red face for a little while, good thing it clears up.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s gentle for frequent use.</li>
            <li>but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>I would need to use it for few more times before I can decided if it help with acne or reduce pores size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely  be buying more products from them in the near future..</li>
            <li>Have been using this mask for a few weeks and am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I normally have oily skin</li>
            <li>Since turning 40 I have been continually searching for new products to help defy the effects of aging and the environment on my skin.</li>
            <li>Made my skin super dry after one use.</li>
            <li>face felt clean and smooth afterwards, not sure I looked younger, though.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>I love that in just a few minutes I can be transported to the spa!</li>
            <li>face feeling soft!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and worried about trying a new product.</li>
            <li>face feels clean and soft without the dryness associated with other products I have used.</li>
            <li>It left my face smooth and didn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a large amount, so this will last for awhile.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little work to smooth it onto your face without some clumping.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>This facial masks really has a defined feel for your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural texture and glowing respsonse to my skin</li>
            <li>and it does leave my face soft afterward.  </li>
            <li>Silky soft face after use</li>
            <li>With just a 10-minute application my skin feels soft and nourished.  </li>
            <li>Does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(O*shi Glows Natural Anti Aging Skin Resurfacing &amp; Anyi Wrinkle Serum).</li>
            <li>I am a mom to a four month old.</li>
            <li>I also like that this is a natural, cruelty-free product.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face soft..</li>
            <li>I am over 50, and it leaves my skin soft too.  </li>
            <li>so I was surprised I used my moisturizer after.</li>
            <li>As a mother of two young children I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to pamper myself.</li>
            <li>No messy cleanup like some clay masks.  </li>
            <li>but it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft and refresh.</li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>I had scars from past acne, wrinkles forming and fine lines, I am starting to see changes for the positive.</li>
            <li>First, I wash my face and pat it dry.</li>
            <li>Clean out my pore and peels off all the dead skin. .</li>
            <li>Thank you and highly recommend to all who need that extra lift.</li>
            <li>I have used several clay and mud masks - spa grade and have to say this my new favourite for the quality as well as the price point compared to spa quality products i have used.  </li>
            <li>when you apply it so easy within less than 20 seconds of application, keeping it on for 5 minutes and then rinsing it off 5 minutes later;  you will feel you have gone to a spa and back!  </li>
            <li>This mask works very well with my combination skin and it helps to dry up my acne and reduces the oil in the t-zone.  </li>
            <li>It has no small or fragrance and glides on, you don&#x27;t even have to use a lot (maybe using twice a week will last for 6 months...).  </li>
            <li>I have only use it once so far</li>
            <li>Left my face feeling soft..</li>
            <li>Then I apply a thin layer with my fingers and wait the recommended 10 minutes to dry and then just rinse it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>As it starts to dry, it feels tight, and kind of crumbles a little when you move your face.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer, blemishes less noticable, colour more solid and less blotchy</li>
            <li>I typically leave my mask on for 20 minutes - within the first 5 minutes</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft but not oily, as a college student I have late nights, and this helps keep my skin looking fresh.</li>

            <li> Wash off with warm water and then apply cool water to close pores..</li>
            <li> What I love about this product is how easy it is to use, even as a mother always in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the product is smooth and not grainy and I love how my skin feels as the mask begins to work it&#x27;s magic.</li>

            <li> It feels great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great product leaves my face feeling refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> it happens I had some questions about the products for my skin type and was impressed with the quick, personal, and  and thorough response by the company  to my questions.</li>
            <li> But the absolute best part of using the Oshi-Glows Clay mask is how refreshed and soft my face feels after!</li>
            <li> O*SHI GLOWS clay mask is a true treat to use!  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and ease to remove.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and glides on smoothy.</li>
            <li> Works well and is easy to remove</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin -- VERY sensitive -- and this is great!</li>
            <li> The O*SHI GLOWS Clay Mask is a pleasure to use with its pleasant and natural scent; smooth and light texture; and the cleansing and toning effect it has on the skin.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little nervous about using it, but I am very happy I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Seems to work best when followed by Pure Hyaluronic Acid serum, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again as I am not feeling or noticing an improvement in the skin - especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I CAN&#x27;T TELL A HUGE DIFFERENCE, BUT CAN TELL AN IMPROVEMENT.  </li>
            <li> I love that is had a nice and natural scent to it.  </li>
            <li> you too enjoy and believe in “O’Shi Glows’ products as I do.</li>
            <li> was not asked to try this product, I bought this completely on my own (as well as the serum), and really like</li>
            <li> It is not drying and washes smoothly off.  </li>
            <li> Leave it on for the 10 minutes rinse it off and your face is smooth as can be.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic clay mask.  </li>
            <li> I like the texture, clean smell, and easy application.</li>
            <li> You can feel this go on smooth and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the application because the end results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and charming.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good.  </li>
            <li> It has a mild, pleasant, natural herbal scent which I do not react to at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask a couple times, I like how it feels, and it dries pretty quick which is nice.</li>
            <li> Makes my favorite feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> and it is easy and quick to rinse it off there.</li>
            <li> The mask is very nice and my skin did feel great after, but definitely not for dry or combination skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited to keep useing it again.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried a variety of different mud/clay masks and this, by far, ranks as the best.</li>
            <li> I really do feel that my skin is clearer and even has more of a glow to it.  </li>
            <li> But the next day, I had 2 people take notice to my skin looking good.</li>
            <li> I love this so much</li>
            <li> There is no bad smells either, No alcohol smells or chemical smells.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth and has a light natural scent.  </li>
            <li> The scent is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> And as a person who is sensitive to scents, I love that there are no artificial or strong perfume smells in this product.  </li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly, even though I did not use the &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; shipping.</li>
            <li> Love it it makes my face feel lighter younger and tighter love it</li>
            <li> This is a great facial mask and I will more than likely be purchasing again when I run out!</li>
            <li> My face feels soft afterwards and it definitely is cleaning the pores, I like that it has so many good ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> My face feels great (slightly tingly) while I have the mask on</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> This stuff elimintes the redness after each use and really helps to smooth out my skin</li>
            <li> I rarely break out</li>
            <li> I have found it leaves my skin glowing and fresh looking for a couple of days after even.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft this is.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin and it leaves my face feeling smooth, clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This facial mask is so easy to apply and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin fresh, clean and much softer.</li>
            <li> By far the best mask I have used in years and unlike previous products, O*SHI GLOWS is made with largely organic ingredients and is NOT tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> and when i opened the lid the seal came right off.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and it makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel soft afterward but didn&#x27;t really help my skin look any better.  </li>
            <li> The Oshi-Glows clay mask has a natural fragrance and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and it holds up to your skin’s cleanness, but know how it energizes and makes your skin so very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and smooth after using it</li>
            <li> My skin looks more vibrant and my breakouts are fer and far between!</li>
            <li> I also appreciate how easily the mask washes off with warm and a small washcloth.  </li>
            <li> Dries very very fast.</li>
            <li> After the first time using it my skin felt very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend O*Shi Glows as an effective, high quality facial product with mostly organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I used the mask and saw a difference by the first use</li>
            <li> This is the first clay mask I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> My skin tone started to even out after the first use.  </li>
            <li> This made my face feel tighter and smoother and overall better appearance in that area as well.</li>
            <li> What I am absolutely over-the-top impressed with is the customer service delivered by OSHI Glows.</li>
            <li> 12 hours later my face is still smooth as can be and not oily at all!</li>
            <li> I love that you only need 10 mins.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how light this feels even after it drys.</li>
            <li> So many masks are overloaded with extra fragrance</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have a beard</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean and smooth afterwards and is starting to appear much healthier.</li>
            <li> The facial mask is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> My oily skin has been reduced but my blemishes have still not decreased its size..</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and have noticed a change in how my skin looks already.</li>
            <li> I apply it while getting things ready</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This mask really does revitalize and refreshen your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something gentle for my skin</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I feel a gentle tightening and coolness.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend</li>
            <li> It leaves my face clean and not dry.  </li>
            <li> and I told her about this mask, and now she wants it too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very soothing mask.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> really seems to get deep in the skin leaving a very refreshed feeling after with soft skin and feels like your skin just breathes better.</li>
            <li> Do not notice much of a difference after using this product and not the quality I had hoped for the price.</li>
            <li> Although my skin felt a bit tight still after removing the mask, my face felt very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t stink like many other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> It felt plump, fresh and clean, and I even noticed less blackheads.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to help my skin feel less oily and more.... silky.</li>
            <li> Came off easily with a wet cloth.</li>
            <li> Slightly oily, smell is just ok...</li>
            <li> I would suggest using a damp hot towel first on your face to open your pores, and then I would apply the mask..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> For the cost I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> but this one is natural, very gentle and not messy.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me, you will have a red face for a little while, good thing it clears up.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s gentle for frequent use.</li>
            <li> but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> I would need to use it for few more times before I can decided if it help with acne or reduce pores size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely  be buying more products from them in the near future..</li>
            <li> Have been using this mask for a few weeks and am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I normally have oily skin</li>
            <li> Since turning 40 I have been continually searching for new products to help defy the effects of aging and the environment on my skin.</li>
            <li> Made my skin super dry after one use.</li>
            <li> face felt clean and smooth afterwards, not sure I looked younger, though.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I love that in just a few minutes I can be transported to the spa!</li>
            <li> face feeling soft!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and worried about trying a new product.</li>
            <li> face feels clean and soft without the dryness associated with other products I have used.</li>
            <li> It left my face smooth and didn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a large amount, so this will last for awhile.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little work to smooth it onto your face without some clumping.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li> This facial masks really has a defined feel for your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural texture and glowing respsonse to my skin</li>
            <li> and it does leave my face soft afterward.  </li>
            <li> Silky soft face after use</li>
            <li> With just a 10-minute application my skin feels soft and nourished.  </li>
            <li> Does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (O*shi Glows Natural Anti Aging Skin Resurfacing &amp; Anyi Wrinkle Serum).</li>
            <li> I am a mom to a four month old.</li>
            <li> I also like that this is a natural, cruelty-free product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft..</li>
            <li> I am over 50, and it leaves my skin soft too.  </li>
            <li> so I was surprised I used my moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> As a mother of two young children I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to pamper myself.</li>
            <li> No messy cleanup like some clay masks.  </li>
            <li> but it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft and refresh.</li>
            <li> Soft.</li>
            <li> I had scars from past acne, wrinkles forming and fine lines, I am starting to see changes for the positive.</li>
            <li> First, I wash my face and pat it dry.</li>
            <li> Clean out my pore and peels off all the dead skin. .</li>
            <li> Thank you and highly recommend to all who need that extra lift.</li>
            <li> I have used several clay and mud masks - spa grade and have to say this my new favourite for the quality as well as the price point compared to spa quality products i have used.  </li>
            <li> when you apply it so easy within less than 20 seconds of application, keeping it on for 5 minutes and then rinsing it off 5 minutes later;  you will feel you have gone to a spa and back!  </li>
            <li> This mask works very well with my combination skin and it helps to dry up my acne and reduces the oil in the t-zone.  </li>
            <li> It has no small or fragrance and glides on, you don&#x27;t even have to use a lot (maybe using twice a week will last for 6 months...).  </li>
            <li> I have only use it once so far</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling soft..</li>
            <li> Then I apply a thin layer with my fingers and wait the recommended 10 minutes to dry and then just rinse it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> As it starts to dry, it feels tight, and kind of crumbles a little when you move your face.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearer, blemishes less noticable, colour more solid and less blotchy</li>
            <li> I typically leave my mask on for 20 minutes - within the first 5 minutes</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft but not oily, as a college student I have late nights, and this helps keep my skin looking fresh.</li>
            <li> so I need a product that removes the excess oil but NOT leaving my skin dry.</li>
            <li> Once on, the mask begins to dry</li>
            <li> - I could just see how it would be messy if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> My face gets dry and I often break out due to the all over beard</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use this mask a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this mask a few weeks now</li>
            <li> After using it a few times, I have noticed my pores seem a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> Product was dryer and cakier than I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> Have only used a few times, but can tell a difference in the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> After a few use of O-shi Glows facial mask my face feels softer and</li>

            <li> No break outs or rashes, as I have gotten from other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I so recommend the Clay Mask to everyone, even if you don’t purchase any other “O’Shi Glows” products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope to see other products by Oshi-Glows like moisturizers or serums because if they are anything like the clay mask</li>
            <li> But I am reserving one star because I am not sure of the long term benifits.</li>
            <li> I also have old scars on my face that tend to look worse as the elasticity leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> I am not real sure what I should say.</li>
            <li> The mask compound feels a little gelatinous in your hand, not like a whip or cream.  </li>
            <li> and I just need to work at those spots a little.  </li>
            <li> Once dried (just a few minutes)</li>
            <li> so im not sure if it helps Acne or reduce pores size.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s scent is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Even if you are not a huge clay mask fan I urge you to try this product!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything at this time that is negative about Oshi Glows.</li>
            <li> After using it two times in the past week I&#x27;m hooked!  </li>
            <li> The product goes on very thick.</li>
            <li> It is very thick in the container</li>
            <li> The size of my pores have consistently decreased.  </li>
            <li> The frequency of breakouts has also decreased.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife and I both tried this. The product goes on very thick. As it starts to dry, it feels tight, and kind of crumbles a little when you move your face. Washing it off takes some attention to detail, as my wife kept pointing out spots I&#x27;d missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face felt clean and smooth afterwards, not sure I looked younger, though.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love!!!!!</li>
            <li> Made my skin super dry after one use. The mask is very nice and my skin did feel great after, but definitely not for dry or combination skin. I will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask! I have sensitive skin so I was a little nervous about using it, but I am very happy I ordered it. It left my skin feeling soft but not oily, as a college student I have late nights, and this helps keep my skin looking fresh. No break outs or rashes, as I have gotten from other products I have tried. I will definitely continue to use this mask a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin so I need a product that removes the excess oil but NOT leaving my skin dry. O*SHI GLOWS Clay Mask is the ticket!&lt;br /&gt;My face feels clean and soft without the dryness associated with other products I have used.</li>
            <li> This facial masks really has a defined feel for your face. If you have sensitive skin like me, you will have a red face for a little while, good thing it clears up. My oily skin has been reduced but my blemishes have still not decreased its size.. I am going to try 2 face masks a week instead of 1. Maybe it will change the factor. I hope my review helps anyone in need of a clearer face.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve used this mask a couple times, I like how it feels, and it dries pretty quick which is nice. I have really oily skin and have noticed a change in how my skin looks already.</li>
            <li> Felt great on my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and charming. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it. Clean out my pore and peels off all the dead skin. . Makes my favorite feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product! My skin is noticeably smoother after just two uses. It has not aggravated my skin or caused any breakouts. I&#x27;m looking forward to enjoying more results.</li>
            <li> The product of “Enhanced Healing Clay Mask” is without words.  This product is so amazing and when you apply it so easy within less than 20 seconds of application, keeping it on for 5 minutes and then rinsing it off 5 minutes later;  you will feel you have gone to a spa and back!  Yes, a short relaxation of time, you got back to yourself.  Upon your application of this product you will realize how very kind and it holds up to your skin’s cleanness, but know how it energizes and makes your skin so very soft and smooth.  I so recommend the Clay Mask to everyone, even if you don’t purchase any other “O’Shi Glows” products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping you too enjoy and believe in “O’Shi Glows’ products as I do.</li>
            <li> Great product! Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and it makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> I have used several clay and mud masks - spa grade and have to say this my new favourite for the quality as well as the price point compared to spa quality products i have used.  I like this product for its consistency and the way my skin has felt after using it.  It&#x27;s natural texture and glowing respsonse to my skin has been refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product surpassed my expectations and I have added this to my skin cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li> I have only use it once so far and it does leave my face soft afterward.  I would need to use it for few more times before I can decided if it help with acne or reduce pores size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.  Will continue to use the product and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Silky soft face after use</li>
            <li> O*SHI GLOWS clay mask is a true treat to use!  My face feels great (slightly tingly) while I have the mask on and I see a noticable improvement in my skin when I take the mask off.  My skin is clearer, blemishes less noticable, colour more solid and less blotchy and my skin feels smoother to the touch.  I will continue to use this product on a regular basis.  By far the best mask I have used in years and unlike previous products, O*SHI GLOWS is made with largely organic ingredients and is NOT tested on animals.  I&#x27;m hooked!  I am going to let my teenage daughter use it too, to help minimize blemishes and acne.</li>
            <li> What I love about this product is how easy it is to use, even as a mother always in a hurry. I apply it while getting things ready and when it is time to rinse, I am getting in the shower and it is easy and quick to rinse it off there.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using masks but this one is natural, very gentle and not messy. Your skin feels great after the mask. I&#x27;d definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The O*SHI GLOWS Clay Mask is a pleasure to use with its pleasant and natural scent; smooth and light texture; and the cleansing and toning effect it has on the skin.  With just a 10-minute application my skin feels soft and nourished.  After using it two times in the past week I&#x27;m hooked!  Definitely a welcome addition to my skin-care regimen.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, seller had my Mask delivered by the next day I was totally impressed. I used the mask and saw a difference by the first use I was excited to keep useing it again. Works well with acne prone skin Aswell as diminishing acne scars. I will definitely  be buying more products from them in the near future.. Way to go!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel soft afterward but didn&#x27;t really help my skin look any better.  Have used twice a week for about 4 or 5 weeks. Will finish the product but won&#x27;t purchase again. This is the first clay mask I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Use face wash on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I rarely break out but I do have allergies and sometimes get red,mildly bumpy, irritated skin. This stuff elimintes the redness after each use and really helps to smooth out my skin also it eliminates the itchy feeling. A little goes a long way but I will definately re-order this product. Gotta stick to what works.</li>
            <li> Have been using this mask for a few weeks and am pleased with it. I bought it on my own after searching on Amazon for a serum that I felt would be good for my face. I like the serum too (O*shi Glows Natural Anti Aging Skin Resurfacing &amp; Anyi Wrinkle Serum). Along the way I bought this mask as well and have been using it almost every day. I like that it&#x27;s gentle for frequent use. My face feels soft afterwards and it definitely is cleaning the pores, I like that it has so many good ingredients in it. It feels good on the skin, and for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was not asked to try this product, I bought this completely on my own (as well as the serum), and really like it.&lt;br /&gt;As it happens I had some questions about the products for my skin type and was impressed with the quick, personal, and  and thorough response by the company  to my questions.</li>
            <li> This mask really does revitalize and refreshen your face.&lt;br /&gt;It washes off amazingly fast.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it for the spa like quality without the spa like price</li>
            <li> O*Shi Glows clay facial wash was given to me as a gift.  I have been using it twice weekly and love the feel both during and after the application. I really do feel that my skin is clearer and even has more of a glow to it.  And as a person who is sensitive to scents, I love that there are no artificial or strong perfume smells in this product.  It has a mild, pleasant, natural herbal scent which I do not react to at all! Definitely recommend O*Shi Glows as an effective, high quality facial product with mostly organic ingredients.  I plan to use this product regularly.</li>
            <li> i like this product, I&#x27;ve used it twice now and i can definitely see the a difference from before i used this. My only problem was the packaging. When I receive it, the seal has a big tear on it and when i opened the lid the seal came right off. I hope next time i buy it, it will be perfectly sealed.</li>
            <li> I am a mom to a four month old. I thought my skin problems on my face would go away after pregnancy. Wrong! I&#x27;ve been looking for something gentle for my skin and I have found it. This doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin and it leaves my face feeling smooth, clean and refreshed. Just the sort of pampering a mom is looking for!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT  !!!!  The Enhanced Healing Clay Mask will be my routine from now on !!!!!  I have used the mask about four times .  My skin tone started to even out after the first use.  The size of my pores have consistently decreased.  The frequency of breakouts has also decreased.</li>
            <li> I have used this product just three times and notice smaller pores. I also have old scars on my face that tend to look worse as the elasticity leaves my skin. This made my face feel tighter and smoother and overall better appearance in that area as well. A little goes a long way. It goes on wonderfully and feels like a true spa experience. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product does just what it says it should, it is a great clay mask that delivers tightening and refining of the pores. What I am absolutely over-the-top impressed with is the customer service delivered by OSHI Glows. Not only did they follow-up immediately after a delay in shipping, they sent me an additional personal email a week later with additional information on the product and what I can expect, different benefits, etc... Way to go OSHI GLOWS! THAT is what I call amazing customer service!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this for her face. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Thank you love this cream. Dries very very fast. I like how it does not drip. Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHRINKING MY PORES.  I CAN&#x27;T TELL A HUGE DIFFERENCE, BUT CAN TELL AN IMPROVEMENT.  USE 3-4 TIMES A WEEK</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried a variety of different mud/clay masks and this, by far, ranks as the best. I typically leave my mask on for 20 minutes - within the first 5 minutes I feel a gentle tightening and coolness. Very relaxing. The scent is clean and fresh. I especially love how easily the mask rinses off leaving my face feeling rejuvenated. I also like that this is a natural, cruelty-free product. This product is a definite winner. I would absolutely recommend O*SHI GLOWS!</li>
            <li> Since turning 40 I have been continually searching for new products to help defy the effects of aging and the environment on my skin. A facial mask has been a regular part of my routine as a I strive to heal, refresh and revitalize my skin. I have finally found the ultimate mask in the Oshi-Glows Clay mask.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this product I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting any chemicals on my body as so many beauty products contain unnatural ingredients. The Oshi-Glows clay mask has a natural fragrance and is easy to apply. I like the fact that the product is smooth and not grainy and I love how my skin feels as the mask begins to work it&#x27;s magic. It feels amazing!!! I also appreciate how easily the mask washes off with warm and a small washcloth.  But the absolute best part of using the Oshi-Glows Clay mask is how refreshed and soft my face feels after! I feel as though I have given my skin a youthful lift. I hope to see other products by Oshi-Glows like moisturizers or serums because if they are anything like the clay mask I know they will be great! </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin -- VERY sensitive -- and this is great! It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft.. I would suggest using a damp hot towel first on your face to open your pores, and then I would apply the mask.. The mask hardens after 5-7 mins... Wash off with warm water and then apply cool water to close pores.. Left my face feeling soft.. I&#x27;ve only use product for a week so im not sure if it helps Acne or reduce pores size.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this mask a few weeks now but so far I really like it. My skin feels so clean and smooth afterwards and is starting to appear much healthier. I will keep using it and update as I get more results</li>
            <li> This is the best face mask I have ever used in in entire life.  It has no small or fragrance and glides on, you don&#x27;t even have to use a lot (maybe using twice a week will last for 6 months...).  It is not drying and washes smoothly off.  I have a problem with my pores and I saw noticeable changes after 1 use.  I couldn&#x27;t recommend a better product - MUST BUY (Even for the guys)!!!</li>
            <li> This mask works!! Love it.  It does an amazing job cleaning pores and blemishes.  I have found it leaves my skin glowing and fresh looking for a couple of days after even.  I have never used a product before that did that.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  It is for oily skin, and that I have.  It leaves my face clean and not dry.  It helps control my oiliness of my face.  I just purchased a second jar of this stuff for my best friend because she has oily skin, and she has been commenting on how great my skin looks.  I am over 50, and it leaves my skin soft too.  My friend has oily skin and I told her about this mask, and now she wants it too.</li>
            <li> I received the facial mask yesterday and used it instantly. The facial mask is easy to apply. Leave it on for the 10 minutes rinse it off and your face is smooth as can be. When you apply it you feel your pores opening up and the feeling remains for hours after removing it. There is no bad smells either, No alcohol smells or chemical smells. 12 hours later my face is still smooth as can be and not oily at all!</li>
            <li> O*SHI GLOWS mask is an excellent product with excellent service and customer information. I love that you only need 10 mins. with this mask and your skin feels renewed afterwards. I have noticed my pores getting smaller which has been a problem for me forever. I am very impressed with my use and the results of this product. I will definitely be adding this to my routine of facial care. Thank you and highly recommend to all who need that extra lift.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that they don&#x27;t test on animals. I have only been using this for two weeks now. It is a wonderful product, leaves my skin smooth and soft. It is easy to apply and ease to remove.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly, even though I did not use the &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; shipping. I have used the product 4 times since I received it. I definitely noticed a difference after 1st use. Although my skin felt a bit tight still after removing the mask, my face felt very fresh and clean. I normally have oily skin so I was surprised I used my moisturizer after. But the next day, I had 2 people take notice to my skin looking good. It felt plump, fresh and clean, and I even noticed less blackheads. After using it a few times, I have noticed my pores seem a bit smaller. So Yes! I would definitely recommend this face mask. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Love it it makes my face feel lighter younger and tighter love it</li>
            <li> I use this clay mask twice a week. It makes my face look and feel amazing! I have sensitive skin and worried about trying a new product. It did not irritate my skin. This is a must in your beauty regiment.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to help my skin feel less oily and more.... silky. This product accomplishes both of these feats. Use as directed on packaging as often as you feel you need to and I promise you wont regret it! This is a great facial mask and I will more than likely be purchasing again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> This facial mask is so easy to apply and easy to wash off. While it is on your face you acturally feel your skin tightening as it dries. My face feels smoother and looks fresher . I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> This facial mask is simply awesome. It leaves my skin fresh, clean and much softer. This mask works very well with my combination skin and it helps to dry up my acne and reduces the oil in the t-zone.  It cleanses all the dirt impurities that clog my pores. I feel like I have had a day at the spa but with only a fraction of the cost. It is easy to use. First, I wash my face and pat it dry. Then I apply a thin layer with my fingers and wait the recommended 10 minutes to dry and then just rinse it off with warm water. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a deep cleansing facial mask.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how light this feels even after it drys. Came off easily with a wet cloth. The best part is how it made my pores smaller and gave my skin a glow. I love it !!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic clay mask.  Even if you are not a huge clay mask fan I urge you to try this product!  I love that is had a nice and natural scent to it.  So many masks are overloaded with extra fragrance it becomes too strong for me, but not this one!  This mask is very easy on the skin and makes my face feel wonderful.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this face mask. After the first time using it my skin felt very soft and smooth. After using it multiple there was a noticeable difference in the way my face looks and feels. I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this so much it made my face feel like it did years ago about 10 years younger. I would recommend this to anyone. I would buy it again also,.</li>
            <li> As a mother of two young children I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to pamper myself. I love that in just a few minutes I can be transported to the spa! My face feels great after and love my me time with it!</li>
            <li> Very soothing mask.  My skin feels soft and great afterward.  No messy cleanup like some clay masks.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Slightly oily, smell is just ok...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and my face is super smooth and moisturized!!  It goes on easily and washes off easily! I&#x27;m sold on this mask!</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It is very thick in the container but it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. It also doesn&#x27;t stink like many other products I have tried. It left my face smooth and didn&#x27;t dry it out. I will continue to use this weekly, maybe more. I really like it!</li>
            <li> I am not real sure what I should say. I don&#x27;t have anything at this time that is negative about Oshi Glows. I like the texture, clean smell, and easy application. My skin feels softer. But I am reserving one star because I am not sure of the long term benifits.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE!! this product. My skin was so soft and refresh. Thank you for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonia Miller</li>
            <li> Gifted this for Christmas and my stepmom absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  It feels great on my sensitive skin. My skin feels very soft and smooth after using it</li>
            <li> I love how clean my face looks and feels after using this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and glides on smoothy.I leave it on for about 10 to 20 minutes and just rinse it off with water. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love how this product feels on my skin! And I know that I can trust that it contains no harmful or non-sustainably sourced ingredients and that it is kind to animals. Thank you for introducing a genuine product to fill this neglected niche!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have a beard and I still enjoy to use this product! My face gets dry and I often break out due to the all over beard so I was looking for something refreshing. You can feel this go on smooth and really seems to get deep in the skin leaving a very refreshed feeling after with soft skin and feels like your skin just breathes better. My skin looks more vibrant and my breakouts are fer and far between!</li>
            <li> Not greasy like some are.</li>
            <li> Product was dryer and cakier than I expected it to be.  Seems to work best when followed by Pure Hyaluronic Acid serum, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again as I am not feeling or noticing an improvement in the skin - especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Works well and is easy to remove</li>
            <li> Only been using it a couple days &amp; I&#x27;m loving the difference in my pores !!</li>
            <li> Looked like someone had used this jar before.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> For the cost I had high expectations. Do not notice much of a difference after using this product and not the quality I had hoped for the price. Masks at the store are probably just as good.</li>
            <li> Mask is great.  Love using it.</li>
            <li> Great mask!  Goes on very smooth and has a light natural scent.  Definitely like that it&#x27;s scent is not overwhelming.  Tightens very nicely and washes off smooth.  Face definitely feels and looks smoother.  Have only used a few times, but can tell a difference in the way my skin feels.  You don&#x27;t need a large amount, so this will last for awhile.  Will definitely recommend to my friends!</li>
            <li> I have always used homemade face mask, but decided to try O-shi Glows. After a few use of O-shi Glows facial mask my face feels softer and there is a healthier glow. I had scars from past acne, wrinkles forming and fine lines, I am starting to see changes for the positive. This will now be part of my home facial treatments.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this is. It feels good on my face, and leaves my skin nice and refreshed. It also comes off very easily, which is a great feature in a face mask! I received this product for instructional purposes in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Facial I&#x27;m a jar leaves face feeling soft!</li>
            <li> Great product leaves my face feeling refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Made my skin feel different instantly</li>
            <li> The mask compound feels a little gelatinous in your hand, not like a whip or cream.  It takes a little work to smooth it onto your face without some clumping.  I find that there are areas that don&#x27;t smear over my skin evenly and I just need to work at those spots a little.  However, the application doesn&#x27;t diminish the overall feel of the mask once it has been applied - I could just see how it would be messy if you are not careful.  Once on, the mask begins to dry and you can feel your skin pull tighter.  Its best to have a resting face during this process so as not to crack the mask.  Once dried (just a few minutes) the mask is easily removed with warm water and washcloth.  Your face will feel amazing. Soft. Supple. Glowing.  I don&#x27;t mind the application because the end results are fantastic.</li>
