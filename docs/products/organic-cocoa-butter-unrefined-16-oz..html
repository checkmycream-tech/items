            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Smelled amazing, melted well in my homemade deodorant recipe.  </li>
            <li>Amazing in home made lotions.</li>
            <li>This is amazing and nothing like that.  </li>
            <li>Works well when making your own lotion or body butter.</li>
            <li>What I wanted, as I use this to make my own creams.</li>
            <li>I bought organic cocoa butter, shea butter, almond oil, and beeswax pellets to make my own skin and hair care products after reading reviews here on Amazon...</li>
            <li>My fiance, who accuses me of being a pilgrim for making some of my own stuff, loves it and uses it every night.  </li>
            <li>I used this to make my own lotion.</li>
            <li>I used this and their shea butter to make my own lotion.</li>
            <li>I was also impressed with the fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to message on scars following bi-lateral knee replacement and smells wonderful and works great</li>
            <li>Smells nice like chocolate.  </li>
            <li>Needs to be warmed to pick up and put on, or use a spoon and warm in between your palms.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want that to be honest.</li>
            <li>I make my own lotions and creams this worked well.</li>
            <li>being said, it absorbes easily, it does leave my skin hydrated and looking good.</li>
            <li>We loved that it was organic and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Smells great works well with other butters to make own lotion!!!</li>
            <li>This is by far, the best packaging I have come by for cocoa butter, sealed and everything.  </li>
            <li>I used it to make deodorant and that was lovely, but this is so nice</li>
            <li>Smells so wonderful and makes your body so soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance and texture, fresh and inviting.  </li>
            <li>But its ok because I make my own lotion with it.</li>
            <li>The smell of this cocoa butter is amazing, you can tell it&#x27;s used to make chocolate since it smells more chocolate-like than most &amp;#34;100% cocoa butters&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was impressed to have such great flavor the first time I made it.  </li>
            <li>Large size and great price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just more cocoa butter, but those did not dissolve&lt;</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love cocoa butter&lt;</li>
            <li>i thought it would have been a better convenience to have it in&lt;br /&gt;the jar</li>
            <li>I have been messing around with and finding many uses for tropical oils since purchasing coconut oil to cook with..</li>
            <li>It looks authentic.</li>
            <li>However I like the way it feels on my skin, smooth!</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I wish the consistency was more like Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I will use it after I finish the more convenient options I have purchased.</li>
            <li>(I love chocolate</li>
            <li>As stated in the title, it had an overwhelming skunky/acrid burnt rubber smell.  </li>
            <li>Love this cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>The texture is lovely.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and that would help melt it and thus be more usable, but I was wanting something usable out of the jar.</li>
            <li>It is truly authentic.</li>
            <li>I love it for my skin all over my body and face.</li>
            <li>I love cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li>my skin is so much more softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, and has a nice smell, like a box of candy.</li>
            <li>Love this cocoa butter, I just heat some up in the microwave.</li>
            <li>helped I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>so I took a leap of faith that it was OK to use.  </li>
            <li>Glad I got resealable containers,  too.</li>
            <li>It works much better than the sort you buy in a tube at the store.</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter smells wonderful, but I should have done more research because I did not realize the jar would be a solid block.  </li>
            <li>Essential Depot has seriously impressed me with the quality of their product.  </li>
            <li>I am in Love with the product.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my skin is!</li>
            <li>And I love the chocolate like smell.</li>
            <li>I love using this for my lotion bars, cloth diaper wipe solution cubes, and deodorant.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll practice and report:)</li>
            <li>I used this to make a whipped body butter with an orange essential oil to compliment it and it is incredible!  </li>
            <li>I bought this on impulse just to try it and have fallen in love with it.  </li>
            <li>great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I love it and the chocolate scent.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Definitely authentic.</li>
            <li>Love the way it feels and smells.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really ok.  </li>
            <li>High quality at a great price.  </li>
            <li>My first order with this product was good.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m familiar with how it should smell and taste (intoxicatingly chocolate-y!), and what I got just isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sure it work fine.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the product is fine.  </li>
            <li>This one is pure, smell good and absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>Very pleased that the product was delivered right on time and that it was very fresh.</li>
            <li>It has all the characteristics of natural cocoa butter and made a very nice skin &amp; hair product.</li>
            <li>Easy to make whipped body butter with it cocoa, shea, coconut oil, organic olive oil and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It melts nicely into more liquid oils and really enriches lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Exellent unrefined butter.. smells delishhh .. really easy to melt..</li>
            <li>It stayed liquid for hours as well, making it easy to use.</li>
            <li>So I ordered this particular brand and have been delighted with it.  </li>
            <li>Quite strong of the cocoa smell</li>
            <li>It smells great and offers great benefits for those that use it on a regular bases.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet cocoa scent in the jar, my family wanted eat it :-) .</li>
            <li>Is wonderful to my collection of other organic ingredients for body butters and lotions!</li>
            <li>This seems like a fine product.  </li>
            <li>Quality of butter was fine but for the purpose of making body butter</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s customer service, as always, is top-notch, but I was a little concerned at the condition of the product when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I know exactly what we&#x27;re slathering on!</li>
            <li>Huge container.</li>
            <li>Precisely as described.</li>
            <li>This was precisely what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>Your body heat intantly softens it to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I mix a mixture of cocoa butter, sheabuter, coconut oil ,ollive oil, a teaspoon of honey, vegetable glycerin and aloe very gel to make my own homemade body butter 😁</li>
            <li>It smells almost like chocolate and makes my skin smooth even days after using it.</li>
            <li>Could only get a couple of spoonfuls out but all and all its a great product</li>
            <li>However, I later used it to make chocolate ice creams, sauces etc..., and it just gives great depth to chocolaty treats.</li>
            <li>Great withe essential oils</li>
            <li>This is a great product but it really is very solid and needs to be warmed up before it can be used.</li>
            <li>it feels good so far</li>
            <li>I used this to put in a homemade body butter for pregnancy, so far so good.</li>
            <li>Smells great just as other cocoa butter I have used, seems both pure and good quality.</li>
            <li>It is very hard to find great products where I am from, so I am very pleased:)</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, feels so good, and leaves my skin feeling really soft without making it greasy (which really surprised me).  </li>
            <li>I had originally wanted to use this for my hair but decided against it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>While digging some out today I found there is a huge air bubble inside, so my tub isn&#x27;t quite full of product.</li>
            <li>Love the product, this is the first time I have ordered cocoa butter to place in a body lotion</li>
            <li>It was rich in fragrance and texture.</li>
            <li>i put it on my face at night and in my bath to give my skin a super smooth and moisterized feeling.</li>
            <li>So far I Love this coco butter!</li>
            <li>It is quite hard and solid at room temperature, so I set it on top of my gas fireplace overnight and in the morning it was perfectly liquid and slightly warm.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to help her make it special.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin this time of year and it is great.</li>
            <li>However, I must say I have bought coconut oil and palm oil from this company and was pleased with their quality and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Good to see that you can make a profit and take care of the environment at the same time!</li>
            <li>I actually tasted it to see if it tasted as good as it smelt, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but it s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>and I believe true skin hydration comes from inside out not the stuff we slather</li>
            <li>I melted some along with some shea butter and added sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell at all</li>
            <li>Got here fast,Good quality, pleasant aroma ,really beneficial for the ski, makes it soft and glowing..</li>
            <li>Each time I purchase from Essential Depot, I am never disappointed and more than satisfied.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Upon opening the product, you are hit with the very chocolate aroma which is to be expected, but nevertheless a pleasant surprise!  </li>
            <li>There is a lovely scent of cocoa or as most people say, &amp;#34;chocolate&amp;#34; for a short time, and to me, it is aroma therapy.  </li>
            <li>so yummy, works wonders on my pregnant growing belly.</li>
            <li>It hardens and melts quickly when applied to skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While it is less oily for me and works great, the smell of chocolate is almost over powering.</li>
            <li>I usually order cocoa butter from another company, and theirs has a delicious chocolate smell, very unlike this.</li>
            <li>Every time  a high quality product!!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for unrefined cocoa butter, this is exactly what you want!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a lot too, if you&#x27;re just using it for your skin every day it should last you more than a year easy.</li>
            <li>but it was a too much for my fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>but once I dug some out gently with a paring knife it was fine.</li>
            <li>It is magnificent, and it I&#x27;d lasting me a very long time!</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, and despite frequent use, we&#x27;re only halfway through</li>
            <li>I first bought this to make a personal deodorant and it worked okay, but the chocolate smell was strong</li>
            <li>Again, hopefully a fluke, as many other people seem satisfied.</li>
            <li>FYI use it in the steam room or right after tanning as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I had to warm it in the microwave a bit because it was hard at first, but it is such a great product.</li>
            <li>, this does take a very long time if you wish to cover your entire body after a shower but the quality is great and my skin felt amazing, after putting some on in a section I wet my hand w a little warm water and find this helps to distribute the product better and aids with sinking into the skin.</li>
            <li>I used this cocoa butter combined with sesame oil and a few drops of essential oil, heated up in a pan, to make a wonderful homemade body lotion.</li>
            <li>Great quality but its too hard to get out</li>
            <li>get it in the jar in the first place.</li>
            <li>This my second purchase love the purity of it.</li>
            <li>It has been my number one choice for use on sun and wind burned skin caused by using a motorcycle as my primary source of transportation, 100+ degree heat and cloudless Texas sky.  </li>
            <li>I was sent a sample of their Ylang Ylang essential oil and enjoyed using it in a blend as well.</li>
            <li>and I have been rather pleased with it overall.</li>
            <li>I know that something had to be done to it to get it from natural chunk form to smooth in a container.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find this Cocoa Butter on Amazon - not having any idea where I would find such a thing in the store!</li>
            <li>I have never used Cocoa Butter before, so this is my first experience with it.  </li>
            <li>Product came exactly as advertised, the error on my part was that I did not realize that it was unrefined.  </li>
            <li>Only reason that it received a 4 not a 5 is that it is much more greasy than advertised</li>
            <li>It has been my number one choice for use on sun and wind burned skin caused by using a motorcycle as my primary source of transportation, 100+ degree heat and cloudless Texas sky.</li>
            <li>Also pleased with low postage for 4 pounds!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is not edible, this product is for cosmetic use, for the skin, hair,etc</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and soft after using this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased Shea butter from this same company and love it.  </li>
            <li>This was my first purchase from ED.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as pictured and when I opened the tub, it smelled just like chocolate.</li>
            <li>Smells divine, feels divine, and does exactly what I expect it to.</li>
            <li>This is the first cocoa butter I have purchased, so nothing to compare to, but this has all the characterisics that I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for the DIY sunscreen that I made.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve used my other cocoa butters to make homemade whipped body butters, and they make for an amazing moisturizer.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never ordered natural cocoa butter before, and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>actually if it smelled less amazing it might be better, (makes me crave</li>
            <li>Some other online suggestions didn&#x27;t seem like they would be something I wanted to do and this has worked out very easily and well for me.  </li>
            <li>It makes you super soft.</li>
            <li>What a generous amount for this price, I&#x27;m so thankful I looked on Amazon and found this pure organic cocoa butter for this price.</li>
            <li>I did NOT want any type of additives and so chose this one as it is pure cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li>Just a note to people that do not know about cocoa butter in this pure state.</li>
            <li>Nothing better than real cocoa butter for dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Love that their packaging is eco friendly without excessive packaging or dyes.  </li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils and am always researching a better way to stay &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; as organically/processed free as possible.  </li>
            <li>It does have a cocoa/chocolate scent, much like a bag of chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>much more chocolatey than i expected.</li>
            <li>It is VERY moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It did work very well on my lips though.</li>
            <li>This product is as described and works very well.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs really well into the skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks for providing the real deal.</li>
            <li>I mix it with the Shea butter from this company and use it at night straight out of the shower..</li>
            <li>This is the real deal cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe how much richer it is than the tube cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>Packing was whole, in Russia not to buy it from us, and I so hoped to do house chocolate for the child.</li>
            <li>Seems very Organic. . .</li>
            <li>It is real organic cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>Any suggestions on how to make this into a personal smooth lotion??</li>
            <li>I really like and I like the smell</li>
            <li>It lites up the whole room.</li>
            <li>It really mostuirizes my skin.</li>
            <li>This unrefined cocoa butter is more like wax than butter and can be removed from the jar by shaving off thin layers off of the top..</li>
            <li>Seems good for lotion, but isn&#x27;t mean for food.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this was just a fluke based on the other reviews, but when my product arrived the cap was mostly unscrewed</li>
            <li>I use it mostly at bed time now due to the smell.</li>
            <li>I go back and forth between wanting to smear this luscious, rich stuff all over my body and eat it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it made a burn heal really quick, it went from second degree to almost unnoticeable!  </li>
            <li>Seeing that she is older</li>
            <li>I recommend this particular product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much exactly what it looks like: a decently-sized tub of solid cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>The only thing is... need more essential oil to &#x27;balance&#x27; the smell!</li>
            <li>But if you want a pure product with no additives to possibly make your problem worse if using for medical reasons than this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>highly reccomended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to people who want to condition their skin and reduce scars.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this to make my own lotion (along with some other ingredients obviously.)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard but melts nicely when applying.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased raw cocoa butter,  and overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the product I received.</li>
            <li>I love the properties of cocoa butter and am anxious to try out new &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34; and plan to make large batches of moisturizers for my friends and</li>
            <li>We have always used oil in ours, but I was ready to step it up as my 11 year old daughter was organizing a father/daughter dance in our backyard</li>
            <li>Expensive but great.</li>
            <li>worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t use a lot of this in normal cooking, but when the recipe calls for it this is the one we use.  </li>
            <li>Again, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal or not.  </li>
            <li>Even when microwaved to soften product is hardens right back up.</li>
            <li>The butter was uniform and quite smooth once melted; there was no debris as was reported in other reviews.</li>
            <li>Nice and solid in the container, takes a little bit of work to get out.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>does smell a little strong though.</li>
            <li>Very hard, but when melted down makes an incredible cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice, medium-mild chocolaty smell and is very hard, even in the middle of this hot summer.</li>
            <li>Smooth, silky and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I use it afrer showering and it keeps my feet very soft soft.</li>
            <li>I melted mine down a bit in the microwave and then added some shea butter, coconut oil, glycerin, and some essential oils to make it a bit more user-friendly for my purposes.</li>
            <li>anyone who has never tried unrefined cocoa butter let me warn you that it is very hard and has to be chipped out, I like to warm it in my hands and then apply it</li>
            <li>but just recently switch to this pure form of cocoa butter</li>
            <li>and I see a big difference by using pure 100% cocoa butter versus a palmers cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely Cocoa butter, it has everything an unrefined cocoa butter should have, it is hard, but that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li>I saw the many one star reviews saying it was so hard they couldn&#x27;t get it from the jar.</li>
            <li>Lovely hard butter with chocolate scent.  </li>
            <li>I leave it outside and it is always soft and ready to be used.</li>
            <li>This product seems old.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the real deal.</li>
            <li>i want to see if it helps my 11 year old get rid of a couple of scars.my niece fell off her bike and scratched her forehead.</li>
            <li>I was advised by my 88 year old grandmother to use cocoa butter to help with scarring.  </li>
            <li>and I like chocolate as much as the next person but</li>
            <li>This is comparable to another organic cocoa butter I purchased from the store, only this was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin because she has eczema.</li>
            <li>We also put it in our hair for a natural conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I just got an old product and it has over-hardened??</li>
            <li>I love the cocoa smell but hate the time it takes to dig out the product with a spoon, warm it up, and put it on.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product especially to anyone who cannot use the ingredients added to most other creams and lotions containing cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>First, I must clarify that I&#x27;m unsure if this is indeed raw, unrefined, unprocessed cocoa butter because it was sent in the container just as pictured &amp; is smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a very smoky, strange smell.</li>
            <li>This product goes a long way as you do not need much to get the soothing relief that</li>
            <li>It it a hard texture that melts easily in my pan; and firms up my product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard as rock, but softens up easily.  </li>
            <li>On taste seemingly neutral, but there is an aftertaste a little with a taste of bitterness, and the smell very much spoils everything!</li>
            <li>I wanted to be a little bit more natural with my body not only internally but externally too.</li>
            <li>I originally thought I got a bad jar until I read the reviews more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Not sure if there&#x27;s a special way to get it out.</li>
            <li>(it barely took 1/4 turn to remove it) and the foil seal was 3/4 lifted off.  </li>
            <li>I put it all over my body especially in darker areas like old scars.</li>
            <li>By the time I re-ordered it, it came as chips of Cocoa butter and barely any fragrance of what I know it should smell like.</li>
            <li>so this will be the last purchase of natural cocoa butter in a jar.</li>
            <li>I had expected to receive the same product I had purchased the first time.</li>
            <li>out there which kind of have a weird smell along with the cocoa</li>
            <li>It is a hard, solid block, but is easy to use without mixing it with another softer butter.</li>
            <li>I make my own body lotions, since I have dry skin, and store products either do nothing, or make it worse.</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter was harder than I expected, but warms up quickly to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Very hard at room temperature and has strong smell.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a sealed plastic covering that was oily to touch, which got on other items in box, when I opened it the inside of wrap was oily and the whole outside of jar was oily and had cocoa butter on it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff if super extra hard.</li>
            <li>It helps a lot with repairing skin that saw a little too much wind, sun, or even drywall dust.</li>
            <li>I put it in a little container set it on the lamp, it liquifies fast and It becomes like oil.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how much to expect this item to cost, and while it is certainly more expensive than oil, it didn&#x27;t feel too extravagant, especially since the chocolate fountain is something we only pull out once a year or less.  </li>

            <li> This is amazing and nothing like that.  </li>
            <li> Works well when making your own lotion or body butter.</li>
            <li> What I wanted, as I use this to make my own creams.</li>
            <li> I bought organic cocoa butter, shea butter, almond oil, and beeswax pellets to make my own skin and hair care products after reading reviews here on Amazon...</li>
            <li> My fiance, who accuses me of being a pilgrim for making some of my own stuff, loves it and uses it every night.  </li>
            <li> I used this to make my own lotion.</li>
            <li> I used this and their shea butter to make my own lotion.</li>
            <li> I was also impressed with the fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to message on scars following bi-lateral knee replacement and smells wonderful and works great</li>
            <li> Smells nice like chocolate.  </li>
            <li> Needs to be warmed to pick up and put on, or use a spoon and warm in between your palms.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want that to be honest.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotions and creams this worked well.</li>
            <li> being said, it absorbes easily, it does leave my skin hydrated and looking good.</li>
            <li> We loved that it was organic and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Smells great works well with other butters to make own lotion!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far, the best packaging I have come by for cocoa butter, sealed and everything.  </li>
            <li> I used it to make deodorant and that was lovely, but this is so nice</li>
            <li> Smells so wonderful and makes your body so soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and texture, fresh and inviting.  </li>
            <li> But its ok because I make my own lotion with it.</li>
            <li> The smell of this cocoa butter is amazing, you can tell it&#x27;s used to make chocolate since it smells more chocolate-like than most &amp;#34;100% cocoa butters&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was impressed to have such great flavor the first time I made it.  </li>
            <li> Large size and great price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just more cocoa butter, but those did not dissolve&lt;</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> love cocoa butter&lt;</li>
            <li> i thought it would have been a better convenience to have it in&lt;br /&gt;the jar</li>
            <li> I have been messing around with and finding many uses for tropical oils since purchasing coconut oil to cook with..</li>
            <li> It looks authentic.</li>
            <li> However I like the way it feels on my skin, smooth!</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I wish the consistency was more like Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I will use it after I finish the more convenient options I have purchased.</li>
            <li> (I love chocolate</li>
            <li> As stated in the title, it had an overwhelming skunky/acrid burnt rubber smell.  </li>
            <li> Love this cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> The texture is lovely.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and that would help melt it and thus be more usable, but I was wanting something usable out of the jar.</li>
            <li> It is truly authentic.</li>
            <li> I love it for my skin all over my body and face.</li>
            <li> I love cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> my skin is so much more softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, and has a nice smell, like a box of candy.</li>
            <li> Love this cocoa butter, I just heat some up in the microwave.</li>
            <li> helped I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> so I took a leap of faith that it was OK to use.  </li>
            <li> Glad I got resealable containers,  too.</li>
            <li> It works much better than the sort you buy in a tube at the store.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter smells wonderful, but I should have done more research because I did not realize the jar would be a solid block.  </li>
            <li> Essential Depot has seriously impressed me with the quality of their product.  </li>
            <li> I am in Love with the product.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my skin is!</li>
            <li> And I love the chocolate like smell.</li>
            <li> I love using this for my lotion bars, cloth diaper wipe solution cubes, and deodorant.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll practice and report:)</li>
            <li> I used this to make a whipped body butter with an orange essential oil to compliment it and it is incredible!  </li>
            <li> I bought this on impulse just to try it and have fallen in love with it.  </li>
            <li> great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love it and the chocolate scent.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Definitely authentic.</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels and smells.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really ok.  </li>
            <li> High quality at a great price.  </li>
            <li> My first order with this product was good.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m familiar with how it should smell and taste (intoxicatingly chocolate-y!), and what I got just isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sure it work fine.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the product is fine.  </li>
            <li> This one is pure, smell good and absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li> Very pleased that the product was delivered right on time and that it was very fresh.</li>
            <li> It has all the characteristics of natural cocoa butter and made a very nice skin &amp; hair product.</li>
            <li> Easy to make whipped body butter with it cocoa, shea, coconut oil, organic olive oil and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It melts nicely into more liquid oils and really enriches lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Exellent unrefined butter.. smells delishhh .. really easy to melt..</li>
            <li> It stayed liquid for hours as well, making it easy to use.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this particular brand and have been delighted with it.  </li>
            <li> Quite strong of the cocoa smell</li>
            <li> It smells great and offers great benefits for those that use it on a regular bases.</li>
            <li> It has a sweet cocoa scent in the jar, my family wanted eat it :-) .</li>
            <li> Is wonderful to my collection of other organic ingredients for body butters and lotions!</li>
            <li> This seems like a fine product.  </li>
            <li> Quality of butter was fine but for the purpose of making body butter</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s customer service, as always, is top-notch, but I was a little concerned at the condition of the product when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that I know exactly what we&#x27;re slathering on!</li>
            <li> Huge container.</li>
            <li> Precisely as described.</li>
            <li> This was precisely what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> Your body heat intantly softens it to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I mix a mixture of cocoa butter, sheabuter, coconut oil ,ollive oil, a teaspoon of honey, vegetable glycerin and aloe very gel to make my own homemade body butter 😁</li>
            <li> It smells almost like chocolate and makes my skin smooth even days after using it.</li>
            <li> Could only get a couple of spoonfuls out but all and all its a great product</li>
            <li> However, I later used it to make chocolate ice creams, sauces etc..., and it just gives great depth to chocolaty treats.</li>
            <li> Great withe essential oils</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it really is very solid and needs to be warmed up before it can be used.</li>
            <li> it feels good so far</li>
            <li> I used this to put in a homemade body butter for pregnancy, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Smells great just as other cocoa butter I have used, seems both pure and good quality.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find great products where I am from, so I am very pleased:)</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, feels so good, and leaves my skin feeling really soft without making it greasy (which really surprised me).  </li>
            <li> I had originally wanted to use this for my hair but decided against it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> While digging some out today I found there is a huge air bubble inside, so my tub isn&#x27;t quite full of product.</li>
            <li> Love the product, this is the first time I have ordered cocoa butter to place in a body lotion</li>
            <li> It was rich in fragrance and texture.</li>
            <li> i put it on my face at night and in my bath to give my skin a super smooth and moisterized feeling.</li>
            <li> So far I Love this coco butter!</li>
            <li> It is quite hard and solid at room temperature, so I set it on top of my gas fireplace overnight and in the morning it was perfectly liquid and slightly warm.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to help her make it special.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin this time of year and it is great.</li>
            <li> However, I must say I have bought coconut oil and palm oil from this company and was pleased with their quality and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Good to see that you can make a profit and take care of the environment at the same time!</li>
            <li> I actually tasted it to see if it tasted as good as it smelt, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but it s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> and I believe true skin hydration comes from inside out not the stuff we slather</li>
            <li> I melted some along with some shea butter and added sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell at all</li>
            <li> Got here fast,Good quality, pleasant aroma ,really beneficial for the ski, makes it soft and glowing..</li>
            <li> Each time I purchase from Essential Depot, I am never disappointed and more than satisfied.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Upon opening the product, you are hit with the very chocolate aroma which is to be expected, but nevertheless a pleasant surprise!  </li>
            <li> There is a lovely scent of cocoa or as most people say, &amp;#34;chocolate&amp;#34; for a short time, and to me, it is aroma therapy.  </li>
            <li> so yummy, works wonders on my pregnant growing belly.</li>
            <li> It hardens and melts quickly when applied to skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While it is less oily for me and works great, the smell of chocolate is almost over powering.</li>
            <li> I usually order cocoa butter from another company, and theirs has a delicious chocolate smell, very unlike this.</li>
            <li> Every time  a high quality product!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for unrefined cocoa butter, this is exactly what you want!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot too, if you&#x27;re just using it for your skin every day it should last you more than a year easy.</li>
            <li> but it was a too much for my fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> but once I dug some out gently with a paring knife it was fine.</li>
            <li> It is magnificent, and it I&#x27;d lasting me a very long time!</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, and despite frequent use, we&#x27;re only halfway through</li>
            <li> I first bought this to make a personal deodorant and it worked okay, but the chocolate smell was strong</li>
            <li> Again, hopefully a fluke, as many other people seem satisfied.</li>
            <li> FYI use it in the steam room or right after tanning as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I had to warm it in the microwave a bit because it was hard at first, but it is such a great product.</li>
            <li> , this does take a very long time if you wish to cover your entire body after a shower but the quality is great and my skin felt amazing, after putting some on in a section I wet my hand w a little warm water and find this helps to distribute the product better and aids with sinking into the skin.</li>
            <li> I used this cocoa butter combined with sesame oil and a few drops of essential oil, heated up in a pan, to make a wonderful homemade body lotion.</li>
            <li> Great quality but its too hard to get out</li>
            <li> get it in the jar in the first place.</li>
            <li> This my second purchase love the purity of it.</li>
            <li> It has been my number one choice for use on sun and wind burned skin caused by using a motorcycle as my primary source of transportation, 100+ degree heat and cloudless Texas sky.  </li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of their Ylang Ylang essential oil and enjoyed using it in a blend as well.</li>
            <li> and I have been rather pleased with it overall.</li>
            <li> I know that something had to be done to it to get it from natural chunk form to smooth in a container.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find this Cocoa Butter on Amazon - not having any idea where I would find such a thing in the store!</li>
            <li> I have never used Cocoa Butter before, so this is my first experience with it.  </li>
            <li> Product came exactly as advertised, the error on my part was that I did not realize that it was unrefined.  </li>
            <li> Only reason that it received a 4 not a 5 is that it is much more greasy than advertised</li>
            <li> It has been my number one choice for use on sun and wind burned skin caused by using a motorcycle as my primary source of transportation, 100+ degree heat and cloudless Texas sky.</li>
            <li> Also pleased with low postage for 4 pounds!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not edible, this product is for cosmetic use, for the skin, hair,etc</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and soft after using this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased Shea butter from this same company and love it.  </li>
            <li> This was my first purchase from ED.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as pictured and when I opened the tub, it smelled just like chocolate.</li>
            <li> Smells divine, feels divine, and does exactly what I expect it to.</li>
            <li> This is the first cocoa butter I have purchased, so nothing to compare to, but this has all the characterisics that I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for the DIY sunscreen that I made.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used my other cocoa butters to make homemade whipped body butters, and they make for an amazing moisturizer.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered natural cocoa butter before, and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> actually if it smelled less amazing it might be better, (makes me crave</li>
            <li> Some other online suggestions didn&#x27;t seem like they would be something I wanted to do and this has worked out very easily and well for me.  </li>
            <li> It makes you super soft.</li>
            <li> What a generous amount for this price, I&#x27;m so thankful I looked on Amazon and found this pure organic cocoa butter for this price.</li>
            <li> I did NOT want any type of additives and so chose this one as it is pure cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> Just a note to people that do not know about cocoa butter in this pure state.</li>
            <li> Nothing better than real cocoa butter for dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Love that their packaging is eco friendly without excessive packaging or dyes.  </li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils and am always researching a better way to stay &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; as organically/processed free as possible.  </li>
            <li> It does have a cocoa/chocolate scent, much like a bag of chocolate chips.</li>
            <li> much more chocolatey than i expected.</li>
            <li> It is VERY moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It did work very well on my lips though.</li>
            <li> This product is as described and works very well.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs really well into the skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks for providing the real deal.</li>
            <li> I mix it with the Shea butter from this company and use it at night straight out of the shower..</li>
            <li> This is the real deal cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe how much richer it is than the tube cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Packing was whole, in Russia not to buy it from us, and I so hoped to do house chocolate for the child.</li>
            <li> Seems very Organic. . .</li>
            <li> It is real organic cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Any suggestions on how to make this into a personal smooth lotion??</li>
            <li> I really like and I like the smell</li>
            <li> It lites up the whole room.</li>
            <li> It really mostuirizes my skin.</li>
            <li> This unrefined cocoa butter is more like wax than butter and can be removed from the jar by shaving off thin layers off of the top..</li>
            <li> Seems good for lotion, but isn&#x27;t mean for food.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this was just a fluke based on the other reviews, but when my product arrived the cap was mostly unscrewed</li>
            <li> I use it mostly at bed time now due to the smell.</li>
            <li> I go back and forth between wanting to smear this luscious, rich stuff all over my body and eat it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it made a burn heal really quick, it went from second degree to almost unnoticeable!  </li>
            <li> Seeing that she is older</li>
            <li> I recommend this particular product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much exactly what it looks like: a decently-sized tub of solid cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> The only thing is... need more essential oil to &#x27;balance&#x27; the smell!</li>
            <li> But if you want a pure product with no additives to possibly make your problem worse if using for medical reasons than this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> highly reccomended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to people who want to condition their skin and reduce scars.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this to make my own lotion (along with some other ingredients obviously.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard but melts nicely when applying.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased raw cocoa butter,  and overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the product I received.</li>
            <li> I love the properties of cocoa butter and am anxious to try out new &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34; and plan to make large batches of moisturizers for my friends and</li>
            <li> We have always used oil in ours, but I was ready to step it up as my 11 year old daughter was organizing a father/daughter dance in our backyard</li>
            <li> Expensive but great.</li>
            <li> worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use a lot of this in normal cooking, but when the recipe calls for it this is the one we use.  </li>
            <li> Again, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal or not.  </li>
            <li> Even when microwaved to soften product is hardens right back up.</li>
            <li> The butter was uniform and quite smooth once melted; there was no debris as was reported in other reviews.</li>
            <li> Nice and solid in the container, takes a little bit of work to get out.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> does smell a little strong though.</li>
            <li> Very hard, but when melted down makes an incredible cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice, medium-mild chocolaty smell and is very hard, even in the middle of this hot summer.</li>
            <li> Smooth, silky and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I use it afrer showering and it keeps my feet very soft soft.</li>
            <li> I melted mine down a bit in the microwave and then added some shea butter, coconut oil, glycerin, and some essential oils to make it a bit more user-friendly for my purposes.</li>
            <li> anyone who has never tried unrefined cocoa butter let me warn you that it is very hard and has to be chipped out, I like to warm it in my hands and then apply it</li>
            <li> but just recently switch to this pure form of cocoa butter</li>
            <li> and I see a big difference by using pure 100% cocoa butter versus a palmers cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely Cocoa butter, it has everything an unrefined cocoa butter should have, it is hard, but that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I saw the many one star reviews saying it was so hard they couldn&#x27;t get it from the jar.</li>
            <li> Lovely hard butter with chocolate scent.  </li>
            <li> I leave it outside and it is always soft and ready to be used.</li>
            <li> This product seems old.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the real deal.</li>
            <li> i want to see if it helps my 11 year old get rid of a couple of scars.my niece fell off her bike and scratched her forehead.</li>
            <li> I was advised by my 88 year old grandmother to use cocoa butter to help with scarring.  </li>
            <li> and I like chocolate as much as the next person but</li>
            <li> This is comparable to another organic cocoa butter I purchased from the store, only this was much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin because she has eczema.</li>
            <li> We also put it in our hair for a natural conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I just got an old product and it has over-hardened??</li>
            <li> I love the cocoa smell but hate the time it takes to dig out the product with a spoon, warm it up, and put it on.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product especially to anyone who cannot use the ingredients added to most other creams and lotions containing cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> First, I must clarify that I&#x27;m unsure if this is indeed raw, unrefined, unprocessed cocoa butter because it was sent in the container just as pictured &amp; is smooth.</li>
            <li> It has a very smoky, strange smell.</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way as you do not need much to get the soothing relief that</li>
            <li> It it a hard texture that melts easily in my pan; and firms up my product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard as rock, but softens up easily.  </li>
            <li> On taste seemingly neutral, but there is an aftertaste a little with a taste of bitterness, and the smell very much spoils everything!</li>
            <li> I wanted to be a little bit more natural with my body not only internally but externally too.</li>
            <li> I originally thought I got a bad jar until I read the reviews more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Not sure if there&#x27;s a special way to get it out.</li>
            <li> (it barely took 1/4 turn to remove it) and the foil seal was 3/4 lifted off.  </li>
            <li> I put it all over my body especially in darker areas like old scars.</li>
            <li> By the time I re-ordered it, it came as chips of Cocoa butter and barely any fragrance of what I know it should smell like.</li>
            <li> so this will be the last purchase of natural cocoa butter in a jar.</li>
            <li> I had expected to receive the same product I had purchased the first time.</li>
            <li> out there which kind of have a weird smell along with the cocoa</li>
            <li> It is a hard, solid block, but is easy to use without mixing it with another softer butter.</li>
            <li> I make my own body lotions, since I have dry skin, and store products either do nothing, or make it worse.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter was harder than I expected, but warms up quickly to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Very hard at room temperature and has strong smell.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a sealed plastic covering that was oily to touch, which got on other items in box, when I opened it the inside of wrap was oily and the whole outside of jar was oily and had cocoa butter on it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff if super extra hard.</li>
            <li> It helps a lot with repairing skin that saw a little too much wind, sun, or even drywall dust.</li>
            <li> I put it in a little container set it on the lamp, it liquifies fast and It becomes like oil.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how much to expect this item to cost, and while it is certainly more expensive than oil, it didn&#x27;t feel too extravagant, especially since the chocolate fountain is something we only pull out once a year or less.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s raw, pure cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> But the butter looks very old, bottom of jar has dark brown spots in it.  </li>
            <li> As this winter has been long and cold and dry one, everyone who tried the lotion loved it for their dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have some very old stretch marks on my legs and its less visible.</li>
            <li> I normally use the hair dryer to get this a little melted while it&#x27;s in my hand</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my wrinkled 63 year old face is less wrinkled than my 40 year old son&#x27;s is since using this product in conjunction with the other products I mentioned ordering.</li>
            <li> I suspect this will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is not your typical soft creamy cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> spent another 5 minutes to rub in the tiny white beads thinkings</li>
            <li> and then I quickly became addicted to taking a chunk and rubbing it over my skin.</li>
            <li> Be warned: it is brick hard in the container and will need to be gently melted in order to remove.</li>
            <li> This is very moisturizing, but as others have said it arrives brick hard.</li>
            <li> I run hot water into the jar, let it sit for a bit and dab small amounts on my fingers to rub into my face and any other dry areas.</li>
            <li> The smell does not persist too long ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried organic cocoa butter before and had only tried the stuff you get at big retailers--the watered down product.  </li>
            <li> Where my other cocoa butters were smooth and creamy, this seemed thin and cracking (in it&#x27;s unmelted state) and not nearly as dense or cream colored as the other cocoa butters</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s chunky and beady.&lt;br /&gt;Using a spoon and scooping a small bit to rub on the skin took over 15 minutes to rub in but it left tiny white</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy but is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I had purchased cocoa butter from 3 other manufacturers prior to buying from this company</li>
            <li> I made lotion with some of this mixed with other butters.</li>
            <li> I scoop some into the palm of my hand, let it melt and within seconds I have a lotion to spread due to the cocoa butter&#x27;s low melting point.</li>
            <li> I received it together with other goods today one big parcel, from my post service.</li>
            <li> It actually takes a sharp object to pick product apart and product to break it up, then it come out in crumbles.</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> So now, I use it on my body and hands to fight winter itch and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Since I live in Florida I have issues with it being hard.</li>
            <li> I guess it would have to be mixed with another lotion after being melted down??</li>
            <li> Also, raw cocoa butter is supposed to be brick hard and somewhat gritty when softened but melts right into your skin with a slight chocolatey fragrance that lingers a bit.</li>
            <li> There is a slight cocoa smell in the lotion and several people who tried it didn&#x27;t care of it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> and you get those little beads that you have to remove/shave off the clothing - this is what the beads of &amp;#34;cocoa butter &amp;#34; left behind.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I feel a little ripped off actually.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this to make homemade body butter, hard lotion (in molds) and chaptick.  </li>
            <li> Only difficulty is that it&#x27;s a bit hard to get it out of the jar unless it is heated, but I&#x27;d rather have it in an actual jar than received it in a ziplock bag...</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks there&#x27;s no scar left.</li>
            <li> It is not something I can return, but I am upset with myself at spending the money and not getting what I expected.</li>
            <li> however it stays harder at room temperature than bulk Shae Butter does....</li>
            <li> We melt it in a saucepan, or just roll a chunk of it between our palms at night when we watch TV and rub it all over the rough spots.  </li>
            <li> it was nearly impossible to get it out of the jar in order to be able to melt it down to make the butter..</li>
            <li> I used this with shea butter and some other oils to make home made body butter.  </li>
            <li> My intention in buying this was to combine it with other creams or oils to make a type of body cream.  </li>
            <li> This product makes you wonder how the other well-known brand of Cocoa Butter in a tub is processed.</li>
            <li> I use this with my other butters and oils.</li>
            <li> I only need a small amount of it when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> Hope to use it for other homemade skin care.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard &amp; solid unless heated or mixed with something to soften it.</li>
            <li> It melted down just as expected.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> This is the 1st time I&#x27;ve bought cocoa butter, so I have no idea what it&#x27;s supposed to look like; this is nearly as hard as a brick; I have to scrape it with a knife to use it, and when I put it in the double broiler, had to stab it out of the jar in chunks.</li>
            <li> hard to get it out as it is really solid.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it is extremely hard -</li>
            <li> I use a double boiler to melt the cocoa butter since it comes in the plastic jar but is rock hard in consistency .... and mix it with any oil( almond, coconut -but</li>
            <li> It is not fresh at all.</li>
            <li> Against all common sense and instinct, I thought that maybe it would cook off or mellow out once made into some white chocolate, but it was just as pronounced in</li>
            <li> It is difficult to use straight out of the container, I melted it down and made it into a lotion.</li>
            <li> but then i thought about it and it was probably melted down some&lt;br</li>
            <li> Requires using a blow dryer at the opening of the jar to melt it down some.  </li>
            <li> It has foreign a little pro-rancid smell, as though pro-rancid milk.</li>
            <li> The melting temperature is slightly lower than body temperature and it will melt in your hand.  </li>
            <li> The melting temperature is slightly lower than body temperature and it will melt in your hand.</li>
            <li> The company told me I could microwave it slightly</li>
            <li> but because the cocoa butter and coconut oil helped I improve the texture of my skin it made my stretch marks less silvery.</li>
            <li> It has these little &amp;#34;grains&amp;#34; in it, sort of like sand, but once melted, they seem to go away.  </li>
            <li> Ws a little grainy but served my purpose.</li>
            <li> I scraped for what it seemed like forever just to get a little amount out</li>
            <li> Not a rich smelling cocoa butter, but rather dull and bitter smelling.  </li>
            <li> Ordered a few times and will continue to reorder.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and myself use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I had been using shea butter for lotion bars and whipped body butters but found it a bit too oily and heavy for me and decided to try this cocoa butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is so heavy</li>
            <li> I even use a small amount under my eyes and it makes my skin look less darker underneath.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard, so I like to mix it with other ingredients to make a body whip.</li>
            <li> It is hard and must be melted down if blending to make body butters.</li>
            <li> I have used this raw as a lotion and used it in a deodorant recipe.</li>
            <li> so I decided to order this raw butter.  </li>
            <li> - I prefer it to come in small chunks.</li>
            <li> form and I was not able to use it and had to return it</li>
            <li> I cannot use it unless I take a spoon and try to get some out of the jar, then I have to microwave it in a small tupperware I have for about 18 seconds, then apply it.  </li>
            <li> the lid arrived broken because it was shipped in a box with heavier items, but i&#x27;ve ordered other items from this vendor without any issues.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t prepared for how hard it was going to be and didn&#x27;t read the comments before ordering like I usually do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard you can&#x27;t get it out of the jar.  </li>
            <li> have given 5 stars but its hard to get out the&lt;br /&gt;jar.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get out</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2014 and it  spoil before 2015 has a scent like its rancid,and it has a  hard crumbly texture, can it be use?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to melt.</li>
            <li> The product is as hard as a brick.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter is hard as a rock, but perhaps it is suppose to be that way.</li>
            <li> It looks like it has bacteria spots, and it is really hard, not at all like creme.</li>
            <li> Hard to get out of the container as well</li>
            <li> Kinda hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to know if it&#x27;s supposed to be hard like this.</li>
            <li> yes I know it&#x27;s supposed to be somewhat hard -</li>
            <li> It is hard as a brick when you get it</li>
            <li> This Cocoa Butter was so hard I couldn&#x27;t even run it through my blender to mix it with coconut oil or anything else.</li>
            <li> But it is extremely hard.</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance but its so hard to dig into that it takes away from the benefit of the product.</li>
            <li> considering how dense and hard cocoa butter becomes at room temperature.</li>
            <li> This smells yummy,it is hard in the jar</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to say at all.  </li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to walk around all day smelling like it.</li>
            <li> This unrefined cocoa butter is hard - you dont stick your finger in the tub and get a dollop!</li>
            <li> This stuff is as hard as a rock!  </li>
            <li> Its very hard, but melts to body warmth.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to the touch and therefore did not meet my expectation.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use as product is VERY firm.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little disappointing that in order to use it you have to melt it.</li>
            <li> am not happy with this product&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I had read about poor performance in a chocolate fountain using oil.  </li>
            <li> I have been doing therapy for a broken wrist recovery, and the therapist uses cocoa butter to help massage the wrist and hand.</li>
            <li> SO HARD IMPOSSIBLE TO USE</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m having a difficult time getting it out of the jar in chunks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get out of this container, but it&#x27;s going to be difficult to get out of any container</li>
            <li> My skin itches like crazy, and my throat is even itchy.</li>
            <li> Very tedious</li>
            <li> I assumed(my bad)</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> (everyone else seems to have had glowing satisfaction with this), but it was just BAD.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell bad like some others complain about,  </li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed with this  cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> As is, this was the WORST cocoa butter I&#x27;ve ever bought, and I would NOT recommend it to be used for ANYTHING.</li>
            <li> It just looks nasty.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells wonderful!! Excellent product, great quality.</li>
            <li> I received and opened my order only to find that this product is ROCK HARD.&lt;br /&gt;Using a finger or finger nail cannot get it out.  It&#x27;s chunky and beady.&lt;br /&gt;Using a spoon and scooping a small bit to rub on the skin took over 15 minutes to rub in but it left tiny white beads.&lt;br /&gt;I spent another 5 minutes to rub in the tiny white beads thinkings it&#x27;s just more cocoa butter, but those did not dissolve&lt;br /&gt;It resembles some type of cotton or like when your clothes start to fuzz and you get those little beads that you have to remove/shave off the clothing - this is what the beads of &amp;#34;cocoa butter &amp;#34; left behind.&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy with this product&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t even smell chocolate-y.&lt;br /&gt;It feels like it was blended with something else.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like a refund or a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;THis product is not cocoa butter and it&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s advertised to be.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like it was left exposed to the air for months then packaged and sealed.&lt;br /&gt;Totally dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> I have used this raw as a lotion and used it in a deodorant recipe. I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great Product!!! Works well when making your own lotion or body butter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the reviews for this product before I bought it.  It&#x27;s so hard you can&#x27;t get it out of the jar.  I thought it was going to be like coconut oil.  I was going to make a body butter out of the two but I threw it away cuz I didn&#x27;t want to fuss with it.</li>
            <li> Bomby cocoa butter for your body.  I used this with shea butter and some other oils to make home made body butter.  works great!</li>
            <li> Love it. I used it to make body butter. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Great for making your own creams and stuff.</li>
            <li> Not for internal use.... I assumed(my bad) that it was edible since it was 100 % organic.</li>
            <li> This stuff if super extra hard. To time consuming to be melting in microwave everything I need to use it.</li>
            <li> Not for interal use? Why? That means its not fully organic than!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to make a chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money. Not described as not edible product  in guidelines</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful!  Used in deodorant and hand cream.  Very solid until melted.</li>
            <li> would buy again nice size jar great prices</li>
            <li> love cocoa butter&lt;br /&gt;smells great and feels great on the skin&lt;br /&gt;mix mine with shea butter&lt;br /&gt;so i can walk around smellin all chocolaty lol&lt;br /&gt;would have given 5 stars but its hard to get out the&lt;br /&gt;jar. i thought it would have been a better convenience to have it in&lt;br /&gt;the jar but then i thought about it and it was probably melted down some&lt;br /&gt;to get it in the jar in the first place. but still happy with it and will continue to use</li>
            <li> This is by far, the best packaging I have come by for cocoa butter, sealed and everything.  I will be ordering from Essential Depot in the future.</li>
            <li> This stuff made great body butter.</li>
            <li> This is very nice quality cocoa butter.  I used it to make deodorant and that was lovely, but this is so nice I use it by it&#x27;s self on my skin, it made a burn heal really quick, it went from second degree to almost unnoticeable!  It smells really good to!!!</li>
            <li> So far I have used this to make homemade body butter, hard lotion (in molds) and chaptick.  All have turned out amazing.  I would definitely recommend this product and will be purchasing again once my tub is gone</li>
            <li> Great value and great product.  Just had knee surgery and this helped prevent scaring.</li>
            <li> The smell of this cocoa butter is amazing, you can tell it&#x27;s used to make chocolate since it smells more chocolate-like than most &amp;#34;100% cocoa butters&amp;#34; out there which kind of have a weird smell along with the cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot too, if you&#x27;re just using it for your skin every day it should last you more than a year easy.</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my pregnancy and also added some vitamin E into it. I got through my pregnancy with no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> This my second purchase love the purity of it. It is hard to get out but I work it out. Have anyone tried on their scalp?</li>
            <li> I have been using rhe product for six months and it has given me the results I hasd hoped for. I use it afrer showering and it keeps my feet very soft soft. I even use a small amount under my eyes and it makes my skin look less darker underneath. It is almost oderless, and that is a plus.</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2014 and it  spoil before 2015 has a scent like its rancid,and it has a  hard crumbly texture, can it be use?</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Good quality.</li>
            <li> What I wanted, as I use this to make my own creams.</li>
            <li> Precisely as described.</li>
            <li> I use this in the soaps I make, and it&#x27;s wonderful.  It helps a lot with repairing skin that saw a little too much wind, sun, or even drywall dust.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this was just a fluke based on the other reviews, but when my product arrived the cap was mostly unscrewed (it barely took 1/4 turn to remove it) and the foil seal was 3/4 lifted off.  I asked for a replacement or refund and Amazon chose to simply refund.  Amazon&#x27;s customer service, as always, is top-notch, but I was a little concerned at the condition of the product when it arrived.  Again, hopefully a fluke, as many other people seem satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been messing around with and finding many uses for tropical oils since purchasing coconut oil to cook with.. I bought organic cocoa butter, shea butter, almond oil, and beeswax pellets to make my own skin and hair care products after reading reviews here on Amazon... This unrefined cocoa butter is more like wax than butter and can be removed from the jar by shaving off thin layers off of the top.. The melting temperature is slightly lower than body temperature and it will melt in your hand.  It has been my number one choice for use on sun and wind burned skin caused by using a motorcycle as my primary source of transportation, 100+ degree heat and cloudless Texas sky.  I have noticed that my wrinkled 63 year old face is less wrinkled than my 40 year old son&#x27;s is since using this product in conjunction with the other products I mentioned ordering.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, have to use a heated spoon to get it out of the jar but well worth it.</li>
            <li> loved this stuff. i put it on my face at night and in my bath to give my skin a super smooth and moisterized feeling.</li>
            <li> I use cocoa butter for making home made body scrubs. This is a great price for the amount. It was shipped in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Will always use shea butter and will buy from them. It looks authentic.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and like it already. Reason for the 4 stars it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m having a difficult time getting it out of the jar in chunks. Not sure if there&#x27;s a special way to get it out. However I like the way it feels on my skin, smooth!</li>
            <li> Each time I purchase from Essential Depot, I am never disappointed and more than satisfied.  I order my food-grade lye from here.  I was sent a sample of their Ylang Ylang essential oil and enjoyed using it in a blend as well.</li>
            <li> This product seems old. Like its been sitting for years. It&#x27;s hard to melt. The product is as hard as a brick. Will not buy again. It is not fresh at all. I bought this product for homemade body butter.</li>
            <li> This products is just as advertised. It is a great value for the quality and I have been rather pleased with it overall.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> excellent product i use it every day. would not know how to act if i didn&#x27;t use it. highly reccomended</li>
            <li> First, I must clarify that I&#x27;m unsure if this is indeed raw, unrefined, unprocessed cocoa butter because it was sent in the container just as pictured &amp; is smooth. I know that something had to be done to it to get it from natural chunk form to smooth in a container. Otherwise, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product. It has all the characteristics of natural cocoa butter and made a very nice skin &amp; hair product. Be warned: it is brick hard in the container and will need to be gently melted in order to remove. Also, raw cocoa butter is supposed to be brick hard and somewhat gritty when softened but melts right into your skin with a slight chocolatey fragrance that lingers a bit. I would buy this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I use this ingredient in my homemade deodorant. It has a sweet cocoa scent in the jar, my family wanted eat it :-) . It it a hard texture that melts easily in my pan; and firms up my product.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars but it&#x27;s a little disappointing that in order to use it you have to melt it. I wish the consistency was more like Shea Butter. It smells great and offers great benefits for those that use it on a regular bases.</li>
            <li> This is very moisturizing, but as others have said it arrives brick hard. I originally thought I got a bad jar until I read the reviews more thoroughly. I use a table knife to shave some off and rub it in my hands until it melts and then use it. It is a little heavy but is very moisturizing. It does have a cocoa/chocolate scent, much like a bag of chocolate chips. This is definitely the real deal.</li>
            <li> Requires using a blow dryer at the opening of the jar to melt it down some.  I will use it after I finish the more convenient options I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I had read about poor performance in a chocolate fountain using oil.  We have always used oil in ours, but I was ready to step it up as my 11 year old daughter was organizing a father/daughter dance in our backyard and I wanted to help her make it special.  I was pleased to find this Cocoa Butter on Amazon - not having any idea where I would find such a thing in the store! I didn&#x27;t know how much to expect this item to cost, and while it is certainly more expensive than oil, it didn&#x27;t feel too extravagant, especially since the chocolate fountain is something we only pull out once a year or less.  And thanks to the Prime membership, I had the butter in time to put it to use with happy results for a smooth flowing fountain with a full chocolate flavor serving as a superb centerpiece dessert for a wonderful party.  I think if I plan ahead again the next time I use the fountain, I would again use the Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells like chocolate so I use it at night. (I love chocolate but i don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like it) I put it all over my body especially in darker areas like old scars. It makes you super soft. It is solid ,but it melts to the touch. I have this wax lamp I use it to melt the cocoa butter. I put it in a little container set it on the lamp, it liquifies fast and It becomes like oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make white chocolate, and it was SO revolting.  As stated in the title, it had an overwhelming skunky/acrid burnt rubber smell.  Against all common sense and instinct, I thought that maybe it would cook off or mellow out once made into some white chocolate, but it was just as pronounced in the after product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I had purchased cocoa butter from 3 other manufacturers prior to buying from this company so I&#x27;m familiar with how it should smell and taste (intoxicatingly chocolate-y!), and what I got just isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Perhaps I got a bad batch (everyone else seems to have had glowing satisfaction with this), but it was just BAD.  Now that I think about it, it even LOOKED inferior.  Where my other cocoa butters were smooth and creamy, this seemed thin and cracking (in it&#x27;s unmelted state) and not nearly as dense or cream colored as the other cocoa butters I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As is, this was the WORST cocoa butter I&#x27;ve ever bought, and I would NOT recommend it to be used for ANYTHING. (I&#x27;ve used my other cocoa butters to make homemade whipped body butters, and they make for an amazing moisturizer.)</li>
            <li> this has a great smell. much more chocolatey than i expected. the lid arrived broken because it was shipped in a box with heavier items, but i&#x27;ve ordered other items from this vendor without any issues. i used it yesterday to make homemade peppermint chocolate body butter. it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> i want to see if it helps my 11 year old get rid of a couple of scars.my niece fell off her bike and scratched her forehead. After using this product for a few weeks there&#x27;s no scar left.</li>
            <li> Smells so wonderful and makes your body so soft and not greasy. Perfect for your night grooming needs! Ordered a few times and will continue to reorder. Large size and great price.</li>
            <li> My intention in buying this was to combine it with other creams or oils to make a type of body cream.  I melted some one night and tried it on my face.  It is VERY moisturizing.  It has these little &amp;#34;grains&amp;#34; in it, sort of like sand, but once melted, they seem to go away.  I haven&#x27;t actually used it as a body cream yet, so maybe I will come back later and tell you how that works out.  I have never used Cocoa Butter before, so this is my first experience with it.  It did work very well on my lips though.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter is nice quality, and great smelling. Worked well in my lotions. The lid came damaged, so I have to keep it sealed with plastic wrap and then the lid. The cocoa butter is hard as a rock, but perhaps it is suppose to be that way.</li>
            <li> Product came exactly as advertised, the error on my part was that I did not realize that it was unrefined.  Only reason that it received a 4 not a 5 is that it is much more greasy than advertised</li>
            <li> Great mostiurizer for pregnant bellies! I love the cocoa smell but hate the time it takes to dig out the product with a spoon, warm it up, and put it on. It&#x27;s time consuming for people on the go!</li>
            <li> The melting temperature is slightly lower than body temperature and it will melt in your hand. It has been my number one choice for use on sun and wind burned skin caused by using a motorcycle as my primary source of transportation, 100+ degree heat and cloudless Texas sky.</li>
            <li> Love this cocoa butter. Easy to make whipped body butter with it cocoa, shea, coconut oil, organic olive oil and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, packaging intact. The price is good. The texture is lovely. The scent is amazing. This was precisely what I hoped it would be. I will be buying from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this to make my own lotion (along with some other ingredients obviously.)  My fiance, who accuses me of being a pilgrim for making some of my own stuff, loves it and uses it every night.  I love the fact that I know exactly what we&#x27;re slathering on!</li>
            <li> If I had to describe this, I would say it smells like heaven. It smells sooooooo good. And it moisturizers like nobodies buisness. I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is as described and works very well.  I fell and scarred my face 4 months ago.  I have used everything.  I was advised by my 88 year old grandmother to use cocoa butter to help with scarring.  Seeing that she is older they don&#x27;t make things like the used to so I decided to order this raw butter.  I have noticed a big difference in just 3 weeks.  I will continue to use this in hopes to not have to have surgery.  Wish me luck!</li>
            <li> I have been doing therapy for a broken wrist recovery, and the therapist uses cocoa butter to help massage the wrist and hand. I thought I would like to do that at home. However, organic is way different than what she uses. It looks like it has bacteria spots, and it is really hard, not at all like creme. My fault, I guess I should know, but organic in food is my only reference. I did not expect it to be as it is. The company told me I could microwave it slightly and that would help melt it and thus be more usable, but I was wanting something usable out of the jar. It is not something I can return, but I am upset with myself at spending the money and not getting what I expected. Totally on me, just if there is someone else out there who does not get the difference between &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and non-organic cocoa butter, this is written for them.</li>
            <li> This product needs some heat applied to make it usable. I hold a hair dryer on it for a minute. Once it starts to melt it goes on the skin nicely and feels wonderful. The chocolate smell is intoxicating.</li>
            <li> I used this to make my own lotion. It smells amazing and I like the consistency. It absorbs really well into the skin.</li>
            <li> It is truly authentic. It&#x27;s the cocoa butter that my mom used to buy. It smells like something one could eat. Thanks for providing the real deal.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use to make homemade lotion. Smells just like delicious chocolate! I can not wait to use it!</li>
            <li> Nothing better than real cocoa butter for dry skin and hair. Smooth, silky and long lasting. Both my wife and myself use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This product is not what I had hoped for.  Not a rich smelling cocoa butter, but rather dull and bitter smelling.  Hard to get out of the container as well - I prefer it to come in small chunks.</li>
            <li> Wonderful feel, wonderful aroma.  Great for body lotion!  Would recommend to anyone looking for a body butter that just melts into your skin.</li>
            <li> I made lotion with some of this mixed with other butters. My husband said I smelled like a brownie. Essential oil did not help.</li>
            <li> What a generous amount for this price, I&#x27;m so thankful I looked on Amazon and found this pure organic cocoa butter for this price. I love it for my skin all over my body and face. Amazing deal.</li>
            <li> Got here fast,Good quality, pleasant aroma ,really beneficial for the ski, makes it soft and glowing..I just dig a piece out w a tool of sort and melt it with my hands.Using it right out of the shower works best to melt it.I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  It was in a &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; form and I was not able to use it and had to return it</li>
            <li> Used the Cocoa butter for lotion bars, worked beautifully, loved the smell! Would buy again. Also pleased with low postage for 4 pounds!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and texture, fresh and inviting.  Works well in recipes (such as body butters, lip balms, and cloned tiger balm).</li>
            <li> I love cocoa butter.  This one is pure, smell good and absorbs into my skin. I miss it with coconut oil and it improved my skin texture and look. my skin is so much more softer and smoother. I have some very old stretch marks on my legs and its less visible. The stretch mark is still there but because the cocoa butter and coconut oil helped I improve the texture of my skin it made my stretch marks less silvery. I&#x27;ve used cocoa butter with coconut oil for about. couple of years but just recently switch to this pure form of cocoa butter and I see a big difference by using pure 100% cocoa butter versus a palmers cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this works great on my face. I run hot water into the jar, let it sit for a bit and dab small amounts on my fingers to rub into my face and any other dry areas. The smell goes away soon so don&#x27;t worry about getting eaten by chocoholics. I suspect this will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> This seems like a fine product.  My only problem is the container - I had to cut it with scissors to get the cocoa butter out.  Then, in a double boiler, I melted all of it and poured it into 1T size square molds so I could use it easier.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard. But its ok because I make my own lotion with it.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff around.  worth the extra money. Lasts a very long time.  I recommend this particular product</li>
            <li> One of our favorite products!!!  We use it with organic shea butter, beeswax, coconut oil, and essential oils to make our baby&#x27;s butt cream.  Everyone including our baby&#x27;s doctor are impressed with the results!  We have purchased it several times.  Every time  a high quality product!!!</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I like the effect that it has on my skin.  I highly recommend this product to people who want to condition their skin and reduce scars.</li>
            <li> This product makes you wonder how the other well-known brand of Cocoa Butter in a tub is processed. This unrefined cocoa butter is hard - you dont stick your finger in the tub and get a dollop! I used a knife to chunk it up and then I quickly became addicted to taking a chunk and rubbing it over my skin. Your body heat intantly softens it to go on smoothly. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had been using shea butter for lotion bars and whipped body butters but found it a bit too oily and heavy for me and decided to try this cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;While it is less oily for me and works great, the smell of chocolate is almost over powering. It&#x27;s not a bad smell at all and I like chocolate as much as the next person but that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to walk around all day smelling like it. No essential oil will cover it either.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it absorbes easily, it does leave my skin hydrated and looking good. I use it mostly at bed time now due to the smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality cocoa butter and would have gotten five stars if it were packaged better. It&#x27;s not the easiest thing to get out of a plastic container. I hope the seller reconsiders the packaging.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed with this  cocoa butter. It has a very smoky, strange smell. I usually order cocoa butter from another company, and theirs has a delicious chocolate smell, very unlike this. However, I must say I have bought coconut oil and palm oil from this company and was pleased with their quality and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using cocoa butter. it feels good so far</li>
            <li> I bought this product for cooking... Unfortunately it is not edible, this product is for cosmetic use, for the skin, hair,etc.. It was not mentioned in the product description....</li>
            <li> Excellent price for a great product. This is comparable to another organic cocoa butter I purchased from the store, only this was much cheaper. It is difficult to use straight out of the container, I melted it down and made it into a lotion. Smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it in food, on our bodies, and in our hair.  It is a wonderful treat for the senses, and is great for the tissues.</li>
            <li> Good for Diabetic foot moisturizing however it stays harder at room temperature than bulk Shae Butter does....So I&#x27;m going with the Shae in future....This however is delish as a treat....tastes like a candy bar!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use this product all over my body and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I mix it with the Shea butter from this company and use it at night straight out of the shower.. FYI use it in the steam room or right after tanning as a moisturizer. My skin feels so smooth and soft after using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this cocoa butter!!!</li>
            <li> So far I Love this coco butter! Smells delightful! Is wonderful to my collection of other organic ingredients for body butters and lotions! I will continue to buy from this company!</li>
            <li> I used this and their shea butter to make my own lotion. This smells wonderful! I love it. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Having never used cocoa butter before, I have nothing to compare this to. It&#x27;s got a nice, medium-mild chocolaty smell and is very hard, even in the middle of this hot summer.</li>
            <li> I used this in my homemade lotion as well as to refill my cocoa butter stick. Great buy, great product! Smells great just as other cocoa butter I have used, seems both pure and good quality.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use a lot of this in normal cooking, but when the recipe calls for it this is the one we use.  Taste is very good and the quality is there.</li>
            <li> I make my own body lotions, since I have dry skin, and store products either do nothing, or make it worse. No wonder...a lot of them contain refinery ingredients, or some form of alcohol. This is the 1st time I&#x27;ve bought cocoa butter, so I have no idea what it&#x27;s supposed to look like; this is nearly as hard as a brick; I have to scrape it with a knife to use it, and when I put it in the double broiler, had to stab it out of the jar in chunks. So far, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, and has a nice smell, like a box of candy. I&#x27;d like to know if it&#x27;s supposed to be hard like this.</li>
            <li> I go back and forth between wanting to smear this luscious, rich stuff all over my body and eat it!&lt;br /&gt;It melts nicely into more liquid oils and really enriches lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> If you are allergic to dust mites, do not use this product. My skin itches like crazy, and my throat is even itchy. Wish I would have researched cocoa butter allergy before I purchased the product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this company!! I wanted to be a little bit more natural with my body not only internally but externally too. I use this with my other butters and oils. It&#x27;s so great. Oh ,I almost forgot. The butter is S O L I D. Like a rock or whatever.</li>
            <li> Smell greats. Came packed as described. Seems good for lotion, but isn&#x27;t mean for food. Only difficulty is that it&#x27;s a bit hard to get it out of the jar unless it is heated, but I&#x27;d rather have it in an actual jar than received it in a ziplock bag...</li>
            <li> It arrived in a sealed plastic covering that was oily to touch, which got on other items in box, when I opened it the inside of wrap was oily and the whole outside of jar was oily and had cocoa butter on it.  The jar however was sealed.  But the butter looks very old, bottom of jar has dark brown spots in it.  And label is messed up.  It just looks nasty.</li>
            <li> Very good cocoa butter. Ws a little grainy but served my purpose.</li>
            <li> I opened the box 5 minutes ago and had to sing its praises. I smell like a chocolate bar and my skin already feels amazing! buy it. buy it now.</li>
            <li> After a severe skin infection recently, my surgeon, and wound care doctors all recommended organic cocoa butter to help sooth the blistered and peeling skin from the skin what looked like burns from the inflammation from the infection.  So I ordered this particular brand and have been delighted with it.  I did NOT want any type of additives and so chose this one as it is pure cocoa butter.  This is a very solid piece of cocoa butter, but I use a tongue depressor or a wooden spoon (from ice cream bars) to scrape what I need each day and then I press the shavings into the palm of my hand and let them soften until it is spreadable on my legs.  I am not contaminating the product in the jar by putting my hands in it, just using the wooden stick or whatever you wish to use, and then depositing the amount I want into my hand.  I have found this to work well. Some other online suggestions didn&#x27;t seem like they would be something I wanted to do and this has worked out very easily and well for me.  If you are looking for a lotion then you do not want this product.  But if you want a pure product with no additives to possibly make your problem worse if using for medical reasons than this is perfect.  There is a lovely scent of cocoa or as most people say, &amp;#34;chocolate&amp;#34; for a short time, and to me, it is aroma therapy.  It is a really good scent/odor to me and not overpowering.  No one has ever asked me what I have on for a scent.  This product goes a long way as you do not need much to get the soothing relief that you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product especially to anyone who cannot use the ingredients added to most other creams and lotions containing cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> used it for homemade deodorant, works great leaves armpits smooth! does smell a little strong though.</li>
            <li> Made the best body lotion with this cocoa butter.  It smells yummy</li>
            <li> Works good. It&#x27;s hard, so I like to mix it with other ingredients to make a body whip.</li>
            <li> hard to get it out as it is really solid.</li>
            <li> I bought this solely to use during my pregnancy with my third child. Love this cocoa butter, I just heat some up in the microwave. I once again didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks, can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s from the product but keeping my stomach moisterized with this helped I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased raw cocoa butter,  and overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the product I received. I only gave it 4 stars because it is extremely hard - yes I know it&#x27;s supposed to be somewhat hard - but I literally have to take a steak knife to it, scrape away some shavings,  then scoop that out and melt it in order to use it.  It also had some weird white bumps all over the top.  Again, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal or not.  It didn&#x27;t smell bad like some others complain about,  so I took a leap of faith that it was OK to use.  All that being said,  once melted and mixed into my home remedies I make with it it&#x27;s very nice and works well.  I purchased Shea butter from this same company and love it.  Glad I got resealable containers,  too.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal cocoa butter. It is hard as a brick when you get it so be prepared to put some elbow grease into it! (laughing) I melted mine down a bit in the microwave and then added some shea butter, coconut oil, glycerin, and some essential oils to make it a bit more user-friendly for my purposes. I had originally wanted to use this for my hair but decided against it. I like the product but it was a too much for my fine, wavy hair. (3a/3b if you&#x27;re into hair typing). So now, I use it on my body and hands to fight winter itch and dry skin.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful!  Nice and solid in the container, takes a little bit of work to get out.  I used it to make lotion bars and it worked wonderfully</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter is wonderful! It works much better than the sort you buy in a tube at the store. It is a hard, solid block, but is easy to use without mixing it with another softer butter. I scoop some into the palm of my hand, let it melt and within seconds I have a lotion to spread due to the cocoa butter&#x27;s low melting point. Some times I just rub it between my palms, prayer hand style. You won&#x27;t believe how much richer it is than the tube cocoa butter. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter smells wonderful, but I should have done more research because I did not realize the jar would be a solid block.  This was timely and seems high-quality, skin-friendly!</li>
            <li> Hello! I ordered this product on November 27, it delivered on December 2, and an expiration date expiration date cocoa butter - till December, 2014. I received it together with other goods today one big parcel, from my post service. It has foreign a little pro-rancid smell, as though pro-rancid milk. On taste seemingly neutral, but there is an aftertaste a little with a taste of bitterness, and the smell very much spoils everything! That is I so understand that it didn&#x27;t deteriorate yet finally, but already in process...&lt;br /&gt;Certainly, I can smear now it on the body, but give in food to the child - already isn&#x27;t present. Packing was whole, in Russia not to buy it from us, and I so hoped to do house chocolate for the child. But it upset me.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Essential Depot has seriously impressed me with the quality of their product.  High quality at a great price.  Love that their packaging is eco friendly without excessive packaging or dyes.  Seems very Organic. . . I am new to essential oils and am always researching a better way to stay &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; as organically/processed free as possible.  I love the properties of cocoa butter and am anxious to try out new &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34; and plan to make large batches of moisturizers for my friends and family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the product, you are hit with the very chocolate aroma which is to be expected, but nevertheless a pleasant surprise!  The feel of the product is amazing!  Nothing negative to say at all.  I was also impressed with the fast shipping.  Of course, all the vendors that fulfilled by Amazon are amazing so I am spoiled in that regard.  I did go on line to research the company and am again impressed with their philosophy and the care they put into each product.  Good to see that you can make a profit and take care of the environment at the same time!</li>
            <li> Difficult to use as product is VERY firm.  Must be scraped out.  16oz as shavings is more than anyone would ever use!</li>
            <li> I am in Love with the product. This cocoa butter smells so good, it smells like chocolate. Very pleased that the product was delivered right on time and that it was very fresh. It is very hard to find great products where I am from, so I am very pleased:)</li>
            <li> Smells great works well with other butters to make own lotion!!! Little goes a long way!!! Would definitely recommend to frineds and family!!!</li>
            <li> Exellent unrefined butter.. smells delishhh .. really easy to melt.. im obsesssed ♥</li>
            <li> works well for my lip balms.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I&#x27;ve never ordered natural cocoa butter before, and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> No cream! SO HARD IMPOSSIBLE TO USE</li>
            <li> mmmmm smells lovely!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I just received it! I love how smooth my skin is! And I love the chocolate like smell. I mix a mixture of cocoa butter, sheabuter, coconut oil ,ollive oil, a teaspoon of honey, vegetable glycerin and aloe very gel to make my own homemade body butter 😁</li>
            <li> This was not at all what I was expecting when I ordered it. This Cocoa Butter was so hard I couldn&#x27;t even run it through my blender to mix it with coconut oil or anything else. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Item came as described with a short period of time and well-packaged.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Its very hard, but melts to body warmth. It smells almost like chocolate and makes my skin smooth even days after using it.</li>
            <li> I love this!  Great cocoa smell!  It&#x27;s hard as rock, but softens up easily.  I love using this for my lotion bars, cloth diaper wipe solution cubes, and deodorant.</li>
            <li> Smells so so yummy, works wonders on my pregnant growing belly. I hope this helps on stretch marks. I Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This product smells just like chocolate.But it is extremely hard. Could only get a couple of spoonfuls out but all and all its a great product</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase from ED. I got the cocoa butter, Shea butter and beeswax pearls. They arrived on time and are as described. Good quality. Will purchase from ED again.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff! I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin because she has eczema. I had to warm it in the microwave a bit because it was hard at first, but it is such a great product. I actually tasted it to see if it tasted as good as it smelt, but it didn&#x27;t. I only need a small amount of it when I&#x27;m using it. Very worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance but its so hard to dig into that it takes away from the benefit of the product.</li>
            <li> I was so hesitant to buy this because there was no review at the time.  I am so glad I bought it.  It is real organic cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I have never worked with cocoa butter before, but needed some organic for some skin stuff I&#x27;m working on. I wasn&#x27;t prepared for how hard it was going to be and didn&#x27;t read the comments before ordering like I usually do. I am sure it work fine. While digging some out today I found there is a huge air bubble inside, so my tub isn&#x27;t quite full of product. I feel a little ripped off actually. That&#x27;s the reason for the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I mix this along with the Palmers cocoa butter oil and it makes my skin feel like silk. I&#x27;ve also noticed that it&#x27;s evening out my skin blemishes. The smell is great. So no perfume is needed.</li>
            <li> I use this to make lotion and it works great. Has a nice smell!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get out of this container, but it&#x27;s going to be difficult to get out of any container considering how dense and hard cocoa butter becomes at room temperature. It smells and tastes delicious in recipes. The butter was uniform and quite smooth once melted; there was no debris as was reported in other reviews.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Any suggestions on how to make this into a personal smooth lotion?? I guess it would have to be mixed with another lotion after being melted down?? I&#x27;ll practice and report:)</li>
            <li> I used this to make a whipped body butter with an orange essential oil to compliment it and it is incredible!  It absorbs nicely and leaves a wonderful scent - my dog even took notice :-)</li>
            <li> Love the product, this is the first time I have ordered cocoa butter to place in a body lotion</li>
            <li> I really like and I like the smell but my husband hates the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this on impulse just to try it and have fallen in love with it.  I have two teenage daughters who also use it all the time.  We melt it in a saucepan, or just roll a chunk of it between our palms at night when we watch TV and rub it all over the rough spots.  It softens the skin and smells great!  We also put it in our hair for a natural conditioner.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely Cocoa butter, it has everything an unrefined cocoa butter should have, it is hard, but that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to be. I like using it in home made body butter recipes. It does need to be either melted or processed in a food processor to mix it. It has a great cocoa smell as well!</li>
            <li> This stuff is as hard as a rock!  I cannot use it unless I take a spoon and try to get some out of the jar, then I have to microwave it in a small tupperware I have for about 18 seconds, then apply it.  Very tedious and I don&#x27;t think I should have to do this to use a lotion!  It smells very nice and I&#x27;m sure the product is fine.  Perhaps I just got an old product and it has over-hardened??</li>
            <li> This product was not as soft as expected. It was very hard to the touch and therefore did not meet my expectation.</li>
            <li> I used this to put in a homemade body butter for pregnancy, so far so good.</li>
            <li> actually if it smelled less amazing it might be better, (makes me crave chocolate)&lt;br /&gt;for anyone who has never tried unrefined cocoa butter let me warn you that it is very hard and has to be chipped out, I like to warm it in my hands and then apply it, this does take a very long time if you wish to cover your entire body after a shower but the quality is great and my skin felt amazing, after putting some on in a section I wet my hand w a little warm water and find this helps to distribute the product better and aids with sinking into the skin.</li>
            <li> I used this item along with organic olive oil and organic beeswax for homemade body lotion. As this winter has been long and cold and dry one, everyone who tried the lotion loved it for their dry skin. There is a slight cocoa smell in the lotion and several people who tried it didn&#x27;t care of it.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed to make a wonderful body cream whip. It melted down just as expected. I saw the many one star reviews saying it was so hard they couldn&#x27;t get it from the jar. That&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to be!! It&#x27;s raw, pure cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Expensive but great. I use a double boiler to melt the cocoa butter since it comes in the plastic jar but is rock hard in consistency .... and mix it with any oil( almond, coconut -but this one solidifies).&lt;br /&gt;Makes for a great lotion and smells like chocolate. The smell does not persist too long ... but it s good enough for me. I dont think it will cure or erase skin imperfections like stretch marks ... and I believe true skin hydration comes from inside out not the stuff we slather on.&lt;br /&gt;But this is a wonderful alternative to any lotion out on the market.</li>
            <li> I have been using it and like it a lot! I have very dry skin this time of year and it is great. Use it daily on face and lips.</li>
            <li> This is very good quality. It&#x27;s exactly as pictured and when I opened the tub, it smelled just like chocolate. I used this to make lotion bars and lip balm and it worked perfectly. It is quite hard and solid at room temperature, so I set it on top of my gas fireplace overnight and in the morning it was perfectly liquid and slightly warm. It stayed liquid for hours as well, making it easy to use. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> great product at a reasonable price. i would buy this product again especially the shea butter which comes in same size bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much exactly what it looks like: a decently-sized tub of solid cocoa butter. I had a stick of this stuff I used for everything, and when I used it up I decided to go ahead and get a tub of it instead. Smells divine, feels divine, and does exactly what I expect it to. If you&#x27;re looking for unrefined cocoa butter, this is exactly what you want!</li>
            <li> My first order with this product was good. It was rich in fragrance and texture. By the time I re-ordered it, it came as chips of Cocoa butter and barely any fragrance of what I know it should smell like. The packaging was different and the company was different. I had expected to receive the same product I had purchased the first time. Never Again will I order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Huge container. It&#x27;s very hard &amp; solid unless heated or mixed with something to soften it. I use mine as eye and scar cream so it was mixed with coconut oil. I love it and the chocolate scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Very hard, but when melted down makes an incredible cream. This product has no added products, just as it said</li>
            <li> This is the first cocoa butter I have purchased, so nothing to compare to, but this has all the characterisics that I was expecting.  Lovely hard butter with chocolate scent.  I emulsified with coconut oil, beeswax and aloe juice to create a yummy smelling body butter.  I love it and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> The smell is so heavy but this also works wonders on the skin. I used it in a batch of lotion.</li>
            <li> This smells yummy,it is hard in the jar but once I dug some out gently with a paring knife it was fine.I melted some along with some shea butter and added sweet almond oil.Used double broiler method.cooled in refrig 20 min.used hand mixer to mix it up .put in plastic sealed containers.Excellent results! Makes great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter was harder than I expected, but warms up quickly to the touch.  I bought it to message on scars following bi-lateral knee replacement and smells wonderful and works great</li>
            <li> Smells nice like chocolate.  Needs to be warmed to pick up and put on, or use a spoon and warm in between your palms. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This butter is legit, you can go ahead and buy it. It&#x27;s been doing good for my stretch marks. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Worked great in the chocolate mint lip balm I made from scratch.  I was impressed to have such great flavor the first time I made it.  I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Quality of butter was fine but for the purpose of making body butter it was nearly impossible to get it out of the jar in order to be able to melt it down to make the butter..I scraped for what it seemed like forever just to get a little amount out and my hands hurt after..Great quality but its too hard to get out so this will be the last purchase of natural cocoa butter in a jar.</li>
            <li> Great for my skin, i love it. I will definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> I first bought this to make a personal deodorant and it worked okay, but the chocolate smell was strong and I didn&#x27;t want that to be honest. However, I later used it to make chocolate ice creams, sauces etc..., and it just gives great depth to chocolaty treats. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Great withe essential oils</li>
            <li> Love this. I make my own lotions and creams this worked well. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Smelled amazing, melted well in my homemade deodorant recipe.  Hope to use it for other homemade skin care.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this for about a year. It&#x27;s hard but melts nicely when applying. We&#x27;ve warmed some of it to transfer to a smaller jar which makes it even easier to apply. It smells wonderful. It&#x27;s a great product, and despite frequent use, we&#x27;re only halfway through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve recently bought shea butter from the same company... also terrific!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I used this to make lip balm and lotion bars. Our family loved the chocolate mint that we created using this product. We loved that it was organic and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I used this cocoa butter combined with sesame oil and a few drops of essential oil, heated up in a pan, to make a wonderful homemade body lotion. The kitchen smells amazing after heating this up!</li>
            <li> Unrefined organic cocoa butter that smells like milk chocolate! Just a note to people that do not know about cocoa butter in this pure state. It is hard and must be melted down if blending to make body butters. This is not your typical soft creamy cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Amazing in home made lotions.</li>
            <li> should come in a bag since it is a solid, you have to melt before each use in order to measure product</li>
            <li> Very hard at room temperature and has strong smell. Definitely authentic. Made Cocoa-shea butter</li>
            <li> Excellent prodcut, we love this Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> Since I live in Florida I have issues with it being hard. I leave it outside and it is always soft and ready to be used. Love the way it feels and smells.</li>
            <li> Product is in solid form. Even when microwaved to soften product is hardens right back up. It actually takes a sharp object to pick product apart and product to break it up, then it come out in crumbles. Not at all what I was expecting. Will not order this product again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it really is very solid and needs to be warmed up before it can be used.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! It is magnificent, and it I&#x27;d lasting me a very long time! I enjoy using it; it smells very nice, and it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried organic cocoa butter before and had only tried the stuff you get at big retailers--the watered down product.  This is amazing and nothing like that.  It&#x27;s totally solid and I use a spoon to scrape off what I need for each use.  I normally use the hair dryer to get this a little melted while it&#x27;s in my hand and then I apply it all over.  I love it so much.  It smells amazing, feels so good, and leaves my skin feeling really soft without making it greasy (which really surprised me).  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Quite strong of the cocoa smell but it&#x27;s really ok.  Used it in my DIY skin care lotion.  The only thing is... need more essential oil to &#x27;balance&#x27; the smell!</li>
            <li> This product is the best quality &amp; l love it! I hope  I&#x27;ll use only this cocoa butter in future .</li>
            <li> Great quality product. I used it to make body butter and it works excellent. I mixed it with coconut oil and olive oil.</li>
            <li> Great product, great company!!</li>
            <li> I had to mix it with avocado oil and then heat it on the stove.  I then mixed it with a mixer until blended.  It hardens and melts quickly when applied to skin.  I will definitely repurchase this since my skin stays hydrated during winter months.</li>
            <li> It lites up the whole room. The smell is delicious&lt;br /&gt;. I have eczema. I used the product on skin. It really mostuirizes my skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for the DIY sunscreen that I made. A great product as advertised. Will order again as needed.</li>
            <li> This worked great for my homemade lotion bars, and it smells heavenly. There&#x27;s no reason not to recommend this to anyone.</li>
