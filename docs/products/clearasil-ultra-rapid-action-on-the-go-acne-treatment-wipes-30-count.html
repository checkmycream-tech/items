            <li>These guys are great for keeping your skin clean.</li>
            <li>Very happy to see that an old company like Clearasil doesnt include it.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s easy and it works!</li>
            <li>First of all, the fact that these are wipes alone make them very handy.</li>
            <li>Best of all, they don&#x27;t have a very strong scent which may bother loved ones or small children if they get close after using a pad.</li>
            <li>What more could a guy (or mom) ask for....?</li>
            <li>I no longer get as many as I did, and if I do they are gone in a day instead of a week.</li>

            <li>I like this a lot better.</li>

            <li>was able to feel the difference.</li>
            <li>But I thought why not try it since I feel like my face could be cleaned better than a wash I use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought these as an \\&quot;add on item\\&quot; and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>

            <li>These pads clean great and are very convenient.</li>
            <li>They have a nice, clean light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about these pads is that they&#x27;re rough.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and transport.</li>
            <li>These are an easy way to freshen up during the work day, and help prevent break outs.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has amazing prices on the whole line!</li>

            <li>While it kept away pimples, it didn&#x27;t do as great of a \\&quot;pore cleansing\\&quot; job as I expected it to.</li>
            <li>order a lot of things from Amazon and have never given such a good review.  </li>
            <li>They clean my face and get rid of surprise pimples quickly.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong scent when first applied</li>
            <li>This is a miracle it has help my breakouts tremendously.</li>
            <li>On older skin, be sure to moisturize after you use these.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for a mild case of acne.  </li>
            <li>The normal cotton pads don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re doing a good job of exfoliating, but these scrubtastic little pads leave you feeling nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>The pads were effective at removing making, dirt, and general build-up.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because it did clean my skin when i first use</li>
            <li>They are so handy and easy to use and MESS FREE, and they really work!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 18, and struggle with huge clogged pores, and I really thought this would help.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>Or its nice to use in the middle of the day to wipe off excess dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>The price is good compared to other stores and it works well.</li>
            <li>Then I put oil of olay lotion on my face and chin/neck area right after and go to bed.  </li>
            <li>firstly, i got this at a really cheap price and they work really well .&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for the smell, I think these facial cleansing pads smell pretty nice.</li>
            <li>They work very well and smell really clean.  </li>
            <li>and this is easy for a 12 year old boy to use.</li>
            <li>I have used the pads consistently for a year now</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and smooth again.</li>
            <li>Get some!Will be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li>With a combo of Clean &amp; Clear</li>
            <li>I purchased these pads for my teen to keep in her gym locker for a super fast way to clean her face after gym class.</li>
            <li>I get the same refreshing clean feel with a basic wash cloth and soap.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it four stars is because you really have to stick to it.</li>
            <li>I bought some of these for my son to use on his shoulders for breakouts and they are working really well.  </li>
            <li>Real person here telling you to buy it.</li>
            <li>So much easier than an astringent and a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>We have very oily skin here, so using this really helps keep the gunk from building up throughout the day.</li>
            <li>but... I was really looking for a product that cleared up my breakouts plus got rid of blackheads.</li>
            <li>You can feel that it has a texture to it that really helps get into the pores.</li>
            <li>By time I get ready for bed, because I have really oily skin, my face needs washing and do not want to take another shower.</li>
            <li>Came fast , was sealed.</li>
            <li>These pads really worked well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything</li>
            <li>Once he started adding these pads to his cleansing routing, he&#x27;s stopped using the Retin A and his skin has really cleared up.  </li>
            <li>I buy these containers because it&#x27;s far more convenient to use these pre-moistened pads than to keep a bottle of astringent and a pack of facial pads.  </li>
            <li>I use these to clean up my face after being outside at work.  </li>
            <li>The price is high and the pads dry out very quick.</li>
            <li>I consistently have zits, and this helps to clear them up quicker/bring them to the surface quicker.</li>
            <li>first couple of times I used them on my face they stung a little bit, but your skin adjusts to it very quickly</li>
            <li>I looked everywhere for a wipe with non of the highly toxic propyl glycol ingredient in it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I remember using something like this in high school and looking at the pad after and being grossed out by the dirt.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong alcoholic odor that burns your eyes and skin.</li>
            <li>He still has a few pimples to deal with, but many fewer than before</li>
            <li>After years and years of suffering with mild adult acne, this product has FINALLY ended the breakout cycle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: the new version (Multicolored label) of Clearasil DOES now include propyl glycol.</li>
            <li>Makes her skin feel brand new and silky on her pillow at night.  </li>
            <li>When I am done spraying I wipe off my face with a new pad.</li>
            <li>One small pad works fine!</li>
            <li>The only thing is that make sure you close the lid carefully.</li>
            <li>The little pads are well saturated and just a teensy bit abrasive to really get your skin clean.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t believe the would do the same wonders for me like they did to everybody else.</li>
            <li>They are about the same price but a much higher quality.</li>
            <li>Talk about pore cleaning action!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased similar products, including other Clearasil items, and they seem to have a more exfoliating aspect to them .</li>
            <li>I had mild acne, not bad, but I&#x27;m 100% sure that this would work for you if you have really bad acne.</li>
            <li>I originally got them to clean acne-prone areas, like my shoulders and chest, without creating the mess that comes along with wiping down your body with liquid soap and a wash cloth on nights/mornings when you&#x27;re not taking a shower.</li>
            <li>Got it to clear up cracked skin on feet.  </li>
            <li>And they literally started to clear my acne after one use.</li>
            <li>It has helped clear up my acne</li>
            <li>So far they are working.</li>
            <li>I thought my skin was just being sensitive.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying facial wipes to remove your make up .  </li>
            <li>REALLY MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and have never had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, they did not deep clean as I would have expected.</li>
            <li>Cuts down the grease and dirt quickly</li>
            <li>For about two weeks (which seems like a long time but really wasn&#x27;t) I washed my face three times a day and used a pad after each time, and my skin was literally clear.</li>
            <li>I got these mainly for quickie cleansing during the day but also to use after regular face washing.  </li>
            <li>The only downfall I have found is that these pads are highly scented.</li>
            <li>With these cleansing pads, I can get all the dirt and grime off my face from my long day without the hassle of a real face wash.</li>
            <li>so i normally squeeze the excess back into the jar.  </li>
            <li>I am older and didn&#x27;t need anything this drying and would recommend trying any other cleaning pad if you are an older woman but not this one.</li>
            <li>but I bought this one initially because of its low cost and high amount of pads for the price.  </li>
            <li>I thought now it would just dry out my face since I&#x27;m now 33 years old and not really getting consistent pimples anymore.  </li>
            <li>not as good as some of the more gentle cleaning pads can leave your face red after using it and the pads are very thin and a little hard to take out of the container - bought two due to the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible nearly any cleansing pad similiar to this would do the same job</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these consistently for a few weeks now as an alternative to liquid toner/pore cleanser.</li>
            <li>I will admit that most nights, I am too lazy to get back in the shower or make a mess at the sink cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far I have notice that I have less breakouts, although they haven&#x27;t completely gone away.</li>
            <li>I hit up my entire body with them every few weeks and they clean extremely well.</li>

            <li> Or its nice to use in the middle of the day to wipe off excess dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> The price is good compared to other stores and it works well.</li>
            <li> Then I put oil of olay lotion on my face and chin/neck area right after and go to bed.  </li>
            <li> firstly, i got this at a really cheap price and they work really well .&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the smell, I think these facial cleansing pads smell pretty nice.</li>
            <li> They work very well and smell really clean.  </li>
            <li> and this is easy for a 12 year old boy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used the pads consistently for a year now</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and smooth again.</li>
            <li> Get some!Will be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> With a combo of Clean &amp; Clear</li>
            <li> I purchased these pads for my teen to keep in her gym locker for a super fast way to clean her face after gym class.</li>
            <li> I get the same refreshing clean feel with a basic wash cloth and soap.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it four stars is because you really have to stick to it.</li>
            <li> I bought some of these for my son to use on his shoulders for breakouts and they are working really well.  </li>
            <li> Real person here telling you to buy it.</li>
            <li> So much easier than an astringent and a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> We have very oily skin here, so using this really helps keep the gunk from building up throughout the day.</li>
            <li> but... I was really looking for a product that cleared up my breakouts plus got rid of blackheads.</li>
            <li> You can feel that it has a texture to it that really helps get into the pores.</li>
            <li> By time I get ready for bed, because I have really oily skin, my face needs washing and do not want to take another shower.</li>
            <li> Came fast , was sealed.</li>
            <li> These pads really worked well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything</li>
            <li> Once he started adding these pads to his cleansing routing, he&#x27;s stopped using the Retin A and his skin has really cleared up.  </li>
            <li> I buy these containers because it&#x27;s far more convenient to use these pre-moistened pads than to keep a bottle of astringent and a pack of facial pads.  </li>
            <li> I use these to clean up my face after being outside at work.  </li>
            <li> The price is high and the pads dry out very quick.</li>
            <li> I consistently have zits, and this helps to clear them up quicker/bring them to the surface quicker.</li>
            <li> first couple of times I used them on my face they stung a little bit, but your skin adjusts to it very quickly</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for a wipe with non of the highly toxic propyl glycol ingredient in it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I remember using something like this in high school and looking at the pad after and being grossed out by the dirt.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong alcoholic odor that burns your eyes and skin.</li>
            <li> He still has a few pimples to deal with, but many fewer than before</li>
            <li> After years and years of suffering with mild adult acne, this product has FINALLY ended the breakout cycle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: the new version (Multicolored label) of Clearasil DOES now include propyl glycol.</li>
            <li> Makes her skin feel brand new and silky on her pillow at night.  </li>
            <li> When I am done spraying I wipe off my face with a new pad.</li>
            <li> One small pad works fine!</li>
            <li> The only thing is that make sure you close the lid carefully.</li>
            <li> The little pads are well saturated and just a teensy bit abrasive to really get your skin clean.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t believe the would do the same wonders for me like they did to everybody else.</li>
            <li> They are about the same price but a much higher quality.</li>
            <li> Talk about pore cleaning action!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased similar products, including other Clearasil items, and they seem to have a more exfoliating aspect to them .</li>
            <li> I had mild acne, not bad, but I&#x27;m 100% sure that this would work for you if you have really bad acne.</li>
            <li> I originally got them to clean acne-prone areas, like my shoulders and chest, without creating the mess that comes along with wiping down your body with liquid soap and a wash cloth on nights/mornings when you&#x27;re not taking a shower.</li>
            <li> Got it to clear up cracked skin on feet.  </li>
            <li> And they literally started to clear my acne after one use.</li>
            <li> It has helped clear up my acne</li>
            <li> So far they are working.</li>
            <li> I thought my skin was just being sensitive.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying facial wipes to remove your make up .  </li>
            <li> REALLY MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and have never had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, they did not deep clean as I would have expected.</li>
            <li> Cuts down the grease and dirt quickly</li>
            <li> For about two weeks (which seems like a long time but really wasn&#x27;t) I washed my face three times a day and used a pad after each time, and my skin was literally clear.</li>
            <li> I got these mainly for quickie cleansing during the day but also to use after regular face washing.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall I have found is that these pads are highly scented.</li>
            <li> With these cleansing pads, I can get all the dirt and grime off my face from my long day without the hassle of a real face wash.</li>
            <li> so i normally squeeze the excess back into the jar.  </li>
            <li> I am older and didn&#x27;t need anything this drying and would recommend trying any other cleaning pad if you are an older woman but not this one.</li>
            <li> but I bought this one initially because of its low cost and high amount of pads for the price.  </li>
            <li> I thought now it would just dry out my face since I&#x27;m now 33 years old and not really getting consistent pimples anymore.  </li>
            <li> not as good as some of the more gentle cleaning pads can leave your face red after using it and the pads are very thin and a little hard to take out of the container - bought two due to the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible nearly any cleansing pad similiar to this would do the same job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these consistently for a few weeks now as an alternative to liquid toner/pore cleanser.</li>
            <li> I will admit that most nights, I am too lazy to get back in the shower or make a mess at the sink cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far I have notice that I have less breakouts, although they haven&#x27;t completely gone away.</li>
            <li> I hit up my entire body with them every few weeks and they clean extremely well.</li>
            <li> Very drying but probably is good for very bad acne on a teenager skin.</li>
            <li> But it is worth smelling a little weird right before bed if it cleans my face - and it does.</li>
            <li> One of the few products that I have tried that have actually helped the hormonal adult acne I get around my hairline.</li>
            <li> Had to return because the item description is not complete.</li>
            <li> The pads dont dry out my skin like others have stated.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Makes facial care for a guy a bit less taxing.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to use it at least 3 times a day and with a busy schedule like me</li>
            <li> Because this accidentally tipped over in my drawer, with the lid tightly closed, product STILL leaked ALL over.</li>
            <li> Its too rough on the face.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> So using a couple pads every other day to do the job is working out</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY go for other brand</li>
            <li> When you remove the pad from the jar they are very wet</li>
            <li> the Clearasil Daily Clear Acne Treatment Face Wash. I was using ProActiv, but it got too expensive.</li>
            <li> This actually made me break out really bad the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mess with other stuff, just get this.</li>
            <li> If i have to wear a mask to spray paint than i wipe down the inside part of the mask that touches around my mouth.</li>
            <li> It takes up a lot less room</li>
            <li> and it hurt a little bit when applied to the sides of his face.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t harsh or overpowering, I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this ever again.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will take a shower a few hours before bed.</li>
            <li> and then when I dried off, I used one of these pads on my face.</li>
            <li> Small round jar can be kept in an office drawer and used discreetly.</li>
            <li> I find using it everyday is excessive</li>
            <li> I use them to wipe my face throughout the day when my face feels oily or dirty and I am always surprised at what comes off on the pads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But then, a couple of nights I got lazy and didn&#x27;t want to go to the bathroom and wash my face</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by another mother whose pre-teenaged son was dealing with the usual pimples on his face.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to.</li>
            <li> The fix, these nifty little pads pull the dirt, grime, grease and gunk out of your pores without having to re-take an unnecessary additional shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the point is I totally recommend them for acne suffers like myself.</li>
            <li> One time I used it and my skin got so dried and flaky, like really really bad dry</li>
            <li> She is a teen and they don&#x27;t want bad skin</li>
            <li> I am not sure what it is, it just smells weird.</li>
            <li> Poor product, Poor packing.</li>
            <li> It made me break out worse than I already was..</li>
            <li> I hate how it leaves your skin feeling BEYOND DRY.</li>
            <li> I thought wrong.</li>
            <li> They have an awful smell and they actually burn my skin once I applyied.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at all the dirt and grease</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!!</li>
            <li> Virtually impossible!</li>
            <li> It is terrible on your skin, or atleast it was on mine.</li>
            <li> Rids my face of evil oil!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got it to clear up cracked skin on feet.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my son, and he loves it. Why? Because it&#x27;s easy and it works! What more could a guy (or mom) ask for....?</li>
            <li> I have suffered with somewhat severe acne for 2 years now. And I have never found anything to control it, without drying out my skin in the process. So when I stumbled upon these I thought why not, everybody in the reviews was saying how amazing it was. At first I didn&#x27;t believe the would do the same wonders for me like they did to everybody else. Boy was I wrong!! After 1 day my acne scars that I have had for months instantly started fading away. By 2 days they were almost gone. This is a miracle it has help my breakouts tremendously. I no longer get as many as I did, and if I do they are gone in a day instead of a week. The reason I gave it four stars is because you really have to stick to it. The instructions say to use it at least 3 times a day and with a busy schedule like me it&#x27;s hard to. With me I&#x27;m all over the place. One day I&#x27;m using them twice a day, the next only one, then three, then back to one, then two, you get my point. But the point is I totally recommend them for acne suffers like myself.</li>
            <li> I bought some of these for my son to use on his shoulders for breakouts and they are working really well.  They don&#x27;t irritate his skin and pimples are disappearing.  As for the smell, I think these facial cleansing pads smell pretty nice.</li>
            <li> These pads are a quick, effective way to manage breakouts... Makes facial care for a guy a bit less taxing.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter as part of her twice daily acne regime. So far they are working. With a combo of Clean &amp; Clear 3-in-1 foaming face wash and these her acne is 50% cleared in only a week. We are very happy and she is ecstatic that it&#x27;s been so easy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! For about two weeks (which seems like a long time but really wasn&#x27;t) I washed my face three times a day and used a pad after each time, and my skin was literally clear. I had mild acne, not bad, but I&#x27;m 100% sure that this would work for you if you have really bad acne. Don&#x27;t mess with other stuff, just get this. Real person here telling you to buy it.</li>
            <li> not as good as some of the more gentle cleaning pads can leave your face red after using it and the pads are very thin and a little hard to take out of the container - bought two due to the price but i doubt i will but it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18, and struggle with huge clogged pores, and I really thought this would help. I thought wrong. This actually made me break out really bad the first time I used it. I thought my skin was just being sensitive. I didn&#x27;t break out again, HOWEVER, I hate how it leaves your skin feeling BEYOND DRY. Also, considering keeping this in a drawer or taking it for travel? THINK AGAIN. Because this accidentally tipped over in my drawer, with the lid tightly closed, product STILL leaked ALL over. Poor product, Poor packing. Just go find something else please.</li>
            <li> I will admit that most nights, I am too lazy to get back in the shower or make a mess at the sink cleaning my face. Once in the morning should be enough! With these cleansing pads, I can get all the dirt and grime off my face from my long day without the hassle of a real face wash. So far I have notice that I have less breakouts, although they haven&#x27;t completely gone away. I am satisfied with the way it cleans my face. It never burns or stings my face when I use it. The only thing I dislike is the fragrance. I am not sure what it is, it just smells weird. It isn&#x27;t harsh or overpowering, I just don&#x27;t like it. But it is worth smelling a little weird right before bed if it cleans my face - and it does.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, since he ran out of Stridex, but it felt scratchy on his skin and it hurt a little bit when applied to the sides of his face. We are now switching back to Stridex.</li>
            <li> These pads are great. I use them to wipe my face throughout the day when my face feels oily or dirty and I am always surprised at what comes off on the pads. The price is good compared to other stores and it works well. It does have a strong scent when first applied but it doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin. I&#x27;d recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I work in a kitchen and my skin stays greasy.  Obviously this causes acne.  These pads help control that problem.</li>
            <li> I purchased these pads for my teen to keep in her gym locker for a super fast way to clean her face after gym class. She loves the ease of use, and I do think that they have kept breakouts to a minimum.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong alcoholic odor that burns your eyes and skin. It is terrible on your skin, or atleast it was on mine. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this ever again. It made me break out worse than I already was..</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for a wipe with non of the highly toxic propyl glycol ingredient in it. Virtually impossible! Very happy to see that an old company like Clearasil doesnt include it. I like the convenience of these (basically alcohol) wipes. The little pads are well saturated and just a teensy bit abrasive to really get your skin clean. Very happy with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: the new version (Multicolored label) of Clearasil DOES now include propyl glycol. UG! Why?!</li>
            <li> These guys are great for keeping your skin clean. I hit up my entire body with them every few weeks and they clean extremely well.</li>
            <li> ...at removing that last bit of makeup after cleansing. On older skin, be sure to moisturize after you use these. I&#x27;ve had no problem with these. One small pad works fine!</li>
            <li> This is the best product for acne skin. Both the price and the quality are so good. It helps my daughter to be free of acne...If it runs out, we&#x27;ll buy again for just in case.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my teen&#x27;s skin almost immediately. Easy to use and transport. So much easier than an astringent and a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> We have very oily skin here, so using this really helps keep the gunk from building up throughout the day. We use it along with Clearasil Daily Face Wash and we haven&#x27;t had any breakouts.</li>
            <li> After years and years of suffering with mild adult acne, this product has FINALLY ended the breakout cycle.  I have used the pads consistently for a year now and I can honestly say that it&#x27;s changed my life.  I use the pads once in the morning and once at night.  The pads dont dry out my skin like others have stated. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product just does not seem to have value to me. I get the same refreshing clean feel with a basic wash cloth and soap. The price is high and the pads dry out very quick. As an alternative if you want a pad, I would recommend Trader Joes tea tree oil pads. They are about the same price but a much higher quality.</li>
            <li> i got these cause they had plus ance treatment in the pads. overall great product i would recomend this to anyone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ok cleasing pad but it&#x27;s really dry my skin out. One time I used it and my skin got so dried and flaky, like really really bad dry I got angular cheilitis. I gave it 3 stars because it did clean my skin when i first use and I can see a bit improvement and it has nice smell.</li>
            <li> While using these pads I never had one breakout but... I was really looking for a product that cleared up my breakouts plus got rid of blackheads. While it kept away pimples, it didn&#x27;t do as great of a \\&quot;pore cleansing\\&quot; job as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> First of all, the fact that these are wipes alone make them very handy. I originally got them to clean acne-prone areas, like my shoulders and chest, without creating the mess that comes along with wiping down your body with liquid soap and a wash cloth on nights/mornings when you&#x27;re not taking a shower. And that was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, a couple of nights I got lazy and didn&#x27;t want to go to the bathroom and wash my face blah blah blah. And so I used these... And they literally started to clear my acne after one use. Since that night, I have been using them daily and the difference is remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times I used them on my face they stung a little bit, but your skin adjusts to it very quickly and, hey, it cleared my skin so I&#x27;m not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, JUST GET THESE. They are so handy and easy to use and MESS FREE, and they really work! They also have the best price for the amount compared to everything else that comes up when you search &amp;#34;acne wipes&amp;#34; on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for more than 100  days at this point, and i do not see, nor feel any discernible lessening of the acne. I think it makes for a nice, mild exfoliator.</li>
            <li> These are an easy way to freshen up during the work day, and help prevent break outs.  Small round jar can be kept in an office drawer and used discreetly.</li>
            <li> firstly, i got this at a really cheap price and they work really well .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has a very refreshing smell and keeps me awake after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my skin feels really clean and i can see all the oil and dirt on the pads after wiping .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and 90 counts means i dun have to worry about it running out anytime soon .</li>
            <li> I used this as an after shave for over a year now and it prevents any irritation. Highly recommend. I sometimes also use it for clearing my pores around the nose.</li>
            <li> I buy these containers because it&#x27;s far more convenient to use these pre-moistened pads than to keep a bottle of astringent and a pack of facial pads.  It takes up a lot less room too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about these pads is that they&#x27;re rough.  The normal cotton pads don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re doing a good job of exfoliating, but these scrubtastic little pads leave you feeling nice and clean.  They&#x27;re extremely convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> i have battled perimenopausal breakouts for 3 years now - this product clears them up and prevents them from occurring when i use it daily.</li>
            <li> Not the best product but not the worst. Not the best for oily skin though, made my face feel greasy after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these consistently for a few weeks now as an alternative to liquid toner/pore cleanser. I like this a lot better. You can feel that it has a texture to it that really helps get into the pores.</li>
            <li> my pimples are almost gone....i use it twice a day...wonderful product....recomend for people with oily skin and pimples...&lt;br /&gt;thank you...</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will take a shower a few hours before bed. By time I get ready for bed, because I have really oily skin, my face needs washing and do not want to take another shower. The fix, these nifty little pads pull the dirt, grime, grease and gunk out of your pores without having to re-take an unnecessary additional shower.&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact, I once challenged the product by bathing and then when I dried off, I used one of these pads on my face. I was shocked at all the dirt and grease it got off even after washing with soap and water.</li>
            <li> it helped me a lot in fighting the acne. it also worked much better with its cream.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a mild case of acne.  Didn&#x27;t see any improvements after several days use.  Might be a good product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> These pads clean great and are very convenient. If you don&#x27;t wash your face before you use one, you will see the dirt left on the pad.  Good for use at night when I am too sleepy to wash my face. They have a nice, clean light fragrance.  When you remove the pad from the jar they are very wet so i normally squeeze the excess back into the jar.  Leaves face feeling and looking clean, free of dirt and oil.  Clearasil brand gives you a good amount of pads for your money.</li>
            <li> What u would expect.  Came fast , was sealed.</li>
            <li> These pads really worked well. Much cheaper than buying facial wipes to remove your make up .  Leaves your skin clean and radiant</li>
            <li> For anyone who has acme, this product will greatly help clear your face within the first week. This is one of the only over the counter products that actually gives me a &#x27;burning&#x27; feeling upon application.</li>
            <li> I remember using something like this in high school and looking at the pad after and being grossed out by the dirt.  I thought now it would just dry out my face since I&#x27;m now 33 years old and not really getting consistent pimples anymore.  But I thought why not try it since I feel like my face could be cleaned better than a wash I use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face, chin/neck area and shoulders every couple days.  Then I put oil of olay lotion on my face and chin/neck area right after and go to bed.  My face has NEVER felt so smooth.  I find using it everyday is excessive and I don&#x27;t want to dry out my skin.  So using a couple pads every other day to do the job is working out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order a lot of things from Amazon and have never given such a good review.  It&#x27;s possible nearly any cleansing pad similiar to this would do the same job but I bought this one initially because of its low cost and high amount of pads for the price.  I&#x27;m on the subscribe and save program for it and don&#x27;t plan on stopping anytime soon.  A great purchase.</li>
            <li> This may work, but the item doesn&#x27;t show that it contains aloe and we have an aloe allergy.  Had to return because the item description is not complete.</li>
            <li> I bought these as an \\&quot;add on item\\&quot; and I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;d been having some breakout problems and these pads have made a huge difference. My skin is clear and smooth again. I also use the Clearasil Daily Clear Acne Treatment Face Wash. I was using ProActiv, but it got too expensive. Clearasil is definitely a better, and cheaper, choice. Works great and is cheaper. Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> Talk about pore cleaning action! My skin feels smooth and thoroughly treated as soon as I apply the pads. Try them, they work!</li>
            <li> They have an awful smell and they actually burn my skin once I applyied. Its too rough on the face. DO NOT BUY go for other brand</li>
            <li> I use these to clean up my face after being outside at work.  Cuts down the grease and dirt quickly</li>
            <li> REALLY MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MY PORES WILL BUY AGAIN THE PRICE IS GREAT ALSO FAST SHIPPING TRY IT YOUR LOVE IT</li>
            <li> One of the few products that I have tried that have actually helped the hormonal adult acne I get around my hairline. I would recommend this product. The only downfall I have found is that these pads are highly scented.</li>
            <li> I think it delivers the effect it is supposed to deliver. The only thing is that make sure you close the lid carefully. Otherwise, liquid would come out!</li>
            <li> Very drying but probably is good for very bad acne on a teenager skin. I am older and didn&#x27;t need anything this drying and would recommend trying any other cleaning pad if you are an older woman but not this one.</li>
            <li> I love buying cleansing pads. They are perfect for traveling or just to give you an extra cleaning. This is by far my favorite brand. They have a nice smell too. They dont just smell like alcohol or chemical. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything but it didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any changes after two weeks of usage and have no plans to reorder this product. Nuts</li>
            <li> these work well without drying out the skin.  I&#x27;ve used them for 2 days in a row at night, and already see and feel the difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> use it every day&lt;br /&gt;reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;totally recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;help my acne problem.&lt;br /&gt;will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;use it every day&lt;br /&gt;reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;totally recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;help my acne problem.&lt;br /&gt;will purchase again.</li>
            <li> bought this for a friends daughter and she loves it. Makes her skin feel brand new and silky on her pillow at night.  She is a teen and they don&#x27;t want bad skin so she uses it every night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 and have been using these since I was a teenager. They clean my face and get rid of surprise pimples quickly. Best of all, they don&#x27;t have a very strong scent which may bother loved ones or small children if they get close after using a pad. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got these mainly for quickie cleansing during the day but also to use after regular face washing.  They work very well and smell really clean.  Very good texture on the pads and feel effective at getting out dirt.  I got these with the Subscribe and Save option through Amazon and it beats Walmart&#x27;s price and is delivered to your door with FREE shipping!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by another mother whose pre-teenaged son was dealing with the usual pimples on his face.  I had been to the dermatologist and she prescribed a Retin A treatment, which would have made my sons skin extra photo-sensitive.  Once he started adding these pads to his cleansing routing, he&#x27;s stopped using the Retin A and his skin has really cleared up.  He still has a few pimples to deal with, but many fewer than before and this is easy for a 12 year old boy to use.</li>
            <li> The pads were effective at removing making, dirt, and general build-up. If you are just buying them to remove and cleanse on a basic level, I recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;However, they did not deep clean as I would have expected. I&#x27;ve purchased similar products, including other Clearasil items, and they seem to have a more exfoliating aspect to them .</li>
            <li> This definitely helps with breakouts. I consistently have zits, and this helps to clear them up quicker/bring them to the surface quicker.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and love it! It has helped clear up my acne and I love that it comes with pads and is so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and have never had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li> Does what it says keeps my pores nice and clean works good Get some!Will be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> After I use the Clearasil Wash/Mask, I automatically swipe my face with one of these refreshing wipes!!!  Perfect for after Strength Yoga Workouts!  Rids my face of evil oil!  Amazon saves the day with this value!  I then follow with the Clearasil 4 hour gel that seal and heals a breakout!  Amazon has amazing prices on the whole line!</li>
            <li> I like to use this product whenever I&#x27;m painting. If i have to wear a mask to spray paint than i wipe down the inside part of the mask that touches around my mouth. When I am done spraying I wipe off my face with a new pad. It seems to help. Or its nice to use in the middle of the day to wipe off excess dirt and oil.</li>
