            <li>Good product for the price.</li>

            <li>It has a good motor speed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good value for money.</li>
            <li>With all the accessories and the bonus ear/nose contraption, it&#x27;s also a darn good value.</li>
            <li>Otherwise its really good for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s battery battery operated so it&#x27;s good when the power goes out in the house.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I thought it was a good idea to take the guards off as with them</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>I had a rechargeable shaver that provided a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but has good battery life&lt;br /&gt;-Wish</li>
            <li>and  its a good gift to my dad for his fathers day...</li>
            <li>Good product, but no have battery.</li>
            <li>quality is really good in this price</li>
            <li>Batteries were checked and found to be good.</li>
            <li>Does not seem like it makes good contact and acts like the battery</li>
            <li>I laughed when I re-read the \\&quot;no snag</li>
            <li>For the price, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is good that it is run by battery (not included)</li>
            <li>its good for if your grooming</li>
            <li>good for pubes.</li>
            <li>but hey, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>This is a good set.</li>
            <li>and it is fair quality for what you pay for, however,</li>
            <li>It is always tricky buying an item like this online, because you can&#x27;t get your hands on it and give it a good look.</li>
            <li>Good price for a lot of grooming tools.</li>
            <li>Good product and price</li>
            <li>Works good on my beard.</li>
            <li>Good luck with the storage tray.</li>
            <li>I got this one because it had good reviews, however the shave is too close (for those who like a bit of stubble) and it causes all sorts of breakouts on my face because my skin is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband had one of these for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;*Base is good for storing&lt;br /&gt;*cordless</li>

            <li>but good for home use</li>
            <li>Good quality trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Wahl makes some good products, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is good for couple of uses after that</li>
            <li>He is in customer service and well, what can I say I made a good investment.</li>
            <li>but the trim is good.  </li>
            <li>Good blades and the batteries don&#x27;t take away from the power of it.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money.</li>
            <li>its just the stand doesnt hold the nose trimmer good for your trimming</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself works fairly well.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>then that it&#x27;s good life is good too</li>
            <li>Been using this once or twice a week for a couple of months now no issues, can&#x27;t argue with the price, battery life is good, if it breaks I will just order another one.</li>
            <li>It has done a wonderful job keeping him hairless and smooth.</li>
            <li>This kit helps to support your beard and that shines in good condition</li>
            <li>Seems to be of good quality and design, but I would not recommend to friends.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer takes two AA batteries and would be good for travel.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually fairly shaggy when I trim it, about once a month.    </li>
            <li>The mustache trimmer that comes along with it for free is excellent!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;High-carbon self-sharpening steel blades are precision-ground for superior results&lt;</li>
            <li>Surprisingly good product.</li>
            <li>definitely a good find...</li>
            <li>Get the good one this is not it....</li>
            <li>This is a good piece for the price.</li>
            <li>works good, wish it was rechargeable</li>
            <li>This is a good product ,i could have picked this up at walmart,but it was easier to order and have it sent to me.</li>
            <li>This has to be one of the best cheap trimmers on the market.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good but functions are not.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price,</li>

            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>It was a fair price paid for this type of product.</li>
            <li>The Silver colored models are good quality - this one didn&#x27;t work out of the box.</li>
            <li>So it is good for close cuts, but if you have a 4 day growth, it doesn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li>Has good power for being battery operated.</li>
            <li>Wahl used to be so good.</li>

            <li>Thanks Amazon, you have the best prices!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice set</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m ok with it good function....</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice set.</li>
            <li>Nice bonus getting the ear and nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>Really trims my husband&#x27;s gotee great!</li>
            <li>I liked and recommend.</li>
            <li>I was not looking for something that came with its own built in rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li>a nice bonus is the ear and nose trimmer that comes with it.</li>
            <li>The bonus nose trimmer was nice too.  </li>
            <li>Nose-hair clipper was a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mainly I liked this model a lot.</li>
            <li>I own two Wahl clippers that plug into the wall.</li>
            <li>Bought for my grandson, as he uses his dads all the time, now he will have his own.</li>
            <li>When I do have a beard I don&#x27;t find it effective to just trim with.  </li>
            <li>It had a lot of nice accessories and he is using it</li>
            <li>I would say give it 10 minutes before it starts getting noticeably warm and the noise turns up.</li>
            <li>Love it lots of good tools for grooming</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for traveling but still i could have gotten better.</li>
            <li>nice product</li>
            <li>Nice touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>♦ Honestly, I cannot think of any flaws with this product.</li>
            <li>♦ Honestly, I cannot think of any flaws with this product.</li>
            <li>Nice item to have.</li>
            <li>This is a nice inexpensive trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This are a nice addition.</li>

            <li>and I owe it all to this handy dandy trimmer.</li>
            <li>Loving it.</li>
            <li>This allows me to get a nice trim on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>a while I tried to have a beard looking as nice as my Son&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I bought this one because I had a really nice Wahl beard trimmer</li>
            <li>The batteries don&#x27;t fit perfectly in place of the beard trimmer and that makes it feel cheap.</li>
            <li>Plus you can put your own batteries in it.  </li>
            <li>, that is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the product is good, and the guys love using it.  </li>
            <li>Good price but OK quality.</li>
            <li>nicely made as well.</li>
            <li>Also the nose/ear trimmer is nice accoutrement to pkg.</li>
            <li>this is a nice Amazon deal.</li>
            <li>I also liked the [[ASIN:B001GQ3GEY Wahl 9854-600 Lithium Ion</li>
            <li>The beard and mustache trimmer as well as the bonus ear, nose, and brow trimmer work very well and an excellent value for the price I paid at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I use it a lot without a guard and the closeness of the cut is nice for roughing in the shape of my beard.</li>
            <li>Sure was a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li>Comes in handy if I don&#x27;t have time to visit the barber.</li>
            <li>These always come in handy.</li>
            <li>Honestly what&#x27;s that matter?</li>
            <li>This nice set has plenty of accessories and helps him keep nice and trimmed.</li>
            <li>Works like the kind the pros use.</li>
            <li>Would have liked it rechargable.</li>
            <li>Realy nice device.good size,nice work.</li>
            <li>Wahl.the most good thing is that it is portable.</li>
            <li>Nice item comparing to its price ...</li>
            <li>The nose trimmer is a nice bonus</li>
            <li>and it keeps your face trimmed and tidy</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any significant pulling on my hair while using this trimmer as some reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li>Best is the nose trimmer, the older</li>
            <li>I just clean it with the brush after every use and it works great.</li>
            <li>excellent product, highly recommend</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and it appears to be a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>The shaver is underpowered, even with the best batteries, and the attachments don&#x27;t want to fit straight until you give it a good fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its just cheap plastic, but it holds up remarkably well.</li>
            <li>That being said, this is a great product for a well-groomed man whether you have a full beard, goatee, or just want that 5 day growth look.</li>
            <li>You can use it in the shower and clean it under water!!</li>
            <li>for 10$ great deal for a wahl, cuts great, all parts came, nose clipper works great,trimmer sharp and works great.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and a great price.  </li>
            <li>Makes keeping it looking good easy</li>
            <li>Quality of accessories is not that great and battery runs out of juice quickly.  </li>
            <li>lol he loved it so much he gave it unopened to his dad</li>
            <li>Excellent works very well and has many accessories.</li>
            <li>this was good and strong or a battery operated machine, but you cannot retract and extend the metal blade.  </li>
            <li>They are all very easy to use and use AA batteries.</li>
            <li>It is a very strong cutter.</li>
            <li>Amazon hit the estimated delivery right on target and this set from Wahl is proving to be an excellent purchase at a bargain price with a nose trimmer included free of charge.  </li>
            <li>My lines on my beard are impeccable and I love how easy and efficient</li>
            <li>Nose trimmer is fine but does good work.</li>
            <li>Other than that great product for a great price!</li>
            <li>Comparing to its price I find it a very good trimmer, so economic in terms of using the battery..</li>
            <li>I love the quality everything about it nice but trust it when it says its for BEARD&#x27;s....</li>
            <li>but I love the size and how nice it trims.  </li>
            <li>perfect item to replace my old trimmers</li>
            <li>the trimmer works excellent, is only $10 dollars, has extras in it for free AND feels and looks great.  </li>
            <li>Buy a good pair of Italian scissors instead - I&#x27;ve tried many things and this product at Amazon is the best: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XBO4OW2?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage</li>
            <li>I honestly thought it was going ti be better than the reviewss had said it was going to be , but my fiance hates it.</li>
            <li>though it&#x27;s great and worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered more sets now as gifts, because it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li>Everyone knows a beautiful woman who would be a bit more beautiful if she pruned her nose garden back a bit.</li>
            <li>nice, I liked the product equal to the publication , excellent price</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is the best unit for professional beard guys</li>
            <li>Not a bad trimmer for the price works great would be better if it had a built in battery</li>
            <li>Good for its price... dont like that its battery set but its works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Awesome very sharp blade ...works great</li>
            <li>This new trimmer looks great and of course feels good to handle.</li>
            <li>It does give him a great trim and ears, nose trimmed right up.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works great and is sold at the right price.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer set I&#x27;m able to stay clean now without spending 60.00 a month on a good cut.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and and very light weight.</li>
            <li>and I needed something more precise to keep it looking good.  </li>
            <li>Well that machine is best to use i have use  in my life wish i could get  another one  for free from amazon thanks</li>
            <li>Good way to keep that 5-o-clock shadow and still look clean.. nose trimmer works too</li>
            <li>Its still a very good trimmer at an excellent price, and will certainly serves your basic trimming needs.</li>
            <li>Normally this is a very good company, I got a dud.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it worked great.</li>
            <li>The bonus ear and nose trimmer work fine too !</li>
            <li>This is a very cheap razor.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap (so was the price)</li>
            <li>I need a reliable groomer and this is very cheap quality...</li>
            <li>very cheaply made .</li>
            <li>I can tell it&#x27;s more cheaply made, but it still works great and sometimes better than my primary one.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>size is very comfortable to the hand and it does not pull the hair as I trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>inside feels very cheap.  </li>
            <li>Very light weight.  </li>
            <li>Nice and light weight ... easy to use and clean ... great battery life ...</li>
            <li>Like others have stated, this product is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>it is pretty good and with one blade guide drops into my shaving kit nicely.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and all the additional attachments make it a handy all in one place.</li>
            <li>Has a good weight, comfortable to use and the batteries are AA and easy to replace anywhere I am.  </li>
            <li>Good, convenient, such a perfect product can be 100 - 5 to be the normal price, I recommend that you buy, you will be pleased, the quality is also good to have</li>
            <li>everything ok bot the metal is getting Rusty</li>
            <li>you might want to try something with more adjustments</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my husband and he told me recently that it does a great job trimming!  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get anything better at this price.&lt;br /&gt;Trims</li>
            <li>More than satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Vendor was great with fair postage and a very low price.</li>
            <li>The Beard trimmer works ok.</li>
            <li>hindsight, I would&#x27;ve been much better off if I&#x27;d paid thousands of dollars to NOT use this Wahl product.</li>
            <li>love it ..will do business with u again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for the better part of 15 years</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t need to be anything more than that</li>
            <li>Solid piece of face grooming equipment; Wahl is one of the best products for the money.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying it and it was sent speedy</li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>So didn&#x27;t likes it,caz i have seen better.</li>
            <li>Love this clipper set, non-charger battery operated set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;t has more attachments than most trimmers.</li>
            <li>and I like it more even though it is battery opperated.</li>
            <li>Overall great trimmer for a lumberjake!</li>
            <li>how many times I changed the batteries.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for better.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used Wahl before but this, well, I&#x27;m sure you get the point.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s CHEAP!</li>
            <li>While the case is plastic and feels cheap the trimmer is effective.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest to write a better product description.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d make a better set that was meant for &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Is okay.</li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>In my experience, my beard was pulled many times by the trim guard.  </li>
            <li>This razor operates OK</li>
            <li>However, if you can afford something better, you should probably buy something better.  </li>
            <li>and I frankly don&#x27;t know how they can sell it so cheap!  </li>
            <li>The best part is that the comb lengths match the CONAIR, so you can alternate between them to do</li>
            <li>I have not tried an alkaline battery in it, but I could not imagine the trimmer performing any better with one.  </li>
            <li>Saved me a ton of money visiting the barber shop :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Im glad I chose this company.</li>
            <li>love all the tools and gadgetsa t</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This is a real good kit for the person who&#x27;s just starting to learn to trim a beard, everything is included!</li>
            <li>Love&#x27;s all the attachments.</li>
            <li>im glad it came through</li>
            <li>A heads up though, make sure water does not come in contact with the lower battery side of both of the trimmers.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for for this price?</li>
            <li>It works better than I antisipated.</li>
            <li>Now it runs BETTER than when it was</li>
            <li>There are so many pieces to it.</li>
            <li>The nose trimmer is okay</li>
            <li>therell be some antennae ticking out here and there, or u can be more deliberate and take a bit longer with the trimmer to get a more uniform, cleaner cut.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>had i been to the barber shop :)</li>
            <li>but it was better if it could work with 110V too</li>
            <li>I imagine you would not have to change them more than once</li>
            <li>every couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the cheapest trimmer I could find since I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to keep my beard.  </li>
            <li>Probably just a corrosion problem but can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li>(Aren&#x27;t we glad?)  </li>
            <li>These are great and very well made.</li>
            <li>Works perfect and for a very low price!.</li>
            <li>My husband bought this and he couldn&#x27;t be more happier with this set.</li>
            <li>, i love this kit</li>
            <li>Much better than others I&#x27;ve had use it every day will recommend all my friends</li>
            <li>I thought Wahl was a better company</li>
            <li>I would spend more money on a better set.</li>
            <li>I should have known to spend more than 12$ on a face trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is ok...</li>
            <li>for ten bucks and with all the things you get, BEST BUY !!!!!!</li>
            <li>Upon trying to trim my beard, it was more like an epilator than a trimmer.</li>
            <li>The top section comes off for cleaning, but when you put it back together, unless everything is aligned perfectly, you will find the mechanism jams and will not spin up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent product and the only way to make it better is to get it for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prof</li>
            <li>A lot more attachments than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>He was just okay with it.)</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I would give this a lower rating, but for $10.49 I figure none of us should expect much more.  </li>
            <li>you get the more you need it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li>Hope you will continue this relationship and both sides are satisfied.</li>
            <li>The nose hair trimmer was the better of the two devices.</li>
            <li>I ended up not using it any more when I started to get a bit of redness and swelling around the tip of my nose.</li>
            <li>The cordless feature is great and fast when your shaving.</li>
            <li>If this won&#x27;t bother you, I guess it&#x27;s okay to purchase.</li>
            <li>oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger trimmer has more power than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;The nose and ear hair trimmer does a very good job!</li>
            <li>It seems that the Norelco attachment used more energy so having a separate trimmer makes sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li>Wahl is a fantastic brand!</li>
            <li>Get it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did because it works like a charm and</li>
            <li>Came with a lot more accessories than I realized.</li>
            <li>My husband love this kit.  </li>
            <li>It works okay for battery operated.</li>
            <li>Glad he loves it</li>
            <li>the 6th one he has had and the only one he has said was the best president he got for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Ear and nose trimmer could be better, but it was the the trimmer that I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I think that the hair trimmer could be more efficient when trimming the hair in the nose</li>
            <li>It was an okay gift to give someone.</li>
            <li>It is better then the rest on the market.</li>
            <li>Could Be better.  </li>
            <li>I was quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>With this product I felt I got more than I paid for it.</li>
            <li>After owning Wahl beard trimmers for more than 20 years, I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of some of the reviews here.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the Wahl trimmer that lasted me more than 15 years.    .  .    </li>
            <li>But neither of them will work any more.    </li>
            <li>I use the moustache/ear trimmer more than the beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It runs OK until I hold it up to my face, then it goes off.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there are many people who would take the time to troubleshoot the issue, and just toss the thing.</li>
            <li>What more can.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer is ok.  </li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t want to spend more money on return shipping.</li>
            <li>OK it has two AA DURACELLs in it.</li>
            <li>I turned if off, cleaned up out, put some more oil in it</li>
            <li>It is an ok trimmer.</li>
            <li>It would&#x27;ve been great to get a case instead of a stand, but I cannot really complain about anything about this product.</li>
            <li>Cant ask for any more for the price</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll have to replace more often.</li>
            <li>It does an ok job for the price.</li>
            <li>I really love this for shaving.</li>
            <li>It works, and I take it on trips where size matter, but for home my Whal hair clippers on the 1.25 inch setting do a waaaay better job.</li>
            <li>ordered for gifting , i am pleased</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>It just has one job of trimming my mustache and with better attachments for it than the Norelco it does a better job.</li>
            <li>TOO FRY&#x27;S AND BOUGHT BETTER QUALITY TRIMMER</li>
            <li>THINK HE WILL LOVE IT</li>
            <li>This is definitely better than the &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; reviews, if you ask me.</li>
            <li>It trims well, better without using the guides.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t try the nose hair trimmer mostly because I don&#x27;t have nose hair that needs to be trimmer but also</li>
            <li>So, an in between fitting would make all the difference on that.</li>
            <li>In fact, I will be ordering two more for relatives.</li>
            <li>I love the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I purchased another brand and it was so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better than the hair clippers I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And once I do, I&#x27;ll be able to do it indefinitely at no additional expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the precision and ease with which these wall product trim my beard mustache, and nose hair.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>favorite feature of the Wahl 5537-1801 is the replaceable AA batteries.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done much better than trimmers 4x the price.</li>
            <li>Also love not having to plug it in.</li>
            <li>I beleive I will be satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this shave kit.  </li>
            <li>sure about durability because of the plastic accessories</li>
            <li>I thought it might work better than my electric, since I thought it would be quieter than the electric.</li>
            <li>It worked quite okay.</li>
            <li>My husband has ordered more size guards just this week.  </li>
            <li>I bought this kit recently and it works excellent for me.</li>
            <li>gladly buy another if it breaks for any reason.</li>
            <li>and they work much better.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to shave often and felt that it needed more power than the battery provided.</li>
            <li>Has been working ok since I bought it.</li>
            <li>Love that this had a lot of attachments with it.</li>
            <li>no problems ok ok ok ok ok</li>
            <li>ok  ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Most things I Review</li>
            <li>Works OK with plenty of attachments.  </li>
            <li>It even was able to cut my sideburns that the beard trimmer couldn&#x27;t.    </li>
            <li>I have to keep holding the top part while I am every time I USED</li>
            <li>I would spend more and get a better product.</li>
            <li>I have better things to do than run out to return defective products and</li>
            <li>the razors are sleek and agile.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Wahl products for 7 years or so, and I usually love what I purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably better to use the oil that Wahl packs in the package.</li>
            <li>We are pleased with the product and the quality of trimming it provides.</li>
            <li>a gift for my brother love your gift</li>
            <li>I have to see how it goes, and give it some time before I can say for sure if we like it, more.</li>
            <li>Great product for reasonable price</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>I love the fact that when they batteries die I can replace them instead of throwing away the trimmer when it can&#x27;t be recharged anymore.</li>
            <li>and it seems okay.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I will defiantly recommend to buy this product.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints, works perfect for trimming my facial hair.</li>
            <li>I also am able to shape up my hairline whenever i need it.</li>
            <li>In my experience, a used toothbrush does the job better than the dinky brush that comes in the package.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>A worthwhile product that can save you money.</li>
            <li>Again, cheap but effective.</li>
            <li>And on top of that I didn&#x27;t even realize it wasn&#x27;t rechargeable.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something a bit more durable.</li>
            <li>It says here that twelve more words are required.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to use it since they did not work, even though I chance the batteries twice</li>
            <li>Still even better, no cord to deal with.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>but my roommate uses it more than me .</li>
            <li>Anyways, it&#x27;s ok for trimming will upgrade to something more substantial in time.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have 4 aa batteries.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the price which was even better.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s okay, I suppose.  </li>
            <li>Works perfect, except for the occasional tug.</li>
            <li>Would love a rechargeable feature but for the price I would make an exception.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend, spend $5 more and purchase better.</li>
            <li>this shaver helps you to look a litter better, its no what i spect, but ...</li>
            <li>Its cheap!</li>
            <li>It works very well and was a great bargain.</li>
            <li>Good for the right person.</li>
            <li>Good product - no problems and priced right.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could ever get it totally clean, even taking the top part off and washing it under warm running water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would&#x27;ve been nice to have a web link or something on directions for using the attachments and whatnot, how to clean, etc</li>
            <li>Clean shave and handles nice</li>
            <li>The bonus ear/nose unit works great on those hard-to-get-at places that plague older men.</li>
            <li>This was a great price but is very loud!  </li>
            <li>I am beyond happy with this product, i highly recommend this to anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to use it at all, but I have ended up using it even more than the full beard trimmer!  </li>
            <li>Between trips to the barber shop, I find this kit a good way to trim my \\&quot;soup strainer\\&quot; mustache, clean up my beard a bit, clean up nose and ear hairs, and trim my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend for those who want handy, light weight trimmer</li>
            <li>very light weight(plastic)  with a strong motor.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of trimming.</li>
            <li>Pretty good pretty good.</li>
            <li>Just put a pair of good battery&#x27;s and ready to go!.</li>
            <li>First off the shavers works good</li>
            <li>Pretty good condition.</li>
            <li>No damm good at all do not buy go to Walmart first</li>
            <li>This is a pretty darn good set for the price.</li>
            <li>on the first use of this trimmer it was a good result.</li>
            <li>The battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li>For the price it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>The teeth seem to be too close together to get a good clip the first time; the battery lid keeps coming off the ear/nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This works good and is exactly has described.</li>
            <li>Not a knock off, item in original pkg, in tact and with all parts!</li>
            <li>This product is really nice, we especially liked the round nose hair cutter</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, have used more than a year, still going strong.</li>
            <li>I love trimmers with AA batteries - they are easy to replace and you never have to worry about the battery losing charge over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually use it as kind of a backup to a rechargeable panasonic I have, but this once works great.</li>
            <li>Another way I would increase the rating would be to give more detailed information or include more pics for the product.</li>
            <li>Works very well,  impressed with the whole kit.</li>
            <li>pulls hairs more than i&#x27;m comfortable with, wahl model # 9966 has worked much better for me</li>
            <li>Happy with it, although the nasal one is a bit dodgy - lots of handy diverse bits so i can do facial and head</li>
            <li>item well described and performs as expected; no frills,great price, great kit; good value, meeting my expectations with no hassle</li>
            <li>Much more than I expected paying what I payed... have been using the kit over a year and everything works great!!!</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a better, more precise tool for me.</li>
            <li>Nice product, great size, hopefully works for a long time :)</li>
            <li>The unit is very light and feels cheaply built</li>
            <li>I have had much better at 5-6 times the price&#x27; for what I paid, this works just fine - no complaints</li>
            <li>really love how easy the interchangable clips are too, easy and snap on.</li>
            <li>big beard trimmer works very good.</li>
            <li>Very good set of trimmers and tools for a very low price.</li>
            <li>but this one has been great so far.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have use for many of the accessories and the cheap stand does not have room for all the included attachments.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer, no problems so far.</li>
            <li>This product is both cheap, effective and overall a great value.</li>
            <li>Needed a replacement for my Husbands shaver and he&#x27;s happy so far with this one.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>My Fiance is in love with this tool, trims everything smoothly.</li>
            <li>but if it had some sort of recharging capability and cut closer to the skin to be more smooth I would give it 5 star.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had it about a month so far, trimming 1-2x a week, and I can tell you that I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>in all - it&#x27;s OK for the money but is a cheap machine.</li>
            <li>We are happy so far.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good but has a cheap quality and feel to it.</li>
            <li>This product fit the bill, and I have been satisfied with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it works great, great for travel and economic, is only required to buy rechargeable batteries with charger</li>
            <li>and so far it works great.</li>
            <li>I bought this item for my husband and so far I must say it works great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe to the touch, light weight, and there&#x27;s no pesky cord to worry about</li>
            <li>I really like it good buy....</li>
            <li>Fair quality for the price, trimmed my bear really well and made a difference in my grooming rutines</li>
            <li>does the job the nose hair trimmer works well, reasonably priced good job wahl</li>
            <li>get yourself a Phillips Norelco if you really want a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>Right out the box to my face!!</li>
            <li>this kit is excelent is complete and too good, and the shipping was excelent all the description is right, very clear and the quality is perfect</li>
            <li>Works nice, price is right...</li>
            <li>IT IS SHARP AND FITS MY HAND PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li>Trust me, it&#x27;s worth it! :)</li>
            <li>This is a great deal at the price, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and it pinches your hairs a little on its lowest setting.</li>
            <li>This is the 2015 version of the first beard trimmer I ever bought more than 24 years ago!</li>
            <li>trimmer is the perfect size for trimming your beard, neck, bangs, sideburns and let&#x27;s not forget some man scaping on the chest, pits, or other hairy areas.</li>
            <li>starters, this thing rusts easily.</li>
            <li>and I would easily compare it to a plug in model.  </li>
            <li>Well nice , love the fact it is very well made.</li>
            <li>It runs on 2 easily replaceable AA batteries</li>
            <li>so it cuts sufficiently easily that I don&#x27;t overdo it</li>
            <li>Cleans and stores easy .</li>
            <li>Attachments bend easy.</li>
            <li>I tried replacing batteries, made sure they were clean, etc.</li>
            <li>Love all of the attachments it comes with it makes it easy to really make his style his own.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s cordless and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Compact easy to use and store.</li>
            <li>You ask for, something that does the job it was intended, it&#x27;s inexpensive  and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise mobile and easy to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 3 preset length guides are really easy to put on and take off, and the compact size and storage rack make it really easy to keep out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i like how easy it is to use them</li>
            <li>, but I did not see an easy way to replace the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On batteries so it is easy to travel with it.</li>
            <li>Easy attachment change</li>
            <li>Works well and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>Works great for trimming beard and mustache, and the nose/ear/eyebrow trimmer works much better than the last 3 I owned.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy for him to keep groomed.  </li>
            <li>its worth spending 10 dollars more for a better one.</li>
            <li>THIS IS EASY...</li>
            <li>Easy to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>very portable would be good in a pinch with no power available.</li>
            <li>Had it a year now, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>For my beard ,its not that strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d strongly recommend the product and the merchant.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent...........been using it for over 5 years now and still going strong.</li>
            <li>The motors in both units are still going strong.  </li>
            <li>The motor on the beard trimmer is just as strong as when it bought it.  </li>
            <li>works good mainly bought for the mini trimmer and the 35% off deal that day</li>
            <li>3+ years and still going strong.</li>
            <li>this came very cheap and it&#x27;s doing a fine job specially for the price i paid for</li>
            <li>It does a great job and as long as you use good batteries, the power will last a good while before needing the batteries replaced.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good high quality trimmer this is not it.</li>
            <li>Okay so this little thing is as cheap as it is awesome.  </li>
            <li>So far this is amazing for the value!</li>
            <li>I bought this beard trimmer because I had a regular size Wahl clippers that worked great for my head, but wasn&#x27;t impressed with how it handled trimming beards and figured I&#x27;d buy something made expressly for that purpose for a little more precision.  </li>
            <li>This made me disgruntled and more importantly I then had to go out and buy one at the store so that I would be clean for work.</li>
            <li>The items all work just fine.  </li>
            <li>a fine trimmer... have used the nose one yet.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, light weight and packable.</li>
            <li>Works fine and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li>work fine, no problems</li>
            <li>Shipping box was kinda beat up, but product was fine.</li>
            <li>He loves it and says that it is easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It worked just fine for the 2 weeks it lasted.</li>
            <li>Everything was fine except for the nose hair trimmer which just stopped working after a week or two.</li>
            <li>I knew the batteries were fine, so I opened up the trimmer and discovered that the switch was faulty.</li>
            <li>Everything is working fine now.</li>
            <li>it is close on the shave, I think does fine on beard length</li>
            <li>and it did fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>I have a beard and use this, works fine.</li>
            <li>and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Trimmer is slim and light for easy traveling.</li>
            <li>For what it costs it works fine.  </li>
            <li>For now, it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Would have been better off spending more money for a higher quality product.</li>
            <li>It does a perfectly fine job on my goatee.</li>
            <li>but it seems to hold up just fine.</li>

            <li>Finally got my bear lookin nice for cheap!!</li>
            <li>I knew from another reviewer that the &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; nose &amp; eyebrow trimmer doesn&#x27;t fit in the stand, but it&#x27;s flat-bottomed, and stands up just fine.</li>
            <li>perfect for timming my little 5# doggie</li>
            <li>It is rather cheaply made (as others have said), but it works great and does not pull my facial hair at all.</li>
            <li>its cheap, so might not be a good choice for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>i got it the afternoon and bought tow batteries at the shop came home and shaved with it , works great shave smooth enough and came with brush comb and oil with attachments and a bonus nose trimmer .</li>

            <li>I bought this as a cheap trimmer.  </li>
            <li>the trimmer is dirt cheap, so i didnt have the highest of expectations.</li>
            <li>I can get the light trim or close shave</li>
            <li>this is a great tool for shaving, but does not cut short beard, anyways it´s</li>
            <li>Does everything that it is supposed to do and at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>It is a free item.</li>
            <li>the blades of the beard trimmer are also of cheap quality and leaves marks.</li>
            <li>This one is cheap plastic that feels like its going to fall apart.  </li>
            <li>Workmanship of unit is cheap.  </li>
            <li>fantastic buy for the price</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s built cheap, but it works.</li>
            <li>the price fits, its a bit cheaply made.</li>
            <li>cheap piece of crap...rusted up and became another piece of trash.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re just doing some light trimming</li>
            <li>I use a cheap &amp;#34;sunbeam&amp;#34; battery 8 for a $1 from the dollar store.  </li>

            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Light weight trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The parts don&#x27;t fit together well.  </li>
            <li>it seems as if it should be more powerful...</li>
            <li>cheap material</li>
            <li>Cheap and ineffective.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get the job done, cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Wahl sent me a replacement free of charge immediately.  </li>
            <li>The trimmers are precise and ergonomic.</li>
            <li>works great for facial hair and for his hair.</li>
            <li>but a cheap way to get er done</li>
            <li>This product was cheap.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was cheap and had both trimmer for hair and nose, but it has lasted three uses and now the nose piece doesn&#x27;t work and the beard trimmer does not work well</li>
            <li>My Son had this GREAT LOOKIN beard that is short....</li>
            <li>and it is still clean, strong and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>ALL the attachments fit in the holder</li>
            <li>The primary WAHL trimmer meets ALL my requirements.&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
            <li>away from this product, there is a reason why it is as cheap as it is.</li>
            <li>for the price it is a fantastic choice.</li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>All the attachments really come in quite handy.</li>

            <li>Perfect for your everyday trimming needs.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the cheap price.  </li>
            <li>Great price, like the different length combs.</li>
            <li>Use to trim mustache, light beard.  </li>
            <li>It was cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works well, even if it feels really cheap.</li>
            <li>last forever and do a great job</li>
            <li>It is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Cheap, starts making noises after a while</li>
            <li>It is NOT giving smooth touch on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;appears</li>
            <li>Great trimmers only thing is I wish they had a stand for the ear/nose trimmer to sit in</li>
            <li>It is a cheap price for a reason.</li>
            <li>I was looking for cheap product that I would end up using sparingly anyways</li>
            <li>No wear-and-tear noted and it&#x27;s easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t fit in the stand/tray.</li>
            <li>Dont really use the nose trimmer but still nice to hae</li>
            <li>Look, you get what you pay for so its definitely cheap.</li>
            <li>Nice item as described thanks</li>
            <li>Excelent nic color smooth</li>
            <li>Works well for light touch ups.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, flimsy feel - just junk.</li>
            <li>I feel that it is made with cheap plastic that feels like it’s going to fall apart.</li>
            <li>it was cheap</li>
            <li>working, I do not see how this cheap plastic piece of junk could get 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Great for male hygiene.</li>
            <li>After using a Phillips Norelco All In One Grooming system for a decade, when it died I thought I would give this cheap option a try.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s so cheap.  </li>
            <li>I use cheap cvs batteries.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, this is the cheap option, so your not getting a luxury trimmer.</li>
            <li>and it work good and have had many different trimmers, and</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as the one I have at home (also a Wahl) which is rechargeable and is better overall in quality.&lt;br /&gt;However for a travel unit</li>
            <li>but always comments that it doesn&#x27;t cut as good as the old one did.</li>
            <li>good complete set.  </li>
            <li>Great product - worked better than expected</li>
            <li>/&gt;The old adage, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; holds especially true for this product.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>they work good so far, don&#x27;t like that they run on batteries.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product originally; however, the company Wahl went above and beyond to help me out and replace my trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Very handy.. total value for money</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and tims well.</li>
            <li>Very economical and practical.</li>
            <li>The instructions included are very useful as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this devise to be very useful.</li>
            <li>Great value for those of us who have facial hair and like to stay clean and neat.</li>
            <li>but I got the exact same one (this one) and it works great, love that it&#x27;s wireless</li>
            <li>Very good for a battery operated device, not as strong as the regular cordless/rechargeable ones but is much lighter and can be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li>which is surprising because Wahl usually makes good products</li>
            <li>They come with a nice bit of accessories an are pretty powerful.</li>
            <li>To now have an extremely quick and easy (painless) alternative to tweezers, I am grateful.</li>
            <li>I loved the first I purchased so much, I went ahead and purchased another.  </li>
            <li>Just got my new Wahl Cordless trimmer and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I liked it, it is just as described, i would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anybody looking for a cost effective trimmer set.</li>
            <li>I find it much more convenient to be able to slip in a new battery than worry about keeping it charged.  </li>
            <li>Nice blades and very nice small accessories.</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;m aware that this is a $12 product</li>
            <li>WHEN I PLACED MY ORDER, THAT IS WHAT I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT, AND THIS ITEM REQUIRES 2 AA BATTERIES.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for &amp; I am not disappointed</li>
            <li>Even if it breaks within a year it was still worth the $10!</li>
            <li>(I bought it originally for car camping and overnight take</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a long story, and we had a great relationship but the fateful night we used this trimmer on her bearded clam is a hellish incident I don&#x27;t wish on anyone.</li>
            <li>Other than not being sure how to put in that batteries, it seems good for the price so far so good</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend, he loved it but apparently the nose hair trimmers didn&#x27;t work/</li>
            <li>This product really isn&#x27;t worth your money!</li>
            <li>my original review appears below *</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working great for the beard, eyebrows, and just minor trim here and there.</li>
            <li>I use it for my sideburns and eyebrows weekly, still on the original set of batteries.</li>
            <li>At first I was really impressed, but after the first use, it lost the power it initially had.</li>
            <li>Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend you skip the first part and just move on to better things.</li>
            <li>While everything else about this product is fine, all the different size trimming replacements and the nose trimmer works fairly well, the fact that it yanks out hairs so often makes this product 2 out of 5 in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>it is a great little package,  I will post more if I run into any problems.</li>
            <li>The price is great on this little gadget and my husband seems pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product from a company that has been around a very long time.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite things, lost mine during Super Storm Sandy &amp; couldn&#x27;t wait till I was able to get a new one,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m clean shaven now.</li>
            <li>The price of this trimmer was fantastic because before I purchased this product I checked the prices at the so-called Super Stores and I could not find one cheaper</li>
            <li>This product is great...if you like your whiskers ripped from your face rather than cleanly cut.</li>
            <li>TO GET clean result ,have to try it again and again.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product that&#x27;s worth its value.</li>
            <li>This is a good cheap set of clippers for someone who has a short beard.  </li>
            <li>response directing me on how to routinely clean and oil the clippers.  </li>
            <li>that said, i wouldnt rely on this to clean me up for a business trip.</li>
            <li>Not only good for my face, but keeps my dog&#x27;s nether parts free from Klingons</li>
            <li>I thought maybe Wahl&#x27;s quality had deteriorated as have so many products in the age of corporate greed at the expense of any kind of customer service or satisfaction.    </li>
            <li>I liked the last model better....  </li>
            <li>keep the exterior of the cutter clean.</li>
            <li>I use the brush, SUPPLIED, after each use to clean the blade and cutter exterior.</li>
            <li>The Wahl brand for the last thirty years has provided by far the best (and cheapest) mens shaver.  </li>
            <li>I got this because I needed something to clean up my side burns/back of the neck between haircuts.</li>
            <li>Either his barber would trim it up, or he would try to clean it up with his razor, which did not work as well as he had hoped.  </li>
            <li>use the brush to clean it up after use.</li>
            <li>and I wanted something to clean up.  </li>
            <li>This set seems very sturdy and I loved the stainless steel tips.</li>
            <li>Very cheap, very reliable, does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very cheap, very reliable, does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>VERY LIGHT AND WORKS VERY WELL</li>
            <li>The machine looks pretty good so far!</li>
            <li>For the price you&#x27;re not getting anything special.  </li>
            <li>I could not be more satisfied with this economical, practical and complete grooming set!</li>
            <li>Good enough to keep most of my beard trimmed but certainly wouldn&#x27;t cut it off if need be.</li>
            <li>great product, exactly as advertised, would definitely recommend it to anyone who asked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to win any power contests, but you just need a small motor for most</li>
            <li>Not much use yet but works great.  </li>
            <li>A great gift for the man in your life whether it&#x27;s a family member, friend or significant other.</li>
            <li>This in my opinion is a true value.  </li>
            <li>Cool product works well</li>
            <li>Overall good.</li>
            <li>this trimmer is really cool</li>
            <li>Works fairly well, but not as well as prior model made in Illinois, as this one was made in China.</li>
            <li>He really likes how he is able to change the clipper part of it.</li>
            <li>but overall a good product for the price IMO.</li>
            <li>I should have probably read the description of the product more closely, however the product does get the job done really well and does meet the expections of trimming beard</li>
            <li>I use my full size corded for that.  </li>
            <li>really like Wahl as a company and will probably look to see if they have a more robust model before changing brands.  </li>
            <li>All the necessities for a good haircut when the style is short.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re going to try this trimmer, keep it far away from moisture of any kind.</li>
            <li>cool product....very durable</li>
            <li>The trimmer is of solid design and good material.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a place in the holder to put the ear/nose hair trimmer, but overall a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>I trim my beard fairly close, using the fourth click out of five on the slidable blade guard.  </li>
            <li>Ok, get real, a booger cutter plus a sideburn/beard trimmer for 10bucks!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Returned for full refund.</li>
            <li>Nice complete kit.</li>
            <li>only good thing is that all components and attach work.</li>
            <li>Cool beans were found with this item.</li>
            <li>I like this set, it cuts good and batteries last longer in it than advertised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed it a solid trimmer, good feel and</li>
            <li>Brought this for my dad as a Xmas gift and he loved it especially the nose shaver that came with it.</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad by.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the bargain price, and it does the job, as needed.</li>
            <li>Not a bad offer for $10 anyway.</li>
            <li>clogs up very easily, even with new batteries</li>
            <li>:  Unless this thing breaks down within a year, I think its a great choice for light trimming needs.  </li>
            <li>Cuts very well and is light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Replaced my worn out trimmers I confident these well be a good as the previous Wahl.</li>
            <li>But if price is your main factor this one works just fine!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking after your first use easily.</li>
            <li>The guides are easy to use and change out, the trimmer itself is easy and doesn&#x27;t pull, and the extra tools help out too! :)</li>
            <li>Great gift for men, young or old who like the day stubble to clean shaven.</li>
            <li>attachments work fine, and the smaller trimmer is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still kicking after almsot 2 years and still sharp great product.</li>
            <li>Other than that everything was great.</li>
            <li>I am using Wahl products from long time and happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;These are really and cheap and best.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My other trimmer was great; it felt substantial in my hand and did the job well.  </li>
            <li>Other then that its a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>its exactly what i was looking for work fine</li>
            <li>Fine for the price after the first trimmer was replaced because it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for a quick neck shaved.</li>
            <li>Got here quickly and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Batteries do go quickly</li>
            <li>Item was shipped quickly and came as described.</li>
            <li>I primarily purchased it for the beard trimmer but was also pleased with the nose hair clipper...so far.</li>
            <li>Just once for a quick edging up of my beard.</li>
            <li>I think these are used for a quick shape up.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is extremely powerful and yet gentle on the face and with so many attachment</li>
            <li>In this case, the price to pay for style is cheap however loud the product. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>It gets the job done quickly and without fuss.</li>
            <li>Obviously, at just over ten dollars this isn&#x27;t going to be the best trimmer one can purchase.  </li>
            <li>While this trimmer isn&#x27;t perfect, the quality of the trimmer and results are on par with a much more expensive trimmer (like $40).</li>
            <li>This thing eats batteries, and quickly doesn&#x27;t cut hair, but just pulls it out.</li>
            <li>Not motivated enough to try to get it replaced, but I suggest spending more money and getting something better.</li>
            <li>The trimmer worked OK for trimming my beard, though it took maybe twice as many passes as my last rechargeable model</li>
            <li>Great price, and comes with absolutely everything a man needs to trim both facial hair, ears and nose too.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Luckily it broke in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position.  </li>
            <li>otherwise you&#x27;re still better off spending a couple more bucks on one that has a internal rechargable battery</li>
            <li>However, it rusts quickly when taking into the shower.  </li>
            <li>This one was quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Handles my beard and eyebrow trimming needs adequately.  </li>
            <li>battery operated so don&#x27;t expect anything extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s about 20 years old, was a lot more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This shaver does a quick efficient job for me.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t perform adequately either.</li>
            <li>Being both mustachioed and bearded, I don&#x27;t need much attention from a trimmer, but this package is more than adequate and worth twice the price.</li>
            <li>Providing the nose trimmer and marketing it as a bonus would be more meaningful if it actually worked; it does not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super affordable and does what it needs to for my uncle, who I gave it to as a gift.</li>
            <li>Minus the battery fit problem, the trimmer does a good job.</li>
            <li>have not tried those other products, so it&#x27;s possible they are really excellent as well, but honestly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to me worth it to pay twice as much for the name</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good just what i expected to be, really love the this and the shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>Other than that, the trimmer is perfect as far as the performance is concerned.</li>
            <li>but it works ok on people hair that is not thick.</li>
            <li>5 stars because I got exactly what I needed for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I have only used it about 6-8 times but the batteries don&#x27;t seem to die real easy</li>
            <li>But overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Works on a AA battery, which lasts a good, long time in this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Another &amp;#34;well known&amp;#34; brand name that has entered the great swirl and vortex down the drain and into oblivion.</li>
            <li>maybe the only cons that I found the comb which coming with it is vert sharp but who cares about it since the trimmer is working very good :)</li>
            <li>Great product minus the fact that the trimmer does not have very much power.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a very cheap but easy to use hair trimmer for basic maintenance go for it...</li>
            <li>Having had a rechargeable trimmer previous to this one, I welcome a trimmer that you have to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li>Wow these are amazing for my first pair Trimmers.</li>
            <li>Works really well as an easy beard trimmer...</li>
            <li>gift was exactly what he wanted for Christmas thanks amazon for comin thru when I needed you the most</li>
            <li>you are looking for an inexpensive trimmer that does basic trimming, this is a pretty good trimmer for the cost.</li>
            <li>Wahl is a pretty solid company, so I knew I was in good hands.</li>
            <li>The trimmer feels solid in your hand and obviously is pretty well made - surprising given its price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I have not had a single issue with it, and, like a good book, its</li>
            <li>you are looking for an ordinary, cheap, completely run of the mill trimmer than Wahl is your best bet.</li>
            <li>First, you have to remember that this is a beard TRIMMER!  </li>
            <li>and really does the job for me!!</li>
            <li>but for 9 bucks works really well!!</li>
            <li>Your key to better looks!</li>
            <li>I use the shortest clip to shave my balls and my wife really loves it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for free fast shipping (I always select Super Saver Shipping)</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR KEEPING BEARD CLOSELY TRIMMED AND GETTING IN TIGHT PLACES AROUND MUSTACHE AND GOATEE.</li>
            <li>Works fine, really like the AAA batteries.  </li>
            <li>very nice and less than walmart</li>
            <li>great little trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li>the little nose hair accessory is great too.</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s a great little shaver that doesn&#x60;t eat batteries.</li>
            <li>Great little machine for the price.</li>
            <li>Overall, the shipping was fine, I was able to get it in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a person who can afford a slightly better shaver, but I guess if you&#x27;re looking for something to use occasionally and not on the face, this works fine.</li>
            <li>Trimmer was fine and appeared to be a good purchase for a few months</li>
            <li>If you like to closely trim your facial hair instead of shaving totally bare clean, this is great.</li>
            <li>With the batteries, it is lasting longer and the trimmer is very good compared to the rechargeable trimmers at the same cost.</li>
            <li>was a gift, everything works just great and is useful for everyday, the plastic caddy has compartment for each tool.</li>
            <li>The guards are cheap plastic but easy enough to use, change, and clean as needed.  </li>
            <li>This is a powerful unit and my husband likes the accessories.</li>
            <li>Nice combination of low price and all the function you could want.</li>
            <li>Works Great, the batteries are lasting longer in this one compared to my old one.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor.  </li>
            <li>WELL worth the money.  </li>
            <li>has a powerful motor  </li>
            <li>I have had several trimmers but this is well made with a nice even trim.</li>
            <li>I WENT OUT AND PURCHASED A FRESH SET OF AA ALKALINES AND INSTALLED THEM PER THE MANUFACTURERS INSTRUCTIONS.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is surprisingly powerful, considering it runs on just 2 AA batteries.  </li>
            <li>Good to have, works as expected.</li>
            <li>but if the batteries are fresh (using duracell batteries so no excuses)</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t complain when I exited the bathroom freshly manscaped and nose hairs gone.</li>
            <li>... was broken but the people were wonderful and issued me a prompt refund</li>
            <li>I really expected more from a prominent brand like Wahl.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>With fresh batteries, this thing has the energy of a slug.  </li>
            <li>Switch o Big trimmer is kind of touchy  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t take an regular AA battery you have to buy the really nice ones.  </li>
            <li>It was well worth its price.  </li>
            <li>I recommend that for a useful tool to trim beards, noses and ears, this is worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li>really worth for money</li>
            <li>more offers like this.</li>
            <li>I use rechargeable batteries and honestly I have not had to recharge them yet, although I only use the shaver about once a</li>
            <li>Anyway, he is really pleased with it &amp; it does more than he expected.  </li>
            <li>So far I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if somebody could have verified it actually worked before reselling it.</li>
            <li>It is plenty powerful.  </li>
            <li>so it isnt worth the time or effort to pack it and drop it off.</li>
            <li>So far, almost a year later, it is still working great.</li>
            <li>its worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is not as powerful as a corded razor</li>
            <li>and this works better than the old Wahl trimmer I Had.  </li>
            <li>Okay only because it was so cheap.  </li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>My old one was better.</li>
            <li>for the price it is worth it</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Powerful trimmer and works well.  </li>
            <li>Replaceable batteries have far more power then any of their rechargeable units.</li>
            <li>But for 10 bucks if I get a year out of use it seems worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>My last shaver was also Wahl and I liked it.</li>
            <li>Lots of useful extras.</li>
            <li>Like most trimmers, these are not really heavy duty and are not meant years..  </li>
            <li>It is much more powerful than my old Remington one that had a chargeable battery.  </li>
            <li>but i will probably use it as a 5 guard once grown out that far, and if it looks ok at that length</li>
            <li>Also there is a nose hair trimmer that is quite useful.  </li>
            <li>Now, with straight, spiky, gray facial hair, scissors do not do a good job.</li>
            <li>This product worth for the price.</li>
            <li>I do like the nose and ear trimmer which is almost worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li>I am pleased so far.</li>
            <li>That being said, I can say thus far I am pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>Execellent product with the worth of price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice &amp; working properly.</li>
            <li>This item is as simple as they come and they offer it in a cost effective package.</li>
            <li>Can even cut your own hair short if desired.</li>
            <li>Works nice, if you&#x27;re looking for something at low price and usefull you should buy this trimmer</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the return.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li>Worth what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>If it lasts a year then it will have been worth the price.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the product (old and new).  </li>
            <li>One improvement over the older model - and this is GREAT news - the trimmer does not &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; batteries when not in use for a week like the older models did!“We want teachers to have an open conversation about bullying in their classrooms,” she tells Yahoo Parenting.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m left with a product that is worth nothing but to be thrown in the garbage!!!</li>
            <li>It just putters out right away, and fresh batteries don&#x27;t help. ??</li>
            <li>Perfect for the normal groom a male needs, and a female steals to also complete :)</li>
            <li>Like most everyone I&#x27;ve had many battery operated devices and never had this problem with any other.</li>
            <li>Drains battery pretty quickly</li>
            <li>The price was excellent  and based on my last purchase of Wahl beard trimmer about 10 years ago, I&#x27;m assuming the quality and long term use will be the same or better.</li>
            <li>until now the cut hair machine have a good function, is recomended to other people that would like to buy it</li>
            <li>OTHER ATTACHMENTS ARE GOOD FOR TRIMMING HAIR.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t trim as good as other Wahl products, thinking about returning</li>
            <li>Though good trimmer, it has sharp cutters which some time cause irritation and burn.</li>
            <li>They also put out power very well for high-drain purposes, and do not self-discharge significantly.</li>
            <li>said good bye to other machines</li>
            <li>Other wise its all right but</li>
            <li>I turned it on heard the noise and it went right into the dumpster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some comments about how it will pull the hairs right out of you.  </li>
            <li>What I did not expect however was the rusty blades which seemed to rust just right after the return window expired.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any of the pinching or snagging that others had right up until the day it died.</li>
            <li>Get what you pay for...did NOT work right out of the package.</li>
            <li>Does what it says and he says it cleans right up with water as instructions indicate.</li>
            <li>No way to repair it, went right into the trash.    </li>
            <li>; So you&#x27;d guess that the product is made in the US, right?</li>
            <li>Works well and was priced right.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this and had to return it for a refund as it didn&#x27;t even work right out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>getting clogged right away&lt;</li>
            <li>Oh, that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>Overall, a professional quality product at an amazing price!</li>
            <li>These devices, like virtually all else that runs on AA batteries, will will work brilliantly and long on standard eneloop rechargeable NiMH cells... which cost about $2 each on amazon and which will each take 1500 charge cycles.</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT LITTLE TRIMMER FOR THE MONEY!</li>
            <li>Cheap substitute of high end Trimmer</li>
            <li>Well worth its very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to have brand new batteries or it won&#x27;t trim very well.</li>
            <li>I must admit that I mostly bought this when adding items to get above $25 for super saver</li>
            <li>Not only did this set arrive quickly, my husband is quite pleased with how well this trimmer works.</li>
            <li>I have been using mine for close to a month now almost daily, and the batteries are still going strong, the blade is still sharp, and even the nose hair trimmer is working great.  </li>
            <li>Pretty powerful for a battery operated device.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a Wahl Peanut razor and love it, so I had some brand loyalty when I needed a razor that I could use outside the United States without having to plug into different types of sockets.  </li>
            <li>The longest guard on this thing barely leaves a beard at all, slightly more than stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaved my face and revealed my true self, much to the chagrin of people I know.</li>
            <li>This kit does a great job of helping me with my excessive hair problem and the batteries seem to have a nice long life.</li>
            <li>It holds a nice long charge also on the battery.</li>
            <li>He used it right away and likes it very much.  </li>
            <li>Good product, it does what it claims got rid of my beard in a few minutes highly recommended cheap and useful</li>
            <li>Better off paying a little more for a razor that works.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more money for a better trimmer, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have used this little trimmer extensively, and have found it to be excellent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m getting rid of this and paying a little more for a much better product.  </li>
            <li>Still going strong after more than a years use every other day.</li>
            <li>My first reaction was to throw it in the trash right then</li>
            <li>Pure awesomeness!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to worry about charge levels or cords when traveling, easy enough to pickup new AA batteries if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, but does ok.  </li>
            <li>Great item especially the different face hair trimmers.</li>
            <li>This clipper does a good job, but it&#x27;s much louder than I would have expected from Wahl.  </li>
            <li>It trims relatively close or as much as you want without giving you any kind of problems.</li>
            <li>It feels and operate cheap, and it makes to much noise and the vibration in my hand to much.</li>
            <li>its plastic and lightweight, plus it runs on batteries so its great for traveling, especially on shorter trips or trips with multiple stops where u may not have an outlet for awhile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy clean and simple to use.</li>
            <li>Got here super fast</li>
            <li>So if you only intend of keeping a short beard or stubble, this is a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>Worked great especially for such an inexpensive trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the worse on line purchase I&#x27;ve ever experienced!</li>
            <li>, I bought a wahl as a back up, cheap trimmer, and its become my primary trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>An Instructional Manual for different hair cuts would had been great to include with the package for people like me who are starting to learn how to cut hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for their quick services &amp; shipping</li>
            <li>Very loud, and cheaply made..</li>
            <li>I used to have the older $10 Wahl special, It was a workhorse, not fancy but got the job done</li>
            <li>The other  attachment personal trimmer is very good and does the job well.</li>
            <li>Thank you all very much.</li>
            <li>recommend this Wahl trimmer and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Does the job well and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>And very reasonably priced as well</li>
            <li>Compact and very much what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping</li>
            <li>very light, battery operated and quiet.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be working fine, so far.</li>
            <li>it got rusted a little bit after 2 weeks, but the power is good...</li>
            <li>Its ok but thst wasnt wat I expected, it doesnt really clean ur nose</li>
            <li>Better set that other trimmers I&#x27;ve spent more for, and haven&#x27;t come with nearly as many attachments.</li>
            <li>and I am very impress with what I got,more important how well the trimmer work and also the nose hair trimmer and would highly recommend this product for purchase.</li>
            <li>The new one doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good as the older version of the same product.  </li>
            <li>probably because they are battery powerd, which is why I bought them in the first place.</li>
            <li>They rip the hair off my face and have since the first time i used them.</li>
            <li>low power, could be better</li>
            <li>but I need more gaurds, these are way to short</li>
            <li>This is not professional grade equipment, but for personal use (and at this price) it really is a great value</li>
            <li>Does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I had to replace an old Remington recharchable trimmer that I used for beard trimming and detailed trimming as part of my haircuts.  </li>
            <li>but low and behold, I was just in for the first of many surprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll step up to a better model which I hope will last longer than six months.</li>
            <li>I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li>Worked wonderfully the first time, then was unable to ever use it again.</li>
            <li>Shaves pretty close when I work the details.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find that the trimmers used   AA batteries instead of the larger size battery in my old Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li>my beard is gonna look fresh from now on haha</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>The one problem I have had is that my beard hair tends to be pretty course</li>
            <li>NEVERTHELESS, IF YOU ARE FOCUSED ON A BATTERY OPERATED TRIMMER, BE AWARE THAT THE BATTERY IS NOT INTEGRATED.    </li>
            <li>I brought this as a back up because I keep losing the charger for my better set.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Basic trimmer, works okay, requires a battery.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using such trimmer, and I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Broke the first use.</li>
            <li>will gladly purchase again if necessary</li>
            <li>I have been using this Product for the last two weeks and have been pleased with it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li>This is my first 1 star review in Amazon.</li>
            <li>During first use itself without the plastic I could sense some bite on my skin.</li>
            <li>No hangups, no pulling hairs, the guide lengths are consistent.</li>
            <li>this is the first trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li>Not expensive and does the job.</li>
            <li>Not only do they replace the product if it breaks, but the warranty goes well beyond what most companies offer.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This is the first cordless trimmer that I have owed.</li>
            <li>Had the same model for over 5 years but the plastic guard I use most wore out.</li>
            <li>Worked alright the first couple times I used it.</li>
            <li>I was willing to gamble and it paid off.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I mostly used it for facial hair trimming without any of the guards on.</li>
            <li>Make sure you oil your blade properly!</li>
            <li>There are better ones at a higher price range, but these served me well for THREE YEARS at it&#x27;s current price.</li>
            <li>I have had this for about a month and use it at least twice a week, still using the first set of batteries and it works great.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I use the attachment for my bows and that works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was  looking for.</li>
            <li>There are many different types of motors these trimmers can have and this model has the weakest.  </li>
            <li>the ear nose and brow trimmer had issues at first.  </li>
            <li>When working, the blade area gets pretty hot after just 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>so I imagine its great since he hasnt complained about it to me.</li>
            <li>First of all, it is a TRIMMER which is the &amp;#</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really quite powerful.</li>
            <li>♦ The trimmer is pretty light--being almost all plastic, but it fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviews said these were cheaply made, but I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>and I am still on the first set of batteries.  </li>
            <li>It does cut very well at all!</li>
            <li>goes through batteries to fast and doesn&#x27;t cut worth a darn.</li>
            <li>Opposite problem with the nose trimmer, you better be hercules to get the battery cover off of it.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer works okay for a low priced item.  </li>
            <li>not heavy, the switch is on the side and it just feels comfortable in my hand when I trim my mustache.</li>
            <li>Whal were willing to replace it</li>
            <li>I got this as a replacement of another Wahl trimmer I had that finally died after many years of use.  </li>
            <li>[ I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit that the first one I bought had a picture of Richard Karn (Al from Home Improvement)</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Died the first week -</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold the battery tightly enough any more to run.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s deafeningly loud and extremely cheap, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll spend the extra money for better quality.</li>
            <li>exactly what i needed and as described.</li>
            <li>Its light not to loud.</li>
            <li>Then broke within first week.</li>
            <li>First time I went to use it, it wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Prime Shipping made this a real bargain!</li>
            <li>for the first month or two.</li>
            <li>Had a similar razor Conair and I like this one much better</li>
            <li>The company remains steadfast to its roots by providing professional quality products.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s no luxury beard trimmer, and occasionally, it tugs at my hair.</li>
            <li>Needed a cheap trimmer and have always liked Wahl in the past.</li>
            <li>He just grew his first beard</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe Wahl puts their name on this product but then most likely the Wahl brand name was sold to some investment company years ago</li>
            <li>The nose trimmer didn&#x27;t run when I first installed the batteries.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that you can spend a better $10 for a male grooming product.  </li>
            <li>When I first attempted to use this in my nose, it felt as if I were using tweezers.</li>
            <li>but it does the job, and it does it the first time.</li>
            <li>It comes with everything i needed, and the cradle held everything pretty well.</li>
            <li>Was willing to over look that.</li>
            <li>This product performed exactly as it was designed to</li>
            <li>It rusted over within the first week</li>
            <li>pleased overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this trimmer a couple times and for the price, I guess it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d shop around more next time.</li>
            <li>And the only reason I have to call this the &amp;#34;second-best&amp;#34; razor is because it has more parts than I know how to work with.</li>
            <li>The nose/brow trimmer is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>I use it pretty infrequently.</li>
            <li>The first lasted years.  </li>
            <li>The nose hair trimmer is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>I tried it for a brief period of time after I was able to find batteries for it</li>
            <li>Use it to fix up my facial hair mostly.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my husband needed.</li>
            <li>I am pretty dissappointed</li>
            <li>It is clearly made of cheap plastic and was made in China.  </li>
            <li>My step-father has this exact Wahl set</li>
            <li>I should have looked for a more robust and solid built unit.</li>
            <li>A few good smacks against my hand remedies the problem, but</li>
            <li>The new one has much more power and the blades vibrate a lot quicker than the old one.  </li>
            <li>Purchased new Wahl trimmer in White in addition to Black one already owned and still in excellent working order</li>
            <li>He says that it is pretty powerful and precise and only cut him once his first time using it.</li>
            <li>The blade is sharp, cuts close, and leaves me with no stubble, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s any danger of it catching skin or yanking out hairs.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend if someone in your life needs an affordable first time trimmer!</li>
            <li>Way better than my previous wired one, still works with the original batteries I inserted six months ago.</li>
            <li>If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself to have a thick beard, which is why I am not spending more money on a better beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>This are powerful and very well made, I practically did my whole head with with the beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Appreciated the bonus trimmer which only made it a better value for the dollar.</li>
            <li>For it&#x27;s price, I can say it&#x27;s well worth it for anyone that is searching for something on the cheap side of things, while at the same time being a product that can get the job done.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this little trimmer set.</li>
            <li>I have found nothing special about this trimmer and would not waste my money on it again.  </li>
            <li>This product is cheaply made with low grade plastic, but it works and it&#x27;s priced right.</li>
            <li>Spend a little bit more and get something made far better.  </li>
            <li>the positive side, it does what you need.&lt;br /&gt;Takes about 8 minutes to get the job done to my satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>a positive note</li>
            <li>But all in all a decent product, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always pretty much done the trick.</li>
            <li>I was considering a more expensive one, but needed 11 bucks more in my order to get free shipping.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works great, but I&#x27;m only going to give is 3 stars due to the faulty switch.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t come with many long clippers.</li>
            <li>I do find it useful from time to time in trimming hair, and it does a much better job than I could do any other way.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t long before I was able to trim again.</li>
            <li>good for small trimming.</li>
            <li>As a very wise English person once said \\&quot;I am not rich enough to buy cheap things\\&quot; -- I wish I listened to him instead of Amazon.com reviews..</li>
            <li>Does a fine job, sharp blades, comes with oil, nice size in the hand, plenty of cutting power, great for sideburns &amp; moustache...</li>
            <li>It is kind of odd</li>
            <li>Nice set of accessories but not a high-end machine (which is something you should expect when paying anything less than $50).</li>
            <li>the trim guides are easy to put on and off of the trimmer even after over a vear of daily use.</li>
            <li>After that it started to sputter and be less effective.</li>
            <li>My facial hair then was curly, and it was easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item strongly for personal hygiene..  </li>
            <li>had I not thrown it against the wall, shattering it out of pure frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pure junk.</li>
            <li>Works just to trim ends on large beards.</li>
            <li>I used it one time to trim certain areas.</li>
            <li>Pure junk.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful when buying this product because of the positive reviews I&#x27;d read.</li>
            <li>The holder isn&#x27;t really all that effective or useful as it doesn&#x27;t have a spot for the small rotary trimmer or all of the length guards.</li>
            <li>The attachments from the old one don&#x27;t fit onto this new version, the blade is wider.</li>
            <li>But I would happily buy another one of these at less than $10 instead of a $40 unit next time I need a trimmer.</li>
            <li>The trimmer worked fine for the first few trims, even though the included adjustable guide doesn&#x27;t really work, the fixed length guides work OK.  </li>
            <li>I bought a new trimmer right away.</li>
            <li>Works fine for the price, and seems to last !</li>
            <li>Have used several weeks &amp; battries are still doing fine.</li>
            <li>Most personal shavers cost much more than this and come with less.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this twice, and it  does a fine job trimming my beard and neck.</li>
            <li>Both trimmers worked fairly decent for about the first 5 or 6 times.</li>
            <li>but it seems pretty decent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little kit, and being on batteries makes it portable</li>
            <li>This is a nice little kit.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little trimmer set.</li>
            <li>I love that this trimmer just uses plain old AA batteries which can be easily changed, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about having it plugged in to the wall all of the time.</li>
            <li>So, it serves a purpose, and does a fine job, and it definitely was was worth it for the modest price.</li>
            <li>works well, alittle hard on batterys but good for the price</li>
            <li>very durable</li>
            <li>Dont know how much time this will survive</li>
            <li>The nose trimmer worked really well.</li>
            <li>Aside from the cheapish construction, its held up real well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this Wahl one to replace a similarly cheap Vidal Sassoon branded trimmers that finally died.  </li>
            <li>I noticed immediately that the Wahl was much easier to nick yourself with accidentally.  </li>
            <li>I decided to keep it anyway, and just be more careful than I&#x27;d had to be with the Vidal Sassoon</li>
            <li>Well, if you nick yourself many times because of a nicking-prone trimmers, even if you&#x27;re careful about cleaning the wound and antibiotic ointment each time, eventually statistics might let an infection take hold.  </li>
            <li>thanks charles petruzzi.</li>
            <li>the plus side, it&#x27;s a very inexpensive set that includes anything and everything you&#x27;ll need to trim your beard, goatee, van dyke or</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li>the nose trimmer works really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely purchasing another one to replace it.  </li>
            <li>It does the job well, but its a longer process than it really needs to be.  </li>
            <li>i itch too much, but i didn&#x27;t want to spend much as i will shave by summer  </li>
            <li>I really think it costs them $1 to make this item..</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I wanted to try growing a beard and didn&#x27;t want to put too much money into a trimmer if I didn&#x27;t like my beard.    </li>
            <li>This product was shipped fast...</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>These trimmers seem to work very well....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like that much.</li>
            <li>Is this really a Wahl?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfectly capable of taking care of a goatee, but as I&#x27;ve been moving toward a full-face beard, it&#x27;s leaving a bit to be desired.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t trim the edges very well</li>
            <li>I was looking for an inexpensive and very portable trimmer and found this.  </li>
            <li>The included nose-hair trimmer also works very well.</li>
            <li>( use GENTLY on the neck)  </li>
            <li>I also use scissors but these help out so much.</li>
            <li>I trims really well.</li>
            <li>but it seems to work for a reasonable amount of time considering the price.  </li>
            <li>haha..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li>he was very upset.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really</li>
            <li>like really?</li>
            <li>If I leave fresh batteries sitting in the clipper, they nearly die within a week.  </li>
            <li>Not as much power as a corded item would be but very acceptable.</li>
            <li>For $11-12, you really shouldn&#x27;t be expecting too much.</li>
            <li>we couldn&#x27;t really trim my hair.</li>
            <li>I hope the trimmer has a much longer lifespan.</li>
            <li>Does everything specified and more than expected.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful as a beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li>However, unless that day comes before a year&#x27;s use (hopeful much much longer), my review will stand.</li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re really pressed for money and need something compact and convenient, this may be for you.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is very efficient for the price.</li>
            <li>and it was ready to go.</li>
            <li>the batterie don&#x27;t run out fast either.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much from this beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>It started to rust out all ready.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer works very well</li>
            <li>The overall quality as in material and weight it what you would expect from a cheaply priced trimmer.</li>
            <li>bottom line is it works better than expected and for the price it can not be beat.  </li>
            <li>makes more noise than expected.</li>
            <li>Got this one because it is straight battery powered.</li>
            <li>I really think it costs them $1 to make this item..</li>
            <li>or it will rust fast.</li>
            <li>Although the battery lasted me the whole time i had it, i don&#x27;t like the fact that it is not rechargable.</li>
            <li>It cuts hear really well without the attachment.  </li>
            <li>The cordless with built in batteries run out of juice too fast.  </li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>Very convenient to take on the road.</li>
            <li>I had to get a more expensive Philips Norelco to do the job, but I really can&#x27;t complain at such a great price.</li>
            <li>Closer cut than my wahl plug in unit, and the nose hair trimmer cuts the hair without too much discomfort.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nowhere near as powerful as the Remington.</li>
            <li>very hand..good product</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>It is also really just battery operated</li>
            <li>But if you do buy this one, just an FYI that it isn&#x27;t really the one for haircuts.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Very well.</li>
            <li>Fast in Brazil.</li>
            <li>fast shipment.</li>
            <li>On those occasions when I do need to charge it up, it doesn&#x27;t take very</li>
            <li>/&gt;This stopped working very soon after I got it.</li>
            <li>In the minute that I used it, this thing pulled out as much hair as it cut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, light weight, and simple to use.</li>
            <li>Nose and ear trimmer doesn&#x27;t function very well at all.</li>
            <li>it really does.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but for the price I paid it works really well.</li>
            <li>The 5-position guide only goes to 1 setting and doesn&#x27;t feel secure.</li>
            <li>Compared to the rechargeable Conair I had owned for years, the Wahl cuts much faster and without any &amp;#34;whisker pull&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>so I can not say to much never use</li>
            <li>Wahl stands behind their equipment almost forever, so it made a great gift for my friend.</li>
            <li>the product works really well</li>
            <li>Much better in fact, than what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like it, very snaggy on my beard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, but only where it counts!</li>
            <li>Very convenient.  </li>
            <li>thank you soo soo much.</li>
            <li>thanks much</li>
            <li>Plastic, very plastic</li>
            <li>Also, the build quality is much better than expected, so  I expect them to keep working.</li>
            <li>They feel solid, yet light.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really thinking about the battery issue when I bought this.  </li>
            <li>I am returning this one also and getting a real trimmer.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also very noisy and applying a drop of oil doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>I tried out both and both trimmers work really well.</li>
            <li>It is really a value for money.</li>
            <li>hahahahaha...</li>
            <li>Thanks arrived on time and works well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain much considering the price.</li>
            <li>The Wahl shaves much closer to the skin.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t cut very well</li>
            <li>The nose clipper doesn&#x27;t really work very well.  </li>
            <li>IT STRAIGHT</li>
            <li>works well, does the job, inexpensive, shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Batteries die fast</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Cons - The guides and stand are very chintzy/flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>Item works really well.</li>
            <li>Does everything it supposed to do very well</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really pick up on the &amp;#34;battery operated&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for this price</li>
            <li>I got this because I saw that it has the nose and brow trimmer, but unless you&#x27;re alright with still having visible nose hairs, the nose/brow trimmer really won&#x27;t be of much use to you.</li>
            <li>This part is very important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was free second one I&#x27;ve tried!!!!!</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t as much clipper size guards as we would like.  </li>
            <li>my only concern is that it started to sound funny (Loud noise) after 15 0r 20 minutes of use on my first try, i wont use it till like a month after, but i hope this doesn&#x27;t become a problem.</li>
            <li>I bought based on price and should&#x27;ve just spent $10-15 more.</li>
            <li>is rusting a tiny bit and feels cheap but trims like a dream!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I just tried it out and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>What I really like is the simplicity so that you can take around anywhere you go without bothering about the weight nor the electricity.</li>
            <li>Bought for my bf, works very well</li>
            <li>I expected it to be a bit more... nimble and seemingly effortless</li>
            <li>I REALLY don&#x27;t know what to do or may be trash</li>
            <li>For anyone who wants the info - 3 AA batteries.</li>
            <li>It also goes through batteries to fast.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s really taking a toll on my wallet going everyone week or two.</li>
            <li>The blade doesn&#x27;t seem to be calibrated very well, it pulls at the hairs.</li>
            <li>Absolute garbage, it stopped working after a month.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the packaging is protective.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say here.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Its a shame because it cut really well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li>shipped fast</li>
            <li>They work better that I had expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>works well and does not take up much space.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much of it</li>
            <li>and I like all the attachments needed for a trim or a really close grooming.</li>
            <li>Really like the nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is very Durable and holds up to the humidity in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I don’t really have the time to go through any hassle in returning it.</li>
            <li>so I guess I cannot expect too much.</li>
            <li>However, being cheap in design and quality has been the only thing I can review.</li>
            <li>But it is much handier and lighter than the plug-in Wahl.</li>
            <li>It works very well  </li>
            <li>i bought this for my son and he hasn&#x27;t really used it much</li>
            <li>but it seems to do what it say very well.</li>
            <li>It will not do much on ear hair; I have another trimmer for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quality product for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>it works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>The cutting power isn&#x27;t all that great it won&#x27;t go through thick hair very well, it kind of more pushes it out of the way</li>
            <li>The nose hair trimmer is even more of an energy vampire, and it will completely kill a battery left in it for a week.  </li>
            <li>I am an adult male whose hair grows everywhere but on top of my head, this trimmer helps me maintain a neat appearance of the rest of my head.</li>
            <li>Good product and every one should try it at least  .</li>
            <li>Wahl offers many different models and I chose this one because I was also in the market for a ear nose and brow trimmer and this came with that as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The different razor guards are nice but not necessary unless you want a shorter cut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been at least 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve bought this item, and have loved it ever since.</li>
            <li>Nose trimmer is nice, but the razor quits after a few shaves, GET A RECHARGEABLE RAZOR.</li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s not 100% safe, and cutting yourself inside a nostril is a good way to get a MRSA infection.</li>
            <li>When I saw that the battery replacement was as much as this new trimmer I figured nice to have a new one for the same price as the battery for the old one.</li>
            <li>However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own.</li>
            <li>Easy to use though, maybe a little pinching if I go to quickly.</li>
            <li>I followed the cleaning instructions in the book completely yet right as I lifted the plastic cap off of the device I was treated to some unwelcomed brown spots.</li>
            <li>Nose trimmer broke after very few uses and can only be used if I keep the  battery cover off and jiggle the battery into place just right, but shaver works well and is still going strong after many months.</li>
            <li>Uses alkaline batteries so no frequent charging needed, batteries easily replaceable.</li>
            <li>I only need to trim once every other week or so, but the battery life seems good for me.  </li>
            <li>I had a strange experience with this one: When I first received the product, everything was fine, except for the bonus trimmer, which just wouldn&#x27;t work even with a new battery.</li>
            <li>however it is batterie operated, just make sure you keep a set of extra batteries because you will need them shortly after your first trim.</li>
            <li>last awhile - Used a dozen times on original batteries</li>
            <li>Overall though, I did receive the order promptly and on the attempt to originally return the product as the image shown was misleading to where it did look that you could have the capability to trim hair with (since I did not have the money for the haircut)</li>
            <li>A lot better than any other trimmer that I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like this brand more than other at home brands I have used.</li>
            <li>so far so good it will depend on how long batteries last</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and not powerful at all,..</li>
            <li>Several attachable blade lengths  Plus a nose/ear trimmer this will clean you up.</li>
            <li>other combs and the both other trimmers are great.</li>
            <li>However, the motor does get loud if you are using it for a long time, so before you turn it on, make sure you have an idea as to what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is decent but drains batteries fast.</li>
            <li>Simply clean with brush and oil provided and item will last.</li>
            <li>It actually worked than I had expected very pleased.</li>
            <li>♦ The thing that surprised me the most is how long it stays charged.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing little trimmer!  </li>
            <li>This is just good for trimming down some of the bush so that the blades don&#x27;t get clogged constantly when I use the Fusion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product, the only down fall is that it is battery powered.</li>
            <li>works great, the shaver guard trapped and pulled hairs initially, but seems better behaved after a few uses.</li>
            <li>The product offers a lot of bonus attachments for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but I  should have spent a little more money and got a better one .</li>
            <li>easy to store and carry, good cutting power</li>
            <li>I bought it mostly for an ear &amp; nose trimmer but really like the fact that there is a beard trimmer included with several different trimmer heads to control length.</li>
            <li>It does the basic job of a quick facial hair clean up.</li>
            <li>I bought this two babies along a CONAIR full size trimmer and ended up not using the big fella&#x27;.</li>
            <li>good things come in small packages and even better when the price was small too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will consistently and frequently pull hair.  </li>
            <li>First off, this thing is loud.</li>
            <li>The attachments are very difficult to get off of the razor, but aside from that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Nice small trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems pretty reliable so far.</li>
            <li>This very inexpensive Wahl did better than my three times more expensive Norelco.</li>
            <li>It is also pretty loud.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is powerful enough and it&#x27;s actually a benefit to use rechargeable AA batteries in this compared to a cheap built in NiCad.</li>
            <li>A small bottle of oil is also included, and has its own spot in the stand, along with slots for the comb and cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re just an average joe like me, then there is no need to spend more money, this gets the job done every time..</li>
            <li>Works well for shaving down there :)</li>
            <li>I recommend it for something small quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Had this for 4 years, still like new!</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new trimmer!</li>
            <li>It was cheaper to buy a new trimmer than replacing the guards!</li>
            <li>Mind you, not a top notch, high quality, buy-it-for-life trimmer, but damn nice for $10.</li>
            <li>Hard to open, but still a great product for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve apid more and have gotten less.</li>
            <li>Much better than my previous one.</li>
            <li>I must recant a previous review of this by me,the clip is adjustable,from the metal guide, seems sturday,Im pleased with product</li>
            <li>This particular trimmer kit is not a wall charger device, it operates off of batteries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to manual trimming with scissors for now while I look for a worthy replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to compete with a professional clippers however for light and simple grooming</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not buy this beard trimmer if you are older than 14.</li>
            <li>I had a older Wahl  trimmer and hair cutter worked for 10 years</li>
            <li>For the money it is a decent buy.</li>
            <li>However, after receiving this particular model I used it once.</li>
            <li>They are decent clippers for cleaning lining up the hair.</li>
            <li>for the money decent deal.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older rechargeable unit.</li>
            <li>The nose/ear trimmer works decently well</li>
            <li>perhaps someone wanted to use this particular trimmer as a torture device?</li>
            <li>I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy a more expensive one.</li>
            <li>Batteries last several months or more.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pinch or cut and gets hairs close to skin (not to be confused with a straight razor but good for what I need).  </li>
            <li>I mainly use the beard trimmer and it does</li>
            <li>This is a decent product.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;free&#x27; nose and ear trimmer were used once and the 2nd time, it sounded like an old car rattling.  </li>
            <li>* Does a decent job</li>
            <li>Not that anything more expensive is that much better.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t work on steady speed since day one...</li>
            <li>This makes it simple and quick to maintain with the 3 guard lengths.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, but gets the job done quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works decent, however the included nose trimmers broke after one use.</li>
            <li>I have a 4 year old cheap Chinese knockoff i bought in Bangkok that still works and is not rusty.</li>
            <li>recommended to anyone that needs a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is a decent trimmer.  </li>
            <li>However, the main shaver does not.</li>
            <li>Seems to have a pretty strong little motor.</li>
            <li>And, it is very loud and too fast.    </li>
            <li>really well for the price was very surprised.</li>
            <li>The on off switch has a &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; undocumented middle setting of super high speed.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap option and don&#x27;t have to shave every single day, I would grab this set.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very light and feels cheap and most importantly, does a terrible job of trimming.  </li>
            <li>But only one bad blade in like 4 sets of these at this point, perfect gift and the nose trimmers are sweet</li>
            <li>good for weak hair, it wont cut my beard ...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for the price it was listed.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>Wahl came highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended gift for the man in your life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recomended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly as it is probably</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this trimmer too highly...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to someone who is looking to give this as a gift to someone else who needs to &#x27;tighten&amp;#34; up their look . . .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>We received the trimmer just as promised and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Wahl is known for high quality products, this is no exception except as a battery operated product it has no power as a beard trimmer, nose trimmer works though I give it that.</li>
            <li>After 1 MN working it smells like burning and the noise is really really high</li>
            <li>so I will keep it anyway as it&#x27;s a fairly high quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, even though he doesn&#x27;t f****n deserve it and should have it jammed so far down his throat</li>
            <li>For less $11 this seems to be a great deal, especially with the nose trimmer being a completely different unit from the beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect muchfor the price, I was very surprised as it works better than my much more expensive unit.</li>
            <li>I love the little caddy that comes with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use the nose hair trimmer as I have a little grooming tool I like better</li>
            <li>But...the guards could be a little better.</li>
            <li>Does a fine job well worth the small price.</li>
            <li>the cutting abilities aren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>The first batteries i put in were cheap, so i upgraded to quality batteries with little difference.  </li>
            <li>and I found it to be more then capable of trimming my large and thick beard.</li>
            <li>felt cheap and wasnt what i expected.</li>
            <li>Louder sound then expected</li>
            <li>Great for hair, beard and even those weird nose and ear hairs.</li>
            <li>batteries have to be jammed into case with a hammer...very cheaply made (in China of course).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was cheap and, therefore, I&#x27;m not going to try and return it for a partial refund.</li>
            <li>Spend a few more dollars and get one that doesn&#x27;t cause pain while using.</li>
            <li>Cuts ok, to about a 4 star level but basically feel like i wasted my money.  </li>
            <li>This set is worth double what you pay for it.</li>
            <li>Not the most heavy duty</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;He has not complained about batteries, so he must like it .</li>
            <li>I wondered if being battery powered would be powerful enough.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You can get these locally at pretty much the same price.</li>
            <li>Even if it only lasts a year well worth it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even worth sending it back!</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as my commercial clipper, but it is cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be enticed by its low price - it isn&#x27;t even worth the inexpensive cost.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am debating purchasing another one just to have its so well worth it.</li>
            <li>Battery operated so it&#x27;s only so powerful.  </li>
            <li>I have always stood behind wahl as being a superior product.</li>
            <li>I recently had a tremendous downsize in my personal economics, so I am used to the higher end models.</li>
            <li>better than my previous trimmer by far.</li>
            <li>far better than previous ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>the thing isn&#x27;t strong enough to cut my facial hair...</li>
            <li>how is broken the top part keep pop or shoot out lucky it never shoot in my nose</li>
            <li>hey, remember, it&#x27;s only $10, right?</li>
            <li>Be right back...</li>
            <li>It trims very even and the guides fit tight.  </li>
            <li>fine, no reason to buy a more expensive product.</li>
            <li>My son has a similar product and it worked fine with the same batteries</li>
            <li>The bonus hair trimmer is also of decent quality (although I&#x27;m not sure how one would effectively be able to use it on eyebrows).</li>
            <li>However, it does do a pretty decent job, although, occasionally it will pull a hair or two.</li>
            <li>Let me start by echoing other users&#x27; reviews: the plastic that this trimmer and its accessories are made with feels extremely cheap.  </li>
            <li>Same as old trimmer, pretty much.</li>
            <li>The construction is cheap, which maybe can be forgiven due to</li>
            <li>I gave this 5 stars due to the fact its so cheap and works like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Brand new batteries and</li>
            <li>Had a trimmer set but lost the charge cord and couldn&#x27;t find a new one.</li>
            <li>New batteries of course, about each year.</li>
            <li>MISTAKE, the new one can&#x27;t cut evenly and the attachments for beard length are a joke.</li>
            <li>so you can adjust the length as desired, however the new one has three attachments set at predetermined length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I placed a new battery in turned it on and it worked for 5 minutes made a noise and has not worked since.  </li>
            <li>He had not had a new kit like this in years.  </li>
            <li>So when I decided to get a new trimmer I got a new Wahl Trimmer -</li>
            <li>Went to use one morning and it would not work, changed batteries (brand new) still would not work.</li>
            <li>BTW the new products work as I hoped.</li>
            <li>and then it stopped working, even with new batteries it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I NEED NEW ONE</li>
            <li>It just died so got him a new one.</li>
            <li>WHAT HAPPENED, did the company run out of new products and sent returned items from their warehouse slated to be refurbished.</li>
            <li>(I saw a YouTube video and took it apart to solder in a new battery, but it was a pain, and the clippers were still so-so.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Replaced with brand new batteries</li>
            <li>Even will completely new batteries, I couldn&#x27;t trim or shave anything.</li>
            <li>I put new batteries but it still will not turn on.</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d get a new one, thinking that Wahl might have solved the problem.</li>
            <li>I even went to buy brand new batteries, and they wouldn&#x27;t even cut on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and unlike some other products, it&#x27;s not too heavy and stores easily.</li>
            <li>You gotta be very careful while using this product, it is not so smooth on the skin, i wont blame it on the product, well,</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the motor is loud but other than that excellent product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted a battery powered shaver as opposed to rechargeable and this is really the only one i can find.  </li>
            <li>It was cheap enough and I only wanted something to keep up with manscaping...</li>
            <li>Sad to see a great, old mid-western company manufacture their products in China rather than Ohio.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s able to trim and maintain his facial hair with minimal tugs...</li>
            <li>I bought this for personal grooming, the machine is so loud giving the illusion of it being powerful.</li>
            <li>The main design flaws are a) the outer blade housing is prone to rust; and b) eventually the built-in battery completely dies.  </li>
            <li>Super limited battery life.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, got it the next day.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are very loud.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li>I think this is a very complete product</li>
            <li>It was awesome but disappointed when this package didnt come with eyebrow attachments</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big investment but believe me, you get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li>My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years.</li>
            <li>The batteries don&#x27;t sit in the trimmer properly and the trimmer worked once, the first time I put batteries in, then never worked again.  </li>
            <li>Another thing was - the first beard trimmer worked well, but the second one was tugging on my stubble - and avoiding that was what their ad was all about!!!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to dwell on it, so I just sent the replacement back, and kept the first one.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly as usual from amazon and this i was pleased with.</li>
            <li>This set works like a professional one!.</li>
            <li>I considered, but declined to buy other more expense, name-brand trimmers such as&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>My fiancé struggled to trim his facial hair even without a guard...had higher hopes for this product...disappointed</li>
            <li>i bought this for edging and trimming my sideburns at first, but i used it to shave my entire head</li>
            <li>I rated this so low because since the first day the product didn&#x27;t even work with fully battery.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a small problem in operating it as the battery contacts weren&#x27;t touching the batteries.</li>
            <li>Batteries are better because usually we run through trimmers because the irremovable battery stops keeping a charge.</li>
            <li>Works for nearly every beard grooming task I need!</li>
            <li>It simple cuts better and closer than the other brand.</li>
            <li>the 2 smaller guards broke the first day</li>
            <li>He looks clean and sharp for work.</li>
            <li>the manual states: keep the blade clean and oil every other month or so - no worries</li>
            <li>Likes: stainless steel, high quality blade; long-lasting lithium ion battery; fairly quiet to use&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:</li>
            <li>I got this beard trimmer for my cousin who was needing a new one after his old one quit working.</li>
            <li>so I could put this new old in it.  </li>
            <li>♦ The sound is moderate--not quiet, but not loud.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality, battery doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made batteries don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>Very vague instructions on how to use the eyebrow and moustache accessories, but it trims very close and looks great for the beard.</li>
            <li>My partner is very satisfied and says it works well, only complaint is that it&#x27;s noisy but at the price, that&#x27;s acceptable.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty loud and occasionally will pull a hair instead of cut</li>
            <li>I wish there was a size between the longest fitting and the next one down...</li>
            <li>I got a little water on the blades, but wiped it off with a towel and figured it would be fine.</li>
            <li>The ear and nose clipper is just too weak to be effective.</li>
            <li>it was waterproof,  but so far have not had any problems keeping it dry around the sink &amp; tub!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the $10ish price, it&#x27;s worth it if you want a cordless trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the blade&#x27;s initial ability to be adequate (only one week of use at time of review.  </li>
            <li>I have a large bin of chargers in my garage and did not want to add another &amp;#34;unknown&amp;#34; in the future.</li>
            <li>They feel a little cheap and are a bit noisy, but I don&#x27;t see that a problem given what the product is.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get one that actually works.</li>
            <li>Frankly, the little nostril trimmer is worth the price of the whole set</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to press the rotating blade a little too firmly against your nostril to get a good cut.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting your manhood or ladyhood lol</li>
            <li>Beard trimmer is great for pulling hair but not for cutting it.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how much power this trimmer has only running on two AA batteries!</li>
            <li>and it is abundantly clear to me now.  </li>
            <li>After using this one time it has completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>Since it uses AA batteries there is no need to have a cord lying around like my old rechargeable one.</li>
            <li>They burned my 5 year old grandson, and an elderly friend of mine, as well</li>
            <li>This thing trims very well, and has been used about once or twice a week for the last year, so it holds up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also recently ran into an issue with the nose trimmer on/off switch doing whatever it wants.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much for the low price...</li>
            <li>The blades feel like they&#x27;ve been made with the cheapest steel from an old clunker in China..</li>
            <li>Not too loud though.  </li>
            <li>works well, trimmer is loud.</li>
            <li>Gift for Adult grandson.</li>
            <li>The speed at which the trimmer operates really surprised me</li>
            <li>It is a bit loud, but does the intended job of trimming.  </li>
            <li>I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED, THIS PRODUCT ONLY WORKED ONE TIME.</li>
            <li>Wow, was that a mistake.    </li>
            <li>bit loud</li>
            <li>Just remember to use a safety clip/position guide (included) and not use it directly.</li>
            <li>My husband is really picky about his personal grooming item.</li>
            <li>FINALLY THE WHOLE DEAL, AND WORKS WELL</li>
            <li>He has been using his old Beard Trimmer for over 10yrs.</li>
            <li>took my old one that was still working and trimmed my puppys face and around his eyes and also did his feet in between groomings so that I could see to cut his nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll likely get tossed and replaced very</li>
            <li>It is a bit loud however.  </li>
            <li>This product is complete garbage.</li>
            <li>I have used this product only once, but it served its purpose very well.</li>
            <li>A bit of a power hog, requires fairly frequent battery changes.</li>
            <li>I did keep the old zipper case the old one came in</li>
            <li>Have not had any issues so far.</li>
            <li>I was extremely surprised at the power or speed that it has.</li>
            <li>For the price it hasexcededmy expectations so far.</li>
            <li>As far as the quality of the trimmer, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>but the fact is it was an absolute chore to get it to actually trim my beard.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be too loud to use near my ears.</li>
            <li>just  completely stopped.</li>
            <li>This was the reason I replaced my old trimmer, and yesterday they had it on sale on Prime day, so I bought it for about the price of this one.</li>
            <li>I put in batteries into the bonus ear trimmer and it came on instantly, not thinking much of it, when I went to turn it off, the switch would not work</li>
            <li>To the point that while using it just the movement of my hand would pull the battery door open, leaving me with two pieces in my hand, and really ruining the grip I had on the device.</li>
            <li>Only real downside</li>
            <li>I can tell so far by just looking at the product, is that it does not come with batteries (do people even include batteries with products anymore?)    </li>
            <li>Lots of improvements over his old one.</li>
            <li>I have had no problems so far.</li>
            <li>He has used this several times and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This is a well priced trimmer that does the job but loud when in use.</li>
            <li>Took old batteries and put in flashlight and they worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this especially because it is battery operated.</li>
            <li>old.</li>
            <li>So if your looking for a reasonably priced trimmer that will do the job I would definitely give this one a go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my beard lately</li>
            <li>I did and the young lady that I spoke with</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not adjustable enough to get real gradations.  </li>
            <li>Thought it does do the job, I miss my old one, because it was a beast</li>
            <li>So far I cannot find fault with its function.</li>
            <li>It does catch/pull occasionally when going too fast.</li>
            <li>Really loud, so plan around others sleep.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>Every piece is marked &amp;#34;Made in China.&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>I havent had a problem with them so far.</li>
            <li>Not sturdy enough for much else.  </li>
            <li>Everything else is like his old one that he likes.</li>
            <li>but the value far exceeds the price.  </li>
            <li>B000B9SFQG 3310-230 Wahl Blade Oil Professional Blade Maintenance by Wahl Professional Animal]]</li>
            <li>I am surprised to see Wahl put their name on this.</li>
            <li>Yes, not as loud.</li>
            <li>I got it and frequently cuts out.</li>
            <li>When I was a young man, I let my beard get as bushy as I could stand it, using scissors to maintain a good-looking appearance.</li>
            <li>This does the job it needs to, I&#x27;ve heard no complaints so far from my fiance.</li>
            <li>Batteries stay charged for a long time and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the merchandise.iwill suggest this product to any of my friends who need a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>My old Wahl trimmer</li>
            <li>I only use the smallest guide comb for my beard; and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints at all, so far.</li>
            <li>After 2 shaves it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>So far he has no complaints.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR CASH.</li>
            <li>A bit loud</li>
            <li>Yes, I completely missed the &amp;#34;cordless battery operated&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Wow, it works.  </li>
            <li>This replaces a 15 year old trimming kit.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll spend a few extra minutes longer than you&#x27;d expect to make sure you got all the hair trimmed that you wanted to.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>The nosetrimmer seems to run slow but that&#x27;s better than&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wahl provided good customer service when the clipper failed after three months.  </li>
            <li>Not impressed at all...heard nothing but good things about this product</li>
            <li>Used on my beard today for the first time - thick and full hair - cut through w/ no pull or snag -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, anyone still buying and discarding alkaline batteries deserves poor performance.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my husbands birthday in January, he took it out to use it for the first time last week, after trying several new batteries in it, the darn thing would not work.</li>
            <li>Comes with a cheap little stand, plus some decent different sized guards.</li>
            <li>After the first use I was very pleased in the performance of the large trimmer, not so much the small trimmer which I found basicly useless.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a sensitive skin, but there are red spots allover due to the cheap material.</li>
            <li>This little hair trimmer is so powerful my wife has used it to trim my hair to even it up and neaten my hair !</li>
            <li>As said in other reviews, the batteries don&#x27;t fit right in the nose timmer, and I find it quitting until I give it a little shake.</li>
            <li>THIS APPLIANCE IS SMALL AND EASY TO USE.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad but the noise trimmer does not work from day 1, and the blades on the clipper looks to be getting rusty in less then a month.</li>
            <li>I use it for little trims to clean up a bit around mustache.  </li>
            <li>Cuts are pretty easy and it&#x27;s not as heavy as other model I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li>The shears are super sharp!  </li>
            <li>The attachments work very well, but take a little getting used to at first.</li>
            <li>The Wahl quality far exceeds the last 2 Remington sets I had, and will surely last much longer, 2 yr. warantee!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t turn on at first until I jiggled the batteries in their seating, which also seems loose.</li>
            <li>The little gimmicks for limiting the depth of cutting have been to guys with beards the most terrific and simple ideas of great value to men.</li>
            <li>used only the main trimmer.  </li>
            <li>does the main trimmers get only 1 star?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent set for as low priced as it is.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t spend the extra $10 or so to buy a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li>I finally found a trimmer w/ attachments at a decent price.</li>
            <li>The excellence you expect from one of the finest grooming product companies, at a very reasonable price, I have had several rechargeable trimmer sets...and they only last so long, this one was priced right at around 10$, and I have rechargeable batteries anyway, which can be changed.</li>
            <li>a little cheapy, but not bad</li>
            <li>At first, i kinda hesitate to buy this because i couldn&#x27;t believe the price for this whole set was less than $10!</li>
            <li>right length cutter heads which my other did not have, at 3 times the price.</li>
            <li>Some of the other reviewers are right, who said that this trimmer is noisy.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for several reasons.</li>
            <li>Seems to work as expected and was purchased at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>If you want a high quality product that will last forever, then consider this a 2 star.</li>
            <li>While Amazon&#x27;s return process if simple and proved to be hassle free the one time I used it previously</li>
            <li>The batteries lasts long, meaning the trimmers consume not too much energy.</li>
            <li>cheaply made and way too small.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well for behind your ears, back of your neck, and touching up all areas.</li>
            <li>The other nice thing about no cord is that you can shave those extra hairy places in the shower or wherever (wouldn&#x27;t do it with the shower on though); thus not making a mess on the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>everything I expected and works very well!</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that is would be nice if the included stand had holders for the attachments and extra trimmer.</li>
            <li>am a lifetime beard grower, and have had many different trimmers, and I happen to by a Wahl one day, and its outlasted all my other big name trimmers, and i totally mistreated it and abused it, and it still trims like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Quality is much higher then I expected.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>and I do strongly recommend that you do get long lasting batteries to operate this as it will be beneficial or get rechargeable batteries as it does drain the battery faster than I would have expected.</li>
            <li>considering how much comes in the small package, but what I do use, I like very much.</li>
            <li>As with most older men, I seem to be growing hair in all the wrong places and losing it where it&#x27;s needed, this little kit takes care of the first half of my poblem just fine.</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a new trimmer with various attachments and ran across the Wahl brand at Amazon.</li>
            <li>The new trimmers was same model # and features.  </li>
            <li>After trying 4 sets of different new batteries I found some that worked.  </li>
            <li>nose trimmer does not have enough power even with new batteries.  </li>
            <li>Takes personal hygiene to a new level</li>
            <li>I clean my unit with isopropyl alcohol, and it&#x27;s not very effective.</li>
            <li>better said dull ! ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super powerful.</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t remember the exact time span, but it was long enough for no concerns to arise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In hindsight I should have spent a few more dollars.</li>
            <li>I certainly won&#x27;t be buying this brand again and will save up a few extra bucks to get something with a little more quality and durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Wahl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The beard trimmer on the other hand shaves quite well - I&#x27;m not too particular about a smooth shave as long as its low enough to be neat and looks well trimmed.</li>
            <li>works very well for the money, gave it hubby as a gift he like it not as strong as other wahl i have use in the past</li>
            <li>looks like the blade are not sharp</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve had a Philips before and its internal rechargeable battery doesn&#x27;t last long, and it isn&#x27;t as powerful as the Wahl.</li>
            <li>But for the price, the few times it gives me that minor discomfort can be easily</li>
            <li>Well worth the little bit of money.</li>
            <li>and sometimes it takes multiple passes on the same area to get decent results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Am surprised a major name company would produce such an inferior product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must be in the minority, as it is generally getting 4 stars, but I found this to be a steaming piece of dog poo.</li>
            <li>I generally use it without the guides to get a close trim around my neck line.  </li>
            <li>So much for the batteries don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely steer clear of here-</li>
            <li>and so far I have not had the same problem with this one.  </li>
            <li>Use frequently since purchased 8 months ago and running on same batteries.  </li>
            <li>I cleaned the entire unit with a soft brush and compressed air and re-assembled it.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well this worked for just having regular AA batteries.</li>
            <li>nose trimmer doesn&#x27;t go up my nose far enough to trim hair.</li>
            <li>This version only uses two batteries as opposed to the three for my old one.  </li>
            <li>Have only used trimmer for sideburns so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this gets slightly jammed on thicker parts of my beard, but the real dissapointment is the massive&lt;br /&gt;waste of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No regrets, and not considering purchasing a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; trimmer at this point.</li>
            <li>Have only used it a couple of times so far, but I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s pricing for this complete grooming package simply cannot be beat!</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for a really old WAHL trimmer that finally just stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Professional quality grooming products at a ridiculously low price.</li>
            <li>I just replaced the old chargable Wahl model I had for twenty years finally gave out.</li>
            <li>I have used it only twice so far</li>
            <li>I am going to contact Wahl directly and will report back if they uphold the 2-year warranty ONE day before it expires!  </li>
            <li>Barely gets through one use</li>
            <li>after using it just one time 3 days later the metal part was all rusty, it is not stainless, i regret not searching more about this product, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>normally battery operated trimmers don&#x27;t last me but months, but i am no on the second year with this.</li>
            <li>But because I had thicker than normal facial hair it did not cut properly as I had hoped however the pieces that were said to be in the package were there</li>
            <li>Not very sharp..</li>
            <li>Blade sucks, runs out of batt in minutes, does not have the right size of attachments that normal shavers have.</li>
            <li>It got broken right after first use.</li>
            <li>It would not be good to get shocked by a cord when you have a very sharp metal razor right near your face.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I grew tired of shaving, so with this I can quickly shave in the morning without loosing much time.</li>
            <li>I typically just use it for a few minutes at a time, so I don&#x27;t keep it plugged in; nevertheless, it still stays charged for many days.</li>
            <li>Expect a few errant shaves that might require a trip to the barber shop anyway to fix it before you do start to get it right.  </li>
            <li>Dead on arrival right out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>I know you get what you pay for typically, but this really takes the cake!</li>
            <li>And i kept comparing with other brand, fancy looking, and of course evaluate the reviews as much i appreciate.</li>
            <li>You have to go much slower than other razors would allow, but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>This shaver shaves very close and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li>I really like that trimmer, and it lasted for almost 2 years before it really started to dull.</li>
            <li>The comb heads have to be sort of forced down onto the clippers and they are very short, way shorter than I liked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with sort of naturally curly hair .Its</li>
            <li>The noise is loud enough to be heard outside the bathroom.</li>
            <li>My old one occasionally would when the batteries got very low, but this one has not at all.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not going to bother to send it back to get fixed since I only paid like $15.</li>
            <li>im socially acceptable</li>
            <li>replaced an earlier model that was broken from being dropped too many times</li>
            <li>I mean I don&#x27;t like a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>It is a replacement of an old one that has been dropped a few times and had a hard time running any more.  </li>
            <li>If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty simple, so I guess there&#x27;s not a lot for them to mess up.</li>
            <li>Apparently the packers didn&#x27;t want to waster the proper size box</li>
            <li>Once I finally got it it barely runs.  </li>
            <li>Also arrived early and did not have to wait to long.</li>
            <li>Only detraction - apparently they changed the model of the nose trimmer</li>
            <li>Sturdy construction, useful extras, and it comes with a small container of oil for the blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and yet powerful.</li>
            <li>It small but powerful for a battery powered device.  </li>
            <li>The main drawback is that is sucks that battery life up fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, tough and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>the blades just seemed to dull really quickly.</li>
            <li>Its not super high end, its made of cheap plastic, however its hard to complain when you get a bonus trimmer all for around ten bucks.</li>
            <li>I know it is cordless, which sounds convenient, except the battery cover is difficult to keep in place, especially if you think you are handy enough to turn it on with one hand as you push the switch up, the battery cover comes back and off.</li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law bought me a rechargeable Wahl that was so dull that it pulled even short whiskers, and this battery operated Wahl is killing batteries way too fast, one decent trim</li>
            <li>item was as described and new in package, was definately what i expected and would definately buy items from again</li>
            <li>The plastic blade combs are hard and a bit uncomfortable to use; the combs are fairly difficult to remove and replace and doing so sometimes will remove the entire blade which then has to be re-inserted; the 1/8&amp;#34; comb (smallest available) does not get it down to stubble level, it would be nice to have an even smaller comb; would be nice to have a storage unit for the trimmer and of the accessories</li>
            <li>Does the job, but not quite as fast or comfortably as a previous model this replaced.</li>
            <li>Barely used as it was only used for trimming eyebrows and back of neck once.  </li>
            <li>I was curious why there was a pretty wide range of prices for these trimmers</li>
            <li>but I Think it is a little small, bigger is better</li>
            <li>My old one had a narrow, straight blade, and it took a long time to do the job.</li>
            <li>Ear, nose trimmer is just OK, a little underpowered and hard to get correcy battery contact.</li>
            <li>Blade on trimmer was a little bent but didn&#x27;t really affect anything.</li>
            <li>Batteries wears out a little too fast for my taste but does the job its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I tried brand new batteries, then other batteries, to no avail.  </li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive because i didn&#x27;t actually see the real thing</li>
            <li>not too bad does what it says works good</li>

            <li> Otherwise its really good for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s battery battery operated so it&#x27;s good when the power goes out in the house.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I thought it was a good idea to take the guards off as with them</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> I had a rechargeable shaver that provided a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

            <li> Good product, but no have battery.</li>
            <li> quality is really good in this price</li>
            <li> Batteries were checked and found to be good.</li>
            <li> Does not seem like it makes good contact and acts like the battery</li>
            <li> I laughed when I re-read the \\&quot;no snag</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is good that it is run by battery (not included)</li>
            <li> its good for if your grooming</li>
            <li> good for pubes.</li>
            <li> but hey, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> This is a good set.</li>
            <li> and it is fair quality for what you pay for, however,</li>
            <li> It is always tricky buying an item like this online, because you can&#x27;t get your hands on it and give it a good look.</li>
            <li> Good price for a lot of grooming tools.</li>
            <li> Good product and price</li>
            <li> Works good on my beard.</li>
            <li> Good luck with the storage tray.</li>
            <li> I got this one because it had good reviews, however the shave is too close (for those who like a bit of stubble) and it causes all sorts of breakouts on my face because my skin is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband had one of these for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>

            <li> but good for home use</li>
            <li> Good quality trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Wahl makes some good products, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is good for couple of uses after that</li>
            <li> He is in customer service and well, what can I say I made a good investment.</li>
            <li> but the trim is good.  </li>
            <li> Good blades and the batteries don&#x27;t take away from the power of it.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> its just the stand doesnt hold the nose trimmer good for your trimming</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself works fairly well.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.</li>
            <li> then that it&#x27;s good life is good too</li>
            <li> Been using this once or twice a week for a couple of months now no issues, can&#x27;t argue with the price, battery life is good, if it breaks I will just order another one.</li>
            <li> It has done a wonderful job keeping him hairless and smooth.</li>
            <li> This kit helps to support your beard and that shines in good condition</li>
            <li> Seems to be of good quality and design, but I would not recommend to friends.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer takes two AA batteries and would be good for travel.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually fairly shaggy when I trim it, about once a month.    </li>
            <li> The mustache trimmer that comes along with it for free is excellent!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;High-carbon self-sharpening steel blades are precision-ground for superior results&lt;</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good product.</li>

            <li> This is a good product ,i could have picked this up at walmart,but it was easier to order and have it sent to me.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best cheap trimmers on the market.</li>

            <li> Good product for the price,</li>

            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loved it</li>
            <li> Good buy, I&#x27;m from Venezuela</li>
            <li> He absolutely loved it and he uses them all the time.</li>
            <li> I have yet to have to replace the batteries on either unit, so that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Beard trimmer operates good.</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> It was a fair price paid for this type of product.</li>
            <li> The Silver colored models are good quality - this one didn&#x27;t work out of the box.</li>
            <li> So it is good for close cuts, but if you have a 4 day growth, it doesn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li> Has good power for being battery operated.</li>
            <li> Wahl used to be so good.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good value for money.</li>
            <li> When I did use it it had my gotee looking good</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a nice set</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m ok with it good function....</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Nice set.</li>
            <li> Nice bonus getting the ear and nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> Really trims my husband&#x27;s gotee great!</li>
            <li> I liked and recommend.</li>
            <li> I was not looking for something that came with its own built in rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li> a nice bonus is the ear and nose trimmer that comes with it.</li>
            <li> The bonus nose trimmer was nice too.  </li>
            <li> Nose-hair clipper was a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mainly I liked this model a lot.</li>
            <li> I own two Wahl clippers that plug into the wall.</li>
            <li> Bought for my grandson, as he uses his dads all the time, now he will have his own.</li>
            <li> When I do have a beard I don&#x27;t find it effective to just trim with.  </li>
            <li> It had a lot of nice accessories and he is using it</li>
            <li> I would say give it 10 minutes before it starts getting noticeably warm and the noise turns up.</li>
            <li> Love it lots of good tools for grooming</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for traveling but still i could have gotten better.</li>
            <li> nice product</li>
            <li> Nice touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ♦ Honestly, I cannot think of any flaws with this product.</li>
            <li> ♦ Honestly, I cannot think of any flaws with this product.</li>
            <li> Nice item to have.</li>
            <li> This is a nice inexpensive trimmer.  </li>

            <li> and I owe it all to this handy dandy trimmer.</li>
            <li> Loving it.</li>
            <li> This allows me to get a nice trim on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> a while I tried to have a beard looking as nice as my Son&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I bought this one because I had a really nice Wahl beard trimmer</li>
            <li> The batteries don&#x27;t fit perfectly in place of the beard trimmer and that makes it feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Plus you can put your own batteries in it.  </li>
            <li> , that is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the product is good, and the guys love using it.  </li>
            <li> Good price but OK quality.</li>
            <li> nicely made as well.</li>
            <li> Also the nose/ear trimmer is nice accoutrement to pkg.</li>
            <li> this is a nice Amazon deal.</li>
            <li> I also liked the [[ASIN:B001GQ3GEY Wahl 9854-600 Lithium Ion</li>
            <li> The beard and mustache trimmer as well as the bonus ear, nose, and brow trimmer work very well and an excellent value for the price I paid at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use it a lot without a guard and the closeness of the cut is nice for roughing in the shape of my beard.</li>
            <li> Sure was a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Comes in handy if I don&#x27;t have time to visit the barber.</li>
            <li> These always come in handy.</li>
            <li> Honestly what&#x27;s that matter?</li>
            <li> This nice set has plenty of accessories and helps him keep nice and trimmed.</li>
            <li> Works like the kind the pros use.</li>
            <li> Would have liked it rechargable.</li>
            <li> Realy nice device.good size,nice work.</li>
            <li> Wahl.the most good thing is that it is portable.</li>
            <li> Nice item comparing to its price ...</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer is a nice bonus</li>
            <li> and it keeps your face trimmed and tidy</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any significant pulling on my hair while using this trimmer as some reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Best is the nose trimmer, the older</li>
            <li> I just clean it with the brush after every use and it works great.</li>
            <li> excellent product, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and it appears to be a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> The shaver is underpowered, even with the best batteries, and the attachments don&#x27;t want to fit straight until you give it a good fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its just cheap plastic, but it holds up remarkably well.</li>
            <li> That being said, this is a great product for a well-groomed man whether you have a full beard, goatee, or just want that 5 day growth look.</li>
            <li> You can use it in the shower and clean it under water!!</li>
            <li> for 10$ great deal for a wahl, cuts great, all parts came, nose clipper works great,trimmer sharp and works great.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and a great price.  </li>
            <li> Makes keeping it looking good easy</li>
            <li> Quality of accessories is not that great and battery runs out of juice quickly.  </li>
            <li> lol he loved it so much he gave it unopened to his dad</li>
            <li> Excellent works very well and has many accessories.</li>
            <li> this was good and strong or a battery operated machine, but you cannot retract and extend the metal blade.  </li>
            <li> They are all very easy to use and use AA batteries.</li>
            <li> It is a very strong cutter.</li>
            <li> Amazon hit the estimated delivery right on target and this set from Wahl is proving to be an excellent purchase at a bargain price with a nose trimmer included free of charge.  </li>
            <li> My lines on my beard are impeccable and I love how easy and efficient</li>
            <li> Nose trimmer is fine but does good work.</li>
            <li> Other than that great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> Comparing to its price I find it a very good trimmer, so economic in terms of using the battery..</li>
            <li> I love the quality everything about it nice but trust it when it says its for BEARD&#x27;s....</li>
            <li> but I love the size and how nice it trims.  </li>
            <li> perfect item to replace my old trimmers</li>
            <li> the trimmer works excellent, is only $10 dollars, has extras in it for free AND feels and looks great.  </li>
            <li> Buy a good pair of Italian scissors instead - I&#x27;ve tried many things and this product at Amazon is the best: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XBO4OW2?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage</li>
            <li> I honestly thought it was going ti be better than the reviewss had said it was going to be , but my fiance hates it.</li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s great and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered more sets now as gifts, because it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows a beautiful woman who would be a bit more beautiful if she pruned her nose garden back a bit.</li>
            <li> nice, I liked the product equal to the publication , excellent price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the best unit for professional beard guys</li>
            <li> Not a bad trimmer for the price works great would be better if it had a built in battery</li>
            <li> Good for its price... dont like that its battery set but its works pretty good.</li>

            <li> It is very easy to use and and very light weight.</li>
            <li> and I needed something more precise to keep it looking good.  </li>
            <li> Well that machine is best to use i have use  in my life wish i could get  another one  for free from amazon thanks</li>

            <li> Very comfortable to use.</li>

            <li> Like others have stated, this product is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> it is pretty good and with one blade guide drops into my shaving kit nicely.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and all the additional attachments make it a handy all in one place.</li>
            <li> Has a good weight, comfortable to use and the batteries are AA and easy to replace anywhere I am.  </li>

            <li> Vendor was great with fair postage and a very low price.</li>
            <li> The Beard trimmer works ok.</li>
            <li> hindsight, I would&#x27;ve been much better off if I&#x27;d paid thousands of dollars to NOT use this Wahl product.</li>
            <li> love it ..will do business with u again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for the better part of 15 years</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t need to be anything more than that</li>
            <li> Solid piece of face grooming equipment; Wahl is one of the best products for the money.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying it and it was sent speedy</li>
            <li> Satisfied.</li>
            <li> So didn&#x27;t likes it,caz i have seen better.</li>
            <li> Love this clipper set, non-charger battery operated set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;t has more attachments than most trimmers.</li>
            <li> and I like it more even though it is battery opperated.</li>
            <li> Overall great trimmer for a lumberjake!</li>
            <li> how many times I changed the batteries.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for better.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Wahl before but this, well, I&#x27;m sure you get the point.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s CHEAP!</li>
            <li> While the case is plastic and feels cheap the trimmer is effective.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest to write a better product description.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d make a better set that was meant for &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Is okay.</li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> In my experience, my beard was pulled many times by the trim guard.  </li>
            <li> This razor operates OK</li>
            <li> However, if you can afford something better, you should probably buy something better.  </li>
            <li> and I frankly don&#x27;t know how they can sell it so cheap!  </li>
            <li> The best part is that the comb lengths match the CONAIR, so you can alternate between them to do</li>
            <li> I have not tried an alkaline battery in it, but I could not imagine the trimmer performing any better with one.  </li>
            <li> Saved me a ton of money visiting the barber shop :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Im glad I chose this company.</li>
            <li> love all the tools and gadgetsa t</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> This is a real good kit for the person who&#x27;s just starting to learn to trim a beard, everything is included!</li>
            <li> Love&#x27;s all the attachments.</li>
            <li> im glad it came through</li>
            <li> A heads up though, make sure water does not come in contact with the lower battery side of both of the trimmers.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for for this price?</li>
            <li> It works better than I antisipated.</li>
            <li> Now it runs BETTER than when it was</li>
            <li> There are so many pieces to it.</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer is okay</li>
            <li> therell be some antennae ticking out here and there, or u can be more deliberate and take a bit longer with the trimmer to get a more uniform, cleaner cut.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> had i been to the barber shop :)</li>
            <li> but it was better if it could work with 110V too</li>
            <li> I imagine you would not have to change them more than once</li>
            <li> every couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the cheapest trimmer I could find since I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to keep my beard.  </li>
            <li> Probably just a corrosion problem but can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li> (Aren&#x27;t we glad?)  </li>
            <li> These are great and very well made.</li>
            <li> Works perfect and for a very low price!.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this and he couldn&#x27;t be more happier with this set.</li>
            <li> , i love this kit</li>
            <li> Much better than others I&#x27;ve had use it every day will recommend all my friends</li>
            <li> I thought Wahl was a better company</li>
            <li> I would spend more money on a better set.</li>
            <li> I should have known to spend more than 12$ on a face trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is ok...</li>
            <li> for ten bucks and with all the things you get, BEST BUY !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Upon trying to trim my beard, it was more like an epilator than a trimmer.</li>
            <li> The top section comes off for cleaning, but when you put it back together, unless everything is aligned perfectly, you will find the mechanism jams and will not spin up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an excellent product and the only way to make it better is to get it for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prof</li>
            <li> A lot more attachments than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> He was just okay with it.)</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I would give this a lower rating, but for $10.49 I figure none of us should expect much more.  </li>
            <li> you get the more you need it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li> Hope you will continue this relationship and both sides are satisfied.</li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer was the better of the two devices.</li>
            <li> I ended up not using it any more when I started to get a bit of redness and swelling around the tip of my nose.</li>
            <li> The cordless feature is great and fast when your shaving.</li>
            <li> If this won&#x27;t bother you, I guess it&#x27;s okay to purchase.</li>
            <li> oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger trimmer has more power than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;The nose and ear hair trimmer does a very good job!</li>
            <li> It seems that the Norelco attachment used more energy so having a separate trimmer makes sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> Wahl is a fantastic brand!</li>
            <li> Get it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did because it works like a charm and</li>
            <li> Came with a lot more accessories than I realized.</li>
            <li> My husband love this kit.  </li>
            <li> It works okay for battery operated.</li>
            <li> Glad he loves it</li>
            <li> the 6th one he has had and the only one he has said was the best president he got for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Ear and nose trimmer could be better, but it was the the trimmer that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I think that the hair trimmer could be more efficient when trimming the hair in the nose</li>
            <li> It was an okay gift to give someone.</li>
            <li> It is better then the rest on the market.</li>
            <li> Could Be better.  </li>
            <li> I was quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> With this product I felt I got more than I paid for it.</li>
            <li> After owning Wahl beard trimmers for more than 20 years, I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of some of the reviews here.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the Wahl trimmer that lasted me more than 15 years.    .  .    </li>
            <li> But neither of them will work any more.    </li>
            <li> I use the moustache/ear trimmer more than the beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It runs OK until I hold it up to my face, then it goes off.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there are many people who would take the time to troubleshoot the issue, and just toss the thing.</li>
            <li> What more can.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is ok.  </li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t want to spend more money on return shipping.</li>
            <li> OK it has two AA DURACELLs in it.</li>
            <li> I turned if off, cleaned up out, put some more oil in it</li>
            <li> It is an ok trimmer.</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;ve been great to get a case instead of a stand, but I cannot really complain about anything about this product.</li>
            <li> Cant ask for any more for the price</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll have to replace more often.</li>
            <li> It does an ok job for the price.</li>
            <li> I really love this for shaving.</li>
            <li> It works, and I take it on trips where size matter, but for home my Whal hair clippers on the 1.25 inch setting do a waaaay better job.</li>
            <li> ordered for gifting , i am pleased</li>
            <li> Love it....</li>
            <li> It just has one job of trimming my mustache and with better attachments for it than the Norelco it does a better job.</li>
            <li> TOO FRY&#x27;S AND BOUGHT BETTER QUALITY TRIMMER</li>
            <li> THINK HE WILL LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This is definitely better than the &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; reviews, if you ask me.</li>
            <li> It trims well, better without using the guides.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t try the nose hair trimmer mostly because I don&#x27;t have nose hair that needs to be trimmer but also</li>
            <li> So, an in between fitting would make all the difference on that.</li>
            <li> In fact, I will be ordering two more for relatives.</li>
            <li> I love the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I purchased another brand and it was so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better than the hair clippers I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And once I do, I&#x27;ll be able to do it indefinitely at no additional expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the precision and ease with which these wall product trim my beard mustache, and nose hair.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> favorite feature of the Wahl 5537-1801 is the replaceable AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done much better than trimmers 4x the price.</li>
            <li> Also love not having to plug it in.</li>
            <li> I beleive I will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this shave kit.  </li>
            <li> sure about durability because of the plastic accessories</li>
            <li> I thought it might work better than my electric, since I thought it would be quieter than the electric.</li>
            <li> It worked quite okay.</li>
            <li> My husband has ordered more size guards just this week.  </li>
            <li> I bought this kit recently and it works excellent for me.</li>
            <li> gladly buy another if it breaks for any reason.</li>
            <li> and they work much better.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to shave often and felt that it needed more power than the battery provided.</li>
            <li> Has been working ok since I bought it.</li>
            <li> Love that this had a lot of attachments with it.</li>
            <li> no problems ok ok ok ok ok</li>
            <li> ok  ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> Most things I Review</li>
            <li> Works OK with plenty of attachments.  </li>
            <li> It even was able to cut my sideburns that the beard trimmer couldn&#x27;t.    </li>
            <li> I have to keep holding the top part while I am every time I USED</li>
            <li> I would spend more and get a better product.</li>
            <li> I have better things to do than run out to return defective products and</li>
            <li> the razors are sleek and agile.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wahl products for 7 years or so, and I usually love what I purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably better to use the oil that Wahl packs in the package.</li>
            <li> We are pleased with the product and the quality of trimming it provides.</li>
            <li> a gift for my brother love your gift</li>
            <li> I have to see how it goes, and give it some time before I can say for sure if we like it, more.</li>
            <li> Great product for reasonable price</li>
            <li> Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I love the fact that when they batteries die I can replace them instead of throwing away the trimmer when it can&#x27;t be recharged anymore.</li>
            <li> and it seems okay.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I will defiantly recommend to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints, works perfect for trimming my facial hair.</li>
            <li> I also am able to shape up my hairline whenever i need it.</li>
            <li> In my experience, a used toothbrush does the job better than the dinky brush that comes in the package.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> A worthwhile product that can save you money.</li>
            <li> Again, cheap but effective.</li>
            <li> And on top of that I didn&#x27;t even realize it wasn&#x27;t rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a bit more durable.</li>
            <li> It says here that twelve more words are required.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use it since they did not work, even though I chance the batteries twice</li>
            <li> Still even better, no cord to deal with.</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> but my roommate uses it more than me .</li>
            <li> Anyways, it&#x27;s ok for trimming will upgrade to something more substantial in time.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have 4 aa batteries.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the price which was even better.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s okay, I suppose.  </li>
            <li> Works perfect, except for the occasional tug.</li>
            <li> Would love a rechargeable feature but for the price I would make an exception.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend, spend $5 more and purchase better.</li>
            <li> this shaver helps you to look a litter better, its no what i spect, but ...</li>
            <li> Its cheap!</li>
            <li> It works very well and was a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Good for the right person.</li>
            <li> Good product - no problems and priced right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could ever get it totally clean, even taking the top part off and washing it under warm running water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would&#x27;ve been nice to have a web link or something on directions for using the attachments and whatnot, how to clean, etc</li>
            <li> Clean shave and handles nice</li>
            <li> The bonus ear/nose unit works great on those hard-to-get-at places that plague older men.</li>
            <li> This was a great price but is very loud!  </li>
            <li> I am beyond happy with this product, i highly recommend this to anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to use it at all, but I have ended up using it even more than the full beard trimmer!  </li>
            <li> Between trips to the barber shop, I find this kit a good way to trim my \\&quot;soup strainer\\&quot; mustache, clean up my beard a bit, clean up nose and ear hairs, and trim my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend for those who want handy, light weight trimmer</li>
            <li> very light weight(plastic)  with a strong motor.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job of trimming.</li>
            <li> Pretty good pretty good.</li>
            <li> Just put a pair of good battery&#x27;s and ready to go!.</li>
            <li> First off the shavers works good</li>
            <li> Pretty good condition.</li>
            <li> No damm good at all do not buy go to Walmart first</li>
            <li> This is a pretty darn good set for the price.</li>
            <li> on the first use of this trimmer it was a good result.</li>
            <li> The battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li> For the price it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> The teeth seem to be too close together to get a good clip the first time; the battery lid keeps coming off the ear/nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This works good and is exactly has described.</li>
            <li> Not a knock off, item in original pkg, in tact and with all parts!</li>
            <li> This product is really nice, we especially liked the round nose hair cutter</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, have used more than a year, still going strong.</li>
            <li> I love trimmers with AA batteries - they are easy to replace and you never have to worry about the battery losing charge over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually use it as kind of a backup to a rechargeable panasonic I have, but this once works great.</li>
            <li> Another way I would increase the rating would be to give more detailed information or include more pics for the product.</li>
            <li> Works very well,  impressed with the whole kit.</li>
            <li> pulls hairs more than i&#x27;m comfortable with, wahl model # 9966 has worked much better for me</li>
            <li> Happy with it, although the nasal one is a bit dodgy - lots of handy diverse bits so i can do facial and head</li>
            <li> item well described and performs as expected; no frills,great price, great kit; good value, meeting my expectations with no hassle</li>
            <li> Much more than I expected paying what I payed... have been using the kit over a year and everything works great!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a better, more precise tool for me.</li>
            <li> Nice product, great size, hopefully works for a long time :)</li>
            <li> The unit is very light and feels cheaply built</li>
            <li> I have had much better at 5-6 times the price&#x27; for what I paid, this works just fine - no complaints</li>
            <li> really love how easy the interchangable clips are too, easy and snap on.</li>
            <li> big beard trimmer works very good.</li>
            <li> Very good set of trimmers and tools for a very low price.</li>
            <li> but this one has been great so far.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have use for many of the accessories and the cheap stand does not have room for all the included attachments.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, no problems so far.</li>
            <li> This product is both cheap, effective and overall a great value.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement for my Husbands shaver and he&#x27;s happy so far with this one.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> My Fiance is in love with this tool, trims everything smoothly.</li>
            <li> but if it had some sort of recharging capability and cut closer to the skin to be more smooth I would give it 5 star.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it about a month so far, trimming 1-2x a week, and I can tell you that I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> in all - it&#x27;s OK for the money but is a cheap machine.</li>
            <li> We are happy so far.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good but has a cheap quality and feel to it.</li>
            <li> This product fit the bill, and I have been satisfied with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it works great, great for travel and economic, is only required to buy rechargeable batteries with charger</li>
            <li> and so far it works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my husband and so far I must say it works great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe to the touch, light weight, and there&#x27;s no pesky cord to worry about</li>
            <li> I really like it good buy....</li>
            <li> Fair quality for the price, trimmed my bear really well and made a difference in my grooming rutines</li>
            <li> does the job the nose hair trimmer works well, reasonably priced good job wahl</li>
            <li> get yourself a Phillips Norelco if you really want a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> Right out the box to my face!!</li>
            <li> this kit is excelent is complete and too good, and the shipping was excelent all the description is right, very clear and the quality is perfect</li>
            <li> Works nice, price is right...</li>
            <li> IT IS SHARP AND FITS MY HAND PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li> Trust me, it&#x27;s worth it! :)</li>
            <li> This is a great deal at the price, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and it pinches your hairs a little on its lowest setting.</li>
            <li> This is the 2015 version of the first beard trimmer I ever bought more than 24 years ago!</li>
            <li> trimmer is the perfect size for trimming your beard, neck, bangs, sideburns and let&#x27;s not forget some man scaping on the chest, pits, or other hairy areas.</li>
            <li> starters, this thing rusts easily.</li>
            <li> and I would easily compare it to a plug in model.  </li>
            <li> Well nice , love the fact it is very well made.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The 3 preset length guides are really easy to put on and take off, and the compact size and storage rack make it really easy to keep out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i like how easy it is to use them</li>

            <li> I bought this beard trimmer because I had a regular size Wahl clippers that worked great for my head, but wasn&#x27;t impressed with how it handled trimming beards and figured I&#x27;d buy something made expressly for that purpose for a little more precision.  </li>

            <li> perfect for timming my little 5# doggie</li>
            <li> It is rather cheaply made (as others have said), but it works great and does not pull my facial hair at all.</li>

            <li> Great for male hygiene.</li>
            <li> After using a Phillips Norelco All In One Grooming system for a decade, when it died I thought I would give this cheap option a try.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s so cheap.  </li>
            <li> I use cheap cvs batteries.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, this is the cheap option, so your not getting a luxury trimmer.</li>
            <li> and it work good and have had many different trimmers, and</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as the one I have at home (also a Wahl) which is rechargeable and is better overall in quality.&lt;br /&gt;However for a travel unit</li>
            <li> but always comments that it doesn&#x27;t cut as good as the old one did.</li>
            <li> good complete set.  </li>
            <li> Great product - worked better than expected</li>
            <li> /&gt;The old adage, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; holds especially true for this product.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> they work good so far, don&#x27;t like that they run on batteries.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product originally; however, the company Wahl went above and beyond to help me out and replace my trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Very handy.. total value for money</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and tims well.</li>
            <li> Very economical and practical.</li>
            <li> The instructions included are very useful as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this devise to be very useful.</li>
            <li> Great value for those of us who have facial hair and like to stay clean and neat.</li>
            <li> but I got the exact same one (this one) and it works great, love that it&#x27;s wireless</li>
            <li> Very good for a battery operated device, not as strong as the regular cordless/rechargeable ones but is much lighter and can be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li> which is surprising because Wahl usually makes good products</li>
            <li> They come with a nice bit of accessories an are pretty powerful.</li>
            <li> To now have an extremely quick and easy (painless) alternative to tweezers, I am grateful.</li>
            <li> I loved the first I purchased so much, I went ahead and purchased another.  </li>
            <li> Just got my new Wahl Cordless trimmer and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> I liked it, it is just as described, i would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anybody looking for a cost effective trimmer set.</li>
            <li> I find it much more convenient to be able to slip in a new battery than worry about keeping it charged.  </li>
            <li> Nice blades and very nice small accessories.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m aware that this is a $12 product</li>
            <li> WHEN I PLACED MY ORDER, THAT IS WHAT I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT, AND THIS ITEM REQUIRES 2 AA BATTERIES.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for &amp; I am not disappointed</li>
            <li> Even if it breaks within a year it was still worth the $10!</li>
            <li> (I bought it originally for car camping and overnight take</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long story, and we had a great relationship but the fateful night we used this trimmer on her bearded clam is a hellish incident I don&#x27;t wish on anyone.</li>
            <li> Other than not being sure how to put in that batteries, it seems good for the price so far so good</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, he loved it but apparently the nose hair trimmers didn&#x27;t work/</li>
            <li> This product really isn&#x27;t worth your money!</li>
            <li> my original review appears below *</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working great for the beard, eyebrows, and just minor trim here and there.</li>
            <li> I use it for my sideburns and eyebrows weekly, still on the original set of batteries.</li>
            <li> At first I was really impressed, but after the first use, it lost the power it initially had.</li>
            <li> Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend you skip the first part and just move on to better things.</li>
            <li> While everything else about this product is fine, all the different size trimming replacements and the nose trimmer works fairly well, the fact that it yanks out hairs so often makes this product 2 out of 5 in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> it is a great little package,  I will post more if I run into any problems.</li>
            <li> The price is great on this little gadget and my husband seems pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product from a company that has been around a very long time.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite things, lost mine during Super Storm Sandy &amp; couldn&#x27;t wait till I was able to get a new one,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m clean shaven now.</li>
            <li> The price of this trimmer was fantastic because before I purchased this product I checked the prices at the so-called Super Stores and I could not find one cheaper</li>
            <li> This product is great...if you like your whiskers ripped from your face rather than cleanly cut.</li>
            <li> TO GET clean result ,have to try it again and again.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product that&#x27;s worth its value.</li>
            <li> This is a good cheap set of clippers for someone who has a short beard.  </li>
            <li> response directing me on how to routinely clean and oil the clippers.  </li>
            <li> that said, i wouldnt rely on this to clean me up for a business trip.</li>
            <li> Not only good for my face, but keeps my dog&#x27;s nether parts free from Klingons</li>
            <li> I thought maybe Wahl&#x27;s quality had deteriorated as have so many products in the age of corporate greed at the expense of any kind of customer service or satisfaction.    </li>
            <li> I liked the last model better....  </li>
            <li> keep the exterior of the cutter clean.</li>
            <li> I use the brush, SUPPLIED, after each use to clean the blade and cutter exterior.</li>
            <li> The Wahl brand for the last thirty years has provided by far the best (and cheapest) mens shaver.  </li>
            <li> I got this because I needed something to clean up my side burns/back of the neck between haircuts.</li>
            <li> Either his barber would trim it up, or he would try to clean it up with his razor, which did not work as well as he had hoped.  </li>
            <li> use the brush to clean it up after use.</li>
            <li> and I wanted something to clean up.  </li>
            <li> This set seems very sturdy and I loved the stainless steel tips.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, very reliable, does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very cheap, very reliable, does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY LIGHT AND WORKS VERY WELL</li>
            <li> The machine looks pretty good so far!</li>
            <li> For the price you&#x27;re not getting anything special.  </li>
            <li> I could not be more satisfied with this economical, practical and complete grooming set!</li>
            <li> Good enough to keep most of my beard trimmed but certainly wouldn&#x27;t cut it off if need be.</li>
            <li> great product, exactly as advertised, would definitely recommend it to anyone who asked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to win any power contests, but you just need a small motor for most</li>
            <li> Not much use yet but works great.  </li>
            <li> A great gift for the man in your life whether it&#x27;s a family member, friend or significant other.</li>
            <li> This in my opinion is a true value.  </li>
            <li> Cool product works well</li>
            <li> Overall good.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is really cool</li>
            <li> Works fairly well, but not as well as prior model made in Illinois, as this one was made in China.</li>
            <li> He really likes how he is able to change the clipper part of it.</li>
            <li> but overall a good product for the price IMO.</li>
            <li> I should have probably read the description of the product more closely, however the product does get the job done really well and does meet the expections of trimming beard</li>
            <li> I use my full size corded for that.  </li>
            <li> really like Wahl as a company and will probably look to see if they have a more robust model before changing brands.  </li>
            <li> All the necessities for a good haircut when the style is short.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re going to try this trimmer, keep it far away from moisture of any kind.</li>
            <li> cool product....very durable</li>
            <li> The trimmer is of solid design and good material.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a place in the holder to put the ear/nose hair trimmer, but overall a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I trim my beard fairly close, using the fourth click out of five on the slidable blade guard.  </li>
            <li> Ok, get real, a booger cutter plus a sideburn/beard trimmer for 10bucks!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Returned for full refund.</li>
            <li> Nice complete kit.</li>
            <li> only good thing is that all components and attach work.</li>
            <li> Cool beans were found with this item.</li>
            <li> I like this set, it cuts good and batteries last longer in it than advertised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed it a solid trimmer, good feel and</li>
            <li> Brought this for my dad as a Xmas gift and he loved it especially the nose shaver that came with it.</li>
            <li> Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad by.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the bargain price, and it does the job, as needed.</li>
            <li> Not a bad offer for $10 anyway.</li>
            <li> clogs up very easily, even with new batteries</li>
            <li> :  Unless this thing breaks down within a year, I think its a great choice for light trimming needs.  </li>
            <li> Cuts very well and is light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Replaced my worn out trimmers I confident these well be a good as the previous Wahl.</li>
            <li> But if price is your main factor this one works just fine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking after your first use easily.</li>
            <li> The guides are easy to use and change out, the trimmer itself is easy and doesn&#x27;t pull, and the extra tools help out too! :)</li>
            <li> Great gift for men, young or old who like the day stubble to clean shaven.</li>
            <li> attachments work fine, and the smaller trimmer is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still kicking after almsot 2 years and still sharp great product.</li>
            <li> Other than that everything was great.</li>
            <li> I am using Wahl products from long time and happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;These are really and cheap and best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My other trimmer was great; it felt substantial in my hand and did the job well.  </li>
            <li> Other then that its a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> its exactly what i was looking for work fine</li>
            <li> Fine for the price after the first trimmer was replaced because it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for a quick neck shaved.</li>
            <li> Got here quickly and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Batteries do go quickly</li>
            <li> Item was shipped quickly and came as described.</li>
            <li> I primarily purchased it for the beard trimmer but was also pleased with the nose hair clipper...so far.</li>
            <li> Just once for a quick edging up of my beard.</li>
            <li> I think these are used for a quick shape up.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is extremely powerful and yet gentle on the face and with so many attachment</li>
            <li> In this case, the price to pay for style is cheap however loud the product. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> It gets the job done quickly and without fuss.</li>
            <li> Obviously, at just over ten dollars this isn&#x27;t going to be the best trimmer one can purchase.  </li>
            <li> While this trimmer isn&#x27;t perfect, the quality of the trimmer and results are on par with a much more expensive trimmer (like $40).</li>
            <li> This thing eats batteries, and quickly doesn&#x27;t cut hair, but just pulls it out.</li>
            <li> Not motivated enough to try to get it replaced, but I suggest spending more money and getting something better.</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked OK for trimming my beard, though it took maybe twice as many passes as my last rechargeable model</li>
            <li> Great price, and comes with absolutely everything a man needs to trim both facial hair, ears and nose too.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Luckily it broke in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position.  </li>
            <li> otherwise you&#x27;re still better off spending a couple more bucks on one that has a internal rechargable battery</li>
            <li> However, it rusts quickly when taking into the shower.  </li>
            <li> This one was quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Handles my beard and eyebrow trimming needs adequately.  </li>
            <li> battery operated so don&#x27;t expect anything extraordinary.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s about 20 years old, was a lot more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This shaver does a quick efficient job for me.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t perform adequately either.</li>
            <li> Being both mustachioed and bearded, I don&#x27;t need much attention from a trimmer, but this package is more than adequate and worth twice the price.</li>
            <li> Providing the nose trimmer and marketing it as a bonus would be more meaningful if it actually worked; it does not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super affordable and does what it needs to for my uncle, who I gave it to as a gift.</li>
            <li> Minus the battery fit problem, the trimmer does a good job.</li>
            <li> have not tried those other products, so it&#x27;s possible they are really excellent as well, but honestly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to me worth it to pay twice as much for the name</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good just what i expected to be, really love the this and the shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> Other than that, the trimmer is perfect as far as the performance is concerned.</li>
            <li> but it works ok on people hair that is not thick.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because I got exactly what I needed for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I have only used it about 6-8 times but the batteries don&#x27;t seem to die real easy</li>
            <li> But overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works on a AA battery, which lasts a good, long time in this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Another &amp;#34;well known&amp;#34; brand name that has entered the great swirl and vortex down the drain and into oblivion.</li>
            <li> maybe the only cons that I found the comb which coming with it is vert sharp but who cares about it since the trimmer is working very good :)</li>
            <li> Great product minus the fact that the trimmer does not have very much power.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a very cheap but easy to use hair trimmer for basic maintenance go for it...</li>
            <li> Having had a rechargeable trimmer previous to this one, I welcome a trimmer that you have to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> Wow these are amazing for my first pair Trimmers.</li>
            <li> Works really well as an easy beard trimmer...</li>
            <li> gift was exactly what he wanted for Christmas thanks amazon for comin thru when I needed you the most</li>
            <li> you are looking for an inexpensive trimmer that does basic trimming, this is a pretty good trimmer for the cost.</li>
            <li> Wahl is a pretty solid company, so I knew I was in good hands.</li>
            <li> The trimmer feels solid in your hand and obviously is pretty well made - surprising given its price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I have not had a single issue with it, and, like a good book, its</li>
            <li> you are looking for an ordinary, cheap, completely run of the mill trimmer than Wahl is your best bet.</li>
            <li> First, you have to remember that this is a beard TRIMMER!  </li>
            <li> and really does the job for me!!</li>
            <li> but for 9 bucks works really well!!</li>
            <li> Your key to better looks!</li>
            <li> I use the shortest clip to shave my balls and my wife really loves it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for free fast shipping (I always select Super Saver Shipping)</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR KEEPING BEARD CLOSELY TRIMMED AND GETTING IN TIGHT PLACES AROUND MUSTACHE AND GOATEE.</li>
            <li> Works fine, really like the AAA batteries.  </li>
            <li> very nice and less than walmart</li>
            <li> great little trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li> the little nose hair accessory is great too.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a great little shaver that doesn&#x60;t eat batteries.</li>
            <li> Great little machine for the price.</li>
            <li> Overall, the shipping was fine, I was able to get it in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a person who can afford a slightly better shaver, but I guess if you&#x27;re looking for something to use occasionally and not on the face, this works fine.</li>
            <li> Trimmer was fine and appeared to be a good purchase for a few months</li>
            <li> If you like to closely trim your facial hair instead of shaving totally bare clean, this is great.</li>
            <li> With the batteries, it is lasting longer and the trimmer is very good compared to the rechargeable trimmers at the same cost.</li>
            <li> was a gift, everything works just great and is useful for everyday, the plastic caddy has compartment for each tool.</li>
            <li> The guards are cheap plastic but easy enough to use, change, and clean as needed.  </li>
            <li> This is a powerful unit and my husband likes the accessories.</li>
            <li> Nice combination of low price and all the function you could want.</li>
            <li> Works Great, the batteries are lasting longer in this one compared to my old one.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor.  </li>
            <li> WELL worth the money.  </li>
            <li> has a powerful motor  </li>
            <li> I have had several trimmers but this is well made with a nice even trim.</li>
            <li> I WENT OUT AND PURCHASED A FRESH SET OF AA ALKALINES AND INSTALLED THEM PER THE MANUFACTURERS INSTRUCTIONS.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is surprisingly powerful, considering it runs on just 2 AA batteries.  </li>
            <li> Good to have, works as expected.</li>
            <li> but if the batteries are fresh (using duracell batteries so no excuses)</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t complain when I exited the bathroom freshly manscaped and nose hairs gone.</li>
            <li> ... was broken but the people were wonderful and issued me a prompt refund</li>
            <li> I really expected more from a prominent brand like Wahl.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> With fresh batteries, this thing has the energy of a slug.  </li>
            <li> Switch o Big trimmer is kind of touchy  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t take an regular AA battery you have to buy the really nice ones.  </li>
            <li> It was well worth its price.  </li>
            <li> I recommend that for a useful tool to trim beards, noses and ears, this is worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> really worth for money</li>
            <li> more offers like this.</li>
            <li> I use rechargeable batteries and honestly I have not had to recharge them yet, although I only use the shaver about once a</li>
            <li> Anyway, he is really pleased with it &amp; it does more than he expected.  </li>
            <li> So far I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if somebody could have verified it actually worked before reselling it.</li>
            <li> It is plenty powerful.  </li>
            <li> so it isnt worth the time or effort to pack it and drop it off.</li>
            <li> So far, almost a year later, it is still working great.</li>
            <li> its worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is not as powerful as a corded razor</li>
            <li> and this works better than the old Wahl trimmer I Had.  </li>
            <li> Okay only because it was so cheap.  </li>
            <li> Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My old one was better.</li>
            <li> for the price it is worth it</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Powerful trimmer and works well.  </li>
            <li> Replaceable batteries have far more power then any of their rechargeable units.</li>
            <li> But for 10 bucks if I get a year out of use it seems worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> My last shaver was also Wahl and I liked it.</li>
            <li> Lots of useful extras.</li>
            <li> Like most trimmers, these are not really heavy duty and are not meant years..  </li>
            <li> It is much more powerful than my old Remington one that had a chargeable battery.  </li>
            <li> but i will probably use it as a 5 guard once grown out that far, and if it looks ok at that length</li>
            <li> Also there is a nose hair trimmer that is quite useful.  </li>
            <li> Now, with straight, spiky, gray facial hair, scissors do not do a good job.</li>
            <li> This product worth for the price.</li>
            <li> I do like the nose and ear trimmer which is almost worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> I am pleased so far.</li>
            <li> That being said, I can say thus far I am pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> Execellent product with the worth of price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice &amp; working properly.</li>
            <li> This item is as simple as they come and they offer it in a cost effective package.</li>
            <li> Can even cut your own hair short if desired.</li>
            <li> Works nice, if you&#x27;re looking for something at low price and usefull you should buy this trimmer</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the return.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li> Worth what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> If it lasts a year then it will have been worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product (old and new).  </li>
            <li> One improvement over the older model - and this is GREAT news - the trimmer does not &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; batteries when not in use for a week like the older models did!“We want teachers to have an open conversation about bullying in their classrooms,” she tells Yahoo Parenting.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m left with a product that is worth nothing but to be thrown in the garbage!!!</li>
            <li> It just putters out right away, and fresh batteries don&#x27;t help. ??</li>
            <li> Perfect for the normal groom a male needs, and a female steals to also complete :)</li>
            <li> Like most everyone I&#x27;ve had many battery operated devices and never had this problem with any other.</li>
            <li> Drains battery pretty quickly</li>
            <li> The price was excellent  and based on my last purchase of Wahl beard trimmer about 10 years ago, I&#x27;m assuming the quality and long term use will be the same or better.</li>
            <li> until now the cut hair machine have a good function, is recomended to other people that would like to buy it</li>
            <li> OTHER ATTACHMENTS ARE GOOD FOR TRIMMING HAIR.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim as good as other Wahl products, thinking about returning</li>
            <li> Though good trimmer, it has sharp cutters which some time cause irritation and burn.</li>
            <li> They also put out power very well for high-drain purposes, and do not self-discharge significantly.</li>
            <li> said good bye to other machines</li>
            <li> Other wise its all right but</li>
            <li> I turned it on heard the noise and it went right into the dumpster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some comments about how it will pull the hairs right out of you.  </li>
            <li> What I did not expect however was the rusty blades which seemed to rust just right after the return window expired.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any of the pinching or snagging that others had right up until the day it died.</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for...did NOT work right out of the package.</li>
            <li> Does what it says and he says it cleans right up with water as instructions indicate.</li>
            <li> No way to repair it, went right into the trash.    </li>
            <li> ; So you&#x27;d guess that the product is made in the US, right?</li>
            <li> Works well and was priced right.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this and had to return it for a refund as it didn&#x27;t even work right out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> getting clogged right away&lt;</li>
            <li> Oh, that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> Overall, a professional quality product at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> These devices, like virtually all else that runs on AA batteries, will will work brilliantly and long on standard eneloop rechargeable NiMH cells... which cost about $2 each on amazon and which will each take 1500 charge cycles.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT LITTLE TRIMMER FOR THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> Cheap substitute of high end Trimmer</li>
            <li> Well worth its very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to have brand new batteries or it won&#x27;t trim very well.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I mostly bought this when adding items to get above $25 for super saver</li>
            <li> Not only did this set arrive quickly, my husband is quite pleased with how well this trimmer works.</li>
            <li> I have been using mine for close to a month now almost daily, and the batteries are still going strong, the blade is still sharp, and even the nose hair trimmer is working great.  </li>
            <li> Pretty powerful for a battery operated device.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a Wahl Peanut razor and love it, so I had some brand loyalty when I needed a razor that I could use outside the United States without having to plug into different types of sockets.  </li>
            <li> The longest guard on this thing barely leaves a beard at all, slightly more than stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaved my face and revealed my true self, much to the chagrin of people I know.</li>
            <li> This kit does a great job of helping me with my excessive hair problem and the batteries seem to have a nice long life.</li>
            <li> It holds a nice long charge also on the battery.</li>
            <li> He used it right away and likes it very much.  </li>
            <li> Good product, it does what it claims got rid of my beard in a few minutes highly recommended cheap and useful</li>
            <li> Better off paying a little more for a razor that works.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more money for a better trimmer, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have used this little trimmer extensively, and have found it to be excellent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m getting rid of this and paying a little more for a much better product.  </li>
            <li> Still going strong after more than a years use every other day.</li>
            <li> My first reaction was to throw it in the trash right then</li>
            <li> Pure awesomeness!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to worry about charge levels or cords when traveling, easy enough to pickup new AA batteries if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, but does ok.  </li>
            <li> Great item especially the different face hair trimmers.</li>
            <li> This clipper does a good job, but it&#x27;s much louder than I would have expected from Wahl.  </li>
            <li> It trims relatively close or as much as you want without giving you any kind of problems.</li>
            <li> It feels and operate cheap, and it makes to much noise and the vibration in my hand to much.</li>
            <li> its plastic and lightweight, plus it runs on batteries so its great for traveling, especially on shorter trips or trips with multiple stops where u may not have an outlet for awhile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an easy clean and simple to use.</li>
            <li> Got here super fast</li>
            <li> So if you only intend of keeping a short beard or stubble, this is a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Worked great especially for such an inexpensive trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the worse on line purchase I&#x27;ve ever experienced!</li>
            <li> , I bought a wahl as a back up, cheap trimmer, and its become my primary trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> An Instructional Manual for different hair cuts would had been great to include with the package for people like me who are starting to learn how to cut hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for their quick services &amp; shipping</li>
            <li> Very loud, and cheaply made..</li>
            <li> I used to have the older $10 Wahl special, It was a workhorse, not fancy but got the job done</li>
            <li> The other  attachment personal trimmer is very good and does the job well.</li>
            <li> Thank you all very much.</li>
            <li> recommend this Wahl trimmer and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Does the job well and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> And very reasonably priced as well</li>
            <li> Compact and very much what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping</li>
            <li> very light, battery operated and quiet.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be working fine, so far.</li>
            <li> it got rusted a little bit after 2 weeks, but the power is good...</li>
            <li> Its ok but thst wasnt wat I expected, it doesnt really clean ur nose</li>
            <li> Better set that other trimmers I&#x27;ve spent more for, and haven&#x27;t come with nearly as many attachments.</li>
            <li> and I am very impress with what I got,more important how well the trimmer work and also the nose hair trimmer and would highly recommend this product for purchase.</li>
            <li> The new one doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good as the older version of the same product.  </li>
            <li> probably because they are battery powerd, which is why I bought them in the first place.</li>
            <li> They rip the hair off my face and have since the first time i used them.</li>
            <li> low power, could be better</li>
            <li> but I need more gaurds, these are way to short</li>
            <li> This is not professional grade equipment, but for personal use (and at this price) it really is a great value</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had to replace an old Remington recharchable trimmer that I used for beard trimming and detailed trimming as part of my haircuts.  </li>
            <li> but low and behold, I was just in for the first of many surprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll step up to a better model which I hope will last longer than six months.</li>
            <li> I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> Worked wonderfully the first time, then was unable to ever use it again.</li>
            <li> Shaves pretty close when I work the details.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find that the trimmers used   AA batteries instead of the larger size battery in my old Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> my beard is gonna look fresh from now on haha</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> The one problem I have had is that my beard hair tends to be pretty course</li>
            <li> NEVERTHELESS, IF YOU ARE FOCUSED ON A BATTERY OPERATED TRIMMER, BE AWARE THAT THE BATTERY IS NOT INTEGRATED.    </li>
            <li> I brought this as a back up because I keep losing the charger for my better set.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Basic trimmer, works okay, requires a battery.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using such trimmer, and I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Broke the first use.</li>
            <li> will gladly purchase again if necessary</li>
            <li> I have been using this Product for the last two weeks and have been pleased with it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li> This is my first 1 star review in Amazon.</li>
            <li> During first use itself without the plastic I could sense some bite on my skin.</li>
            <li> No hangups, no pulling hairs, the guide lengths are consistent.</li>
            <li> this is the first trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li> Not expensive and does the job.</li>
            <li> Not only do they replace the product if it breaks, but the warranty goes well beyond what most companies offer.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This is the first cordless trimmer that I have owed.</li>
            <li> Had the same model for over 5 years but the plastic guard I use most wore out.</li>
            <li> Worked alright the first couple times I used it.</li>
            <li> I was willing to gamble and it paid off.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I mostly used it for facial hair trimming without any of the guards on.</li>
            <li> Make sure you oil your blade properly!</li>
            <li> There are better ones at a higher price range, but these served me well for THREE YEARS at it&#x27;s current price.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a month and use it at least twice a week, still using the first set of batteries and it works great.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use the attachment for my bows and that works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was  looking for.</li>
            <li> There are many different types of motors these trimmers can have and this model has the weakest.  </li>
            <li> the ear nose and brow trimmer had issues at first.  </li>
            <li> When working, the blade area gets pretty hot after just 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> so I imagine its great since he hasnt complained about it to me.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is a TRIMMER which is the &amp;#</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really quite powerful.</li>
            <li> ♦ The trimmer is pretty light--being almost all plastic, but it fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews said these were cheaply made, but I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> and I am still on the first set of batteries.  </li>
            <li> It does cut very well at all!</li>
            <li> goes through batteries to fast and doesn&#x27;t cut worth a darn.</li>
            <li> Opposite problem with the nose trimmer, you better be hercules to get the battery cover off of it.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer works okay for a low priced item.  </li>
            <li> not heavy, the switch is on the side and it just feels comfortable in my hand when I trim my mustache.</li>
            <li> Whal were willing to replace it</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement of another Wahl trimmer I had that finally died after many years of use.  </li>
            <li> [ I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit that the first one I bought had a picture of Richard Karn (Al from Home Improvement)</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Died the first week -</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold the battery tightly enough any more to run.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deafeningly loud and extremely cheap, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spend the extra money for better quality.</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed and as described.</li>
            <li> Its light not to loud.</li>
            <li> Then broke within first week.</li>
            <li> First time I went to use it, it wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Prime Shipping made this a real bargain!</li>
            <li> for the first month or two.</li>
            <li> Had a similar razor Conair and I like this one much better</li>
            <li> The company remains steadfast to its roots by providing professional quality products.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s no luxury beard trimmer, and occasionally, it tugs at my hair.</li>
            <li> Needed a cheap trimmer and have always liked Wahl in the past.</li>
            <li> He just grew his first beard</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe Wahl puts their name on this product but then most likely the Wahl brand name was sold to some investment company years ago</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer didn&#x27;t run when I first installed the batteries.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that you can spend a better $10 for a male grooming product.  </li>
            <li> When I first attempted to use this in my nose, it felt as if I were using tweezers.</li>
            <li> but it does the job, and it does it the first time.</li>
            <li> It comes with everything i needed, and the cradle held everything pretty well.</li>
            <li> Was willing to over look that.</li>
            <li> This product performed exactly as it was designed to</li>
            <li> It rusted over within the first week</li>
            <li> pleased overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this trimmer a couple times and for the price, I guess it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d shop around more next time.</li>
            <li> And the only reason I have to call this the &amp;#34;second-best&amp;#34; razor is because it has more parts than I know how to work with.</li>
            <li> The nose/brow trimmer is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I use it pretty infrequently.</li>
            <li> The first lasted years.  </li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a brief period of time after I was able to find batteries for it</li>
            <li> Use it to fix up my facial hair mostly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband needed.</li>
            <li> I am pretty dissappointed</li>
            <li> It is clearly made of cheap plastic and was made in China.  </li>
            <li> My step-father has this exact Wahl set</li>
            <li> I should have looked for a more robust and solid built unit.</li>
            <li> A few good smacks against my hand remedies the problem, but</li>
            <li> The new one has much more power and the blades vibrate a lot quicker than the old one.  </li>
            <li> Purchased new Wahl trimmer in White in addition to Black one already owned and still in excellent working order</li>
            <li> He says that it is pretty powerful and precise and only cut him once his first time using it.</li>
            <li> The blade is sharp, cuts close, and leaves me with no stubble, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s any danger of it catching skin or yanking out hairs.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend if someone in your life needs an affordable first time trimmer!</li>
            <li> Way better than my previous wired one, still works with the original batteries I inserted six months ago.</li>
            <li> If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to have a thick beard, which is why I am not spending more money on a better beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> This are powerful and very well made, I practically did my whole head with with the beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Appreciated the bonus trimmer which only made it a better value for the dollar.</li>
            <li> For it&#x27;s price, I can say it&#x27;s well worth it for anyone that is searching for something on the cheap side of things, while at the same time being a product that can get the job done.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this little trimmer set.</li>
            <li> I have found nothing special about this trimmer and would not waste my money on it again.  </li>
            <li> This product is cheaply made with low grade plastic, but it works and it&#x27;s priced right.</li>
            <li> Spend a little bit more and get something made far better.  </li>
            <li> the positive side, it does what you need.&lt;br /&gt;Takes about 8 minutes to get the job done to my satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> a positive note</li>
            <li> But all in all a decent product, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always pretty much done the trick.</li>
            <li> I was considering a more expensive one, but needed 11 bucks more in my order to get free shipping.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great, but I&#x27;m only going to give is 3 stars due to the faulty switch.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t come with many long clippers.</li>
            <li> I do find it useful from time to time in trimming hair, and it does a much better job than I could do any other way.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t long before I was able to trim again.</li>
            <li> good for small trimming.</li>
            <li> As a very wise English person once said \\&quot;I am not rich enough to buy cheap things\\&quot; -- I wish I listened to him instead of Amazon.com reviews..</li>
            <li> Does a fine job, sharp blades, comes with oil, nice size in the hand, plenty of cutting power, great for sideburns &amp; moustache...</li>
            <li> It is kind of odd</li>
            <li> Nice set of accessories but not a high-end machine (which is something you should expect when paying anything less than $50).</li>
            <li> the trim guides are easy to put on and off of the trimmer even after over a vear of daily use.</li>
            <li> After that it started to sputter and be less effective.</li>
            <li> My facial hair then was curly, and it was easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item strongly for personal hygiene..  </li>
            <li> had I not thrown it against the wall, shattering it out of pure frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pure junk.</li>
            <li> Works just to trim ends on large beards.</li>
            <li> I used it one time to trim certain areas.</li>
            <li> Pure junk.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful when buying this product because of the positive reviews I&#x27;d read.</li>
            <li> The holder isn&#x27;t really all that effective or useful as it doesn&#x27;t have a spot for the small rotary trimmer or all of the length guards.</li>
            <li> The attachments from the old one don&#x27;t fit onto this new version, the blade is wider.</li>
            <li> But I would happily buy another one of these at less than $10 instead of a $40 unit next time I need a trimmer.</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked fine for the first few trims, even though the included adjustable guide doesn&#x27;t really work, the fixed length guides work OK.  </li>
            <li> I bought a new trimmer right away.</li>
            <li> Works fine for the price, and seems to last !</li>
            <li> Have used several weeks &amp; battries are still doing fine.</li>
            <li> Most personal shavers cost much more than this and come with less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice, and it  does a fine job trimming my beard and neck.</li>
            <li> Both trimmers worked fairly decent for about the first 5 or 6 times.</li>
            <li> but it seems pretty decent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little kit, and being on batteries makes it portable</li>
            <li> This is a nice little kit.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little trimmer set.</li>
            <li> I love that this trimmer just uses plain old AA batteries which can be easily changed, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about having it plugged in to the wall all of the time.</li>
            <li> So, it serves a purpose, and does a fine job, and it definitely was was worth it for the modest price.</li>
            <li> works well, alittle hard on batterys but good for the price</li>
            <li> very durable</li>
            <li> Dont know how much time this will survive</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer worked really well.</li>
            <li> Aside from the cheapish construction, its held up real well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Wahl one to replace a similarly cheap Vidal Sassoon branded trimmers that finally died.  </li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that the Wahl was much easier to nick yourself with accidentally.  </li>
            <li> I decided to keep it anyway, and just be more careful than I&#x27;d had to be with the Vidal Sassoon</li>
            <li> Well, if you nick yourself many times because of a nicking-prone trimmers, even if you&#x27;re careful about cleaning the wound and antibiotic ointment each time, eventually statistics might let an infection take hold.  </li>
            <li> thanks charles petruzzi.</li>
            <li> the plus side, it&#x27;s a very inexpensive set that includes anything and everything you&#x27;ll need to trim your beard, goatee, van dyke or</li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> the nose trimmer works really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely purchasing another one to replace it.  </li>
            <li> It does the job well, but its a longer process than it really needs to be.  </li>
            <li> i itch too much, but i didn&#x27;t want to spend much as i will shave by summer  </li>
            <li> I really think it costs them $1 to make this item..</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> I wanted to try growing a beard and didn&#x27;t want to put too much money into a trimmer if I didn&#x27;t like my beard.    </li>
            <li> This product was shipped fast...</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> These trimmers seem to work very well....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that much.</li>
            <li> Is this really a Wahl?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfectly capable of taking care of a goatee, but as I&#x27;ve been moving toward a full-face beard, it&#x27;s leaving a bit to be desired.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t trim the edges very well</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive and very portable trimmer and found this.  </li>
            <li> The included nose-hair trimmer also works very well.</li>
            <li> ( use GENTLY on the neck)  </li>
            <li> I also use scissors but these help out so much.</li>
            <li> I trims really well.</li>
            <li> but it seems to work for a reasonable amount of time considering the price.  </li>
            <li> haha..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> he was very upset.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really</li>
            <li> like really?</li>
            <li> If I leave fresh batteries sitting in the clipper, they nearly die within a week.  </li>
            <li> Not as much power as a corded item would be but very acceptable.</li>
            <li> For $11-12, you really shouldn&#x27;t be expecting too much.</li>
            <li> we couldn&#x27;t really trim my hair.</li>
            <li> I hope the trimmer has a much longer lifespan.</li>
            <li> Does everything specified and more than expected.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful as a beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> However, unless that day comes before a year&#x27;s use (hopeful much much longer), my review will stand.</li>
            <li> works very well</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re really pressed for money and need something compact and convenient, this may be for you.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is very efficient for the price.</li>
            <li> and it was ready to go.</li>
            <li> the batterie don&#x27;t run out fast either.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much from this beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> It started to rust out all ready.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer works very well</li>
            <li> The overall quality as in material and weight it what you would expect from a cheaply priced trimmer.</li>
            <li> bottom line is it works better than expected and for the price it can not be beat.  </li>
            <li> makes more noise than expected.</li>
            <li> Got this one because it is straight battery powered.</li>
            <li> I really think it costs them $1 to make this item..</li>
            <li> or it will rust fast.</li>
            <li> Although the battery lasted me the whole time i had it, i don&#x27;t like the fact that it is not rechargable.</li>
            <li> It cuts hear really well without the attachment.  </li>
            <li> The cordless with built in batteries run out of juice too fast.  </li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> Very convenient to take on the road.</li>
            <li> I had to get a more expensive Philips Norelco to do the job, but I really can&#x27;t complain at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Closer cut than my wahl plug in unit, and the nose hair trimmer cuts the hair without too much discomfort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nowhere near as powerful as the Remington.</li>
            <li> very hand..good product</li>
            <li> hahaha</li>
            <li> It is also really just battery operated</li>
            <li> But if you do buy this one, just an FYI that it isn&#x27;t really the one for haircuts.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Very well.</li>
            <li> Fast in Brazil.</li>
            <li> fast shipment.</li>
            <li> On those occasions when I do need to charge it up, it doesn&#x27;t take very</li>
            <li> /&gt;This stopped working very soon after I got it.</li>
            <li> In the minute that I used it, this thing pulled out as much hair as it cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, light weight, and simple to use.</li>
            <li> Nose and ear trimmer doesn&#x27;t function very well at all.</li>
            <li> it really does.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but for the price I paid it works really well.</li>
            <li> The 5-position guide only goes to 1 setting and doesn&#x27;t feel secure.</li>
            <li> Compared to the rechargeable Conair I had owned for years, the Wahl cuts much faster and without any &amp;#34;whisker pull&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> so I can not say to much never use</li>
            <li> Wahl stands behind their equipment almost forever, so it made a great gift for my friend.</li>
            <li> the product works really well</li>
            <li> Much better in fact, than what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, very snaggy on my beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, but only where it counts!</li>
            <li> Very convenient.  </li>
            <li> thank you soo soo much.</li>
            <li> thanks much</li>
            <li> Plastic, very plastic</li>
            <li> Also, the build quality is much better than expected, so  I expect them to keep working.</li>
            <li> They feel solid, yet light.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really thinking about the battery issue when I bought this.  </li>
            <li> I am returning this one also and getting a real trimmer.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also very noisy and applying a drop of oil doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I tried out both and both trimmers work really well.</li>
            <li> It is really a value for money.</li>
            <li> hahahahaha...</li>
            <li> Thanks arrived on time and works well.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job very well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain much considering the price.</li>
            <li> The Wahl shaves much closer to the skin.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t cut very well</li>
            <li> The nose clipper doesn&#x27;t really work very well.  </li>
            <li> IT STRAIGHT</li>
            <li> works well, does the job, inexpensive, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Batteries die fast</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Cons - The guides and stand are very chintzy/flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Item works really well.</li>
            <li> Does everything it supposed to do very well</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really pick up on the &amp;#34;battery operated&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for this price</li>
            <li> I got this because I saw that it has the nose and brow trimmer, but unless you&#x27;re alright with still having visible nose hairs, the nose/brow trimmer really won&#x27;t be of much use to you.</li>
            <li> This part is very important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was free second one I&#x27;ve tried!!!!!</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t as much clipper size guards as we would like.  </li>
            <li> my only concern is that it started to sound funny (Loud noise) after 15 0r 20 minutes of use on my first try, i wont use it till like a month after, but i hope this doesn&#x27;t become a problem.</li>
            <li> I bought based on price and should&#x27;ve just spent $10-15 more.</li>
            <li> is rusting a tiny bit and feels cheap but trims like a dream!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I just tried it out and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> What I really like is the simplicity so that you can take around anywhere you go without bothering about the weight nor the electricity.</li>
            <li> Bought for my bf, works very well</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a bit more... nimble and seemingly effortless</li>
            <li> I REALLY don&#x27;t know what to do or may be trash</li>
            <li> For anyone who wants the info - 3 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> It also goes through batteries to fast.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s really taking a toll on my wallet going everyone week or two.</li>
            <li> The blade doesn&#x27;t seem to be calibrated very well, it pulls at the hairs.</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage, it stopped working after a month.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the packaging is protective.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say here.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Its a shame because it cut really well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> shipped fast</li>
            <li> They work better that I had expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> works well and does not take up much space.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much of it</li>
            <li> and I like all the attachments needed for a trim or a really close grooming.</li>
            <li> Really like the nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is very Durable and holds up to the humidity in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I don’t really have the time to go through any hassle in returning it.</li>
            <li> so I guess I cannot expect too much.</li>
            <li> However, being cheap in design and quality has been the only thing I can review.</li>
            <li> But it is much handier and lighter than the plug-in Wahl.</li>
            <li> It works very well  </li>
            <li> i bought this for my son and he hasn&#x27;t really used it much</li>
            <li> but it seems to do what it say very well.</li>
            <li> It will not do much on ear hair; I have another trimmer for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quality product for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> it works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> The cutting power isn&#x27;t all that great it won&#x27;t go through thick hair very well, it kind of more pushes it out of the way</li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer is even more of an energy vampire, and it will completely kill a battery left in it for a week.  </li>
            <li> I am an adult male whose hair grows everywhere but on top of my head, this trimmer helps me maintain a neat appearance of the rest of my head.</li>
            <li> Good product and every one should try it at least  .</li>
            <li> Wahl offers many different models and I chose this one because I was also in the market for a ear nose and brow trimmer and this came with that as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The different razor guards are nice but not necessary unless you want a shorter cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been at least 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve bought this item, and have loved it ever since.</li>
            <li> Nose trimmer is nice, but the razor quits after a few shaves, GET A RECHARGEABLE RAZOR.</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s not 100% safe, and cutting yourself inside a nostril is a good way to get a MRSA infection.</li>
            <li> When I saw that the battery replacement was as much as this new trimmer I figured nice to have a new one for the same price as the battery for the old one.</li>
            <li> However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own.</li>
            <li> Easy to use though, maybe a little pinching if I go to quickly.</li>
            <li> I followed the cleaning instructions in the book completely yet right as I lifted the plastic cap off of the device I was treated to some unwelcomed brown spots.</li>
            <li> Nose trimmer broke after very few uses and can only be used if I keep the  battery cover off and jiggle the battery into place just right, but shaver works well and is still going strong after many months.</li>
            <li> Uses alkaline batteries so no frequent charging needed, batteries easily replaceable.</li>
            <li> I only need to trim once every other week or so, but the battery life seems good for me.  </li>
            <li> I had a strange experience with this one: When I first received the product, everything was fine, except for the bonus trimmer, which just wouldn&#x27;t work even with a new battery.</li>
            <li> however it is batterie operated, just make sure you keep a set of extra batteries because you will need them shortly after your first trim.</li>
            <li> last awhile - Used a dozen times on original batteries</li>
            <li> Overall though, I did receive the order promptly and on the attempt to originally return the product as the image shown was misleading to where it did look that you could have the capability to trim hair with (since I did not have the money for the haircut)</li>
            <li> A lot better than any other trimmer that I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like this brand more than other at home brands I have used.</li>
            <li> so far so good it will depend on how long batteries last</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and not powerful at all,..</li>
            <li> Several attachable blade lengths  Plus a nose/ear trimmer this will clean you up.</li>
            <li> other combs and the both other trimmers are great.</li>
            <li> However, the motor does get loud if you are using it for a long time, so before you turn it on, make sure you have an idea as to what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is decent but drains batteries fast.</li>
            <li> Simply clean with brush and oil provided and item will last.</li>
            <li> It actually worked than I had expected very pleased.</li>
            <li> ♦ The thing that surprised me the most is how long it stays charged.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing little trimmer!  </li>
            <li> This is just good for trimming down some of the bush so that the blades don&#x27;t get clogged constantly when I use the Fusion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product, the only down fall is that it is battery powered.</li>
            <li> works great, the shaver guard trapped and pulled hairs initially, but seems better behaved after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The product offers a lot of bonus attachments for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> but I  should have spent a little more money and got a better one .</li>
            <li> easy to store and carry, good cutting power</li>
            <li> I bought it mostly for an ear &amp; nose trimmer but really like the fact that there is a beard trimmer included with several different trimmer heads to control length.</li>
            <li> It does the basic job of a quick facial hair clean up.</li>
            <li> I bought this two babies along a CONAIR full size trimmer and ended up not using the big fella&#x27;.</li>
            <li> good things come in small packages and even better when the price was small too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will consistently and frequently pull hair.  </li>
            <li> First off, this thing is loud.</li>
            <li> The attachments are very difficult to get off of the razor, but aside from that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Nice small trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems pretty reliable so far.</li>
            <li> This very inexpensive Wahl did better than my three times more expensive Norelco.</li>
            <li> It is also pretty loud.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is powerful enough and it&#x27;s actually a benefit to use rechargeable AA batteries in this compared to a cheap built in NiCad.</li>
            <li> A small bottle of oil is also included, and has its own spot in the stand, along with slots for the comb and cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re just an average joe like me, then there is no need to spend more money, this gets the job done every time..</li>
            <li> Works well for shaving down there :)</li>
            <li> I recommend it for something small quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Had this for 4 years, still like new!</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new trimmer!</li>
            <li> It was cheaper to buy a new trimmer than replacing the guards!</li>
            <li> Mind you, not a top notch, high quality, buy-it-for-life trimmer, but damn nice for $10.</li>
            <li> Hard to open, but still a great product for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve apid more and have gotten less.</li>
            <li> Much better than my previous one.</li>
            <li> I must recant a previous review of this by me,the clip is adjustable,from the metal guide, seems sturday,Im pleased with product</li>
            <li> This particular trimmer kit is not a wall charger device, it operates off of batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to manual trimming with scissors for now while I look for a worthy replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to compete with a professional clippers however for light and simple grooming</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not buy this beard trimmer if you are older than 14.</li>
            <li> I had a older Wahl  trimmer and hair cutter worked for 10 years</li>
            <li> For the money it is a decent buy.</li>
            <li> However, after receiving this particular model I used it once.</li>
            <li> They are decent clippers for cleaning lining up the hair.</li>
            <li> for the money decent deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older rechargeable unit.</li>
            <li> The nose/ear trimmer works decently well</li>
            <li> perhaps someone wanted to use this particular trimmer as a torture device?</li>
            <li> I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Batteries last several months or more.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pinch or cut and gets hairs close to skin (not to be confused with a straight razor but good for what I need).  </li>
            <li> I mainly use the beard trimmer and it does</li>
            <li> This is a decent product.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;free&#x27; nose and ear trimmer were used once and the 2nd time, it sounded like an old car rattling.  </li>
            <li> * Does a decent job</li>
            <li> Not that anything more expensive is that much better.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t work on steady speed since day one...</li>
            <li> This makes it simple and quick to maintain with the 3 guard lengths.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, but gets the job done quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works decent, however the included nose trimmers broke after one use.</li>
            <li> I have a 4 year old cheap Chinese knockoff i bought in Bangkok that still works and is not rusty.</li>
            <li> recommended to anyone that needs a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a decent trimmer.  </li>
            <li> However, the main shaver does not.</li>
            <li> Seems to have a pretty strong little motor.</li>
            <li> And, it is very loud and too fast.    </li>
            <li> really well for the price was very surprised.</li>
            <li> The on off switch has a &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; undocumented middle setting of super high speed.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap option and don&#x27;t have to shave every single day, I would grab this set.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very light and feels cheap and most importantly, does a terrible job of trimming.  </li>
            <li> But only one bad blade in like 4 sets of these at this point, perfect gift and the nose trimmers are sweet</li>
            <li> good for weak hair, it wont cut my beard ...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for the price it was listed.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> Wahl came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended gift for the man in your life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recomended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly as it is probably</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this trimmer too highly...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to someone who is looking to give this as a gift to someone else who needs to &#x27;tighten&amp;#34; up their look . . .</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> We received the trimmer just as promised and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wahl is known for high quality products, this is no exception except as a battery operated product it has no power as a beard trimmer, nose trimmer works though I give it that.</li>
            <li> After 1 MN working it smells like burning and the noise is really really high</li>
            <li> so I will keep it anyway as it&#x27;s a fairly high quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, even though he doesn&#x27;t f****n deserve it and should have it jammed so far down his throat</li>
            <li> For less $11 this seems to be a great deal, especially with the nose trimmer being a completely different unit from the beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect muchfor the price, I was very surprised as it works better than my much more expensive unit.</li>
            <li> I love the little caddy that comes with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use the nose hair trimmer as I have a little grooming tool I like better</li>
            <li> But...the guards could be a little better.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job well worth the small price.</li>
            <li> the cutting abilities aren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> The first batteries i put in were cheap, so i upgraded to quality batteries with little difference.  </li>
            <li> and I found it to be more then capable of trimming my large and thick beard.</li>
            <li> felt cheap and wasnt what i expected.</li>
            <li> Louder sound then expected</li>
            <li> Great for hair, beard and even those weird nose and ear hairs.</li>
            <li> batteries have to be jammed into case with a hammer...very cheaply made (in China of course).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was cheap and, therefore, I&#x27;m not going to try and return it for a partial refund.</li>
            <li> Spend a few more dollars and get one that doesn&#x27;t cause pain while using.</li>
            <li> Cuts ok, to about a 4 star level but basically feel like i wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> This set is worth double what you pay for it.</li>
            <li> Not the most heavy duty</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;He has not complained about batteries, so he must like it .</li>
            <li> I wondered if being battery powered would be powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can get these locally at pretty much the same price.</li>
            <li> Even if it only lasts a year well worth it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even worth sending it back!</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as my commercial clipper, but it is cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be enticed by its low price - it isn&#x27;t even worth the inexpensive cost.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am debating purchasing another one just to have its so well worth it.</li>
            <li> Battery operated so it&#x27;s only so powerful.  </li>
            <li> I have always stood behind wahl as being a superior product.</li>
            <li> I recently had a tremendous downsize in my personal economics, so I am used to the higher end models.</li>
            <li> better than my previous trimmer by far.</li>
            <li> far better than previous ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> the thing isn&#x27;t strong enough to cut my facial hair...</li>
            <li> how is broken the top part keep pop or shoot out lucky it never shoot in my nose</li>
            <li> hey, remember, it&#x27;s only $10, right?</li>
            <li> Be right back...</li>
            <li> It trims very even and the guides fit tight.  </li>
            <li> fine, no reason to buy a more expensive product.</li>
            <li> My son has a similar product and it worked fine with the same batteries</li>
            <li> The bonus hair trimmer is also of decent quality (although I&#x27;m not sure how one would effectively be able to use it on eyebrows).</li>
            <li> However, it does do a pretty decent job, although, occasionally it will pull a hair or two.</li>
            <li> Let me start by echoing other users&#x27; reviews: the plastic that this trimmer and its accessories are made with feels extremely cheap.  </li>
            <li> Same as old trimmer, pretty much.</li>
            <li> The construction is cheap, which maybe can be forgiven due to</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars due to the fact its so cheap and works like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Brand new batteries and</li>
            <li> Had a trimmer set but lost the charge cord and couldn&#x27;t find a new one.</li>
            <li> New batteries of course, about each year.</li>
            <li> MISTAKE, the new one can&#x27;t cut evenly and the attachments for beard length are a joke.</li>
            <li> so you can adjust the length as desired, however the new one has three attachments set at predetermined length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I placed a new battery in turned it on and it worked for 5 minutes made a noise and has not worked since.  </li>
            <li> He had not had a new kit like this in years.  </li>
            <li> So when I decided to get a new trimmer I got a new Wahl Trimmer -</li>
            <li> Went to use one morning and it would not work, changed batteries (brand new) still would not work.</li>
            <li> BTW the new products work as I hoped.</li>
            <li> and then it stopped working, even with new batteries it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I NEED NEW ONE</li>
            <li> It just died so got him a new one.</li>
            <li> WHAT HAPPENED, did the company run out of new products and sent returned items from their warehouse slated to be refurbished.</li>
            <li> (I saw a YouTube video and took it apart to solder in a new battery, but it was a pain, and the clippers were still so-so.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Replaced with brand new batteries</li>
            <li> Even will completely new batteries, I couldn&#x27;t trim or shave anything.</li>
            <li> I put new batteries but it still will not turn on.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d get a new one, thinking that Wahl might have solved the problem.</li>
            <li> I even went to buy brand new batteries, and they wouldn&#x27;t even cut on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and unlike some other products, it&#x27;s not too heavy and stores easily.</li>
            <li> You gotta be very careful while using this product, it is not so smooth on the skin, i wont blame it on the product, well,</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the motor is loud but other than that excellent product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a battery powered shaver as opposed to rechargeable and this is really the only one i can find.  </li>
            <li> It was cheap enough and I only wanted something to keep up with manscaping...</li>
            <li> Sad to see a great, old mid-western company manufacture their products in China rather than Ohio.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s able to trim and maintain his facial hair with minimal tugs...</li>
            <li> I bought this for personal grooming, the machine is so loud giving the illusion of it being powerful.</li>
            <li> The main design flaws are a) the outer blade housing is prone to rust; and b) eventually the built-in battery completely dies.  </li>
            <li> Super limited battery life.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, got it the next day.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are very loud.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very complete product</li>
            <li> It was awesome but disappointed when this package didnt come with eyebrow attachments</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big investment but believe me, you get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li> My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years.</li>
            <li> The batteries don&#x27;t sit in the trimmer properly and the trimmer worked once, the first time I put batteries in, then never worked again.  </li>
            <li> Another thing was - the first beard trimmer worked well, but the second one was tugging on my stubble - and avoiding that was what their ad was all about!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to dwell on it, so I just sent the replacement back, and kept the first one.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly as usual from amazon and this i was pleased with.</li>
            <li> This set works like a professional one!.</li>
            <li> I considered, but declined to buy other more expense, name-brand trimmers such as&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> My fiancé struggled to trim his facial hair even without a guard...had higher hopes for this product...disappointed</li>
            <li> i bought this for edging and trimming my sideburns at first, but i used it to shave my entire head</li>
            <li> I rated this so low because since the first day the product didn&#x27;t even work with fully battery.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a small problem in operating it as the battery contacts weren&#x27;t touching the batteries.</li>
            <li> Batteries are better because usually we run through trimmers because the irremovable battery stops keeping a charge.</li>
            <li> Works for nearly every beard grooming task I need!</li>
            <li> It simple cuts better and closer than the other brand.</li>
            <li> the 2 smaller guards broke the first day</li>
            <li> He looks clean and sharp for work.</li>
            <li> the manual states: keep the blade clean and oil every other month or so - no worries</li>
            <li> Likes: stainless steel, high quality blade; long-lasting lithium ion battery; fairly quiet to use&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:</li>
            <li> I got this beard trimmer for my cousin who was needing a new one after his old one quit working.</li>
            <li> so I could put this new old in it.  </li>
            <li> ♦ The sound is moderate--not quiet, but not loud.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality, battery doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made batteries don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Very vague instructions on how to use the eyebrow and moustache accessories, but it trims very close and looks great for the beard.</li>
            <li> My partner is very satisfied and says it works well, only complaint is that it&#x27;s noisy but at the price, that&#x27;s acceptable.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty loud and occasionally will pull a hair instead of cut</li>
            <li> I wish there was a size between the longest fitting and the next one down...</li>
            <li> I got a little water on the blades, but wiped it off with a towel and figured it would be fine.</li>
            <li> The ear and nose clipper is just too weak to be effective.</li>
            <li> it was waterproof,  but so far have not had any problems keeping it dry around the sink &amp; tub!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the $10ish price, it&#x27;s worth it if you want a cordless trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the blade&#x27;s initial ability to be adequate (only one week of use at time of review.  </li>
            <li> I have a large bin of chargers in my garage and did not want to add another &amp;#34;unknown&amp;#34; in the future.</li>
            <li> They feel a little cheap and are a bit noisy, but I don&#x27;t see that a problem given what the product is.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get one that actually works.</li>
            <li> Frankly, the little nostril trimmer is worth the price of the whole set</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to press the rotating blade a little too firmly against your nostril to get a good cut.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting your manhood or ladyhood lol</li>
            <li> Beard trimmer is great for pulling hair but not for cutting it.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much power this trimmer has only running on two AA batteries!</li>
            <li> and it is abundantly clear to me now.  </li>
            <li> After using this one time it has completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> Since it uses AA batteries there is no need to have a cord lying around like my old rechargeable one.</li>
            <li> They burned my 5 year old grandson, and an elderly friend of mine, as well</li>
            <li> This thing trims very well, and has been used about once or twice a week for the last year, so it holds up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also recently ran into an issue with the nose trimmer on/off switch doing whatever it wants.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for the low price...</li>
            <li> The blades feel like they&#x27;ve been made with the cheapest steel from an old clunker in China..</li>
            <li> Not too loud though.  </li>
            <li> works well, trimmer is loud.</li>
            <li> Gift for Adult grandson.</li>
            <li> The speed at which the trimmer operates really surprised me</li>
            <li> It is a bit loud, but does the intended job of trimming.  </li>
            <li> I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED, THIS PRODUCT ONLY WORKED ONE TIME.</li>
            <li> Wow, was that a mistake.    </li>
            <li> bit loud</li>
            <li> Just remember to use a safety clip/position guide (included) and not use it directly.</li>
            <li> My husband is really picky about his personal grooming item.</li>
            <li> FINALLY THE WHOLE DEAL, AND WORKS WELL</li>
            <li> He has been using his old Beard Trimmer for over 10yrs.</li>
            <li> took my old one that was still working and trimmed my puppys face and around his eyes and also did his feet in between groomings so that I could see to cut his nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll likely get tossed and replaced very</li>
            <li> It is a bit loud however.  </li>
            <li> This product is complete garbage.</li>
            <li> I have used this product only once, but it served its purpose very well.</li>
            <li> A bit of a power hog, requires fairly frequent battery changes.</li>
            <li> I did keep the old zipper case the old one came in</li>
            <li> Have not had any issues so far.</li>
            <li> I was extremely surprised at the power or speed that it has.</li>
            <li> For the price it hasexcededmy expectations so far.</li>
            <li> As far as the quality of the trimmer, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> but the fact is it was an absolute chore to get it to actually trim my beard.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be too loud to use near my ears.</li>
            <li> just  completely stopped.</li>
            <li> This was the reason I replaced my old trimmer, and yesterday they had it on sale on Prime day, so I bought it for about the price of this one.</li>
            <li> I put in batteries into the bonus ear trimmer and it came on instantly, not thinking much of it, when I went to turn it off, the switch would not work</li>
            <li> To the point that while using it just the movement of my hand would pull the battery door open, leaving me with two pieces in my hand, and really ruining the grip I had on the device.</li>
            <li> Only real downside</li>
            <li> I can tell so far by just looking at the product, is that it does not come with batteries (do people even include batteries with products anymore?)    </li>
            <li> Lots of improvements over his old one.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems so far.</li>
            <li> He has used this several times and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a well priced trimmer that does the job but loud when in use.</li>
            <li> Took old batteries and put in flashlight and they worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this especially because it is battery operated.</li>
            <li> old.</li>
            <li> So if your looking for a reasonably priced trimmer that will do the job I would definitely give this one a go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my beard lately</li>
            <li> I did and the young lady that I spoke with</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not adjustable enough to get real gradations.  </li>
            <li> Thought it does do the job, I miss my old one, because it was a beast</li>
            <li> So far I cannot find fault with its function.</li>
            <li> It does catch/pull occasionally when going too fast.</li>
            <li> Really loud, so plan around others sleep.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> Every piece is marked &amp;#34;Made in China.&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> I havent had a problem with them so far.</li>
            <li> Not sturdy enough for much else.  </li>
            <li> Everything else is like his old one that he likes.</li>
            <li> but the value far exceeds the price.  </li>
            <li> B000B9SFQG 3310-230 Wahl Blade Oil Professional Blade Maintenance by Wahl Professional Animal]]</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see Wahl put their name on this.</li>
            <li> Yes, not as loud.</li>
            <li> I got it and frequently cuts out.</li>
            <li> When I was a young man, I let my beard get as bushy as I could stand it, using scissors to maintain a good-looking appearance.</li>
            <li> This does the job it needs to, I&#x27;ve heard no complaints so far from my fiance.</li>
            <li> Batteries stay charged for a long time and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the merchandise.iwill suggest this product to any of my friends who need a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> My old Wahl trimmer</li>
            <li> I only use the smallest guide comb for my beard; and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints at all, so far.</li>
            <li> After 2 shaves it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> So far he has no complaints.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR CASH.</li>
            <li> A bit loud</li>
            <li> Yes, I completely missed the &amp;#34;cordless battery operated&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Wow, it works.  </li>
            <li> This replaces a 15 year old trimming kit.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll spend a few extra minutes longer than you&#x27;d expect to make sure you got all the hair trimmed that you wanted to.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> The nosetrimmer seems to run slow but that&#x27;s better than&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wahl provided good customer service when the clipper failed after three months.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed at all...heard nothing but good things about this product</li>
            <li> Used on my beard today for the first time - thick and full hair - cut through w/ no pull or snag -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, anyone still buying and discarding alkaline batteries deserves poor performance.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husbands birthday in January, he took it out to use it for the first time last week, after trying several new batteries in it, the darn thing would not work.</li>
            <li> Comes with a cheap little stand, plus some decent different sized guards.</li>
            <li> After the first use I was very pleased in the performance of the large trimmer, not so much the small trimmer which I found basicly useless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a sensitive skin, but there are red spots allover due to the cheap material.</li>
            <li> This little hair trimmer is so powerful my wife has used it to trim my hair to even it up and neaten my hair !</li>
            <li> As said in other reviews, the batteries don&#x27;t fit right in the nose timmer, and I find it quitting until I give it a little shake.</li>
            <li> THIS APPLIANCE IS SMALL AND EASY TO USE.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad but the noise trimmer does not work from day 1, and the blades on the clipper looks to be getting rusty in less then a month.</li>
            <li> I use it for little trims to clean up a bit around mustache.  </li>
            <li> Cuts are pretty easy and it&#x27;s not as heavy as other model I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> The shears are super sharp!  </li>
            <li> The attachments work very well, but take a little getting used to at first.</li>
            <li> The Wahl quality far exceeds the last 2 Remington sets I had, and will surely last much longer, 2 yr. warantee!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t turn on at first until I jiggled the batteries in their seating, which also seems loose.</li>
            <li> The little gimmicks for limiting the depth of cutting have been to guys with beards the most terrific and simple ideas of great value to men.</li>
            <li> used only the main trimmer.  </li>
            <li> does the main trimmers get only 1 star?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent set for as low priced as it is.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t spend the extra $10 or so to buy a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> I finally found a trimmer w/ attachments at a decent price.</li>
            <li> The excellence you expect from one of the finest grooming product companies, at a very reasonable price, I have had several rechargeable trimmer sets...and they only last so long, this one was priced right at around 10$, and I have rechargeable batteries anyway, which can be changed.</li>
            <li> a little cheapy, but not bad</li>
            <li> At first, i kinda hesitate to buy this because i couldn&#x27;t believe the price for this whole set was less than $10!</li>
            <li> right length cutter heads which my other did not have, at 3 times the price.</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers are right, who said that this trimmer is noisy.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for several reasons.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as expected and was purchased at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> If you want a high quality product that will last forever, then consider this a 2 star.</li>
            <li> While Amazon&#x27;s return process if simple and proved to be hassle free the one time I used it previously</li>
            <li> The batteries lasts long, meaning the trimmers consume not too much energy.</li>
            <li> cheaply made and way too small.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well for behind your ears, back of your neck, and touching up all areas.</li>
            <li> The other nice thing about no cord is that you can shave those extra hairy places in the shower or wherever (wouldn&#x27;t do it with the shower on though); thus not making a mess on the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> everything I expected and works very well!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that is would be nice if the included stand had holders for the attachments and extra trimmer.</li>
            <li> am a lifetime beard grower, and have had many different trimmers, and I happen to by a Wahl one day, and its outlasted all my other big name trimmers, and i totally mistreated it and abused it, and it still trims like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Quality is much higher then I expected.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> and I do strongly recommend that you do get long lasting batteries to operate this as it will be beneficial or get rechargeable batteries as it does drain the battery faster than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> considering how much comes in the small package, but what I do use, I like very much.</li>
            <li> As with most older men, I seem to be growing hair in all the wrong places and losing it where it&#x27;s needed, this little kit takes care of the first half of my poblem just fine.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new trimmer with various attachments and ran across the Wahl brand at Amazon.</li>
            <li> The new trimmers was same model # and features.  </li>
            <li> After trying 4 sets of different new batteries I found some that worked.  </li>
            <li> nose trimmer does not have enough power even with new batteries.  </li>
            <li> Takes personal hygiene to a new level</li>
            <li> I clean my unit with isopropyl alcohol, and it&#x27;s not very effective.</li>
            <li> better said dull ! ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super powerful.</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t remember the exact time span, but it was long enough for no concerns to arise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In hindsight I should have spent a few more dollars.</li>
            <li> I certainly won&#x27;t be buying this brand again and will save up a few extra bucks to get something with a little more quality and durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Wahl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The beard trimmer on the other hand shaves quite well - I&#x27;m not too particular about a smooth shave as long as its low enough to be neat and looks well trimmed.</li>
            <li> works very well for the money, gave it hubby as a gift he like it not as strong as other wahl i have use in the past</li>
            <li> looks like the blade are not sharp</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve had a Philips before and its internal rechargeable battery doesn&#x27;t last long, and it isn&#x27;t as powerful as the Wahl.</li>
            <li> But for the price, the few times it gives me that minor discomfort can be easily</li>
            <li> Well worth the little bit of money.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it takes multiple passes on the same area to get decent results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Am surprised a major name company would produce such an inferior product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must be in the minority, as it is generally getting 4 stars, but I found this to be a steaming piece of dog poo.</li>
            <li> I generally use it without the guides to get a close trim around my neck line.  </li>
            <li> So much for the batteries don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely steer clear of here-</li>
            <li> and so far I have not had the same problem with this one.  </li>
            <li> Use frequently since purchased 8 months ago and running on same batteries.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned the entire unit with a soft brush and compressed air and re-assembled it.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this worked for just having regular AA batteries.</li>
            <li> nose trimmer doesn&#x27;t go up my nose far enough to trim hair.</li>
            <li> This version only uses two batteries as opposed to the three for my old one.  </li>
            <li> Have only used trimmer for sideburns so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this gets slightly jammed on thicker parts of my beard, but the real dissapointment is the massive&lt;br /&gt;waste of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No regrets, and not considering purchasing a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; trimmer at this point.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a couple of times so far, but I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s pricing for this complete grooming package simply cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a really old WAHL trimmer that finally just stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Professional quality grooming products at a ridiculously low price.</li>
            <li> I just replaced the old chargable Wahl model I had for twenty years finally gave out.</li>
            <li> I have used it only twice so far</li>
            <li> I am going to contact Wahl directly and will report back if they uphold the 2-year warranty ONE day before it expires!  </li>
            <li> Barely gets through one use</li>
            <li> after using it just one time 3 days later the metal part was all rusty, it is not stainless, i regret not searching more about this product, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> normally battery operated trimmers don&#x27;t last me but months, but i am no on the second year with this.</li>
            <li> But because I had thicker than normal facial hair it did not cut properly as I had hoped however the pieces that were said to be in the package were there</li>
            <li> Not very sharp..</li>
            <li> Blade sucks, runs out of batt in minutes, does not have the right size of attachments that normal shavers have.</li>
            <li> It got broken right after first use.</li>
            <li> It would not be good to get shocked by a cord when you have a very sharp metal razor right near your face.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I grew tired of shaving, so with this I can quickly shave in the morning without loosing much time.</li>
            <li> I typically just use it for a few minutes at a time, so I don&#x27;t keep it plugged in; nevertheless, it still stays charged for many days.</li>
            <li> Expect a few errant shaves that might require a trip to the barber shop anyway to fix it before you do start to get it right.  </li>
            <li> Dead on arrival right out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> I know you get what you pay for typically, but this really takes the cake!</li>
            <li> And i kept comparing with other brand, fancy looking, and of course evaluate the reviews as much i appreciate.</li>
            <li> You have to go much slower than other razors would allow, but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> This shaver shaves very close and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> I really like that trimmer, and it lasted for almost 2 years before it really started to dull.</li>
            <li> The comb heads have to be sort of forced down onto the clippers and they are very short, way shorter than I liked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with sort of naturally curly hair .Its</li>
            <li> The noise is loud enough to be heard outside the bathroom.</li>
            <li> My old one occasionally would when the batteries got very low, but this one has not at all.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not going to bother to send it back to get fixed since I only paid like $15.</li>
            <li> im socially acceptable</li>
            <li> replaced an earlier model that was broken from being dropped too many times</li>
            <li> I mean I don&#x27;t like a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> It is a replacement of an old one that has been dropped a few times and had a hard time running any more.  </li>
            <li> If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty simple, so I guess there&#x27;s not a lot for them to mess up.</li>
            <li> Apparently the packers didn&#x27;t want to waster the proper size box</li>
            <li> Once I finally got it it barely runs.  </li>
            <li> Also arrived early and did not have to wait to long.</li>
            <li> Only detraction - apparently they changed the model of the nose trimmer</li>
            <li> Sturdy construction, useful extras, and it comes with a small container of oil for the blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and yet powerful.</li>
            <li> It small but powerful for a battery powered device.  </li>
            <li> The main drawback is that is sucks that battery life up fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, tough and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> the blades just seemed to dull really quickly.</li>
            <li> Its not super high end, its made of cheap plastic, however its hard to complain when you get a bonus trimmer all for around ten bucks.</li>
            <li> I know it is cordless, which sounds convenient, except the battery cover is difficult to keep in place, especially if you think you are handy enough to turn it on with one hand as you push the switch up, the battery cover comes back and off.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law bought me a rechargeable Wahl that was so dull that it pulled even short whiskers, and this battery operated Wahl is killing batteries way too fast, one decent trim</li>
            <li> item was as described and new in package, was definately what i expected and would definately buy items from again</li>
            <li> The plastic blade combs are hard and a bit uncomfortable to use; the combs are fairly difficult to remove and replace and doing so sometimes will remove the entire blade which then has to be re-inserted; the 1/8&amp;#34; comb (smallest available) does not get it down to stubble level, it would be nice to have an even smaller comb; would be nice to have a storage unit for the trimmer and of the accessories</li>
            <li> Does the job, but not quite as fast or comfortably as a previous model this replaced.</li>
            <li> Barely used as it was only used for trimming eyebrows and back of neck once.  </li>
            <li> I was curious why there was a pretty wide range of prices for these trimmers</li>
            <li> but I Think it is a little small, bigger is better</li>
            <li> My old one had a narrow, straight blade, and it took a long time to do the job.</li>
            <li> Ear, nose trimmer is just OK, a little underpowered and hard to get correcy battery contact.</li>
            <li> Blade on trimmer was a little bent but didn&#x27;t really affect anything.</li>
            <li> Batteries wears out a little too fast for my taste but does the job its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I tried brand new batteries, then other batteries, to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive because i didn&#x27;t actually see the real thing</li>
            <li> not too bad does what it says works good</li>
            <li> The clippers are okay, the nose trimmer stopped working after about a few months (and no, I don&#x27;t have thick nose hair that clogged it up or anything  </li>
            <li> Just give me something that trims my hair down so that it look normal, not like I intentionally shaved.</li>
            <li> this replace my old one that just plain got old</li>
            <li> I have two new batteries with no success.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this slid off the top of the toilet tank where I&#x27;d rested it and onto the tile bathroom floor, and exploded into about five pieces.</li>
            <li> particular model comes with a few attachments, all necessary accessories, and a convenient stand for the bathroom to hold everything.</li>
            <li> doesnt work well, tangled my facial hair on first use as if the blades were dull.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping for a decent device, my expectations weren&#x27;t high, I mean for what I paid, but I mean come on</li>
            <li> It loses power very fast.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had some longer guides though, as the longest one leaves my hair only about 2 or 3 millimeters long, which is just barely long enough for a short beard.  </li>
            <li> As for the storage base, while its made of very cheap, thin plastic, it holds everything nicely and helps keep your bathroom sink well organized.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether you use, alkaline, dry, lithium, etc, for the type of battery you use it will last about the same hours of use.  </li>
            <li> The Wahl trimmer has much more power and is alot less irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long it will remain sharp, but so far it is doing as the product description said it would.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I prefer the simplicity of two AA batteries, which last a long time in this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time and don&#x27;t have to deal with another charger.</li>
            <li> the product did not last long it stop working within in 4 months would never buy this item again for my husband</li>
            <li> it will not last long at all.</li>
            <li> However, after 2 Norelco products bricked (stopped working for no apparent reason), I decided it was time for a change.  </li>
            <li> long lasting batteryen  trims my beard and thins it out when needed.&lt;br /&gt;The nose and ear trimmwe works</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> the batteries last long also.</li>
            <li> maybe the blade is not long enough or sharp enough just doesn&#x27;t work well as others.</li>
            <li> The only difference is the amount of charge based on long term storage of the batteries</li>
            <li> Last long with the batteries</li>
            <li> I am just wondering how long the batteries will last.</li>
            <li> It runs such a long time without changing batteries.</li>
            <li> Contrary to what I have read, the batteries last a long time it does trim the way I like it</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time, too.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re reliable, the charge lasts long enough to trim hair and beard.  </li>
            <li> Felt that it doesn&#x27;t hold the battery charge long enough.</li>
            <li> Feels like it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed but would cost more to send it back that the product is worth!  </li>
            <li> The old one has on attachment that slides up and down</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaint about this product other that I wish there was more little organizer slots for everything it came with.</li>
            <li> The teeth are very thin and chips easily if you drop your clippers from short distances (from your bathroom counter to the rug on your bathroom floor...</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was a very solid little unit.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is exactly what I was looking for, it runs on batteries and is small enough to get into tight spaces but big enough to so</li>
            <li> Very poorly made, rips hairs out instead of cutting them, buyers beware,  spend more and get a better quality.</li>
            <li> Still, for ten bucks, it&#x27;s hard to complain too much.  </li>
            <li> We thought maybe the batteries were dead and changed them three times (with brand new batteries) and it STILL won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> the batts don&#x27;t last very long...</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time on two standard AA batteries, too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a huge expensive, state-of-the-art razor because I was only experimenting.</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s talk about packing: The beard trimmer is &#x27;blister packed&#x27; with the typical clear plastic shell around it.  </li>
            <li> trimmer stop working less than 6 months old</li>
            <li> After she left I tried the clippers on my own beard, um, on my face mind you because I&#x27;m a guy, but anyway, yeah it sucked and was quite painful.</li>
            <li> When I saw that, I was afraid the batteries wouldn&#x27;t last more than a couple of trims.  </li>
            <li> but my 1 yr old son has hidden it from me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is one of their selling points, but I dropped it in the toilet</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the beard trimmer does a significantly worse job than my Wahl 79300-400, which just costs a few dollars more.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the limited amount of length adjustment pieces, but still gets the job done for a short beard.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected and not as much power not satisfied</li>
            <li> for its price-performance value.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful, useful for small trims, as reviewed previously.</li>
            <li> I happen to by a Wahl one day, and its outlasted all my other big name trimmers, and i totally mistreated it and abused it, and it still trims like a dream, thank you</li>
            <li> I ultimately went back to various Wahl trimmers, yet they all gave out (battery, motor, etc) in less than 2 years.    </li>
            <li> most of what ill write has been stated in other reviews, but here u go.</li>
            <li> con: its loud  could have been a little quieter.&lt;br /&gt;pro</li>
            <li> Surprised with all the little extras that came with my order.</li>
            <li> I just bent the battery contact out a little and that fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> A little loud, but not an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> would buy this same kit again, seems to be holding up just fine so far, nothing bad to say,</li>
            <li> finally contacted the company (duh) and got service for this equipment (very near the end of the warranty date, but that&#x27;s my fault), after which it worked well!</li>
            <li> This, powered by AA batteries leaves me desiring more cutting power</li>
            <li> I reccomend buying this one if you have a long beard and save your money.</li>
            <li> Works well with plenty of power, long battery life.</li>
            <li> As someone with long hair, and a glorious beard, my girlfriend questioned this purchase.</li>
            <li> you have a long beard,</li>
            <li> I do miss my long beard</li>
            <li> Previously i spent about 45mins to an hour to cut my husband&#x27;s hair with only using scissor, but now with Wahl cordless trimmer, i only spent 25mins with touch up via scissor.</li>
            <li> It is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> In hindsight, I should&#x27;ve spent the extra 5 or 10 dollars to give another brand</li>
            <li> I will say that this thing runs for a long time on a set of batteries</li>
            <li> An it takes a long time to kill the battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit my beard was a bit long - maybe</li>
            <li> Should have bought this a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> After opening the trimmer I discovered that it was completely missing a wire to complete the circut</li>
            <li> Hmmm; It&#x27;s been so long that I have to check if it&#x27;s one cell or two...</li>
            <li> A long time ago I needed to care for my skin</li>
            <li> Trims personal hair.&lt;br /&gt;Should be adjustable without arbitrary length attachments, cost a star.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of it works great, I especially like the fact that its all battery powered, no charging base required to waste a plug and counter space.</li>
            <li> My old set just like this quit working (switch problem) after a few years.</li>
            <li> On the recommendation of a friend, I bought this and have wondered how I got along without it for so long.</li>
            <li> Strange thing, neither the trimmer nor the nose tool worked.  </li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d discovered this set a long time ago and saved myself all the pruning with scissors.</li>
            <li> but batteries seem to last a longer than i expected.</li>
            <li> you have fallen a long way.</li>
            <li> I think I spent ten bucks on this</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> so your range is wide open.</li>
            <li> stand is a bit flimsy - really a minor quibble.</li>
            <li> It will not clear out the brush of the Amazon Rainforest.</li>
            <li> I tried doing slowly and at moving fast, however problem persisted</li>
            <li> Poor build quality and really isn&#x27;t worth the $10 I payed for it.  </li>
            <li> use this to either trim up my facial hair, or if I am going cleanshaven after growing it out to trim everything down enough so that I can use my Gilette Fusion manual shaver for the close shave.</li>
            <li> This certainly is not a recommended product to trim your girlfriends&#x27; private parts, well, ex-girlfriend now.</li>
            <li> Not enough to burn, but certainly not comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels about as sturdy as my previous, more expensive Norelco models.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, simply spinning it along the inside rim of your nostril doesn&#x27;t quite cut it, as you have to get underneath the hair and push slightly up into your nostril to get the hair properly removed.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the issue is but new batteries don&#x27;t fix the problem.</li>
            <li> The Remington would PLOW straight through my manly thick beard without even a hiccup, this thing takes several passes and only takes off a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you are on a tight budget.</li>
            <li> I use it daily to keep a stubble look and for other trimming.  </li>
            <li> I did have a problem trimming my nose hair until I discovered that the small thing was for the nose and ears; WOW!</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of hair trimmers my fiancée or other males in his family will use.</li>
            <li> I use it to keep my pin feathers trimmed - the other penguins and puffins here use it similarly here at the Krill Institute.</li>
            <li> At first I thought that it would be too weak, but it mowed the inside of my nostril with ease.</li>
            <li> Hey, if you only need one of the devices, keep what you need and give the other one to someone else.</li>
            <li> I might recommend going for something a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> No more hairy ears for this old goat!</li>
            <li> I checked and other nose trimmers sell for twice what this entire package cost.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t grow it for very long</li>
            <li> Also Indian, that serious organized and rated for your forwarded the goods permitted according to the new regulations of the Venezuelan Government, which has created an uncertainty in my for the reception of the same.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is still sucking batteries dry, but it functions.</li>
            <li> because if the trimmer batteries go dead I always seem to have Double A&#x27;s on hand for instant use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have experience on how well it will last, but I&#x27;ll only need to use it a few times a month.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> The blade guard is a nice touch, especially if you leave it in the storage base without use for a period of time.  </li>
            <li> At times you will notice the unit slow down and get hot.</li>
            <li> The ear/nose trimmer worked fine, but the beard trimmer never started, which rendered all the other accessories useless.</li>
            <li> The ear/nose trimmer makes noise as if it is working, but it won&#x27;t cut a single hair.</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer uses a single battery.</li>
            <li> By comparison, the Norelco G370 had a single NiCad AA battery that was not intended to be replaced by the user.</li>
            <li> Simply put - fails to work right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> not strong enough the nose trimmer turns on sometimes only used it 2 times</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be clear, this is a small, economy-built, AA-battery-powered trimmer.</li>
            <li> Though some have complained on battery life, I only used it currently for mustache, sideburns and occasional side trimming, so can&#x27;t speak to beard trimming.</li>
            <li> This item is not worth even the low price.  </li>
            <li> Not powerful enough for close shave.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it would be a complete system for all hair needs</li>
            <li> Wow ... unbelievable for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long this trimmer will last but for the price I&#x27;m not too worried as I just need it for basic trimming of my beard.</li>
            <li> It is not worth shipping allllll the way back for a refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly because it takes regular alkaline batteries, and most of the rechargeable ones I&#x27;ve gotten have awful batteries that only last a few months.</li>
            <li> its not sharp enough , it hardly takes off anything -_- ...</li>
            <li> Smallest clip does not clip down real low when using it.</li>
            <li> and i say batteries will last maybe a month if you dont mind the pulling when the batteries get worn down.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought one for myself now that winter is here</li>
            <li> With a little care and minor fixes over the years, they seem to last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cheap  comes with a few attachments  bonus nose trimmer  cons:  cutting blades are really narrow (can&#x27;t go too fast)  </li>
            <li> My previous beard trimmer was a samller version of this product and it lasted me for ten years.</li>
            <li> The trimmer finally quit a week and a half ago.</li>
            <li> Have had similar products that cost less than half the price for about the same level of problems.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer, which was a Remington brand, recently stopped working.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut hair, takes multiple passes to trim anything, and half the time it just pulls the hair.</li>
            <li> Also, needless to say, apparently it doesn&#x27;t cut so much as it tears and rips hair out.</li>
            <li> I read mixed reviews about this product, but after using it regularly for the past 2 months, I have had no issues.  </li>
            <li> Worked for half a second.</li>
            <li> The trimmers last for years - usually until you drop it forty or fifty times and the case finally gives up.</li>
            <li> I use the unit 2/3 per month and Batteries last about year and a half for me.</li>
            <li> Bought as much as anything for the nose trimmer part and that worked weakly for about 2 times.  </li>
            <li> Finally it was impossible to get them to fit correctly</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the batteries do not last all that long, but that is no real problem.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Not a high end model, but we are just using it for a military hair cut.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this review is premature for I have had the trimmer only a few weeks with limited use.  </li>
            <li> &gt;♦ Cutting power is fine.</li>
            <li> you have to mess with it and be careful in how you move it, or it will shut itself off in the middle of trimming.  </li>
            <li> I wish the adjustable head had a little closer cut but all in all for the price you can&#x27;t beat it if you want to we are a real short beard want to keep it neat</li>
            <li> This nose trimmer does not work regualily and does little to actually keep my nose hairs trimmed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little noisy, but so are the larger electric trimmers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Only wish it had a little longer beard length guide.</li>
            <li> While the unit works, even the nest brand of batteries provides clippers that move at a very slow rate, that do not trim your beard very well at all.</li>
            <li> speed varies from very slow to extremely fast</li>
            <li> After shaving this long, a little simplicity would go a long way.</li>
            <li> i am in the military and require to hv my hair in standard all the time so these trimmer give me a option to fix my hair a little bit and save me money at the barber shop</li>
            <li> got this kit, and the functionality isnt Bad, but leave more to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say huge disappointment</li>
            <li> This one is much smaller and for ten dollars it was worth the possibility that it would be a bad investment.</li>
            <li> most painful trimmer i have ever owned</li>
            <li> Of course he told me weeks later so too late to send back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Im not sure how long it will last, have had it for one month and use it to cut my dads hair.</li>
            <li> The trimmer rips hairs from your face, the guards fall off and have too wide of spacing to be of any use.</li>
            <li> Too plastic and not the quality I expected.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected, bear in mind</li>
            <li> He is obviously not very durable .</li>
            <li> A few days later I tried to use it again and it wouldn&#x27;t even power on.</li>
            <li> not meant for rough hair</li>
            <li> It was too much trouble to send it back.</li>
            <li> Then 1 month later batteries are dead.  </li>
            <li> What should have I expected for 11.00 it works</li>
            <li> I purchased this today minus the bonus Nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is not as i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Its a total waste of money</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let this get wet</li>
            <li> Hmm you get what you pay for; do not get it wet.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Still with a rechargeable one.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer sounds like a remote control airplane.</li>
            <li> I come to this prestigious firm AMAZON, with the purpose that I review in this respect of the acquired or make me money back.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> but ..... the blades are not stainless steel so after a 2weeks of using it like every3 days and cleaning it with the brush and some alcohol it started to rust.</li>
            <li> I have shorter hair and this kit lets me trim the rough edges from my sideburns and around my ears so my hair doesn&#x27;t look too shaggy.  </li>
            <li> Not something I expected from wahl</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t comment on durability yet since I have only had this product a few days.</li>
            <li> The contacts were bent out of place so the circuit was not being closed when flipping the switch.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be plug-in rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> It does the job, but I hope it does not die on me in the next few uses.</li>
            <li> They have performed as expected to date.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> It was just as expected.</li>
            <li> -- While they have taken a lot of use, neglect and rough handling over the years of use and travel, they are not indestructible -- tonight I dropped my 5537 on a tile floor and broke the blade.</li>
            <li> It is as expected and it works</li>
            <li> so people with heavy beard may have different experience.</li>
            <li> Product was what I expected for a battery operated unit.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected</li>
            <li> Works as expected, no snags or pulls.  </li>
            <li> One issue, the blades will rust if you don&#x27;t apply oil on them so avoid getting them wet</li>
            <li> I have revisted this a few months later.</li>
            <li> As expected for price</li>
            <li> Not hevy duty, but for the price it is what I expected.</li>
            <li> but it works as expected.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not much of a difference between all three guards.</li>
            <li> however the batteries don&#x27;t  have gone thru a few batteries in a brief amount of time..........</li>
            <li> But yesterday even when using with most gentle pressure this thing gave me a nasty cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised a company like Wahl would build such an poor</li>
            <li> The base stand holds everything nicely, except for the nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> This machine cut my skin and caused couple of bloody spots in my face which should not happen with this kind of cordless battery operated trimmers.</li>
            <li> I got this to trim the dogs fur around their face, not strong enough.</li>
            <li> , it has been a disappointment to me ever since I first took it out of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life was never very long.</li>
            <li> I use Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries (on almost all my battery operated gadgets) and a single charge lasts a long time (a few months) when using the trimmers every other day at home.</li>
            <li> To those other reviewers, of course you don&#x27;t have a salon type product, you spent 10% of what they did and got something that is 75% as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It bogs down on every single pass and comes to a halt --  </li>
            <li> the quality is not very nice and the nose trimmer is totally a jerk start.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very powerful and the metal rusts if you rinse it in a sink.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s how I ended up having to go to the emergency room a few days after one of many Wahl trimmer nicks, plus a 2-week run of unpleasant antibiotics, and followup doctor appointments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once the battery level begins to diminish, the trimmer will &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; at the hair rather than cutting it cleanly, so if you experience that problem, it can be addressed by changing the batteries.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly quality plastic, but it works and that&#x27;s what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I bought this over all other options because of the Wahl name.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> Beard trimmer is not as sharp as it should be.  </li>
            <li> He prefers this trimmer set over the other two he has tried out.</li>
            <li> Using this beard trimmer, I had to take a break halfway through due to my frustration with having the hairs torn off my face.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it does kinda suck that it is battery powered and not able to be plugged into the wall to charge.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day</li>
            <li> I had the other brand trimmer for years.</li>
            <li> Works like any other trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Sharp as can be, Haven&#x27;t had an issue with them yet.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> First sorry I thought I did a review .GREAT</li>
            <li> ♦ Blades are plenty sharp.</li>
            <li> and i gotta say other than being battery operated it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> - I think the blades just aren&#x27;t that sharp.</li>
            <li> but other</li>
            <li> Husband was glad to receive this gift at Christmas as he dropped his other one and broke it. :(</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other users, I haven&#x27;t noticed any pain/snagging and the batteries lasted for awhile</li>
            <li> The other attachments are in a zip lock baggie</li>
            <li> Other than that.</li>
            <li> Have had other trimmers and they didn&#x27;t rust.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on the combs and other accessories.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m waiting for it to arrive, I&#x27;ll pull the other 9906 trimmer out of my travel pack to use.</li>
            <li> Other attachments go into a tray.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t sharp at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted a grooming tool to use on areas other than my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blade is sharp and trims my beard with no effort.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it is not rechargeable like the others we have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> That was very disappointing and its to cheap to send back but also no point in buying another one.</li>
            <li> While the base trimmer works fine, the extensions for different lengths tend to rip my hairs out.</li>
            <li> but it has been a fantastic little hair cutting machine</li>
            <li> It has a very sharp blade, so be careful using it on other parts of your body besides your face and hairline.</li>
            <li> I sent it in for repairs, but they apparently consider &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; to mean &amp;#34;do nothing&amp;#34; because after waiting for weeks for it to return in the mail, it still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I tried another set of new batteries, it is still broken.</li>
            <li> Batteries run out very quickly, i would guess because of the bad contact.  </li>
            <li> feels cheep (because you are paying less than $15) but works as expected (though It probably is not waterproof).</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that Wahl wasn&#x27;t living up to its good name, but then coincidentally I discovered that the (+) terminal of the battery in the trimmer wasn&#x27;t coming in contact.</li>
            <li> Works well, no complaints other than the packaging is hard to open.</li>
            <li> But for the price, a little is expected.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re like me and like to use it to whack down a thick and manly beard once a month then possibly look at one of the other ones that have the built-in adjustable guard.</li>
            <li> It is rather hard to move so it isn&#x27;t immediately obvious.</li>
            <li> Should this thing ever break, I will have a hard time going back to tweezers</li>
            <li> I guess for a cheap trimmer unit it isn&#x27;t all bad.</li>
            <li> Really not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The separate small rotary device looked so cheap and dangerous that I threw it out</li>
            <li> The only complaint I could think of at all</li>
            <li> That was not fun.</li>
            <li> Not worth the aggravation..</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the stand does not hold all of the attachments.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have had it a couple of months now and have used it several times and have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> The motor is not powerful and doesn&#x27;t shave well.</li>
            <li> While this trimmer doesn&#x27;t look like a million bucks, it will keep you looking that way for at least several years for just 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the purchase</li>
            <li> It is very inexpensive but I am sorry I bought it.  </li>
            <li> At least it came with oil for my commercial one.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH</li>
            <li> This one really doesn&#x27;t trim anything, and the nose hair trimmer is basically useless.</li>
            <li> It is a mediocre product, but priced very well.  </li>
            <li> see that several people have complained about battery life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;++This is not a shaver, i think people are confusing this for a different job, This is made to trim, maintain, and sculpt a beard or mustache.</li>
            <li> not worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> The cost is very affordable and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Again, this is not worth your investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not have thick facial hair at all</li>
            <li> The blade was installed too far behind the teeth where the hair catches.</li>
            <li> enough said, no really a very good tool for home dressers and hair dressers for cleaning up facial hair and edging buzz cuts.</li>
            <li> Anyone less observant will initially think the trimmer was too dull or defective.</li>
            <li> the one I have now wouldn&#x27;t come off) and the blade pulls on my beard and is not very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Batteries for really quickly, and it&#x27;s difficult to clip away thick hair.</li>
            <li> Works, however the Wahl 91143-100 trimmer model 5537NIs a step down in quality versus my 1999 era Wahl Groomsman.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to help trim down a beard I grew during winter before shaving it in spring</li>
            <li> It shaved it down to close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The longest head still cuts my bear down to 1/3&amp;#34; or so.</li>
            <li> i dont have to worry about it being charged up or running down.</li>
            <li> It take a little longer to shave with the product than other ones that have used.</li>
            <li> and I like the preformance and with the other little trimmer</li>
            <li> Please note that my failure to keep the receipt was definitely my fault.</li>
            <li> Husband other one it plugs into the charger when dead.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a couple Norelco ear trimmers but they each lasted less than a year before just dying for o reaso</li>
            <li> but it ended up being much less than I bargained for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It always seems to run at under half a charge, although it is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The product is not exceptionally sturdy but it is properly priced and it does the job.   </li>
            <li> It replaced one that I had for 10 years, and is a dramatic step up at HALF the cost of the old one.  </li>
            <li> Instead of this you can buy a mac3 blade for half a dollar.</li>
            <li> serious value, last one lasted over two years</li>
            <li> /&gt;Completely stopped working after less than 5 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it outperformed the 2 previous Wahl trimmers I owned, which this was a replacement for.</li>
            <li> Less than 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> So I typically just place the trimmer, by itself, under the sink counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plastic it is made of does seem slightly thinner, but it is plenty sturdy and I don&#x27;t anticipate problems with it.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t expect ear trimmer and beard trimmer in less than 12 bucks.</li>
            <li> When our previous Wahl shaver died, I didn&#x60;t</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that the trimmer attachment sizes aren&#x27;t that long.</li>
            <li> For less than $10 you get a nose trimmer, beard trimmer and all of the accouterments.  </li>
            <li> the attachments are not like the typical Wahl attachments - none of them allow for trimming longer hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comparing this beard trimmer to my previous one, a Philips Norelco G370</li>
            <li> I bought this as my previous beard trimmer was dying after 2 years.</li>
            <li> 7 years from a trimmer less then $15.</li>
            <li> (Reprint of review on 1st product in Black w/edit)</li>
            <li> Tried another name brand for kicks and ended up giving it away to a friend with less demanding needs and bought another Wahl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s battery operated  (AA), and thats a plus for me since I don&#x27;t have to worry about charging or the battery dying half way into a trim.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The provided attachments are inferior to my previous Wahl, the 3/16&amp;#34; or the 1/8&amp;#34; make no adjustment to my beard.</li>
            <li> I almost bought these at a store black Friday and decided to wait..</li>
            <li> and i paid a lot less than retail</li>
            <li> Battery-operation makes the unit less cumbersome.</li>
            <li> It is extremely painful to use as it feels like the blades are not sharp enough or not strong enough because it feels like my hair is being ripped out of my skin rather than trimmed from the surface.</li>
            <li> first disappointing purchase from Wahl.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected.</li>
            <li> but is a mess.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money trying other expensive trimmers.</li>
            <li> Only four stars due the the fact the quite a bit of hair ends up behind the clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned though, cutting your own hair, even the little that I do, takes some practice to do in the mirror (try plucking a random grey hair on the side of your head with tweezers to get what I mean).  </li>
            <li> The housing in the back for the batteries is a poor design, as has been mentioned by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Its a little less close than i thought it would be</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this kit to anyone shopping on a tight budget.  </li>
            <li> The holding carrier does not officially hold nose clipper, a little tight.</li>
            <li> but the smell nose trimmer has a little problem</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband, he likes the little stand that organizes all the accessories.</li>
            <li> The nose/ear trimmer is like a little weedwacker in a tube.</li>
            <li> I like this little guy.</li>
            <li> that my other trimmers and because it is small makes it easier too access</li>
            <li> that scrote just don&#x27;t stop bleedin even for  a little cut son.</li>
            <li> if you have a little longer beard, this is not the trimmer for you.  </li>
            <li> The slightest little bump</li>
            <li> I bought it for him as a gift, knowing little about beard trimmers and trusting reviews.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hear that she was screaming for me to stop because this little thing puts out quite a bit of noise.</li>
            <li> Notice the little ergonomic raised portions on the case.</li>
            <li> ♦ I use the little rubber blade cover when I&#x27;m not using the trimmer.</li>
            <li> its lasted longer than other plastic beard trimmers ive had in the past.</li>
            <li> The attachments leave a little to be desired.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried as I thought I ordered a rechargeable unit</li>
            <li> (what isn&#x27;t these days) but seems a little lightweight - you get what you pay for I suppose.  </li>
            <li> This was just a little underwhelming.</li>
            <li> Beard trimmer is a little nosy.</li>
            <li> I am going to give it to my little nephew</li>
            <li> i thought this would be a little sturdier</li>
            <li> Cutting behind the ears and neck area is easy when using this beard trimmer..</li>
            <li> The little nasal hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t work after falling a few ft into the skin.  </li>
            <li> have been using this little trimming Kit for a few months now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very thick beard, yet I found I had to go over the same spots again and again to get any sort of semblance of evenness.     </li>
            <li> Its really almost like cutting with a blunt razor though with a little persistence, it does get the job</li>
            <li> 1/4\\&quot; to 1/2\\&quot; on average - and pretty curly - but this was downright painful.</li>
            <li> Way too much noise from clipper and uneven cutting - misses some hairs &amp; you must go over a spot again to get the hair cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However there is clearly something wrong with the power switch, as it goes on and off as you turn it on....</li>
            <li> I use this a few times a week for my goat and stash and it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> and you have to take a few whacks at it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I received this one.  </li>
            <li> I used it but found not comfortable.</li>
            <li> But if you use a beard trimmer frequently, you&#x27;re looking at the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Waste of $10</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $10.  </li>
            <li> (heavy noise from the motor)</li>
            <li> all I&#x27;ve had to do every few years</li>
            <li> Charging takes a few hours, but after about 30 minutes you can basically use the trimmer.</li>
            <li> , it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.pure garbages.</li>
            <li> Not a Cheaply built junk.  </li>
            <li> Have been using in for a few months now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone should waste their money on this</li>
            <li> I ended up wrapping the body of the trimmer with electrical tape a few times, over the battery door, just to keep it held on.</li>
            <li> This product works well for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Considering the price of the kit and even changing batteries every few months,  I wish my Conair had conked out sooner.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in that</li>
            <li> like i wasted my money to buy this</li>
            <li> this worked for a few mos.</li>
            <li> It does the job quite well I have been using this product for a few weeks now and have no problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I run the cutter for a few minutes to get the oil worked into the cutter&#x27;s recesses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using a few times a week for my bikini line.  </li>
            <li> it did not work and was simply waste of money...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you time or money..........</li>
            <li> It shares the same problem that the nose trimmer that it comes with does, poor design.</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for a few months now.</li>
            <li> Also this thing is terrible about catching my beard hairs and pulling them.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is the round type: the outer, round guide is stationary, and the blades spin inside.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows someone with uneven sideburns.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works, no.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it a few times and when I went to return it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have heavy beard</li>
            <li> also ager a few days</li>
            <li> Product came to me dead on arrival.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few months now with rechargeable batteries and have not had to recharge them yet.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for some years, but the batteries did not fit well into the compartment.</li>
            <li> Used it once and it killed the batteries...</li>
            <li> and it doesnt even work waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Stopped working within a few weeks</li>
            <li> I know how to install batteries, I know how to trouble shoot batteries.</li>
            <li> some teeth managed to break off within a few weeks of me owning this.  </li>
            <li> This was so cheap that I thought it would be worthless.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be hindered by the fact that it is battery operated.</li>
            <li> I have not accurately measured this, but I wouldn&#x27;t say an underestimate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to spread a drop over the entire cutting surface; so I alternate side edges of the cutter each month to start the spread of oil.</li>
            <li> Not so bad for general beard-upkeep but not a long term product.  </li>
            <li> I am using this product for past 2 weeks and used it less then 3-4 times.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a month and a half!</li>
            <li> Tooo noisy, attachments are not easy to get on, the adjustable&lt;br</li>
            <li> Afraid it wouldn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> First off i don&#x27;t like writting bad reviews but when I have to i have to.</li>
            <li> Pretty bad beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy and let it grow for a few days.  </li>
            <li> As stated, by doing this, I can usually forego a trip to the local barber every other month; essentially cutting my number of trips in half for the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging is a little difficult to open though.</li>
            <li> it keeps them from quiting and keeps them from getting torn up from stickers rubbing them raw.</li>
            <li> I cant see or hear anything broken or loose either.</li>
            <li> waste your hard earned cash on this one.</li>
            <li> Wall used to be THE name in trimmers, no more.</li>
            <li> i spent hours yesterday reading reviews and getting confused</li>
            <li> I took a 3 year break using a Norelco (which was a Christmas gift), however, I was never satisfied with the cut at longer settings.</li>
            <li> The battery quit recharging after the 3rd month, and Wahl&#x27;s position was since I failed to keep my receipt, there was no warranty coverage.</li>
            <li> IT GETS IN SMALL CURVES.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for the past 4 years.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m lazy and let my beard fill out.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they would do that.</li>
            <li> it works well and has a simplistic design so it should last.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect with this inexpensive and battery operated product.</li>
            <li> No more rechargeable s for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate it, it was a gift for Christmas for my brother.</li>
            <li> Not sure why all the ear/nose peace dose not have a spot in the holding tray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried to sharpen them (and not sure you can, anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a while longer, but a pair of small scissors worked just as well.</li>
            <li> the attachments are included and they even have a small bottle of</li>
            <li> like that the small trimmer is separate rather than being another attachment.</li>
            <li> Also like the small size and compact nature of this.</li>
            <li> This product works for the small job that I need it for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 110v units in the past and this unit is just like them.</li>
            <li> I choose the battery unit instead of the rechargeable just because in the past ive had issues with rechargeable units, has everything you need to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I personally am not pleased and don&#x27;t recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I bought to shave small spots on my mini dog&#x27;s &amp;#34;very fine&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had left it in the package since I felt it was a silly product...</li>
            <li> Small, compact all accessories in the pack.&lt;br /&gt;For home use</li>
            <li> small trimmer has no place to sit in holder.. has to be kept in drawer.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband, who has a small beard.  </li>
            <li> I am one who usually goes to the barber to get my beard trimmed and shaved.</li>
            <li> The batteries kept falling out, the opening was too small.</li>
            <li> Not sure how they broke just being in my shaving kit.</li>
            <li> so bad.&lt;br /&gt;The hairs constantly get caught in the trimmer attachment which leads to painful pulling of single hairs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> AA battery operated, poor performance, inconsistent trim speed due to battery cycle.</li>
            <li> The battery life is not amazing as others have noticed, but I usually can go 3-4 uses before needing to charge again.</li>
            <li> New things is bad, let I doubt about the brand.</li>
            <li> never had enough juice or power to trim my measly attempts at a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you have to press hard on it in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> I learnt that the hard way.</li>
            <li> Hard to argue with the price though.</li>
            <li> Running it with niCads so battery life is hard to gauge.</li>
            <li> And after 1 use, the razor acts up now and is dull and does not shave well.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted a trimmer with a 1/16&amp;#34; tool attachment (oddly hard to find).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would even bother selling a beard trimmer that is too dull to cut hair..</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing to complaint about</li>
            <li> At least that one lived up to what they claimed.</li>
            <li> In comparison with the Philips trimmers, I&#x27;d say that this one is slightly inconvenient as you have to keep changing the trimming attachments, as opposed the simple sliding adjustment on the Philips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda delicate, but does its work well.</li>
            <li> However, my biggest complaint is that it burns through batteries when it&#x27;s not even turned on.  </li>
            <li> Husband chose this for shaving his delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> cutting head doesn&#x27;t accept coarse hair well</li>
            <li> Provides a close shave to his sensitive skin, and does not seem to irritate, or be painful.</li>
            <li> and it was too late to return</li>
            <li> This item sucks, keep jamming when I use it</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it anywhere on my body, especially the nether regions.</li>
            <li> After one run on each eyebrow, the errant hairs (or at least the errant parts of them) were gone.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;beard trimmer not effective and so bad&lt;br</li>
            <li> at least turn on..</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 trimmers prior to this one, and this is by far the worst beard trimming product I have ever used/owned.</li>
            <li> at least addresses the battery issue because it uses two AA batteries (the nose trimmer uses one).  </li>
            <li> if you wake up late and cant shave your face with a guillet</li>
            <li> Eats through the whiskers and thick ones like a chainsaw.</li>
            <li> or else it will slowly wear itself out.</li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard this is not the trimmer for you.</li>
            <li> I have really really thick hair tho.  </li>
            <li> , you have to move slow through a mustache or beard or it may pull, just don&#x27;t go too fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a fairly thick beard.</li>
            <li> Or perhaps I have a thick beard.</li>
            <li> Can never go wrong with this purchase $10.00 and after 8 months its still going i use it every other day</li>
            <li> I mean I can not use it throw</li>
            <li> , today my Wahl trimmer finally quit working, sad day indeed!</li>
            <li> But i can tell you, this is the only trimmer ill ever buy, its lasted me 7 years!</li>
            <li> She said she was sorry I was unhappy and sent me new products as replacements.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was just a small defect and this is the worse it can get.</li>
            <li> Not many companies that stand behind their products like that anymore.</li>
            <li> However, the trimmer broke down and will not turn on after a month of casual use.</li>
            <li> at cutting through my very thick facial hair</li>
            <li> Not a good razor for the price, i mean</li>
            <li> , amd spend a half hour trying to figure out what i&#x27;m doing wrong.  </li>
            <li> I seriously would have dumped me too because the pain this thing caused, but I&#x27;m me, well,</li>
            <li> By far the worst part is that the battery door on mine was VERY loose.</li>
            <li> but it is a lot easier to use and a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> The quality of this thing is seriously bad.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I have a goatee and trying to maintain the shape of it with a Bic razor is next to impossible.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate this low enough, this is HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say too much bad about this, especially at the price.</li>
            <li> He has only used it when needed because it pulls to bad.</li>
            <li> , it is unfortunate that even when the battery is dead and the unit is plugged into the chord into the wall, it will not work until it is fully charged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to look it up on the web to see if others hated this product as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Not a good product</li>
            <li> Not good for hairy guys.</li>
            <li> Problem is after buying a few sets, I have one with a blade that has something wrong in one of the teeth</li>
            <li> I bought one of these and it failed within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Pulls beard hair constantly, It&#x27;s no good</li>
            <li> battey operated is no good</li>
            <li> not a good buy</li>
            <li> Always thought battery operated would be waste of money, but this product proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that would mean less power.  </li>
            <li> After only a dozen uses, the trimmer became painfully louder, routinely cut skin, and started ripping my hairs out while trimming (progressively worse).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the horrible salty smell is normal on these or if that was from my girl, EX-girlfriend.</li>
            <li> so i the power would be constiant but other than that cant be mad</li>
            <li> kinda weak. pulls hair.</li>
            <li> really SO weak</li>
            <li> It runs on batteries which make it so weak to cut the hear of the head or the hear of the beard.</li>
            <li> I weak.</li>
            <li> motor and blades with this model is just too weak to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Bought it to replace a Remington who&#x27;s rechargeable battery was getting weak.</li>
            <li> Strips of metal that hold batteries in place were weak and already bent upon purchase.</li>
            <li> Disappointed this brand produced such poor quality garbage.</li>
            <li> But the little device takes just one AA battery, and does a dandy job with zero risk of cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> I truly tried listening to my girlfriends&#x27;, I keep forgetting, EX-girlfriend, anyway, I was trying really hard to listen to hear complain afterwards but the ringing in my ears from the clippers made it difficult, and she thought I was ignoring her.</li>
            <li> Step your game up guys.</li>
            <li> Not happy would not have purchased if I knew it was a battery operated one I like the rechargeable ones</li>
            <li> It shows a space on the base to set the nose trimmer next to the beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> It gets fairly annoying, but not totally intolerable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a lightweight, poorly made, POS.</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t broken so my fianc&amp;eacute;</li>
            <li> Because it broken a tooth....</li>
            <li> I am NOT happy with the purchase of this item.</li>
            <li> I hate this trimmer, I&#x27;ve been buying multigroom products for several years now, Remington, norelco etc.</li>
            <li> The quality is not great.</li>
            <li> Poor quality control, you guys.</li>
            <li> is poor quality made by poorly paid people who don&#x27;t understand about quality</li>
            <li> This thing was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> Broken.</li>
            <li> Shame that Wahl is now playing the &amp;#34;quantity over quality&amp;#34; game.  </li>
            <li> The hair trimmer works but the nose trimmer was broken.</li>
            <li> Do not get the product that is buy: from the date that the purchase was made and will request the sent, the product never I was delivered to my destination, citing the customs agent, the Venezuelan customs were involved, which investigate and was false.</li>
            <li> One has to be lower than the other making for bad contact.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to replace an older one that worked well, and this has awful battery life, and doesn&#x27;t trim well at all</li>
            <li> crazy, and no more.</li>
            <li> new one is horrible.</li>
            <li> This product has some very serious quality control issues.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken, unable to return for exchange or refund, so decided to try to repair it myself.</li>
            <li> Worst purchase on Amazon so far...</li>
            <li> Is really not ideal shopping at a time.</li>
            <li> And it sometimes snags onto facial hair which can be very painful.</li>
            <li> NOT a pleasant feeling!</li>
            <li> I have gotten previous opportunities to use Whal products and I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> the trimmers are very very bad, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t return back.</li>
            <li> Not a good gift, I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a different manufacturers product and was very disappointed with the operation.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s only 10 bucks but totally worthless!</li>
            <li> It trims my beard hair faster then the expensive Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, I was skeptical about ordering this.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I lost the cord to recharge it</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t made use of the comb or oil yet and the brush seems useless in my opinion.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong</li>
            <li> and it is unable to do anything besides tug and pull.  </li>
            <li> The multi position comb is useless.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately threw the packaging away immediately and well before I had batteries to try it.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> After receiving the product and using it an initial time, I have to say that it is terrible!</li>
            <li> Description and explanation on that sheet vague and unclear.</li>
            <li> silly men</li>
            <li> but not awesome.  </li>
            <li> but if this is any sign of Wahl&#x27;s quality, Ill pass, guess they don&#x27;t make em like they used to.</li>
            <li> It rusted to the point of being completely useless within a month of purchase.</li>
            <li> Oh, by the way the nose hair trimmer is useless.</li>
            <li> Wahl saved money in the wrong places.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy another product and just wasted 15 bucks for this crap</li>
            <li> this was simply the worst.</li>
            <li> It failed within one day.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong with this product</li>
            <li> You had one job and you failed.</li>
            <li> This shaver is no match for an actual beard, the guards don&#x27;t let hair through and the motor is horribly under powered.</li>
            <li> i receive verry wrong item.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer was completely useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for some time and it has yet to fail me.  </li>
            <li> But no batteries are included which makes it useless out of the box.</li>
            <li> Since I note nothing wrong with the item, I cannot suppose it is just mine that does not work.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> It is completely useless , I am baffled .</li>
            <li> but the stand is kinda cheesy</li>
            <li> Very poor build quality.</li>
            <li> Very Poor Quality and unsafe</li>
            <li> The received product is very poor in quality.</li>
            <li> My beard is very thin</li>
            <li> Very painful to use and not very strong.</li>
            <li> I thought wireless and rechargable would mean a base for recharging.  </li>
            <li> all for a measly 11 bucks.</li>
            <li> The person that I purchased this item for was disappointed felt it was poorly made and did not work well</li>
            <li> ,it was pulling my hair all the  time when I was  cutting my hair  at the end</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve changed the batteries, cleaned the contacts, cleaned and lubed the cutting head</li>
            <li> Would like a cover for the cutting heads.</li>
            <li> I have always used this brand and type ( rechargeable type too) for cutting my sons hair.</li>
            <li> Cutting performance:  </li>
            <li> The cutting blades resemble a well built, but $10 trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Feels like it&#x27;s yanking the hair out instead of cutting them.</li>
            <li> This was a terrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> Instead of cutting the hair, it just grabs it and yanks it out.  </li>
            <li> 79520-3101 Groom Pro Hair cutting Kit, Yellow/black, 22 Count</li>
            <li> Pulls hair rather then cutting it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that crazy about this razor...</li>
            <li> is disappointment, the shaver does not cut.</li>
            <li> I put a drop on the cutting edge.</li>
            <li> It does sometimes pull hairs, and the battery option causes it to lose cutting power when the batteries need replacing.</li>
            <li> I get so mad that I just want to smash it to bits every time.</li>
            <li> Totally useless!  </li>
            <li> but I paid brand item why I am to get mad</li>
            <li> I am mad</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ts cold now.. :(</li>
            <li> Not as bad as critics make it out to be</li>
            <li> It catches my hairs and hurts so bad.</li>
            <li> Even the nose trimmer in this one isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Bad thing is you need batteries</li>
            <li> , it was a bad switch</li>
            <li> When those rechargeable types go bad, you can&#x27;t get them apart to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously bad design.&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li> “At the beginning of the year, teachers should talk to their students about how we want, as a class, to create a climate that says we don’t accept bullying and that includes calling kids out on their bad behavior.”</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is a werry bad item!!!!&lt;br /&gt;just toy</li>
            <li> For the price it isnt bad..</li>
            <li> bought this for my husban and after seeing bad reviews about, i went and bought it anyways</li>
            <li> Clearly bad quality - don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> times it wont even turn on.......... bad switch?</li>
            <li> Bad product&lt;br /&gt;Anymore</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the 4.5 star reviews, this product is bad.</li>

            <li> My face still hurts after a painful trimming..</li>
            <li> It tears at my hairs at times and can be somewhat painful.    </li>
            <li> hair get stuck in the blade and would be really painful to you.  </li>
            <li> The razor catches and pulls on every pass making for a painful beard trim.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have always stood behind wahl as being a superior product. That being said these trimmers are the worst I&#x27;ve ever had..probably because they are battery powerd, which is why I bought them in the first place. Cons..They rip the hair off my face and have since the first time i used them. The clippers lose power when you tilt them.Pros.fits nicely in hand..very portable would be good in a pinch with no power available.</li>
            <li> Works great.......just as advertised!</li>
            <li> Not a bad trimmer for the price works great would be better if it had a built in battery so i the power would be constiant but other than that cant be mad you oay for what you get and im happy still and have had it for 2month&#x27;s</li>
            <li> everything ok bot the metal is getting Rusty</li>
            <li> works great and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> This is a powerful unit and my husband likes the accessories.</li>
            <li> I sent it as a gift to my son.  He used it.  It works well.</li>
            <li> I wish the adjustable head had a little closer cut but all in all for the price you can&#x27;t beat it if you want to we are a real short beard want to keep it neat you might want to try something with more adjustments but if you want something just to trim up this works. From 1 to 10 I&#x27;ll give it an 8.9</li>
            <li> It is good for the price paid for.</li>
            <li> Had it a year now, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  The nosetrimmer seems to run slow but that&#x27;s better than&lt;br /&gt;having it yank your nosehairs out (don&#x27;t ask).</li>
            <li> came on time worked great loved the product</li>
            <li> very happy gratt trimmer</li>
            <li> low power, could be better</li>
            <li> what a wonderful clipper.  very durable</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s only 10 bucks but totally worthless! Pulled my beard hair out instead of trimming it, none of the guards are labeled, and the stand doesn&#x27;t hold everything that comes with it.  Wall used to be THE name in trimmers, no more. I would have returned it had I not thrown it against the wall, shattering it out of pure frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. I&#x27;m clean shaven now.</li>
            <li> Nice combination of low price and all the function you could want.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband and he told me recently that it does a great job trimming!  Keeps his beard looking nice and trim!</li>
            <li> Really not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was awesome but disappointed when this package didnt come with eyebrow attachments</li>
            <li> fine, no reason to buy a more expensive product.</li>
            <li> perfect and just for the price</li>
            <li> Simply put - fails to work right out of the box.  So i open it, put batteries in it, amd spend a half hour trying to figure out what i&#x27;m doing wrong.  Finally conclude it is defective.  I really wanted a battery powered shaver as opposed to rechargeable and this is really the only one i can find.  So i order another one on amazon, there&#x27;s a silver one i figure what are the chances i get a second defective one?  Well, it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money and time don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get anything better at this price.&lt;br /&gt;Trims beard superbly. Nice blades and very nice small accessories. More than satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Good product at a great price from a brand named MFG, Wahl.  I bought it mostly for an ear &amp; nose trimmer but really like the fact that there is a beard trimmer included with several different trimmer heads to control length. I had purchased a couple Norelco ear trimmers but they each lasted less than a year before just dying for o reaso</li>
            <li> great product! The price was the best I could find.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my son with a beard</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new trimmer with various attachments and ran across the Wahl brand at Amazon. The product offers a lot of bonus attachments for a very reasonable price. This particular trimmer kit is not a wall charger device, it operates off of batteries. I have owned this product for 1 yr and have only had to replace the batteries once.</li>
            <li> Not as bad as critics make it out to be</li>
            <li> China made....very very bad plastic body. Dont know how much time this will survive</li>
            <li> and now just a goatee that I managed to salvage before being completly ravaged by this infernal machine. This thing is Garbage! The trimmer rips hairs from your face, the guards fall off and have too wide of spacing to be of any use. In hindsight I should have spent a few more dollars.</li>
            <li> liitle on the cheap side but gets the job done . Nose hair clipper not the best</li>
            <li> works great! For the occasional trim &amp; touch up, this is a great value.  Because it is battery operated, it is portable.  It&#x27;s nice to cut and trim everyone out on the deck in the sunshine!</li>
            <li> After using this one time it has completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> It cuts great but I need more gaurds, these are way to short</li>
            <li> Tooo noisy, attachments are not easy to get on, the adjustable&lt;br /&gt;attachment is almost worthless.</li>
            <li> Works Great, the batteries are lasting longer in this one compared to my old one. Cuts better, ear &amp; nose trimmer also works great.</li>
            <li> The trimmers work well.  The stand has enough room for all the accessories that come with the trimmer so everything is in one place.  Since it uses AA batteries there is no need to have a cord lying around like my old rechargeable one.</li>
            <li> This kit has it all, and does everything and has every attachment available, from beards to mustaches to goatees to soul patches...no matter your preference....this kit will keep it neatly trimmed</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer set I&#x27;m able to stay clean now without spending 60.00 a month on a good cut.I really like it good buy....</li>
            <li> Not at all impressed with this product. Too plastic and not the quality I expected.  Afraid it wouldn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Everything is there! Comb, cleaning brush, oil, stand and all the attachments. Nose hair trimmer does the job for the price. Though some have complained on battery life, I only used it currently for mustache, sideburns and occasional side trimming, so can&#x27;t speak to beard trimming. Have only changed batteries once in couple of months.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected and not as much power not satisfied but you he what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Saves many trips to the barber! Great for the summer!</li>
            <li> better than my previous trimmer by far. right length cutter heads which my other did not have, at 3 times the price. This in my opinion is a true value.  Vendor was great with fair postage and a very low price.</li>
            <li> Way better than my previous wired one, still works with the original batteries I inserted six months ago.</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer worked really well. The Beard trimmer works ok. Could be sharper.</li>
            <li> Really a great deal.  The items all work just fine.  This is not professional grade equipment, but for personal use (and at this price) it really is a great value</li>
            <li> Aside from the cheapish construction, its held up real well.  Does the job, and has all the needed attachments.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all, does not cut well</li>
            <li> It was cheap enough and I only wanted something to keep up with manscaping...</li>
            <li> Excellent, really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought as much as anything for the nose trimmer part and that worked weakly for about 2 times.  Stopped after that and doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised. Pretty powerful for a battery operated device.</li>
            <li> The product just seams cheep. But I guess that&#x27;s what I get for buying a lower end product. The little nasal hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t work after falling a few ft into the skin.  but my husband doesn&#x27;t care for it anyways. Just not what we were expecting from Walt.</li>
            <li> I bought this Wahl one to replace a similarly cheap Vidal Sassoon branded trimmers that finally died.  I noticed immediately that the Wahl was much easier to nick yourself with accidentally.  I decided to keep it anyway, and just be more careful than I&#x27;d had to be with the Vidal Sassoon branded one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used only the main trimmer.  The separate small rotary device looked so cheap and dangerous that I threw it out immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does the main trimmers get only 1 star?  Well, if you nick yourself many times because of a nicking-prone trimmers, even if you&#x27;re careful about cleaning the wound and antibiotic ointment each time, eventually statistics might let an infection take hold.  And that&#x27;s how I ended up having to go to the emergency room a few days after one of many Wahl trimmer nicks, plus a 2-week run of unpleasant antibiotics, and followup doctor appointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In hindsight, I would&#x27;ve been much better off if I&#x27;d paid thousands of dollars to NOT use this Wahl product.</li>
            <li> Well, you get what you pay for. I just wanted a trimmer for very occasional use, so I didnt want to spend a lot of money. What I got is a tool that looks like a hair trimmer. The only problem is that it doesnt cut hair.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> I had to replace an old Remington recharchable trimmer that I used for beard trimming and detailed trimming as part of my haircuts.  I was reluctant to switch to a battery powered device but this one has been great so far.  The trim guards seem to stay on well w/o worry of them popping off during trimming.  I would recommend this one to a friend. No problems with shipping/packaging.</li>
            <li> love it ..will do business with u again. i used the product and was very pleased with it...thanks charles petruzzi.</li>
            <li> it does not cut well  looks like the blade are not sharp ,it was pulling my hair all the  time when I was  cutting my hair  at the end I felt pain all over my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for the better part of 15 years and I go through my fair share of razors, blades, and electronic devices. After shaving this long, a little simplicity would go a long way. I was hoping that this set by Wahl would be a good deal but it ended up being much less than I bargained for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it&#x27;s a very inexpensive set that includes anything and everything you&#x27;ll need to trim your beard, goatee, van dyke or what have you. It&#x27;s a simple battery operated device that goes on and off with a simple flick of your finger. It didn&#x27;t need to be anything more than that but low and behold, I was just in for the first of many surprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, this thing rusts easily. I&#x27;m taking after your first use easily. I followed the cleaning instructions in the book completely yet right as I lifted the plastic cap off of the device I was treated to some unwelcomed brown spots. My first reaction was to throw it in the trash right then and there let alone continue its use. However, I gave Wahl the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps it was just a small defect and this is the worse it can get. I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. The rust continued to spread and now this product and its accessories sits underneath my bathroom sink. I&#x27;ve gone back to manual trimming with scissors for now while I look for a worthy replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an ordinary, cheap, completely run of the mill trimmer than Wahl is your best bet. It&#x27;s not a big investment but believe me, you get exactly what you pay for. I certainly won&#x27;t be buying this brand again and will save up a few extra bucks to get something with a little more quality and durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Wahl. Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this trimmer. It&#x27;s been perfect for me. I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Wahl trimmers and clippers. I like the stand/storage thing that comes with it. The nose hair trimmer wasn&#x27;t very impressive but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that anyway.</li>
            <li> the pieces are miniature comb is a joke</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much power this trimmer has only running on two AA batteries! It does a great job and as long as you use good batteries, the power will last a good while before needing the batteries replaced.</li>
            <li> My previous beard trimmer was a samller version of this product and it lasted me for ten years. Iv&#x27;e had a mustache for thirty two years and this Wahl trimmer works great on my coarse hair and the nose trimmer works really well. The price of this trimmer was fantastic because before I purchased this product I checked the prices at the so-called Super Stores and I could not find one cheaper and they actually wanted eighteen dollars just for the trimmer and no nose trimmer. Thanks Amazon, you have the best prices!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these for a quick neck shaved. They burned my 5 year old grandson, and an elderly friend of mine, as well</li>
            <li> not strong enough the nose trimmer turns on sometimes only used it 2 times</li>
            <li> Fair quality for the price, trimmed my bear really well and made a difference in my grooming rutines</li>
            <li> Update 7/19/2016 The trimmer finally quit a week and a half ago. Solid piece of face grooming equipment; Wahl is one of the best products for the money. I&#x27;m absolutely purchasing another one to replace it.  ------- This set piqued my interest about a year ago when I spotted it on sale on another website, only to find out that it was cheaper on Amazon.  It turned out to be a pretty good deal.  Let me start by echoing other users&#x27; reviews: the plastic that this trimmer and its accessories are made with feels extremely cheap.  However, I have not had a single issue with it, and, like a good book, its what&#x27;s on the inside not the outside that matters.  This thing trims very well, and has been used about once or twice a week for the last year, so it holds up.  The comb is fairly standard, though I&#x27;ve never had a use for it.  The blade guard is a nice touch, especially if you leave it in the storage base without use for a period of time.  As for the storage base, while its made of very cheap, thin plastic, it holds everything nicely and helps keep your bathroom sink well organized.  It is kind of odd they didn&#x27;t bother to make it big enough to hold the nose trimmer, however.  As for the nose trimmer itself, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as you might think.  Unfortunately, simply spinning it along the inside rim of your nostril doesn&#x27;t quite cut it, as you have to get underneath the hair and push slightly up into your nostril to get the hair properly removed.  It does the job well, but its a longer process than it really needs to be.  You&#x27;ll spend a few extra minutes longer than you&#x27;d expect to make sure you got all the hair trimmed that you wanted to.  I&#x27;ve also recently ran into an issue with the nose trimmer on/off switch doing whatever it wants.  If I flip it to &#x27;off&#x27; once its on, it sometimes stays on, then will either turn off once in the &#x27;on&#x27; position, or stay the course.  A few good smacks against my hand remedies the problem, but I use this thing maybe once or twice a month, so its durability seems to be lacking.  I gave this a 4-star rating because of the nose trimmer, and to a much lesser extent the comb and supplied oil, since I haven&#x27;t had a need for them as of yet.  Its still a very good trimmer at an excellent price, and will certainly serves your basic trimming needs.</li>
            <li> Beard control and painless ear and nose hair control all in the same package.  And, best of all it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for the low price...but it has been great!</li>
            <li> Works well. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> as i&#x27;ve been requested to grow a beard by the gf we compromised and i did a goatee  i spent hours yesterday reading reviews and getting confused so we went to walmart today and i got this kit for $13  i like a short-haired beard or else i itch too much, but i didn&#x27;t want to spend much as i will shave by summer  i just got home and tried it,starting with the longest setting guide  it worked fine,perfect for me  i think i&#x27;ll probably use it 3/4 times a week and it only took 5 minutes to do so for now battery life isn&#x27;t an issue  durability? only time will tell  ps  walmart sure has a lot of fat people shopping there!</li>
            <li> This product is great...if you like your whiskers ripped from your face rather than cleanly cut.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m aware that this is a $12 product and you get what you pay for.. However, I just saw the trimmer I had before this one, a basic Philips Norelco product, for $20 at Target and I used it for 2-3 years w/o any problems!     I can&#x27;t explain how unsatisfied I am with this Wahl product.. I really think it costs them $1 to make this item.. My face still hurts after a painful trimming.. The blades feel like they&#x27;ve been made with the cheapest steel from an old clunker in China.. They smell like they&#x27;re burning. I don&#x27;t have a sensitive skin, but there are red spots allover due to the cheap material. And, it is very loud and too fast.    As a very wise English person once said \\&quot;I am not rich enough to buy cheap things\\&quot; -- I wish I listened to him instead of Amazon.com reviews..</li>
            <li> its a good buy for the price. only problem is having to change batteries all the time.</li>
            <li> Up to the task. Still working, years later.</li>
            <li> Wahl provided good customer service when the clipper failed after three months.  A replacement was provided with no questions asked.</li>
            <li> Cool product works well</li>
            <li> this came very cheap and it&#x27;s doing a fine job specially for the price i paid for</li>
            <li> Pulls your beard hair. Spend a few more dollars and get one that doesn&#x27;t cause pain while using.</li>
            <li> My wife gave me this set for Christmas and, having never had a trimmer before, did not know what to expect. After the first use I was very pleased in the performance of the large trimmer, not so much the small trimmer which I found basicly useless. Now after having it for six months it quit. I&#x27;ve changed the batteries, cleaned the contacts, cleaned and lubed the cutting head but it will not work. It&#x27;s a nice set and I&#x27;m disapointed that it did not last longer so I&#x27;ll step up to a better model which I hope will last longer than six months. It goes to show you that you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> normally battery operated trimmers don&#x27;t last me but months, but i am no on the second year with this. when this does go out, i will buy another as a replacement.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this exceeded my expectations for a battery powered unit. If only it had an adjustable head to do 1/2 or something.</li>
            <li> Comes with a bunch of accessories that aid in the grooming process.  Powerful motor.  Not too loud though.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I really like this and it work good and have had many different trimmers, and I happen to by a Wahl one day, and its outlasted all my other big name trimmers, and i totally mistreated it and abused it, and it still trims like a dream, thank you</li>
            <li> Pretty good, even though he doesn&#x27;t f****n deserve it and should have it jammed so far down his throat he can start shaving pieces off that ice cavitiy he calls a heart!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping to Australia too.</li>
            <li> I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer. My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years. I took a 3 year break using a Norelco (which was a Christmas gift), however, I was never satisfied with the cut at longer settings. I ultimately went back to various Wahl trimmers, yet they all gave out (battery, motor, etc) in less than 2 years.    Deciding to give Wahl one last chance. I purchased the \\&quot;All-in-One Trimmer Kit,\\&quot; given that it had a 5-year warranty. The battery quit recharging after the 3rd month, and Wahl&#x27;s position was since I failed to keep my receipt, there was no warranty coverage. Please note that my failure to keep the receipt was definitely my fault. However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own. If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later. If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
            <li> Fantastic buy.  Works great.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m ok with it good function....</li>
            <li> I am enjoying it and it was sent speedy and I plan to get great service from it.</li>
            <li> What a bargain for a trimmer! Not exactly quality plastic, but it works and that&#x27;s what I paid for. Don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping it plugged in for charging, uses 2 AA batteries so should last a while. Has an attachment for different trim levels and according to the instructions, blades don&#x27;t need oiling that often so upkeep is a minimum. I like it!</li>
            <li> Amazing trimmer for the money. Mind you, not a top notch, high quality, buy-it-for-life trimmer, but damn nice for $10.</li>
            <li> works well, trimmer is loud.</li>
            <li> great price and set gift or you</li>
            <li> Works as expected, bear in mind I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for the price it was listed.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted works great</li>
            <li> Great gift. Might want to get something to carry it in though.</li>
            <li> Was exceptionally disappointed. Worked wonderfully the first time, then was unable to ever use it again.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my beard trimming. I have a large bin of chargers in my garage and did not want to add another &amp;#34;unknown&amp;#34; in the future. I prefer the simplicity of two AA batteries, which last a long time in this trimmer. It took me some time to realize that the guard is adjustable to several settings. It is rather hard to move so it isn&#x27;t immediately obvious. Nice product.</li>
            <li> Thought it was larger, but it works.  Don&#x27;t need the all the accessories.  Satisfied.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try growing a beard and didn&#x27;t want to put too much money into a trimmer if I didn&#x27;t like my beard.    This product is great!    Wahl made a quality blade that cuts the hair perfectly. At times you will notice the unit slow down and get hot. Just add a drop of the oil they give you and you are good to go.    The attachments on this trimmer are for short length beard growers! If you want a longer beard, this isn&#x27;t the product for you.    Works as a hair clipper for really short hair too!    The battery life on this is amazing! I have trimmed my beard several times and have given myself two buzzcuts for my head without a change of batteries!    Nose Trimmer works great and actually cuts and doesn&#x27;t pull hair.    I bought it at $10. Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> Had this for 4 years, still like new! What a BARGAIN!  *EDIT* 6 years and going strong!!!</li>
            <li> Are you a barber or do hair for a living?  If not then this is a great razor and WELL worth the money.  I use this a few times a week for my goat and stash and it works like a charm.  It trims very even and the guides fit tight.  Shaves pretty close when I work the details.  I have had this for over a year and dont think I have ever changed the batterys in it.     I love the fact this also comes with a nose trimmer and in its self is a very good quality piece.  The only complaint I could think of at all if I were to nit pick is the fact the holder does not have a slot for the nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> great little trimmer for the price. has a powerful motor  and i am very pleased with the quality of this trimmer  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT LITTLE TRIMMER FOR THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> This product was shipped fast...I gave it as a gift and the beard clipper does not work!!!!!!!!!! Not impressed at all...heard nothing but good things about this product so thought i could write a good review but I guess not! I want to return it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming excess hair.  Use rechargeable batteries and it goes on and on.  Would like a cover for the cutting heads.</li>
            <li> Great price, quality item</li>
            <li> For my beard ,its not that strong. TO GET clean result ,have to try it again and again.So didn&#x27;t likes it,caz i have seen better.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a replacement for trimmers that stopped running after years of use.  The new trimmers was same model # and features.  I am very satisfied with the product (old and new).  The price was a good value.  I&#x27;d strongly recommend the product and the merchant.</li>
            <li> Works fine for the price, and seems to last !</li>
            <li> Gift for Adult grandson.</li>
            <li> Love this clipper set, non-charger battery operated set. Batteries last a long time and don&#x27;t have to deal with another charger. Works better than expected. Nose trimmer good bonus.</li>
            <li> It works great wish it could be plugged in too</li>
            <li> My Husband loves it!  He said that he likes all of the different attachments it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;t has more attachments than most trimmers.</li>
            <li> got it for my nose hairs and some beard touch up.&lt;br /&gt;works superbly well.</li>
            <li> These trimmers seem to work very well....I was very pleased to find that the trimmers used   AA batteries instead of the larger size battery in my old Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Very fast shipping, got it the next day.  my beard is gonna look fresh from now on haha</li>
            <li> I got this beard trimmer for my cousin who was needing a new one after his old one quit working. Great product minus the fact that the trimmer does not have very much power. It take a little longer to shave with the product than other ones that have used.</li>
            <li> amazing trimmer &amp; great price!</li>
            <li> One problem with the trimmer is it pulls hair while trimming mustache. I tried doing slowly and at moving fast, however problem persisted</li>
            <li> It trims my beard hair faster then the expensive Norelco shaver. Even though the Norelco shaver trimed closer I didn&#x27;t like that much. I still sometimes had to shave afterwards anyway. When my Norelco died rather then waist my money on another one I bought this one and I like it more even though it is battery opperated. I reccomend buying this one if you have a long beard and save your money.</li>
            <li> Got here quickly and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Great item especially the different face hair trimmers. Comoact, fits into my shabing kit bag no problrm.&lt;br /&gt;Got a second one and gave to my barber.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this item.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. Allows to get all the hair all over. Eats through the whiskers and thick ones like a chainsaw. No ripping or tearing! Had to get used to the preset length sizes but it is all good. Great trimmer for a better price. Nose trimmer is fine but does good work. Overall great trimmer for a lumberjake!</li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews others had posted. While it shipped and was delivered as promised, it did not work no matter how many times I changed the batteries. It would turn on for 5 seconds and then die. This after the clamshell packaging cut my husband when he was opening it. I had hoped for better.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, I was skeptical about ordering this.  I am glad I did.  First, you have to remember that this is a beard TRIMMER!  Not a shaver.  It&#x27;s not going to get as close as a blade and isnt meant to.  That said, for the job it is suppose to do, it does excellent.  I have been using mine for close to a month now almost daily, and the batteries are still going strong, the blade is still sharp, and even the nose hair trimmer is working great.  The speed at which the trimmer operates really surprised me and I would easily compare it to a plug in model.  I say order it and try it out.  If you dont like it, you can always return it.  I will be keeping mine.</li>
            <li> Is this really a Wahl? I&#x27;ve always used Wahl before but this, well, I&#x27;m sure you get the point.&lt;br /&gt;It clogs up very easily, even with new batteries the motor just &amp;#34;don&#x27;t sound right&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;And the batts don&#x27;t last very long...&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s CHEAP!</li>
            <li> Does its job for the price</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not bad. I owned one of these for about 2 years probably and am now on my second. It&#x27;s always pretty much done the trick. It&#x27;s perfectly capable of taking care of a goatee, but as I&#x27;ve been moving toward a full-face beard, it&#x27;s leaving a bit to be desired. The cutting power isn&#x27;t all that great it won&#x27;t go through thick hair very well, it kind of more pushes it out of the way and you have to take a few whacks at it. But all in all a decent product, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Very painful to use and not very strong.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well for behind your ears, back of your neck, and touching up all areas. It lasts a very long time on two standard AA batteries, too. Multiple attachments and grease are included too.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.  I just needed something for travel and this fit the bill.  I use it daily to keep a stubble look and for other trimming.  Works wonderful.</li>
            <li> this replace my old one that just plain got old</li>
            <li> Only used this three times and it still turns on but doesn&#x27;t shave. So very unhappy with this product</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new trimmer!</li>
            <li> Yeah, I think he uses it for his head hair though, not for facial hair. But he says he likes it!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t trim the edges very well but it is okay!</li>
            <li> This product is cheap and it looks the part.  The batteries don&#x27;t sit in the trimmer properly and the trimmer worked once, the first time I put batteries in, then never worked again.  This item is not worth even the low price.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> kinda weak. pulls hair. good for small trimming. no recharge</li>
            <li> For 12.00 shipped to my house, this is the best trimmer.  It&#x27;s not going to compete with a professional clippers however for light and simple grooming works great.</li>
            <li> Batteries for really quickly, and it&#x27;s difficult to clip away thick hair. The clippers get stuck and stop temporarily.</li>
            <li> Great father&#x27;s day gift!!</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting</li>
            <li> If your beard has you looking like a wolf man, this is the best trimmer! Several attachable blade lengths  Plus a nose/ear trimmer this will clean you up. I have had several trimmers but this is well made with a nice even trim.</li>
            <li> He is obviously not very durable . disposable somewhat</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive and very portable trimmer and found this.  While the case is plastic and feels cheap the trimmer is effective.  The one problem I have had is that my beard hair tends to be pretty course and sometimes it takes multiple passes on the same area to get decent results.  The included nose-hair trimmer also works very well. I had one from another company and it would sometimes yank the hairs out instead of trimming them and so far I have not had the same problem with this one.  Batteries do go quickly so I think when its time to replace this one I will bite the bullet and buy a rechargeable. But if price is your main factor this one works just fine!</li>
            <li> Nice set. I got this set for Christmas and use it often. The only complaint is the batteries do not last all that long, but that is no real problem.&lt;br /&gt;Nice to take on a trip and use in a hotel room before a big meeting.</li>
            <li> The trimmers do not work!!!!!!!!!!! At all I tried and tried!! It wouldn&#x27;t buy this junk. Just go somewhere and buy them in person. The return policy is bullock I&#x27;m sure!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Item was shipped quickly and came as described.</li>
            <li> The hair tremmor does the job, but sometimes pulls the hair and dosen&#x27;t cut. Overall good.</li>
            <li> I have always used this brand and type ( rechargeable type too) for cutting my sons hair. Its a must for over and around the ears!! a MUST. Helps style and helps even the back up..( use GENTLY on the neck)  I also use scissors but these help out so much.</li>
            <li> not the best but for the price it&#x27;s perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;the big beard trimmer works very good. but the smell nose trimmer has a little problem&lt;br /&gt;you have to press hard on it in order for it to work. don&#x27;t know why. that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m only giving it 4 star!</li>
            <li> It is a bit loud, but does the intended job of trimming.  Nice bonus getting the ear and nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought a ear and nose trimmer for my husband for Christmas, but I was dissapointed in the product. It works and everything, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. The picture is misleading. I would suggest to write a better product description. Overall, the shipping was fine, I was able to get it in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Was delivered on time works great for the price</li>
            <li> Wahl was once the name in trimming and grooming electric razor products. I have had several Wahl hair trimmers. They are great! With a little care and minor fixes over the years, they seem to last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the case with this beard trimmer. I bought this over all other options because of the Wahl name.&lt;br /&gt;However, it has been a disappointment to me ever since I first took it out of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life was never very long. It always seems to run at under half a charge, although it is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is unfortunate that even when the battery is dead and the unit is plugged into the chord into the wall, it will not work until it is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;It never had enough juice or power to trim my measly attempts at a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I curse this thing every time I use it. It is so low on power that the blades stop as soon as they touch my beard. So it hurts like hell every time that I take it to my face. It catches my hairs and hurts so bad. I no longer use it. I had to look it up on the web to see if others hated this product as much as I do. I get so mad that I just want to smash it to bits every time. Ugh!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this beard trimmer if you are older than 14. I think for a teen growing peach fuzz, this might work for a year or two. But not for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pure junk. Wahl is crap. Walk is no longer a quality brand, if they are making sub-par products under their name. The Wahl name forever tarnished.</li>
            <li> until now the cut hair machine have a good function, is recomended to other people that would like to buy it</li>
            <li> Never worked, they must have this problem because when I went to return it I was told to not worry about sending it back....the garbage it went.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer only once a week but I love it. I trims really well. It cuts close on my neck. The price is great. I recommend this trimmer. And the nose trimmer works great.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED, THIS PRODUCT ONLY WORKED ONE TIME. I THOUGHT THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE BATTERIES. I WENT OUT AND PURCHASED A FRESH SET OF AA ALKALINES AND INSTALLED THEM PER THE MANUFACTURERS INSTRUCTIONS. THE TRIMMER RAN FOR TWO SECONDS AND THEN SHUT IT SELF OFF. I HAVE SENT IT BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER TWO WEEKS AGO. I STILL HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM THEM.</li>
            <li> Very handy.. total value for money</li>
            <li> This is the second set I&#x27;ve purchased for my husband.  He has a beard and moustache he&#x27;s always messing with.  This is a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; set.. but it seems to work for a reasonable amount of time considering the price.  I wish they&#x27;d make a better set that was meant for &amp;#34;smaller&amp;#34; jobs.  Haven&#x27;t found it yet.</li>
            <li> The blades bite.. haha..&lt;br /&gt;Its a fine trimmer... have used the nose one yet. Will update later.</li>
            <li> its not sharp enough , it hardly takes off anything -_- ... better said dull ! .. i wouldnt recommend it ! but (Y) got it on time</li>
            <li> I had a Conair rechargable.  Unfortunately I lost the cord to recharge it so I picked up this one. Wow, was that a mistake.    I don&#x27;t have a very thick beard, yet I found I had to go over the same spots again and again to get any sort of semblance of evenness.     It tears at my hairs at times and can be somewhat painful.    It makes a LOT of noise.</li>
            <li> This is the best \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; trimmer I have purchased. It says it does not pull hairs but every now and then it does. Seems to have a pretty strong little motor. Even if it last 6 months I would be happy</li>
            <li> Works, however the Wahl 91143-100 trimmer model 5537NIs a step down in quality versus my 1999 era Wahl Groomsman.  The on off switch has a &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; undocumented middle setting of super high speed.</li>
            <li> It has a good motor speed. Can trim for basic purposes. Very nice in terms of cost and gives you value of money.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is really cool it comes in so handy and the fact that it has a battery awesome (y)</li>
            <li> Works well with plenty of power, long battery life.</li>
            <li> Works well,My husband has used it several times and likes the way it works.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  The product is not exceptionally sturdy but it is properly priced and it does the job.   I am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband, he likes the little stand that organizes all the accessories. It&#x27;s good value for money. It&#x27;s versatile enough to meet all of his needs - trims his face hair &amp; sideburns, prunes eyebrows &amp; nose/ear hairs, etc! You can&#x27;t cut hair (on your head) with it though.</li>
            <li> great item and seller.fast shipping</li>
            <li> Came with bonus nose trimmer which doesn&#x27;t fit in the caddy... wish it did.  Happy otherwise</li>
            <li> Very practical and handy</li>
            <li> THIS APPLIANCE IS SMALL AND EASY TO USE.  IT IS SHARP AND FITS MY HAND PERFECTLY. IT GETS IN SMALL CURVES.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this.!!!! hair get stuck in the blade and would be really painful to you.  I bought this item from Walmart and returned it.</li>
            <li> Ive used Wahl products for many years now, you can never go wrong with their quality or with their prices</li>
            <li> This is such a deal! For just 10 bucks, you get a lot of grooming tools with this set and all the trimmers work exceptionally well. They are all very easy to use and use AA batteries. The batteries lasts long, meaning the trimmers consume not too much energy. I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> the product did not last long it stop working within in 4 months would never buy this item again for my husband he was very upset. I have never had any problems with anything I have purchase on amazon but this product will never purchase suggest that anyone purchase this item it will not last long at all.</li>
            <li> already died after one use</li>
            <li> Great gift for my son.  He was very pleased.  Quick shipping and a great price.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> THE ITEM IN ITSELF HAS A GREAT QUALITY LOOKING (JUST BY LOOKING, I DID NOT USE IT). NEVERTHELESS, IF YOU ARE FOCUSED ON A BATTERY OPERATED TRIMMER, BE AWARE THAT THE BATTERY IS NOT INTEGRATED.    WHEN I PLACED MY ORDER, THAT IS WHAT I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT, AND THIS ITEM REQUIRES 2 AA BATTERIES.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is surprisingly powerful, considering it runs on just 2 AA batteries.  With all the accessories and the bonus ear/nose contraption, it&#x27;s also a darn good value.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and it&#x27;s really awesome!&lt;br /&gt;A bit loud but it&#x27;s nothing to complaint about</li>
            <li> Good to have, works as expected.</li>
            <li> Batteries don&#x27;t fit in cover.  One has to be lower than the other making for bad contact.  Batteries run out very quickly, i would guess because of the bad contact.  Cuts ok, to about a 4 star level but basically feel like i wasted my money.  Have had similar products that cost less than half the price for about the same level of problems.</li>
            <li> I brought this as a back up because I keep losing the charger for my better set. anyway I only use this for facial hair and I don&#x27;t grow it for very long but if the batteries are fresh (using duracell batteries so no excuses) the thing isn&#x27;t strong enough to cut my facial hair... like really? really SO weak</li>
            <li> Really trims my husband&#x27;s gotee great!</li>
            <li> Hard to open, but still a great product for the money.</li>
            <li> I know for $7.95 what can you expect. The noise this machine makes is louder that my weed eater and it&#x27;s electrical. I turned it on heard the noise and it went right into the dumpster. My wife just looked at me and said :I told you so&amp;#34;. Is okay.</li>
            <li> The trimmer guard with 3 bars works great for my beard. The nose/ear trimmer is like a little weedwacker in a tube. You have to get the hairs to go into the tube to cut them. Overall, a professional quality product at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> As someone with long hair, and a glorious beard, my girlfriend questioned this purchase. She didn&#x27;t complain when I exited the bathroom freshly manscaped and nose hairs gone. Step your game up guys.</li>
            <li> This looked like just the thing he was asking for so I ordered it. I was a little apprehensive because i didn&#x27;t actually see the real thing but my husband seems very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This was ordered as a gift for the Holidays and upon checking after Xmas...it was not delivered...  And Amazon&#x27;s policy is no questions after a month...  I guess it is my loss...!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the blades chipped. Now the blades won&#x27;t cut cut hair. Also the guard/clip on broke. Do not reccomend.</li>
            <li> ... was broken but the people were wonderful and issued me a prompt refund so, A+ seller</li>
            <li> I like this little guy. Its great to take on the road. I don&#x27;t like the limited amount of length adjustment pieces, but still gets the job done for a short beard. I&#x27;f you have a long beard, like I did... Buy one that has an adjustable head built on to it. I was considering a more expensive one, but needed 11 bucks more in my order to get free shipping. :)    Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it. I do miss my long beard, I&#x27;ts cold now.. :(</li>
            <li> I had a strange experience with this one: When I first received the product, everything was fine, except for the bonus trimmer, which just wouldn&#x27;t work even with a new battery. I asked for a replacement from Amazon and they promptly sent me one, but the second bonus trimmer had the same problem. I was very disappointed that Wahl wasn&#x27;t living up to its good name, but then coincidentally I discovered that the (+) terminal of the battery in the trimmer wasn&#x27;t coming in contact. Placed a tiny piece of aluminum foil on that terminal, and voilà! worked like a charm. Wahl might have to do something about that one. In the meantime, buyers be informed - this problem is solvable.    Another thing was - the first beard trimmer worked well, but the second one was tugging on my stubble - and avoiding that was what their ad was all about!!! Didn&#x27;t want to dwell on it, so I just sent the replacement back, and kept the first one. At least that one lived up to what they claimed. It&#x27;s been running forever on the same pair of batteries. I can feel the power when it runs. It&#x27;s strong, tough and gets the job done. In comparison with the Philips trimmers, I&#x27;d say that this one is slightly inconvenient as you have to keep changing the trimming attachments, as opposed the simple sliding adjustment on the Philips. But I&#x27;ve had a Philips before and its internal rechargeable battery doesn&#x27;t last long, and it isn&#x27;t as powerful as the Wahl. Even the nose trimmer in this one isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s kinda delicate, but does its work well. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very cheap razor.  It works but not well.  In my experience, my beard was pulled many times by the trim guard.  That was not fun.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price!!</li>
            <li> Basic trimmer, works okay, requires a battery.  Very good value, based on its capabilities and the price.</li>
            <li> This razor operates OK but it is a battery hog. It loses power very fast. The ear and nose clipper is just too weak to be effective. I really expected more from a prominent brand like Wahl.</li>
            <li> It may be cheap, but it&#x27;s all I need, and it does a great job. Sturdy construction, useful extras, and it comes with a small container of oil for the blades.</li>
            <li> easy to store and carry, good cutting power</li>
            <li> Inexpensive product. You get what you pay for. This kit wIll work for travel.</li>
            <li> works great /will buy again for gifts</li>
            <li> For the price, this trimmer isn&#x27;t too shabby.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and it does it well.  I do wish it had some longer guides though, as the longest one leaves my hair only about 2 or 3 millimeters long, which is just barely long enough for a short beard.  However, my biggest complaint is that it burns through batteries when it&#x27;s not even turned on.  If I leave fresh batteries sitting in the clipper, they nearly die within a week.  The nose hair trimmer is even more of an energy vampire, and it will completely kill a battery left in it for a week.  The solution is, of course, to take the batteries out when done shaving, but that&#x27;s a bit of a hassle.  I&#x27;d recommend this kit to anyone shopping on a tight budget.  However, if you can afford something better, you should probably buy something better.  Update after 9 months: The nose hair trimmer has totally stopped working, so I&#x27;ve removed another star.  The beard trimmer is still sucking batteries dry, but it functions.</li>
            <li> Purchased this in January have used it two or times as I go to the barber and have my beard trimmed... But the nose trimmer will not work I have two new batteries with no success. Very cheap (so was the price) I had a older Wahl  trimmer and hair cutter worked for 10 years (hair cutter has worked for over 20 yrs). Wahl is a quality brand this is a piece of crap. Maybe through the years they have lost their touch! I need a reliable groomer and this is very cheap quality... Not worth the aggravation..</li>
            <li> for the price this product is great. OHhh BTW this products only takes AA batteries. I couldn&#x27;t find that in any of the descriptions anywhere than finally I just bought it and thought I would figure it out. Otherwise its really good for the price. I recommend it for something small quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very good product for the price. It does a pretty good job of trimming. Not as much power as a corded item would be but very acceptable.</li>
            <li> Just got my new Wahl Cordless trimmer and LOVE IT!  It replaced one that I had for 10 years, and is a dramatic step up at HALF the cost of the old one.  Add the nose/ear hair trimmer and I frankly don&#x27;t know how they can sell it so cheap!  Not that I&#x27;m complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with a beard should buy one!</li>
            <li> The item does not work</li>
            <li> Pretty good pretty good.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, light weight and packable. You do need to trim your beard before if you want to shave it all. Works well for a trim.</li>
            <li> This was a great price but is very loud!  I don&#x27;t have use for many of the accessories and the cheap stand does not have room for all the included attachments.</li>
            <li> I tried growing my beard out and needed a razor to keep it trimmed - this was perfect for that. I didn&#x27;t need a huge expensive, state-of-the-art razor because I was only experimenting. It is rather cheaply made (as others have said), but it works great and does not pull my facial hair at all. I would make the same decision and purchase this item again!</li>
            <li> Works well for shaving down there :) Just remember to use a safety clip/position guide (included) and not use it directly. I learnt that the hard way.</li>
            <li> This Wahl trimmer does the job......!!!! It&#x27;s battery battery operated so it&#x27;s good when the power goes out in the house.  The selector trim comb gets somewhat stuck when it&#x27;s BEng adjusted but hey for the price what can you expect.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as the one I have at home (also a Wahl) which is rechargeable and is better overall in quality.&lt;br /&gt;However for a travel unit it is pretty good and with one blade guide drops into my shaving kit nicely.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent supplier!</li>
            <li> Use frequently since purchased 8 months ago and running on same batteries.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he says after turning it on it immediately starts to lose power. Not a good gift, I&#x27;m afraid. Of course he told me weeks later so too late to send back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Great product, Perfect for those who want to look good while sporting a beard or goatee. Makes keeping it looking good easy</li>
            <li> I bought this not for the trimmer, but for the guards as we could not find replacement guards for my husband&#x27;s trimmer.  (His is not battery operated, this one is.)</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer, which was a Remington brand, recently stopped working. So, I decided to look for another affordable trimmer and ended up deciding on this one. For $11-12, you really shouldn&#x27;t be expecting too much. It does the basic job of a quick facial hair clean up. I&#x27;ve been using this to trim my beard, as well as on my side burns and it meets my needs. I don&#x27;t consider myself to have a thick beard, which is why I am not spending more money on a better beard trimmer. I haven&#x27;t experienced any significant pulling on my hair while using this trimmer as some reviewers have mentioned. Made of plastic, but seems durable enough. The base stand holds everything nicely, except for the nose trimmer. The nose trimmer is inefficient. Only manages to get bits of my nose hair. Haven&#x27;t made use of the comb or oil yet and the brush seems useless in my opinion. Overall, a great product that&#x27;s worth its value.</li>
            <li> LOL I thought I could trim my hair with it NOT. My head looks like I was hit in the head with mini golf balls. My daughter and I thought it was a good idea to take the guards off as with them we couldn&#x27;t really trim my hair. I&#x27;m African American with sort of naturally curly hair .Its great for Bikini line. I love the quality everything about it nice but trust it when it says its for BEARD&#x27;s.... LOL</li>
            <li> At first, i kinda hesitate to buy this because i couldn&#x27;t believe the price for this whole set was less than $10! And i kept comparing with other brand, fancy looking, and of course evaluate the reviews as much i appreciate. After some comparison, i chose this and i have no regret! See the pictures as attached, i cut my husband&#x27;s hair every 2-3 weeks. Previously i spent about 45mins to an hour to cut my husband&#x27;s hair with only using scissor, but now with Wahl cordless trimmer, i only spent 25mins with touch up via scissor.</li>
            <li> The machine looks pretty good so far! This was my first time using such trimmer, and I am satisfied with it. I think it is worth the price. Good deal! :)</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer works great, it has power and does not tug or rip at hairs. The nose trimmer that comes with it was great, until it broke three months into owning it. I hope the trimmer has a much longer lifespan.</li>
            <li> Broke the first use. Not powerful enough for close shave. Works just to trim ends on large beards. But if you wanted a number one forget it. Shipping was excellent.</li>
            <li> Bought for trimming beard only. Meets my demands. Very nice for the price. Have used several weeks &amp; battries are still doing fine. You get what you pay for &amp; I am not disappointed</li>
            <li> I never did have a beard trimmer before.  Trust me.  It&#x27;s better than nothing!  The ear and nose instrument has performed quite well.</li>
            <li> should be rechargeable</li>
            <li> I bought this two babies along a CONAIR full size trimmer and ended up not using the big fella&#x27;. This are powerful and very well made, I practically did my whole head with with the beard trimmer. The best part is that the comb lengths match the CONAIR, so you can alternate between them to do fades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWEET DEAL.</li>
            <li> This clipper does a good job, but it&#x27;s much louder than I would have expected from Wahl.  The clipper takes 2 AA batteries and the nose hair trimmer takes 1.  I actually like not having to charge it myself.</li>
            <li> excellent price, very good product, thank you</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does everything specified and more than expected.  Plenty of different trims and the biggest guard has 3 different levels.  Very helpful as a beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> My husband is really picky about his personal grooming item. He is really happy with this combo of items. Well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Still kicking after almsot 2 years and still sharp great product.</li>
            <li> I had a Conair trimmer I used for years.  I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I received this one.  So much better!</li>
            <li> except for the clam shell packaging this is a great product...works with inexpensive batteries and the bonus ear, nose trimmer works great. will gladly purchase again if necessary</li>
            <li> I liked and recommend.</li>
            <li> This is s very good product. It met my expectations.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t let me purchase 2 of them!!!??? I guess either my son or my husband is not getting one! :((</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for the past 4 years.  Before that, I didn&#x27;t keep a beard/used a razor.  However, after 2 Norelco products bricked (stopped working for no apparent reason), I decided it was time for a change.  This shaver has been an amazing surprise for under $10.  pros:  cheap  comes with a few attachments  bonus nose trimmer  cons:  cutting blades are really narrow (can&#x27;t go too fast)  Cutting performance:  I&#x27;ve found the blade&#x27;s initial ability to be adequate (only one week of use at time of review.  If status changes, review will too.)  I&#x27;ve seen some comments about how it will pull the hairs right out of you.  I found truth to that statement.  However, if you go slower, this is not a problem.  The cutting blades resemble a well built, but $10 trimmer.  Thus, don&#x27;t think you can give Chewbacca that close trim he&#x27;s always dreamed of in 5 minutes.  You have to go much slower than other razors would allow, but it gets the job done.  Features:  I was not looking for something that came with its own built in rechargeable battery.  I have plenty of rechargeable AA&#x27;s (I use Sanyo Eneloops).  I find it much more convenient to be able to slip in a new battery than worry about keeping it charged.  I have not tried an alkaline battery in it, but I could not imagine the trimmer performing any better with one.  The packaging claims 3 hours of battery life.  I have not accurately measured this, but I wouldn&#x27;t say an underestimate.  Trimmer takes 2 batteries.  Nose trimmer takes 1.  Overall:  Unless this thing breaks down within a year, I think its a great choice for light trimming needs.  I&#x27;ve heard the quote, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t afford to buy cheap things.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m hoping this isn&#x27;t a trinket that isn&#x27;t made to last.  It feels about as sturdy as my previous, more expensive Norelco models.  However, unless that day comes before a year&#x27;s use (hopeful much much longer), my review will stand.</li>
            <li> Saved me a ton of money visiting the barber shop :)</li>
            <li> I use to keep the scruff neat - especially the mustache.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the stand does not hold all of the attachments.</li>
            <li> FINALLY THE WHOLE DEAL, AND WORKS WELL</li>
            <li> It stopped working after 3-4 uses. Sending it back.</li>
            <li> good for weak hair, it wont cut my beard ... only my chest hair ...</li>
            <li> This kit does a great job of helping me with my excessive hair problem and the batteries seem to have a nice long life.</li>
            <li> I used it but found not comfortable. Won&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this product. It feels like it&#x27;s scracthcing my skin.</li>
            <li> My Husband likes it alot. Works fine and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Works well</li>
            <li> batteries wear out after 1 use</li>
            <li> Husband chose this for shaving his delicate skin.  Seems to enjoy using it without having his skin ripped apart by a razor.</li>
            <li> Drains battery pretty quickly</li>
            <li> I bought a Wahl clipper over twenty years ago and it has been working great until I lost it. This new trimmer looks great and of course feels good to handle. I love it.</li>
            <li> My husband will enjoy this for a Christmas Gift. He has been using his old Beard Trimmer for over 10yrs. His saying is&lt;br /&gt;that if it&#x27;s not broke don&#x27;t change it. But I will let Santa change it for him!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he needed one. He especially liked this one because of the nose trimmer. After opening the product, we realized the stand to hold everything, has no place to put the nose trimmer. BUMMER! Overall, I like this product and would recommend it, but the stand needs a place for everything in the package.</li>
            <li> good things come in small packages and even better when the price was small too. Wahl came highly recommended. Im glad I chose this company.</li>
            <li> Beard trimmer is not as sharp as it should be.  Nose hair remover is just o.k.  Next order I will upgrade.</li>
            <li> I received this kit and opened the packaging and assembled it as the directions instructed. It did not work. The ear/nose trimmer worked fine, but the beard trimmer never started, which rendered all the other accessories useless. This made me disgruntled and more importantly I then had to go out and buy one at the store so that I would be clean for work. I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This is the worst piece of junk I have EVER purchased. It is a complete waste of money. Don&#x27;t be a fool. Buy something else.</li>
            <li> This machine cut my skin and caused couple of bloody spots in my face which should not happen with this kind of cordless battery operated trimmers. I don&#x60;t recommend it to any one. Instead of this you can buy a mac3 blade for half a dollar.</li>
            <li> I had a rechargeable shaver that provided a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;This works very well, I would recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;The long lasting batteryen  trims my beard and thins it out when needed.&lt;br /&gt;The nose and ear trimmwe works vwey well&lt;br /&gt;For such an inexpensive shaver trimmer it performs above expectations.</li>
            <li> this product is great and will be buying more for Christmas this year. love all the tools and gadgetsa t</li>
            <li> Nothing but a piece of junk. Only thing that worked was the nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> a good bundle for a fair price,,,,gotta have really good batteries to make them work well</li>
            <li> Love this. Not just for guys!!  I use it on my neckline as I wear my hair short and to shave my neck below the neckline.&lt;br /&gt;I took my old one that was still working and trimmed my puppys face and around his eyes and also did his feet in between groomings so that I could see to cut his nails.</li>
            <li> This product worked for about a week, and now will not turn-on.  Very disappointed in this Wahl product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product good seller</li>
            <li> Well nice , love the fact it is very well made. come with all the extras.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/3/2015&lt;br /&gt;Not pad for the price but do get rusted so need to be cleaned.</li>
            <li> This is a real good kit for the person who&#x27;s just starting to learn to trim a beard, everything is included! Would make a great gift for any manly man!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because the last Wahl he had broke. He is absolutely happy with this because he said it gets the job done. It cuts great and seems like it will last him for awhile. The best thing is the interchangeable blades that it comes with.  I would say go ahead and purchase it. You cant go wrong</li>
            <li> I had to give five star simply because of what you get for the price.  I had this for a couple years now and I still depend on it for trimming my mustache and goatee, and of course nose hair.  I don&#x27;t use all the attachments but I love the size and how nice it trims.  It holds a nice long charge also on the battery.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Product for the last two weeks and have been pleased with it&#x27;s performance.  I primarily purchased it for the beard trimmer but was also pleased with the nose hair clipper...so far.</li>
            <li> Hubby thinks it&#x27;s great. Love&#x27;s all the attachments. Very good value.</li>
            <li> This nose trimmer does not work regualily and does little to actually keep my nose hairs trimmed.  Why can&#x27;t someone manufacture a product that does what it is supposed to do?</li>
            <li> Broke after one use, very disappointed,</li>
            <li> very cheaply made . don&#x27;t work well at all</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m lazy and let my beard fill out. Then I trim it with this. Then I shave. Great methodology.&lt;br /&gt;Great Price!</li>
            <li> Works fairly well, but not as well as prior model made in Illinois, as this one was made in China.</li>
            <li> The holding carrier does not officially hold nose clipper, a little tight. Other than that everything was great.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for any guy comes with all kinds of extras which makes up for the perfect shave and the brand itself is one that I can trust.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;-Lot&#x27;s of attachments&lt;br /&gt;-Bonus nose and ear trimmer&lt;br /&gt;-Walh name&lt;br /&gt;-Great at cutting through my very thick facial hair&lt;br /&gt;-Good for trimming body and pubic hair. Don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting your manhood or ladyhood lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons.&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap plastic&lt;br /&gt;-Takes AA batteries but has good battery life&lt;br /&gt;-Wish it was rechargeable lithium but it was 10 bucks so get over it you babies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this face and body hair trimmer, great value but if you have low self-esteem and have to buy the most expensive products than this isn&#x27;t for you</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, no problems so far.</li>
            <li> I forgot to put a review on this also...I got my on this beginning of the week monday..im glad it came through and  its a good gift to my dad for his fathers day...this will make him happy because he needs it and so I thought why not give him this...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trim my beard too often, so I decided to pick up this item, considering the price is very low.  In hindsight, I should&#x27;ve spent the extra 5 or 10 dollars to give another brand a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will consistently and frequently pull hair.  Probably once ever 3 seconds or so of trimming.  While everything else about this product is fine, all the different size trimming replacements and the nose trimmer works fairly well, the fact that it yanks out hairs so often makes this product 2 out of 5 in my eyes.  It&#x27;ll likely get tossed and replaced very soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re really pressed for money and need something compact and convenient, this may be for you.  But if you use a beard trimmer frequently, you&#x27;re looking at the wrong product.</li>
            <li> This is a good cheap set of clippers for someone who has a short beard.  If you have a longer beard it will not work for you.  I also like the nose trimmer.  For the money it is a decent buy.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this works great the guides fit good , sturdy and trims well I will recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a well made trimmer. Guards are a bit puny.  This is one of the best values even after paying the freight.  It is a bit loud however.  Have to wear ear plugs when using it.</li>
            <li> Between trips to the barber shop, I find this kit a good way to trim my \\&quot;soup strainer\\&quot; mustache, clean up my beard a bit, clean up nose and ear hairs, and trim my eyebrows. It runs on 2 easily replaceable AA batteries so it cuts sufficiently easily that I don&#x27;t overdo it but it does not snag.</li>
            <li> As a bald man I use this to cut the hair I have on the side and back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;It save me $15.00 every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand before, so I thought I would get it again since it&#x27;s inexpensive and it used to get the job done. However, after receiving this particular model I used it once. Just once for a quick edging up of my beard. A few days later I tried to use it again and it wouldn&#x27;t even power on. Replaced the batteries- still nothing. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> now have to lean to cut hair</li>
            <li> Good product, but no have battery.</li>
            <li> Nice set of accessories but not a high-end machine (which is something you should expect when paying anything less than $50).</li>
            <li> So far this is amazing for the value! I do recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my first 1 star review in Amazon. I am using this product for past 2 weeks and used it less then 3-4 times. During first use itself without the plastic I could sense some bite on my skin. But yesterday even when using with most gentle pressure this thing gave me a nasty cut. I guess will use the trimmer only with plastic on. Peace of utter junk. Please do yourself a favor and buy something else.</li>
            <li> Beard trimmer is great for pulling hair but not for cutting it.  I do not have thick facial hair at all and it is unable to do anything besides tug and pull.  Waste of $10</li>
            <li> It runs on batteries which make it so weak to cut the hear of the head or the hear of the beard.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very efficient for the price. It trims relatively close or as much as you want without giving you any kind of problems. Personally, the only con about this product I believe is the noise it produces while its trimming. The noise is loud enough to be heard outside the bathroom. Other than that, the trimmer is perfect as far as the performance is concerned. The bonus trimmer is also very good at doing its job. A heads up though, make sure water does not come in contact with the lower battery side of both of the trimmers. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend, who was happy like me. for its price-performance value.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful, useful for small trims, as reviewed previously.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> noisier than anticipated. not meant for rough hair</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for for this price? I just needed something to trim once or twice a week. It works fantastically. No hangups, no pulling hairs, the guide lengths are consistent. Even if it breaks within a year it was still worth the $10!</li>
            <li> With fresh batteries, this thing has the energy of a slug.  It bogs down on every single pass and comes to a halt --  it just stops even though it is turned on.  Tapping on it bring is back to life.  The razor catches and pulls on every pass making for a painful beard trim.  It was like this out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a Wahl Peanut razor and love it, so I had some brand loyalty when I needed a razor that I could use outside the United States without having to plug into different types of sockets.  That&#x27;s the reason I bought this razor -- it runs on batteries.  I can&#x27;t say huge disappointment cause I guess you get what you pay for, and this thing was cheap.  But it&#x27;s also a piece of junk.  Don&#x27;t waste your $10.  Better off paying a little more for a razor that works.</li>
            <li> this is the first trimmer I have used. It works better than I antisipated. I would recommend it for others.</li>
            <li> quality is really good in this price</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a month. I even changed the batteries and still not working.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer works fine. The nose trimmer never worked. It was too much trouble to send it back.</li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer simply does not work, as in it won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> Sad to see a great, old mid-western company manufacture their products in China rather than Ohio.</li>
            <li> Trimmer does a very nice job.  Only problem is the on/off switch intermittently won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11/1/15:&lt;br /&gt;The unit finally just refused to turn on.  Batteries were checked and found to be good. The amount of time had lapsed to return the device so I disassembled it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was a massive buildup of hair inside the entire unit, especially in the vicinity of the on/off switch. The hair had actually isolated the contact from the switch to the motor which was the reason for non-operation.  I cleaned the entire unit with a soft brush and compressed air and re-assembled it.  Now it runs BETTER than when it was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent an email to &amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34; explaining the buildup of hair only to let them know that a design change was needed.  I received a &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; response directing me on how to routinely clean and oil the clippers.  Another &amp;#34;well known&amp;#34; brand name that has entered the great swirl and vortex down the drain and into oblivion.</li>
            <li> This set is worth double what you pay for it. There are so many pieces to it. My boyfriend had a field day when I gave it to him. He prefers this trimmer set over the other two he has tried out.</li>
            <li> This is a case of you get what you pay for.  While the unit works, even the nest brand of batteries provides clippers that move at a very slow rate, that do not trim your beard very well at all.</li>
            <li> This product is cheaply made with low grade plastic, but it works and it&#x27;s priced right.</li>
            <li> Great value, easy to use, and non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;Just threw in a couple batteries and it was ready to go. The guides are easy to use and change out, the trimmer itself is easy and doesn&#x27;t pull, and the extra tools help out too! :)</li>
            <li> Switch o Big trimmer is kind of touchy  Does not seem like it makes good contact and acts like the battery I weak. have to jiggle it around to make it work.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a cheap trimmer.  However, when i opened it and put batteries in it the product would not turn on.  After trying 4 sets of different new batteries I found some that worked.  Then 1 month later batteries are dead.  It won&#x27;t take an regular AA battery you have to buy the really nice ones.  Wish I had not bought.  The nose trimmer is okay it does the job and the batteries worked.  That is a regular AA battery.  The station holds the trimmer but not the nose trimmer.  Not sure why they would do that.</li>
            <li> They are decent clippers for cleaning lining up the hair. Not expensive and does the job. the batterie don&#x27;t run out fast either.</li>
            <li> After only a dozen uses, the trimmer became painfully louder, routinely cut skin, and started ripping my hairs out while trimming (progressively worse).  I laughed when I re-read the \\&quot;no snag guarantee*\\&quot;.  I oiled the trimmer as described in the manual.  I&#x27;m going to contact Wahl under warranty, otherwise it&#x27;s going in the garbage for $10.</li>
            <li> Not happy would not have purchased if I knew it was a battery operated one I like the rechargeable ones Thanks</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a low cost trimmer this is it. If you are looking for a good high quality trimmer this is not it. It feels and operate cheap, and it makes to much noise and the vibration in my hand to much. Spend a little more money for a better trimmer, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much from this beard trimmer. However, I hoped the hairs on my face would not be torn out every couple of seconds. Using this beard trimmer, I had to take a break halfway through due to my frustration with having the hairs torn off my face. This product is complete garbage.</li>
            <li> I have used this product only once, but it served its purpose very well. I shaved my facial hair with ease and I had no pain or hang ups. This product is both cheap, effective and overall a great value. I would highly recommend this product for several reasons. Number one being the price. I paid just over 10 USD for this item. Most personal shavers cost much more than this and come with less. This product comes with everything you need to keep your facial hair in check. It even comes with a nose and ear hair trimmer! I fact that it comes with a warranty and is battery powered makes this unit a must buy. Not only do they replace the product if it breaks, but the warranty goes well beyond what most companies offer. Being battery powered, you will never have to worry about an electrical mis-hap in the bathroom. It would not be good to get shocked by a cord when you have a very sharp metal razor right near your face. ;)</li>
            <li> Purchased it and returned it. It just didn&#x27;t have the power of a 120volt trimmer and its not like I was trimming my hair just eye brows and side burns.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my boyfriend for Christmas and he absolutley loves it! He really likes how he is able to change the clipper part of it. I only gave it 4 stars because it does kinda suck that it is battery powered and not able to be plugged into the wall to charge. Other than that great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> Very happy with product</li>
            <li> Terrible product. AA battery operated, poor performance, inconsistent trim speed due to battery cycle. cheaply made and way too small.  I should have read the reviews before I purchased. Big mistake.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  Performs as described.  A bit of a power hog, requires fairly frequent battery changes.</li>
            <li> Battery powered. The clippers are very loud. Causes my ears to ring I think these are used for a quick shape up.</li>
            <li> serious value, last one lasted over two years and I only had to replace because I broke it</li>
            <li> excellent product, good quality.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a tad more power, but for the price I&#x27;m still happy.</li>
            <li> Great product! recommended!</li>
            <li> most of what ill write has been stated in other reviews, but here u go. the trimmer is dirt cheap, so i didnt have the highest of expectations. i knew going in this wasnt gonna replace my plug-in trimmer, but i wanted something for traveling convenience. the machine does what its supposed to do and trims ur beard, but dont expect the cleanest of trims. therell be some antennae ticking out here and there, or u can be more deliberate and take a bit longer with the trimmer to get a more uniform, cleaner cut. its plastic and lightweight, plus it runs on batteries so its great for traveling, especially on shorter trips or trips with multiple stops where u may not have an outlet for awhile. i personally use it as a travel trimmer to save space in my bag, i keep a wahl peanut plug-in trimmer at home. that said, i wouldnt rely on this to clean me up for a business trip. its just not gonna give u the cleanest of cuts that u want when presenting urself in a business setting. a nice bonus is the ear and nose trimmer that comes with it. it works well and has a simplistic design so it should last.</li>
            <li> This lasted almost TWO MONTHS!  Barely used as it was only used for trimming eyebrows and back of neck once.  We thought maybe the batteries were dead and changed them three times (with brand new batteries) and it STILL won&#x27;t work.  This is a piece of junk.  Do not buy it!  We are so disappointed.</li>
            <li> does a great job. cant beat the price</li>
            <li> I love this it&#x27;s very nice easy to use.greatfora fathers day gift or</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little trimmer!  A must buy for this price!  If you are truly interested in getting the best product for your money, this is an can&#x27;t miss item.  Even the bonus trimmer works well.  I was truly impressed, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m writing this review.  Trust me, it&#x27;s worth it! :)</li>
            <li> It started to rust out all ready. I never had this issue with a trimmer before like this. Not a good product</li>
            <li> Works really well as an easy beard trimmer...great deal for the price. I am not sure it would be a complete system for all hair needs but overall a good product for the price IMO.</li>
            <li> This was an incredible value for the money.  The bonus nose trimmer was nice too.  This lightweight trimmer is perfect to maneuver.  It was well worth its price.  This is the first cordless trimmer that I have owed.</li>
            <li> Smallest clip does not clip down real low when using it.</li>
            <li> Quality of accessories is not that great and battery runs out of juice quickly.  For the price, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> What should have I expected for 11.00 it works but I  should have spent a little more money and got a better one . for the money decent deal.</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer does not work.Probably should have gone to Google.  I hate this thing.  Take it back or send working nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this for the price. Had the same model for over 5 years but the plastic guard I use most wore out. It was cheaper to buy a new trimmer than replacing the guards!</li>
            <li> Perfect shaving kit to keep my beard in exactly the the shape and thickness I want. The trimmer is extremely powerful and yet gentle on the face and with so many attachment I can get the light trim or close shave I want.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this beard trimmer.  It is a replacement of an old one that has been dropped a few times and had a hard time running any more.  I did keep the old zipper case the old one came in so I could put this new old in it.  I do not care for the stand, since I may take my trimmer on vacations.</li>
            <li> Great feel in hand, balanced and well made with a metal body, and all the attachments for any size beard.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but just don&#x27;t drop it.  The teeth are very thin and chips easily if you drop your clippers from short distances (from your bathroom counter to the rug on your bathroom floor...yes rug on the floor).  So, if you&#x27;re not a clutz like me, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> I am an adult male whose hair grows everywhere but on top of my head, this trimmer helps me maintain a neat appearance of the rest of my head. I recommend that for a useful tool to trim beards, noses and ears, this is worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer works very well, I would give it five stars but it is pretty loud and occasionally will pull a hair instead of cut it.&lt;br /&gt;The batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> Iam using this for last 4 years. really worth for money</li>
            <li> this is a great tool for shaving, but does not cut short beard, anyways it´s a great tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need more offers like this.</li>
            <li> Worked alright the first couple times I used it. Very loud, and cheaply made.. but the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely stopped working after less than 5 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible product.</li>
            <li> using this as a body hair trimmer. does the job the nose hair trimmer works well, reasonably priced good job wahl</li>
            <li> Bought it for my brother and he loves all the accessories that come with it. Have not had any issues so far.</li>
            <li> Works on a AA battery, which lasts a good, long time in this trimmer.  Nose-hair clipper was a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both devices work well, would buy again.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly as usual from amazon and this i was pleased with. The overall quality as in material and weight it what you would expect from a cheaply priced trimmer. What I did not expect however was the rusty blades which seemed to rust just right after the return window expired. I cleaned the blades after use with alcohol and then oiled them with the included clipper oil yet it rusted. I got 2 uses out of it so I guess that&#x27;s just what I would&#x27;ve paid had i been to the barber shop :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy as it wont last. Invest in a Quality product preferably one that had replaceable/changeable blades.</li>
            <li> Product does all that is needed to maintain the trim of my beard will have to determine battery life still running on initial batteries</li>
            <li> I am using Wahl products from long time and happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;These are really and cheap and best.&lt;br /&gt;Mainly I liked this model a lot.</li>
            <li> I think this was a good value though the noise is very loud when you get close to the ears. In this case, the price to pay for style is cheap however loud the product. &#x3D;] Indeed, A necessary manscaping tool.</li>
            <li> Does everything that it is supposed to do and at such a great price.  Not the most heavy duty but it does the job. I have had it a couple of months now and have used it several times and have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
            <li> it got rusted a little bit after 2 weeks, but the power is good...&lt;br /&gt;it is good that it is run by battery (not included) but it was better if it could work with 110V too</li>
            <li> Bought this 2 yrs ago, and have been very happy with it. I use rechargeable batteries and honestly I have not had to recharge them yet, although I only use the shaver about once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little noisy, but so are the larger electric trimmers I&#x27;ve had. It&#x27;s a nice little kit, and being on batteries makes it portable (I bought it originally for car camping and overnight take alongs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it was waterproof,  but so far have not had any problems keeping it dry around the sink &amp; tub!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the $10ish price, it&#x27;s worth it if you want a cordless trimmer. It gets the job done quickly and without fuss.</li>
            <li> The multi position comb is useless. Just throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;The other combs and the both other trimmers are great.</li>
            <li> I was willing to gamble and it paid off. I purchased this today minus the bonus Nose hair trimmer. I own two Wahl clippers that plug into the wall. This one is much smaller and for ten dollars it was worth the possibility that it would be a bad investment. If this trimmer lasts for one month it was money well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just brought it home and put two batteries in it and then proceeded to trim my Stash. I was extremely surprised at the power or speed that it has. It made short work of trimming my Mustache.  I can not speak about battery life but I can say that it seems to me sharper that my other trimmers and because it is small makes it easier too access they area under my Nose and above my upper Lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also cannot comment on the Nose Hair trimmer but what difference does that make? It is a free item. I would guess it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is it works better than expected and for the price it can not be beat.  This is why I gave it five stars.</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers are right, who said that this trimmer is noisy.  It is.  But that might be unavoidable in a device of this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, for a battery-operated machine, it has a nice, hefty feel and does an excellent job.  I have since shaved my beard, but I used it daily for a couple weeks and there was no noticeable weakening of the batteries.  I imagine you would not have to change them more than once every couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the cheapest trimmer I could find since I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to keep my beard.  But I was perfectly happy with the quality of this product, regardless of the price.</li>
            <li> For the price you can not beat. Works great. Still on orginally batteries.</li>
            <li> Excellent beard trimmer/nose hair cutter for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> cutting head doesn&#x27;t accept coarse hair well</li>
            <li> Not a good razor for the price, i mean this ia one od those times when you say &amp;#34;you get what you paid for&amp;#34;! It doesn&#x27;t cut or shave well at all which is surprising because Wahl usually makes good products</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement for my Husbands shaver and he&#x27;s happy so far with this one.&lt;br /&gt;Works really well for the price was very surprised.</li>
            <li> For the price it hasexcededmy expectations so far.</li>
            <li> Misleading from the picture. It shows a space on the base to set the nose trimmer next to the beard trimmer. When in fact it is made to hold the oil, inconvenience.</li>
            <li> For the price you&#x27;re not getting anything special.  The clippers are okay, the nose trimmer stopped working after about a few months (and no, I don&#x27;t have thick nose hair that clogged it up or anything  ;)  It&#x27;s a decent set for as low priced as it is.</li>
            <li> For the price, this thing is great to have around. I actually use it as kind of a backup to a rechargeable panasonic I have, but this once works great. I can tell it&#x27;s more cheaply made, but it still works great and sometimes better than my primary one.</li>
            <li> This is not as i expected it to be. the quality is not very nice and the nose trimmer is totally a jerk start. the blades of the beard trimmer are also of cheap quality and leaves marks. Its a total waste of money</li>
            <li> its good for if your grooming but if you want a close shave this wont cut it</li>
            <li> Good for its price... dont like that its battery set but its works pretty good.</li>
            <li> ARTICLE EXCELLENT, VERY GOOD QUALITY</li>
            <li> Saves me a bunch money, works well</li>
            <li> I used this trimmer from January 2012 until about a week ago, February 2015. I mostly used it for facial hair trimming without any of the guards on. I didn&#x27;t experience any of the pinching or snagging that others had right up until the day it died. Make sure you oil your blade properly! A lot of people don&#x27;t seem to get this. Any mechanical component needs to be oiled well or else it will slowly wear itself out. I still have the nose hair trimmer and have used that without any issues. If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap option and don&#x27;t have to shave every single day, I would grab this set. There are better ones at a higher price range, but these served me well for THREE YEARS at it&#x27;s current price. That&#x27;s crazy value!</li>
            <li> I replaced the same trimmer that died. Probably just a corrosion problem but can&#x27;t be sure. Same as old trimmer, pretty much. It lasted about 3 years.</li>
            <li> I was suprised at how well this product worked. Money well spent.</li>
            <li> Brand new batteries and it lasted 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Have used Wahl brand for years. Quality clippers that are cheaper than I can purchase locally.</li>
            <li> works..but the battery compartment cover doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s being held together by a rubber band ! I wouldnt purchase it again</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect with this inexpensive and battery operated product. But it outperformed the 2 previous Wahl trimmers I owned, which this was a replacement for. It is very powerful and tims well. the batteries last long also. Only downside is not to depend on the nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the beard trimmer but my husband does!  (Aren&#x27;t we glad?)  Anyway, he is really pleased with it &amp; it does more than he expected.  Thank you all very much.</li>
            <li> So far I love this trimmer. It&#x27;s small and yet powerful. I love the little caddy that comes with the trimmer. I use this trimmer for the bikini area and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> perfect item to replace my old trimmers</li>
            <li> As far as the quality of the trimmer, you get what you pay for. I had a wahl trimmer for about 10 years that was plastic, but it was great. This one is cheap plastic that feels like its going to fall apart.  The main drawback is that is sucks that battery life up fast.  The first batteries i put in were cheap, so i upgraded to quality batteries with little difference.  I use it every other day and i say batteries will last maybe a month if you dont mind the pulling when the batteries get worn down.</li>
            <li> Comparing to its price I find it a very good trimmer, so economic in terms of using the battery..maybe the only cons that I found the comb which coming with it is vert sharp but who cares about it since the trimmer is working very good :)</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive, but fully functional grooming item that works perfectly for me. I especially like the ear and nose hair trimmer as an extra. Can&#x27;t beat the value considering the entire system works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randy Lee Harkins</li>
            <li> You gotta be very careful while using this product, it is not so smooth on the skin, i wont blame it on the product, well, its cheap, so might not be a good choice for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this trimmer knowing the package had been opened. What I did not expect was that it would not function at all. I ended up wasting my money, but my fault for taking the risk. I unfortunately threw the packaging away immediately and well before I had batteries to try it. It would have been nice if somebody could have verified it actually worked before reselling it.</li>
            <li> good for pubes. the guard helped so I didn&#x27;t cut my scrote again. that scrote just don&#x27;t stop bleedin even for  a little cut son.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little kit. It works well and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;It would&#x27;ve been nice to have a web link or something on directions for using the attachments and whatnot, how to clean, etc but hey, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> makes more noise than expected. (heavy noise from the motor)</li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard this is not the trimmer for you. Gets the job done but was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are great and very well made.</li>
            <li> For the money, this trimmer is exceptional. It cuts and trims and I have not changed the battery yet. I&#x27;ve had Wahl&#x27;s before and had exceptional service, so why not stay with a winner.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Workmanship of unit is cheap.  Threw it away and got a norelco</li>
            <li> I used to have the older $10 Wahl special, It was a workhorse, not fancy but got the job done easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new one is horrible. It doesn&#x27;t cut hair, takes multiple passes to trim anything, and half the time it just pulls the hair. So there&#x27;s annoying pain w/ 0 hair being trimmed. What&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> This is a good set. I had the other brand trimmer for years. After the first cut I was impressed with the quality of the blade. This has a variable speed.</li>
            <li> This cordless battery operated set is amazing! Works perfect and for a very low price!. Just put a pair of good battery&#x27;s and ready to go!. Do not waste your money trying other expensive trimmers. This set works like a professional one!.</li>
            <li> Product works well but do not like the plastic covers that are used to give different heights to shave with.</li>
            <li> Wahl is known for it&#x27;s quality and it is fair quality for what you pay for, however, if you have a little longer beard, this is not the trimmer for you.  It is always tricky buying an item like this online, because you can&#x27;t get your hands on it and give it a good look.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a month and use it at least twice a week, still using the first set of batteries and it works great. The nose hair trimmer is not the best</li>
            <li> I got this to trim the dogs fur around their face, not strong enough. but it works ok on people hair that is not thick. so keep that in mind</li>
            <li> quality product, works great.</li>
            <li> Works well, does the job.</li>
            <li> Had a trimmer set but lost the charge cord and couldn&#x27;t find a new one. Got this one because it is straight battery powered. Use it several times a week to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> well, its not what i thought. I feel like an idiot. I can&#x27;t explain how unsatisfied I am with this Wahl product.. I really think it costs them $1 to make this item..</li>
            <li> My husband bought this and he couldn&#x27;t be more happier with this set. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Works Great.Very comfortable to use. Comes with all the attachments you could need.</li>
            <li> Good product, it does what it claims got rid of my beard in a few minutes highly recommended cheap and useful</li>
            <li> One of the worest trimmer I have ever seen , stopped working after a month</li>
            <li> Good product and every one should try it at least  . only one thing needed is that battery should come with the pack.</li>
            <li> great deal for the price</li>
            <li> This little hair trimmer is so powerful my wife has used it to trim my hair to even it up and neaten my hair ! The bonus ear and nose trimmer work fine too !</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product. It works wonderfully. He is very happy with it. This product save him a lot of money by doing the beard trimming himself instead of the Barber.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet. Bought two and gave one to my son-in-law and seem to like it.&lt;br /&gt;He has not complained about batteries, so he must like it .</li>
            <li> My husband loves it uses it to trim and cut his hair every time he shaves.It is a great product by Wahl.</li>
            <li> works great like the brand</li>
            <li> Bought for my grandson, as he uses his dads all the time, now he will have his own. Easy to use and all the additional attachments make it a handy all in one place.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff for chip price.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT CARE, THE PRODUCT ARRIVED IN TIME SET. I RECOMMEND 100%</li>
            <li> Thanks! Great Product!!</li>
            <li> Cheap Quality, but works great.  The shears are super sharp!  Well worth the little bit of money.</li>
            <li> Excellent...........been using it for over 5 years now and still going strong. New batteries of course, about each year.</li>
            <li> works well . Cleans and stores easy .</li>
            <li> fantastic buy for the price, i love this kit</li>
            <li> The regular shaver does well but the additional nose/ear trimmer doesn&#x27;t work too well maybe the blade is not long enough or sharp enough just doesn&#x27;t work well as others.</li>
            <li> Obviously, at just over ten dollars this isn&#x27;t going to be the best trimmer one can purchase.  But, for the price, it&#x27;s a solid buy.  I had a similar model for about 6 years that finally died and had to be replaced.  I purchased this primarily because of the inexpensive cost and have been relatively happy with it.  For best results, I would recommend purchasing a set of rechargeable AA batteries to go along with it because it does eat through batteries quite quickly.  Once the battery level begins to diminish, the trimmer will &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; at the hair rather than cutting it cleanly, so if you experience that problem, it can be addressed by changing the batteries.  The bonus hair trimmer is also of decent quality (although I&#x27;m not sure how one would effectively be able to use it on eyebrows).</li>
            <li> Much better than others I&#x27;ve had use it every day will recommend all my friends</li>
            <li> I wondered if being battery powered would be powerful enough.  It is plenty powerful.  The other nice thing about no cord is that you can shave those extra hairy places in the shower or wherever (wouldn&#x27;t do it with the shower on though); thus not making a mess on the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let this get wet or it will rust fast. Attachments bend easy. Feels like it&#x27;s yanking the hair out instead of cutting them.</li>
            <li> Cheap substitute of high end Trimmer</li>
            <li> Likes: stainless steel, high quality blade; long-lasting lithium ion battery; fairly quiet to use&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes: The plastic blade combs are hard and a bit uncomfortable to use; the combs are fairly difficult to remove and replace and doing so sometimes will remove the entire blade which then has to be re-inserted; the 1/8&amp;#34; comb (smallest available) does not get it down to stubble level, it would be nice to have an even smaller comb; would be nice to have a storage unit for the trimmer and of the accessories (the storage unit shown in the picture did not come with my device).</li>
            <li> I have two Wahl trimmers that i&#x27;ve had for 10 years and they have been great all I&#x27;ve had to do every few years is change the battery.  When I saw that the battery replacement was as much as this new trimmer I figured nice to have a new one for the same price as the battery for the old one. MISTAKE, the new one can&#x27;t cut evenly and the attachments for beard length are a joke. The old one has on attachment that slides up and down so you can adjust the length as desired, however the new one has three attachments set at predetermined length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned cash on this one.</li>
            <li> this are amazing and good and  i like it and it come on time too that great that all i say</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older rechargeable unit. very happy with it although I do wish it was rechargeable as well</li>
            <li> I put the batteries in the Trimmer &amp; turned the switch to on &amp; nothing happened, made sure batteries were in correct &amp; tried again still nothing, Amazon is great they had no problem refunding the money I paid.</li>
            <li> My Fiance is in love with this tool, trims everything smoothly. It&#x27;s an easy clean and simple to use. it&#x27;s a Must buy</li>
            <li> trimmer stop working less than 6 months old</li>
            <li> Works like any other trimmer.  I used it once and rinsed it off...  The next day the blades are already rusted...  Hmm you get what you pay for; do not get it wet.</li>
            <li> Good price for a lot of grooming tools.</li>
            <li> The worst item I have ever bought to get the hair cut. The motor is not powerful and doesn&#x27;t shave well. I regretted that I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT recommended!</li>
            <li> two years laters Im still using it daily. works perfect</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR KEEPING BEARD CLOSELY TRIMMED AND GETTING IN TIGHT PLACES AROUND MUSTACHE AND GOATEE. OTHER ATTACHMENTS ARE GOOD FOR TRIMMING HAIR.</li>
            <li> work fine, no problems</li>
            <li> I would not tell any one to buy these. they rip your hair not cut. I got them for my son &amp; they r worthless</li>
            <li> I should have probably read the description of the product more closely, however the product does get the job done really well and does meet the expections of trimming beard however it is batterie operated, just make sure you keep a set of extra batteries because you will need them shortly after your first trim. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m ratting it a three... How ever I&#x27;ll give the seller a five start if it was an option since the product was in excellent condition and everything work great. Blessing</li>
            <li> Sharp as can be, Haven&#x27;t had an issue with them yet. Only four stars due the the fact the quite a bit of hair ends up behind the clippers. Otherwise very good product.</li>
            <li> Good product and price</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and not powerful at all,.. I gave it away.. and they probably gave it to someone else</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for...did NOT work right out of the package. Nothing but junk. I thought Wahl was a better company but I guess not!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this worked for just having regular AA batteries. Cuts very well and is light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I bought a new trimmer right away. This one pulled quite a bit. Although the battery lasted me the whole time i had it, i don&#x27;t like the fact that it is not rechargable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim as good as other Wahl products, thinking about returning</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Works good on my beard.</li>
            <li> Great for the price for what I use it for.  It cuts hear really well without the attachment.  By that I mean I don&#x27;t like a clean shave.  I&#x27;m lazy and let it grow for a few days.  I then use this without an attachment just to cut the hair off.  I use the attachment for my bows and that works pretty well.  When I do have a beard I don&#x27;t find it effective to just trim with.  I have really really thick hair tho.  I use my full size corded for that.  The nose hair trimmer works great.</li>
            <li> While this trimmer isn&#x27;t perfect, the quality of the trimmer and results are on par with a much more expensive trimmer (like $40). I&#x27;ve had mine for several years and use it for body and facial hair. It has held up well and does an excellent job trimming. It comes will all the tools needed to keep your facial/body hair just the way you want. The battery life is not amazing as others have noticed, but I usually can go 3-4 uses before needing to charge again. Charging takes a few hours, but after about 30 minutes you can basically use the trimmer. While this trimmer doesn&#x27;t look like a million bucks, it will keep you looking that way for at least several years for just 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> This was a terrible waste of money. Pulled hair, hurt, and didn&#x27;t trim well. I would not recommend these trimmers....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who likes too look his best, great price for everything included at wallgreens or cvs it would have cost the same price just for 1 of these items.</li>
            <li> Shipping box was kinda beat up, but product was fine. No more rechargeable s for me.</li>
            <li> I must be in the minority, as it is generally getting 4 stars, but I found this to be a steaming piece of dog poo. As said in other reviews, the batteries don&#x27;t fit right in the nose timmer, and I find it quitting until I give it a little shake. Good luck with the storage tray. The slightest little bump when removing the shaver will result in all the attachments scattering over your bathroom counter. The shaver is underpowered, even with the best batteries, and the attachments don&#x27;t want to fit straight until you give it a good fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Wahl products. I recently had a tremendous downsize in my personal economics, so I am used to the higher end models. I&#x27;m still spoiled and getting used to using the cheaper stuff, so there is that. But if you can afford the next model up for around 20, do so.</li>
            <li> I recently started growing a beard and I needed something more precise to keep it looking good.  So I bought this kit expecting that it would do the job.  I go to try it out and... nothing but pain.  Instead of cutting the hair, it just grabs it and yanks it out.  This was after I put the oil on the blades... I immediately threw it in the trash.  I didn&#x27;t feel like going through the hassle of returning it.  The nose/ear trimmer works decently well so I kept that along with the oil.  Other than that, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> great product, exactly as advertised, would definitely recommend it to anyone who asked. lightweight and compact, all you need are the batteries</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the results of this trimmer!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my boyfriend for christmas.. This product seems to be holding up well after being used every day. Provides a close shave to his sensitive skin, and does not seem to irritate, or be painful. Highly recommended gift for the man in your life.</li>
            <li> I got this one because it had good reviews, however the shave is too close (for those who like a bit of stubble) and it causes all sorts of breakouts on my face because my skin is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a person who can afford a slightly better shaver, but I guess if you&#x27;re looking for something to use occasionally and not on the face, this works fine.</li>
            <li> I have found nothing special about this trimmer and would not waste my money on it again.  I would spend more money on a better set.</li>
            <li> My husband had one of these for years and loved it.  The new one doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good as the older version of the same product.  It had a lot of nice accessories and he is using it but always comments that it doesn&#x27;t cut as good as the old one did.</li>
            <li> doesnt work well, tangled my facial hair on first use as if the blades were dull. I should have known to spend more than 12$ on a face trimmer. If i return it i will only get part of it back so it isnt worth the time or effort to pack it and drop it off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing they can sell this thing for $10 and still make a profit. Yes, it&#x27;s built cheap, but it works. No complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> No reason to spend a lot on trimming a mustache and nose hair twice a month.  The cordless with built in batteries run out of juice too fast.  This one runs for months and I use rechargeable AAs.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> This is ok...the price fits, its a bit cheaply made. Im not sure how long it will last, have had it for one month and use it to cut my dads hair. we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> 5 stars because I got exactly what I needed for a cheap price. To those other reviewers, of course you don&#x27;t have a salon type product, you spent 10% of what they did and got something that is 75% as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;*Powered by AA batteries - Don&#x27;t need to recharge&lt;br /&gt;*Batteries last awhile - Used a dozen times on original batteries&lt;br /&gt;*Low cost&lt;br /&gt;*Multiple attachments - #1, #2, #3&lt;br /&gt;*Also comes with a nose trimmer&lt;br /&gt;*Base is good for storing&lt;br /&gt;*cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Feels a little cheapy, but not bad&lt;br /&gt;*Only basic attachments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this to either trim up my facial hair, or if I am going cleanshaven after growing it out to trim everything down enough so that I can use my Gilette Fusion manual shaver for the close shave. This is just good for trimming down some of the bush so that the blades don&#x27;t get clogged constantly when I use the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> I bought it for him as a gift, knowing little about beard trimmers and trusting reviews.  I was not disappointed.  He loves it and says that it is easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Yeah it eats up the batteries, hence why i use recharge batts,&lt;br /&gt;BUT for ten bucks and with all the things you get, BEST BUY !!!!!!</li>
            <li> This certainly is not a recommended product to trim your girlfriends&#x27; private parts, well, ex-girlfriend now. It&#x27;s a long story, and we had a great relationship but the fateful night we used this trimmer on her bearded clam is a hellish incident I don&#x27;t wish on anyone. First off, this thing is loud. I thought my girlfriend was saying something, but she was moving and wiggling so much I thought she was getting off, so I didn&#x27;t hear that she was screaming for me to stop because this little thing puts out quite a bit of noise. Also, needless to say, apparently it doesn&#x27;t cut so much as it tears and rips hair out. I truly tried listening to my girlfriends&#x27;, I keep forgetting, EX-girlfriend, anyway, I was trying really hard to listen to hear complain afterwards but the ringing in my ears from the clippers made it difficult, and she thought I was ignoring her. After she left I tried the clippers on my own beard, um, on my face mind you because I&#x27;m a guy, but anyway, yeah it sucked and was quite painful. I seriously would have dumped me too because the pain this thing caused, but I&#x27;m me, well, and of course I&#x27;m not dating myself, but you get the idea. I&#x27;m not sure if the horrible salty smell is normal on these or if that was from my girl, EX-girlfriend. I hope my review helps.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful when buying this product because of the positive reviews I&#x27;d read. After receiving the product and using it an initial time, I have to say that it is terrible! I know you get what you pay for typically, but this really takes the cake! Upon trying to trim my beard, it was more like an epilator than a trimmer. It felt like it was ripping my hairs out. one at the time. NOT a pleasant feeling! I&#x27;ll promptly be replacing this product with something else...perhaps someone wanted to use this particular trimmer as a torture device?</li>
            <li> Parts didn&#x27;t match up with instructions sheet. Description and explanation on that sheet vague and unclear.</li>
            <li> First sorry I thought I did a review .GREAT PRODUCT GET IT BUY IT</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, to replace a very similar one that had died. So far, almost a year later, it is still working great. Excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was  looking for. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this beard trimmer because I had a regular size Wahl clippers that worked great for my head, but wasn&#x27;t impressed with how it handled trimming beards and figured I&#x27;d buy something made expressly for that purpose for a little more precision.  Wahl offers many different models and I chose this one because I was also in the market for a ear nose and brow trimmer and this came with that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the beard trimmer does a significantly worse job than my Wahl 79300-400, which just costs a few dollars more.  The construction is cheap, which maybe can be forgiven due to it&#x27;s price, but the fact is it was an absolute chore to get it to actually trim my beard.  In the end I gave up and just shaved it all off with a traditional razor after enough damage had been done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor and blades with this model is just too weak to do the job.  I was curious why there was a pretty wide range of prices for these trimmers and it is abundantly clear to me now.  There are many different types of motors these trimmers can have and this model has the weakest.  You are doing yourself a disservice if you settle on this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like Wahl as a company and will probably look to see if they have a more robust model before changing brands.  All I know is this is not the trimmer you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the ear nose and brow trimmer had issues at first.  The top section comes off for cleaning, but when you put it back together, unless everything is aligned perfectly, you will find the mechanism jams and will not spin up.  When working, the blade area gets pretty hot after just 30 seconds. Not enough to burn, but certainly not comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first disappointing purchase from Wahl.  I will be chucking the trimmer in the bin.  I&#x27;ll probably keep the ear nose and brow trimmer for now.</li>
            <li> All the necessities for a good haircut when the style is short. Very convenient to take on the road. FABULOUS!!!</li>
            <li> This product works great. I just loved it.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal at the price, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and it pinches your hairs a little on its lowest setting. I had to get a more expensive Philips Norelco to do the job, but I really can&#x27;t complain at such a great price. Also, the nose trimmer works great, so I&#x27;m keeping it for that.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate it, it was a gift for Christmas for my brother. Its made by wahl so I imagine its great since he hasnt complained about it to me.</li>
            <li> I placed a new battery in turned it on and it worked for 5 minutes made a noise and has not worked since.  Very disappointed but would cost more to send it back that the product is worth!  Larry Goddard</li>
            <li> Bought this as a backup set, and to travel with.  Didn&#x27;t want to worry about charge levels or cords when traveling, easy enough to pickup new AA batteries if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, but does ok.  Closer cut than my wahl plug in unit, and the nose hair trimmer cuts the hair without too much discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value, meets my needs and exceeded my low expectations.</li>
            <li> Both the electric shaver and nose hair trimmer work efficiently. However, the motor does get loud if you are using it for a long time, so before you turn it on, make sure you have an idea as to what you&#x27;re doing. I would say give it 10 minutes before it starts getting noticeably warm and the noise turns up. It gets fairly annoying, but not totally intolerable. All in all, good product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Working great, and very good value for money!</li>
            <li> cheap piece of crap...rusted up and became another piece of trash. felt cheap and wasnt what i expected. maybe thats my fault but i dont suggest you buy this one.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace a Remington who&#x27;s rechargeable battery was getting weak. I will say that this thing runs for a long time on a set of batteries but it&#x27;s nowhere near as powerful as the Remington. The Remington would PLOW straight through my manly thick beard without even a hiccup, this thing takes several passes and only takes off a little bit at a time. Also the guards are basically: stubble, stubble level 2, and extremely short. On my Remington I could set it to give me about a 3/4&amp;#34; beard. The longest guard on this thing barely leaves a beard at all, slightly more than stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just doing some light trimming I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s highly recommended but if you&#x27;re like me and like to use it to whack down a thick and manly beard once a month then possibly look at one of the other ones that have the built-in adjustable guard.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get any cheaper for the best quality - unless you want it for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be the DEFINITIVE answer on this!  First of all, it is a TRIMMER which is the &amp;#34;primary purpose&amp;#34; of your purchase.  the trimmer works excellent, is only $10 dollars, has extras in it for free AND feels and looks great.  Secondly, the batteries are AA and it depend on the type of battery you will buy that will determine the length of use.  However, if you did any research on batteries, you will find that they all last about the same time.  The only difference is the amount of charge based on long term storage of the batteries unused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you use, alkaline, dry, lithium, etc, for the type of battery you use it will last about the same hours of use.  I use a cheap &amp;#34;sunbeam&amp;#34; battery 8 for a $1 from the dollar store.  I use the trimmer daily and it has been over three months and still strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, you should be commenting on the trimmers&#x27; performance not the battery since a battery is NOT included and you have your choice of rechargeable or not.  The trimmer works perfectly and can get so skin close it will be great for ANY type of trimming from fades to nose and ear hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product and the only way to make it better is to get it for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prof Jil</li>
            <li> and I save lots of money not getting my beard trimmed at barbershop. Five bucks each time to trim my beard??? crazy, and no more. This works GREAT! I did have a problem trimming my nose hair until I discovered that the small thing was for the nose and ears; WOW! all for a measly 11 bucks. Who woulda thunk it???</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lightweight, poorly made, POS. I used it maybe 10 times in two months and by the time I realized it was horrible, it had stopped working and it was too late to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PIECE OF CRAP!</li>
            <li> Can never go wrong with this purchase $10.00 and after 8 months its still going i use it every other day</li>
            <li> Works great. Not sure why all the ear/nose peace dose not have a spot in the holding tray</li>
            <li> Great value. Works great!</li>
            <li> very hand..good product</li>
            <li> Ordered for my hubby for fathers day lol he loved it so much he gave it unopened to his dad hahaha silly men now I have to get him one on his bday :P</li>
            <li> I bought these for really low price. Less than 10 dollars. Figured I take a gamble on something so cheap. All I can say is these are beast an I feel like I go them for a steal. They come with a nice bit of accessories an are pretty powerful. An it takes a long time to kill the battery.</li>
            <li> Its ok but thst wasnt wat I expected, it doesnt really clean ur nose</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer set. A lot more attachments than I had anticipated. This is the only brand of hair trimmers my fiancée or other males in his family will use. Very nice set for the price. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Although I did incorrectly order this product thinking I could use this to cut my hair with. It is also really just battery operated and I do strongly recommend that you do get long lasting batteries to operate this as it will be beneficial or get rechargeable batteries as it does drain the battery faster than I would have expected. But because I had thicker than normal facial hair it did not cut properly as I had hoped however the pieces that were said to be in the package were there and it does do it&#x27;s job I opted to give a 4 star but if it had some sort of recharging capability and cut closer to the skin to be more smooth I would give it 5 star. Overall though, I did receive the order promptly and on the attempt to originally return the product as the image shown was misleading to where it did look that you could have the capability to trim hair with (since I did not have the money for the haircut) the Customer Service Rep did show that she truly cared and did what she could to answer my concerns. But that rating is a separate from the product and don&#x27;t want to include that in this one. But if you do buy this one, just an FYI that it isn&#x27;t really the one for haircuts. Another way I would increase the rating would be to give more detailed information or include more pics for the product.</li>
            <li> Great package at a great price!  Although low cost, this product has held up well.  I already had one, but wanted the additional nose and eyebrow trimmer.</li>
            <li> Neat light weight unit works as described</li>
            <li> Great product. The attachments are very difficult to get off of the razor, but aside from that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Last long with the batteries</li>
            <li> Great value. Now I don&#x27;t need to see the barber at all</li>
            <li> Great product, was very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Other than not being sure how to put in that batteries, it seems good for the price so far so good</li>
            <li> Louder sound then expected</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.pure garbages. It does not work</li>
            <li> Pulls my hair as it trims. It&#x27;s annoying that way. But then again, it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I needed something when I&#x27;am on the road and I found this on Amazon... The thing I like best is that it is Cordless and I can take it anywhere.</li>
            <li> Nice small trimmer. Being cordless is great.</li>
            <li> Love it lots of good tools for grooming</li>
            <li> Excellent 100% Recommended</li>
            <li> Horrible. Total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Still with a rechargeable one.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could return but threw away packaging.</li>
            <li> really good item, the quality of the material it&#x27;s good just what i expected to be, really love the this and the shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> Husband loves it and uses it all the time. Wishes some of the guards were longer for his beard.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Its a $10.00 trimmer. Pulls hair, blades gets rusty even with proper maintenance and oiling. I bought it to help trim down a beard I grew during winter before shaving it in spring so I got my $10 dollars use from it after 1 use. Not water proof. Batteries will corrode and it will rust out from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend nor will I buy again.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer sounds like a remote control airplane. I find it to be too loud to use near my ears.</li>
            <li> NO CHARGER... WORTHLESS FOR ME</li>
            <li> I have had much better at 5-6 times the price&#x27; for what I paid, this works just fine - no complaints</li>
            <li> works very well for the money, gave it hubby as a gift he like it not as strong as other wahl i have use in the past but i am a hairdresser so i get pro brands. but good for home use</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday( as I bought the Remington Head To Toe Trimmer for my son in law for Christmas. He was just okay with it.) After reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to purchase this Wahl for him. He absolutely loves it. Does what it says and he says it cleans right up with water as instructions indicate. Guess I will be ordering one for my son in law. It does give him a great trim and ears, nose trimmed right up.</li>
            <li> Both trimmers worked fairly decent for about the first 5 or 6 times. After that, it was like the blades just seemed to dull really quickly. I tried replacing batteries, made sure they were clean, etc. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Really good value and works great.  Good quality trimmer.  Not a Cheaply built junk.  Give it a try!  I like it</li>
            <li> just  completely stopped. Changed the batteries twice to try to get it to work. But the unit did not respond at all. Made in China (not Taiwan).</li>
            <li> While the base trimmer works fine, the extensions for different lengths tend to rip my hairs out. Very painful. Not really worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Works nice, price is right... good complete set.  Appreciated the bonus trimmer which only made it a better value for the dollar.</li>
            <li> This product works just as they said it would. Does a fine job well worth the small price. I&#x27;ve apid more and have gotten less.</li>
            <li> Good beard trimmer, nice case, i like it</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  It catches my hair and pulls and hurts.  The nose/ear trimmer works okay but not awesome.  I would give this a lower rating, but for $10.49 I figure none of us should expect much more.  Wahl makes some good products, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> Very well. Fast in Brazil.</li>
            <li> Not good for hairy guys. It pulls hair and it hurts. It&#x27;s good for traveling but still i could have gotten better.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, he loved it but apparently the nose hair trimmers didn&#x27;t work/were defective.</li>
            <li> fast shipment. nice product</li>
            <li> It got broken right after first use. i wouldn´t buy another one.</li>
            <li> Very economical and practical. Bad thing is you need batteries so I suggest going rechargeable. I bought it because I grew tired of shaving, so with this I can quickly shave in the morning without loosing much time. Just keep in mind having some extra recharged batteries to rely on. Best is the nose trimmer, the older you get the more you need it.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband for Fathers Day and he loves it. For being battery operated it&#x27;s really quite powerful. He says it doesn&#x27;t snag while he&#x27;s trimming so it&#x27;s an enjoyable experience. Love all of the attachments it comes with it makes it easy to really make his style his own.</li>
            <li> Very good for a battery operated device, not as strong as the regular cordless/rechargeable ones but is much lighter and can be used in the shower.  Very good for trips and light.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this little trimmer extensively, and have found it to be excellent. I use it for little trims to clean up a bit around mustache.  I considered, but declined to buy other more expense, name-brand trimmers such as&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005PUZZR8 Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer]] or&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco QT4070/41 Beard Trimmer 7300 (Packaging May Vary)]] or&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008KEJ1LM Panasonic ER-GB40-S Cordless Moustache &amp; Beard Trimmer Wet/Dry with 19 Adjustable Settings]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried those other products, so it&#x27;s possible they are really excellent as well, but honestly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to me worth it to pay twice as much for the name brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ The trimmer is pretty light--being almost all plastic, but it fits well in my hand. Notice the little ergonomic raised portions on the case. Nice touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Measured weight: 4 1/2 oz. Length: 6 1/2 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ The sound is moderate--not quiet, but not loud. Sort of reminded me of being at the barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Attractive appearance, but of course, I didn&#x27;t buy it for how IT looks; I bought it to make ME look good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Cutting power is fine. It&#x27;s not going to win any power contests, but you just need a small motor for most trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Blades are plenty sharp. I&#x27;ve never tried to sharpen them (and not sure you can, anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ The thing that surprised me the most is how long it stays charged.  I typically just use it for a few minutes at a time, so I don&#x27;t keep it plugged in; nevertheless, it still stays charged for many days. On those occasions when I do need to charge it up, it doesn&#x27;t take very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ I use the little rubber blade cover when I&#x27;m not using the trimmer. The cover has held up fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ I don&#x27;t find the stand convenient--nothing wrong with it, but just don&#x27;t want more clutter on the counter. So I typically just place the trimmer, by itself, under the sink counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Honestly, I cannot think of any flaws with this product. Very cheap, very reliable, does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;√ Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[for the record, I do NOT work for the manufacturer, or have any relationship with them.]mer, by itself, under the sink counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ Honestly, I cannot think of any flaws with this product.

            <li> most painful trimmer i have ever owned, if you like the feel of hairs being plucked from your face this is a great product</li>
            <li> This thing eats batteries, and quickly doesn&#x27;t cut hair, but just pulls it out. This was the reason I replaced my old trimmer, and yesterday they had it on sale on Prime day, so I bought it for about the price of this one. I really like that trimmer, and it lasted for almost 2 years before it really started to dull. I have included it in my review if anyone would like to look at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl 79520-3101 Groom Pro Hair cutting Kit, Yellow/black, 22 Count</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews said these were cheaply made, but I was surprised.  Very nice shaver for the money.  Have been using in for a few months now and I am still on the first set of batteries.  I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Horrible trimmer...My fiancé struggled to trim his facial hair even without a guard...had higher hopes for this product...disappointed</li>
            <li> The trimmer is good for couple of uses after that it grabs hold of facial hair and yanks them. this is very painful. The other  attachment personal trimmer is very good and does the job well. Not upto the mark but its worth the price.</li>
            <li> good quality and the guards are wonderful.  It will allow you get your grooming perfect.  Uses fewer batteries than my last groomer.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the last one broke (the one I bought from the store) but I got the exact same one (this one) and it works great, love that it&#x27;s wireless and it hasn&#x27;t broken so my fianc&amp;eacute; like it.</li>
            <li> Do not get the product that is buy: from the date that the purchase was made and will request the sent, the product never I was delivered to my destination, citing the customs agent, the Venezuelan customs were involved, which investigate and was false. Subsequently the same customs agent Mr. Lorenzo Colina, telephone in Miami 2005070 (owner of the company that would bring Venezuela product - supplies and services LM), indicated that the problem was with the goods door to door, reason by which it was returned to the United States. Also Indian, that serious organized and rated for your forwarded the goods permitted according to the new regulations of the Venezuelan Government, which has created an uncertainty in my for the reception of the same. I come to this prestigious firm AMAZON, with the purpose that I review in this respect of the acquired or make me money back.</li>
            <li> i just wanted a nose trimmer and got the entire set for the same price! lucky me! i would recommend.</li>
            <li> Small size, fit everywhere excellent for traveling however should come with your carry on bag, but for the price it is ok</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. It is very nice and easy to use. He looks clean and sharp for work. He is in customer service and well, what can I say I made a good investment. Thank you Amazon for everything. Peace,.</li>
            <li> This product really isn&#x27;t worth your money! It does cut very well at all!</li>
            <li> good seat with great price and am very happy with that.</li>
            <li> excellent recommend 100%. -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good and I am very satisfied, thank you. Hope you will continue this relationship and both sides are satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works great for a 10$ trimmer.  I would recommend it to others looking for an inexpensive beard trimmer to buy.</li>
            <li> goes through batteries to fast and doesn&#x27;t cut worth a darn. I get maybe 3 trims from the batteries and have to replace them. Have to go over the same area 3 or 4 times to get it to trim all the hairs.(sometimes I wonder if they even sharpened the blades)</li>
            <li> The unit is very light and feels cheaply built but I&#x27;ve had no issues in the month since I&#x27;ve purchased it.  It is somewhat noisy when I use it but the trim is good.  The different razor guards are nice but not necessary unless you want a shorter cut.</li>
            <li> I put in batteries into the bonus ear trimmer and it came on instantly, not thinking much of it, when I went to turn it off, the switch would not work, I could not turn it off I had to take the batteries to turn it off, it was a bad switch so I had to send it back and didnt get a chance to use the beard trimmer but if this is any sign of Wahl&#x27;s quality, Ill pass, guess they don&#x27;t make em like they used to.</li>
            <li> did not realize that it was not rechargeable and the nose , ear trimmer did not work at all gave it to salvation army because of return postage costs.</li>
            <li> *** update **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally contacted the company (duh) and got service for this equipment (very near the end of the warranty date, but that&#x27;s my fault), after which it worked well! So I&#x27;m changing the rating from 1 star to 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** my original review appears below ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stopped working very soon after I got it. It just putters out right away, and fresh batteries don&#x27;t help. ?? Not motivated enough to try to get it replaced, but I suggest spending more money and getting something better.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say too much bad about this, especially at the price. It lasts well with alkaline batteries. I only use the closest guide because I don&#x27;t like length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get these locally at pretty much the same price.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this all the time!! We purchased rechargeable batteries also and it never stops.</li>
            <li> Very happy !! Works perfect :)</li>
            <li> Does everything I need.</li>
            <li> nose trimmer doesn&#x27;t go up my nose far enough to trim hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well,  impressed with the whole kit.</li>
            <li> I got a little water on the blades, but wiped it off with a towel and figured it would be fine. Nope. It rusted to the point of being completely useless within a month of purchase. It&#x27;s made of cheap plastic, but that didn&#x27;t bother me considering the cheap price &amp; cordless feature. It worked just fine for the 2 weeks it lasted. I don&#x27;t think anyone should waste their money on this but if you&#x27;re going to try this trimmer, keep it far away from moisture of any kind.</li>
            <li> great value and quality, will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working alright for my &amp;#34;beard.&amp;#34;  No accidents.  Yet.</li>
            <li> i bought this for edging and trimming my sideburns at first, but i used it to shave my entire head and i gotta say other than being battery operated it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly because it takes regular alkaline batteries, and most of the rechargeable ones I&#x27;ve gotten have awful batteries that only last a few months. Well this has to be one of the worst electrical devices I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I had it for about three or four months, just used once or twice a week to trim my beard and mustache.     The nose hair trimmer was the better of the two devices. It&#x27;s pretty simple, so I guess there&#x27;s not a lot for them to mess up. I don&#x27;t think I could ever get it totally clean, even taking the top part off and washing it under warm running water. I ended up not using it any more when I started to get a bit of redness and swelling around the tip of my nose. It takes a while longer, but a pair of small scissors worked just as well. Unfortunately, this slid off the top of the toilet tank where I&#x27;d rested it and onto the tile bathroom floor, and exploded into about five pieces. No way to repair it, went right into the trash.    The trimmer worked OK for trimming my beard, though it took maybe twice as many passes as my last rechargeable model - I think the blades just aren&#x27;t that sharp. By far the worst part is that the battery door on mine was VERY loose. To the point that while using it just the movement of my hand would pull the battery door open, leaving me with two pieces in my hand, and really ruining the grip I had on the device. I ended up wrapping the body of the trimmer with electrical tape a few times, over the battery door, just to keep it held on. The last straw came when I decided to shave my beard off. I tried to use this with no comb over it, and then with the shortest comb, to take off all of my facial hair. I&#x27;ll admit my beard was a bit long - maybe 1/4\\&quot; to 1/2\\&quot; on average - and pretty curly - but this was downright painful. In the minute that I used it, this thing pulled out as much hair as it cut. I gave up and decided it would be easier to just trim with scissors and then shave.     Very poor build quality.</li>
            <li> Great product - worked better than expected and I was impressed at the price for what I go. Good blades and the batteries don&#x27;t take away from the power of it.</li>
            <li> Clippers work well and are a bargain at the price.</li>
            <li> In short, it arrived on time and is not too entirely hefty of a product. Only real downside I can tell so far by just looking at the product, is that it does not come with batteries (do people even include batteries with products anymore?)    Edit:     It&#x27;s been at least 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve bought this item, and have loved it ever since. It&#x27;s compact, light weight, and simple to use. For it&#x27;s price, I can say it&#x27;s well worth it for anyone that is searching for something on the cheap side of things, while at the same time being a product that can get the job done.</li>
            <li> En las fotos que salen en ningún momento se le ve el cable, cuando me llego me sorprendí y no les volvere a comprar a esa tienda.</li>
            <li> The cordless feature is great and fast when your shaving. I&#x27;m not going back to the cable one. And works perfect with my AA rechargeable batteries. Highly recomended</li>
            <li> I know it is cordless, which sounds convenient, except the battery cover is difficult to keep in place, especially if you think you are handy enough to turn it on with one hand as you push the switch up, the battery cover comes back and off. These then creates difficulty in keeping the batteries in contact in order to run the clipper. Opposite problem with the nose trimmer, you better be hercules to get the battery cover off of it.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer works okay for a low priced item.  The ear/nose trimmer makes noise as if it is working, but it won&#x27;t cut a single hair. If this won&#x27;t bother you, I guess it&#x27;s okay to purchase.</li>
            <li> This Wahl trimmer set replaces a Norelco rechargeable trimmer set.&lt;br /&gt;All of the attachments are included and they even have a small bottle of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger trimmer has more power than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;The nose and ear hair trimmer does a very good job! A lot better than any other trimmer that I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;I like that the small trimmer is separate rather than being another attachment. It seems that the Norelco attachment used more energy so having a separate trimmer makes sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about these Wahl trimmers is the ergonomics- not heavy, the switch is on the side and it just feels comfortable in my hand when I trim my mustache. The design is well done.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this Wahl trimmer and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Pulls hair rather then cutting it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He used it right away and likes it very much.  Lots of improvements over his old one.</li>
            <li> it is perfect for what i wanted. it works great i use it for my beard and to trim sideburns</li>
            <li> value for product &#x3D; 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this little trimming Kit for a few months now, you have to move slow through a mustache or beard or it may pull, just don&#x27;t go too fast.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this same kit again, seems to be holding up just fine so far, nothing bad to say, hey, remember, it&#x27;s only $10, right?</li>
            <li> Very good set of trimmers and tools for a very low price. Uses alkaline batteries so no frequent charging needed, batteries easily replaceable. Batteries last several months or more.</li>
            <li> I think this was a great buy for the price and amount of accessories that came with it. works great</li>
            <li> This product works well for everyday use. I would recommend it to anyone. I trims well. I have had no problems so far.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheap and it is. However, it does do a pretty decent job, although, occasionally it will pull a hair or two.</li>
            <li> Great shaver I use it to trim my moustache.</li>
            <li> works well, alittle hard on batterys but good for the price</li>
            <li> Awesome product everything good its just the stand doesnt hold the nose trimmer good for your trimming needs</li>
            <li> Everything was fine except for the nose hair trimmer which just stopped working after a week or two. Whal were willing to replace it but I didn&#x27;t bother (I had viewed it as a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; extra).</li>
            <li> cool product....very durable</li>
            <li> This shaved my face and revealed my true self, much to the chagrin of people I know.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase for myself, but as a gift. Seems to work as expected and was purchased at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> Great value, works well, and a huge assortment of attachments</li>
            <li> Works well for the price. I would buy it again if I needed to.</li>
            <li> Nose and ear trimmer doesn&#x27;t function very well at all. The trimmer itself works fairly well. I am just wondering how long the batteries will last. I guess for a cheap trimmer unit it isn&#x27;t all bad.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Not only good for my face, but keeps my dog&#x27;s nether parts free from Klingons</li>
            <li> Bought this for a Christmas present for my dad. The fact that it&#x27;s cordless is in itself the best part! I wish my hair straightener was cordless! He has used this several times and he absolutely loves it. Definitely a great buy! Wahl is a fantastic brand!</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Good for the price.</li>
            <li> So happy with this Wahl beard trimmer, so easy to use and really does the job for me!! Get it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> First off i don&#x27;t like writting bad reviews but when I have to i have to. First off the shavers works good it really does. Clean shave and handles nice but ..... the blades are not stainless steel so after a 2weeks of using it like every3 days and cleaning it with the brush and some alcohol it started to rust. Plus like every 3 uses u got to change the batteries. But .yeah point made rust... waist of money. Dont buy</li>
            <li> I bought this despite a couple of reviewers who had difficulty getting the trim guides on and off the trimmer. I am glad I did because it works like a charm and the trim guides are easy to put on and off of the trimmer even after over a vear of daily use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that it didn&#x27;t have  a rechargeable battery but other then that it&#x27;s good life is good too</li>
            <li> I already had one so this is a back up spare. It is cheaper than going to a barber shop. I use it to keep my pin feathers trimmed - the other penguins and puffins here use it similarly here at the Krill Institute.</li>
            <li> This is a great product from a company that has been around a very long time.  It&#x27;s easy to use and unlike some other products, it&#x27;s not too heavy and stores easily.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband he loves it. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I liked it, it is just as described, i would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Very good item to have.</li>
            <li> I wish that the razor wire to 110VAC</li>
            <li> the trimmers are very very bad, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t return back.</li>
            <li> very nice, great deal</li>
            <li> Been using this once or twice a week for a couple of months now no issues, can&#x27;t argue with the price, battery life is good, if it breaks I will just order another one.</li>
            <li> It is not as powerful as a corded razor but it is a lot easier to use and a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> Light weight trimmer.  Good enough to keep most of my beard trimmed but certainly wouldn&#x27;t cut it off if need be.</li>
            <li> Came with a lot more accessories than I realized. It&#x27;s been working great for the beard, eyebrows, and just minor trim here and there.</li>
            <li> its exactly what i was looking for work fine</li>
            <li> Perfect. Got here super fast</li>
            <li> It is very inexpensive but I am sorry I bought it.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to cut well.  The parts don&#x27;t fit together well.  It&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li> My husband love this kit.  He had not had a new kit like this in years.  I will recommend this to my son-in-law...............................</li>
            <li> great item, as described</li>
            <li> Should have bought this a long time ago.  great price, sturdy quality and works great.  Also like the small size and compact nature of this.</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming pubes. Also works well in the shower! Blade on trimmer was a little bent but didn&#x27;t really affect anything.</li>
            <li> It works okay for battery operated.</li>
            <li> I read mixed reviews about this product, but after using it regularly for the past 2 months, I have had no issues.  I use it for my sideburns and eyebrows weekly, still on the original set of batteries.</li>
            <li> Does the job well and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but for the price I paid it works really well. It has a very sharp blade, so be careful using it on other parts of your body besides your face and hairline.</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement of another Wahl trimmer I had that finally died after many years of use.  My other trimmer was great; it felt substantial in my hand and did the job well.  This trimmer is very light and feels cheap and most importantly, does a terrible job of trimming.  Not only does it not efficiently clip the hair (I have to do dozens of passes for it to clip all the hair), hair sometimes gets caught in the blades and pulls, which hurts.  Do not like.</li>
            <li> The 5-position guide only goes to 1 setting and doesn&#x27;t feel secure. Didn&#x27;t turn on at first until I jiggled the batteries in their seating, which also seems loose. I didn&#x27;t trust it enough to try using it, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Compared to the rechargeable Conair I had owned for years, the Wahl cuts much faster and without any &amp;#34;whisker pull&amp;#34;.  The eyebrow, nose and ear trimmer is great also.  Considering the price of the kit and even changing batteries every few months,  I wish my Conair had conked out sooner.</li>
            <li> I bought this so my fiance would keep his beard and since I&#x27;ve gotten it for him there has been no baby faced man walking in my house! He&#x27;s able to trim and maintain his facial hair with minimal tugs... Glad he loves it cuz I love beards!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas  gift but when he open the gift he said he does not use this so I can not say to much never use but the JM prime will go out of  there way to help you if you have any  problems or questions thank you for your service</li>
            <li> This actually was to be a gift, ended up getting myself one. Havent tried yet, but have bought Wahl products before</li>
            <li> Works Great! Use it for beard and head, holding up well and plenty of life from batteries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super powerful. It works, but it pulls some.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor with accessories that my husband just loves and can now take care of his beard without having his barber do alot of the trimmimg. I recommend this highly as it is probably the 6th one he has had and the only one he has said was the best president he got for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Wow ... unbelievable for the price. Love it! Even if it only lasts a year well worth it.  Update: It has been two years and this has worked consistently great. I just ordered my second, not because the first isn&#x27;t working, but for a long time I have been missing the cleaning attachments. If you like to closely trim your facial hair instead of shaving totally bare clean, this is great. I find using regular double A batteries an advantage over  the rechargeable type (have had both) because if the trimmer batteries go dead I always seem to have Double A&#x27;s on hand for instant use. When I had the rechargeable type and I had to get to work, I had to wait to use it until it charged, consequently that would be a no trim/shave day, and felt somewhat unnerving. Oh, by the way the nose hair trimmer is useless. Buy a good pair of Italian scissors instead - I&#x27;ve tried many things and this product at Amazon is the best: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XBO4OW2?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage</li>
            <li> Nice item to have. After about a year, the beard trimmer died out.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son.  He is a hairy fella.  It has done a wonderful job keeping him hairless and smooth.</li>
            <li> This Kit is great! everything I expected and works very well! I would definately recommend this item to everyone in need</li>
            <li> Great price, and comes with absolutely everything a man needs to trim both facial hair, ears and nose too. A very full set of beard trimming adjustment lengths makes this ideal. Better set that other trimmers I&#x27;ve spent more for, and haven&#x27;t come with nearly as many attachments. My son loves it!</li>
            <li> In 1995 I got a Wahl mustache trimmer at Laneco (now out of business) and that lasted me faithfully through 2011.  [ I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit that the first one I bought had a picture of Richard Karn (Al from Home Improvement) [  So when I decided to get a new trimmer I got a new Wahl Trimmer - I know it&#x27;s a \\&quot;beard\\&quot; trimmer but I use it to trim my mustache and sideburns.  These attachments work great!  I put on a attachment so that I can keep the length that I want and this works better than the old Wahl trimmer I Had.  The purchase from Amazon also included an nostril trimmer and it works great.  Much better than I used to do!</li>
            <li> Very nice set and my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a nice inexpensive trimmer.  I use it for my beard and it works quite well.</li>
            <li> For $10 you can&#x27;t beat this product.</li>
            <li> My friend asked me for a nose hair trimmer.  I&#x27;d given him one some years back, but it recently gave up the ghost.  This Wahl kit was perfect, good price, excellent products.  Wahl stands behind their equipment almost forever, so it made a great gift for my friend.</li>
            <li> the product works really well, i dont have issues with this product, it doesnt do like the best products in the market but for 9 bucks works really well!!</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper set for the money. The bonus nose hair trimmer is so-so, but hey, it&#x27;s a bonus. The clipper works great. Much better in fact, than what I expected for the price. Having had a rechargeable trimmer previous to this one, I welcome a trimmer that you have to replace the batteries. When those rechargeable types go bad, you can&#x27;t get them apart to replace the batteries. Just use rechargeable batteries in this one and you&#x27;re set. I&#x27;m recommending Amazon&#x27;s rechargeable batteries, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that crazy about this razor...it seems as if it should be more powerful...whatever that means...</li>
            <li> Works great.  Great gift for men, young or old who like the day stubble to clean shaven.</li>
            <li> Excellent power. Use to trim mustache and it works great.  The extra attachments are a plus.</li>
            <li> This are a nice addition.</li>
            <li> just what I needed.  it does a great job.  I like that it&#x27;s cordless and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, very snaggy on my beard.</li>
            <li> The battery just died on me, lasted 7 months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. Because it broken a tooth....</li>
            <li> Does the job well and great price! It&#x27;s cheap, but only where it counts! Ear and nose trimmer could be better, but it was the the trimmer that I was looking for. The trimmer is of solid design and good material.</li>
            <li> Great set.  Works well.</li>
            <li> This kit helps to support your beard and that shines in good condition</li>
            <li> great set for a really good price.</li>
            <li> Batteries wears out a little too fast for my taste but does the job its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have shorter hair and this kit lets me trim the rough edges from my sideburns and around my ears so my hair doesn&#x27;t look too shaggy.  As stated, by doing this, I can usually forego a trip to the local barber every other month; essentially cutting my number of trips in half for the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned though, cutting your own hair, even the little that I do, takes some practice to do in the mirror (try plucking a random grey hair on the side of your head with tweezers to get what I mean).  Expect a few errant shaves that might require a trip to the barber shop anyway to fix it before you do start to get it right.  ;-)</li>
            <li> cheap material but it seems to work.</li>
            <li> It consumes batteries a lot. Though good trimmer, it has sharp cutters which some time cause irritation and burn.</li>
            <li> Still using it months later.  Comes with a lot of stufff I will never use, but all at a great price.</li>
            <li> For a battery operated trimmer set, it works well.  There isn&#x27;t a place in the holder to put the ear/nose hair trimmer, but overall a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I rated this so low because since the first day the product didn&#x27;t even work with fully battery.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend not purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son and he was ecstaticly happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a well priced trimmer that does the job but loud when in use. The attachments are an added value. If you can put up with the noise factor then this is your trimmer.</li>
            <li> its just cheap plastic, but it holds up remarkably well. its lasted longer than other plastic beard trimmers ive had in the past. the little nose hair accessory is great too.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.  Appears to consume batteries quicker than my earlier Wahl.  But it does the job.</li>
            <li> Okay only because it was so cheap.  The nose trimmer is cereal box quality.</li>
            <li> I am NOT happy with the purchase of this item. It is a piece of junk. The nose trimmer never work from day one.</li>
            <li> Everything burnt out it a five uses</li>
            <li> awesome, my boo loves it. thank you soo soo much. speed delivery as well. thanks much</li>
            <li> I think that the hair trimmer could be more efficient when trimming the hair in the nose</li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer fell apart after one use. The trimmer is decent but drains batteries fast. It was an okay gift to give someone.</li>
            <li> Cheap and ineffective. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get the job done, cheap plastic. Not something I expected from wahl</li>
            <li> Compact easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> Plastic, very plastic</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer and bonus ear and nose trimmer was one of my best products I purchased.</li>
            <li> I wont recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Went to use one morning and it would not work, changed batteries (brand new) still would not work. Took old batteries and put in flashlight and they worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less then 6 months and it has stopped working.</li>
            <li> Used on my beard today for the first time - thick and full hair - cut through w/ no pull or snag -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the manual states: keep the blade clean and oil every other month or so - no worries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice kit and stand - haven&#x27;t tried the ear/nose hair trimmer yet -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value and product</li>
            <li> For the price, this bear trimmer has performed wonderfully. It does use batteries, but two AA&#x27;s lasts about a month even with every day trimmings.</li>
            <li> Died the first week - Now I setup a return and got my money back the next day, they is why it got 4 stars and not 1!</li>
            <li> Trimmer was fine and appeared to be a good purchase for a few months but then simply stopped working.  Wahl sent me a replacement free of charge immediately.  That is customer service that you don&#x27;t often find today.</li>
            <li> is disappointment, the shaver does not cut. the blades move and not only cut hair,  I mean I can not use it throw it&#x27;s the only thing I have left</li>
            <li> Unlike similarly priced (and much more expensive ones) these actually work. Also, the build quality is much better than expected, so  I expect them to keep working.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the normal groom a male needs, and a female steals to also complete :)</li>
            <li> thought it was run on a power cord, battery operated</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and the recipient uses all the time.</li>
            <li> Great product at a VERY GOOD price!!!!!!!!!!!!! Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was not what I hoped it would be.  Seems to be of good quality and design, but I would not recommend to friends.  The trimmer takes two AA batteries and would be good for travel.  Overall, it took me over 20 min to trim my entire beard and it still did not seem to be an even cut.  I also did not care for the length.  Hard to argue with the price though.</li>
            <li> Pretty good condition. Just need to buy the batteries separately.</li>
            <li> Great product -- great price -- and really fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Good product. Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> THE BLADE GOT ALL RUST UP</li>
            <li> It is better then the rest on the market.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this especially because it is battery operated.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but not quite as fast or comfortably as a previous model this replaced.</li>
            <li> It works.  Does not Cut Close.  Could Be better.  It does seem well made.  Just wish it would cut closer.</li>
            <li> THESE WERE GIFTHS THEY ALL LIKED IT.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased with this product. I am a firm believer in that, you get what you pay for. With this product I felt I got more than I paid for it. I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you are on a tight budget.</li>
            <li> After owning Wahl beard trimmers for more than 20 years, I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of some of the reviews here.  I thought maybe Wahl&#x27;s quality had deteriorated as have so many products in the age of corporate greed at the expense of any kind of customer service or satisfaction.    The two things that concerned me were quality of construction, and hair-pulling.  The plastic it is made of does seem slightly thinner, but it is plenty sturdy and I don&#x27;t anticipate problems with it.  I don&#x27;t think it would crack if I accidentally dropped it.    I have had no problems at all with it pulling my hairs out.  My old one occasionally would when the batteries got very low, but this one has not at all.  I trim my beard fairly close, using the fourth click out of five on the slidable blade guard.  It&#x27;s usually fairly shaggy when I trim it, about once a month.    I bought the battery version rather than the rechargeable because I have no room to leave it plugged in all the time and I don&#x27;t want to wait 24 hours after I decide it&#x27;s time for a trim.  This version only uses two batteries as opposed to the three for my old one.  I was afraid that would mean less power.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  The new one has much more power and the blades vibrate a lot quicker than the old one.  When I saw that, I was afraid the batteries wouldn&#x27;t last more than a couple of trims.  This also is not the case.  If anything, the two batteries last longer than the three used to.  Obviously Wahl has increased the efficiency of their motor in the last 20 years.    The mustache trimmer that comes along with it for free is excellent!  I was using one of those as-seen-on-TV bikini line trimmers, sort of a sideways mini-clipper.  The Wahl trimmer has much more power and is alot less irritating to my skin.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to use it at all, but I have ended up using it even more than the full beard trimmer!  Works great for ear hair too!    I highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s better than the Wahl trimmer that lasted me more than 15 years.    .  .    -- UPDATE --  This lasted just under three years.    Wahl saved money in the wrong places.  The motors in both units are still going strong.  But neither of them will work any more.    I use the moustache/ear trimmer more than the beard trimmer.  About six months ago, the switch broke.  Luckily it broke in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position.  But since then I have had to take the battery in and out to turn it on and off.  Now the metal clip that holds the battery in place has weakened and is about to snap off from metal fatigue, it is so thin and cheap.  It doesn&#x27;t hold the battery tightly enough any more to run.    The motor on the beard trimmer is just as strong as when it bought it.  But it no longer will stay on.  It runs OK until I hold it up to my face, then it goes off.  It appears to be the switch contact.    Still, for ten bucks, it&#x27;s hard to complain too much.  Even knowing what I now know, I&#x27;m buying another one.</li>
            <li> nose trimmer does not have enough power even with new batteries.  The clipper works great.</li>
            <li> Very impressive kit for around $10. The trimmers are precise and ergonomic. They feel solid, yet light. The attachments work very well, but take a little getting used to at first. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. Can&#x27;t comment on durability yet since I have only had this product a few days. Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;High-carbon self-sharpening steel blades are precision-ground for superior results&lt;br /&gt;5-position guide allows for detailing and edging&lt;br /&gt;3 guide combs: 1/16\\&quot;, 1/8\\&quot; and 3/16\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Battery operated bonus ear/nose/brow trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Includes beard/mustache comb, cleaning brush, blade oil, and storage base&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;none.</li>
            <li> I have owned this set for years and I bought it for my 16yr. old. That should say it all.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it worked great. I went to turn it on a couple days later, flipped the switch, and it did not come on. I knew the batteries were fine, so I opened up the trimmer and discovered that the switch was faulty. The contacts were bent out of place so the circuit was not being closed when flipping the switch. I bent them back into place, re seated the switch, and put the trimmer back together. Everything is working fine now. The trimmer works great, but I&#x27;m only going to give is 3 stars due to the faulty switch. I don&#x27;t think there are many people who would take the time to troubleshoot the issue, and just toss the thing.</li>
            <li> I have the Wahl Brand I bought from Amazon for 10.99 and the Wahl is great it shapes and it is close on the shave, I think does fine on beard length I had no issue getting the attachments on. I recommend the Wahl at 10.99 you can&#x27;t go wrong.﻿</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this trimmer because of the multiple uses.</li>
            <li> Husband was glad to receive this gift at Christmas as he dropped his other one and broke it. :(</li>
            <li> It is a very strong cutter. The attachments leave a little to be desired. All in all, it&#x27;s wo the price</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good product.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my boyfriend and he likes the brand and all the different attachements that it has. Great product for an even better price!</li>
            <li> works great, the shaver guard trapped and pulled hairs initially, but seems better behaved after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken, unable to return for exchange or refund, so decided to try to repair it myself. After opening the trimmer I discovered that it was completely missing a wire to complete the circut</li>
            <li> Problem is after buying a few sets, I have one with a blade that has something wrong in one of the teeth and it bites the face. But only one bad blade in like 4 sets of these at this point, perfect gift and the nose trimmers are sweet</li>
            <li> What more can. You ask for, something that does the job it was intended, it&#x27;s inexpensive  and easy to use.  As with most older men, I seem to be growing hair in all the wrong places and losing it where it&#x27;s needed, this little kit takes care of the first half of my poblem just fine.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son and he lives it.  Great for hair, beard and even those weird nose and ear hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky with how my beard or stubble looks on my face and this beard trimmer works perfect for what I need it to do. So if your looking for a reasonably priced trimmer that will do the job I would definitely give this one a go.</li>
            <li> Runs great. Works like a charm. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my beard lately and I owe it all to this handy dandy trimmer. btw, saw the same one w/o the nose trimmer at walmart for double the price of this one. definitely a good find...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-LiFE</li>
            <li> Still going strong after more than a years use every other day.</li>
            <li> Shop All&lt;br /&gt;Canada (English does not cut )</li>
            <li> pulls hairs more than i&#x27;m comfortable with, wahl model # 9966 has worked much better for me</li>
            <li> i felt very bad while using this its like i wasted my money to buy this</li>
            <li> Get the good one this is not it....this worked for a few mos. Pulls hair when cutting.&lt;br /&gt;OK if you just want to pick up a cheapy...but otherwise I would pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** The folks at Wahl read my review and contacted me thru Amazon asking me to contact customer service...I did and the young lady that I spoke with was terrific! She said she was sorry I was unhappy and sent me new products as replacements. Thank you WAHL!!! Not many companies that stand behind their products like that anymore. BTW the new products work as I hoped.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really thinking about the battery issue when I bought this.  I thought wireless and rechargable would mean a base for recharging.  The beard trimmer is ok.  It&#x27;s not adjustable enough to get real gradations.  The nose and ear trimmer is great.</li>
            <li> I bought this somewhere else. Worst trimmer ever. It won&#x27;t hold a charge. I returned it and got another one and the some thing. It won&#x27;t keep a charge. I am returning this one also and getting a real trimmer.</li>
            <li> Good product, the only down fall is that it is battery powered.</li>
            <li> Great buy.  Works well, but, from Amazon write-up and description, I did not realize it was AA battery powered....I expected it to be plug-in rechargeable.  I guess I should have known the price was WAY too low to be rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected. This is a good piece for the price.Just make sure to have brand new batteries or it won&#x27;t trim very well.</li>
            <li> Ok, get real, a booger cutter plus a sideburn/beard trimmer for 10bucks!&lt;br /&gt;This is a steal.&lt;br /&gt;A booger cutter is 10 bucks, so the trimmer is free.&lt;br /&gt;Works great and no commie jumped out, trying to turn me into a spy!&lt;br /&gt;U need 3 aa batteries and u can trim and booger cut.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. Loving it.</li>
            <li> great gift! my husband LOVES it!! works great for facial hair and for his hair. best on hes ever had... so he says.</li>
            <li> These are meant for touch-ups and for that, they&#x27;re okay at best.  They&#x27;re also very noisy and applying a drop of oil doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deafeningly loud and extremely cheap, but it gets the job done. Unlike some of the other users, I haven&#x27;t noticed any pain/snagging and the batteries lasted for awhile (I can&#x27;t remember the exact time span, but it was long enough for no concerns to arise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old adage, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; holds especially true for this product.</li>
            <li> Used it twice and then it stopped working, even with new batteries it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This item sucks, keep jamming when I use it</li>
            <li> I liked the last model better....  but a cheap way to get er done</li>
            <li> Not much use yet but works great.  I have only used it about 6-8 times but the batteries don&#x27;t seem to die real easy and I like the preformance and with the other little trimmer it is a great little package,  I will post more if I run into any problems.</li>
            <li> IT STOP WORKING AFTER ONLY TWO WEEK JUNK DON&#x27;T BUY</li>
            <li> works good, wish it was rechargeable</li>
            <li> Must buy for beard enthusiasts. I tried out both and both trimmers work really well.</li>
            <li> This product was cheap. I used it one time to trim certain areas. I packed it in a shoe box to be put into my tuff box for my redeployment and opened my shoe box to find out it doesn&#x27;t even work anymore. There was nothing in there to damage the clippers. I&#x27;m upset about this but I&#x27;m not going to bother to send it back to get fixed since I only paid like $15.</li>
            <li> It is really a value for money. Can&#x27;t expect ear trimmer and beard trimmer in less than 12 bucks. Strongly recommend for those who want handy, light weight trimmer</li>
            <li> ES MUY BUENA Y PERFECTA PARA LLEVARLA DE VIAJE ES COMODA LIGERA Y PRACTICA SU HOJILLA SIRVE PARA AFEITAR CON MAS COMODIDA</li>
            <li> It does the job quite well I have been using this product for a few weeks now and have no problem. It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a good product ,i could have picked this up at walmart,but it was easier to order and have it sent to me.</li>
            <li> buenas noches la compra todo fue muy rapido y sin ningun problama y en excelentes condiciones y llego a tiempo gracias</li>
            <li> i got it the afternoon and bought tow batteries at the shop came home and shaved with it , works great shave smooth enough and came with brush comb and oil with attachments and a bonus nose trimmer . con: its loud  could have been a little quieter.&lt;br /&gt;pro: cost&lt;br /&gt;  bonus nose trimmer&lt;br /&gt;  actually works</li>
            <li> As soon as i got it out the nose hair clipper didn&#x27;t work. I should have known that it was crap by the price. i would have returned it but i didn&#x27;t want to spend more money on return shipping.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time in an unopened clam shell. Put the batteries in, but the only thing that worked was the nose trimmer. Returned for full refund.</li>
            <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK THIS STUFF WHY I PUT IT THE BATTERY AND IT DOESN&#x27;T WORKKKK I NEED NEW ONE PLEASEEE OR I DON&#x27;T WANT IT !</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to use on his beard during his hunting season. It works well and it&#x27;s a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Worst purchase on Amazon so far... I bought this because it was cheap and had both trimmer for hair and nose, but it has lasted three uses and now the nose piece doesn&#x27;t work and the beard trimmer does not work well either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Nice complete kit. Works like a Wahl.</li>
            <li> I bought, On APRIL 12, 2012; the Wahl 5537-1801 Cordless Battery Operated Beard Trimmer after I saw one like it in my Son&#x27;s hand.I was hoping that he&#x27;d forget it as he was scurrying about for deployment. Even tho I moved his trimmer to the back of the closet he found it and took it with him....SO SAD!&lt;br /&gt;SO; I looked around and found this trimmer...My Son had this GREAT LOOKIN beard that is short....SORT of like a five o&#x27;clock shadow....but all the time...and longer...&lt;br /&gt;I am still running on the same AA Duracell BATTERY that I put in when the trimmer arrived.  Hmmm; It&#x27;s been so long that I have to check if it&#x27;s one cell or two...Be right back...OK it has two AA DURACELLs in it. 7 MONTHS Of use and it is still clean, strong and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I oil it as recommended; once a monthe I put a drop on the cutting edge. It&#x27;s not easy to spread a drop over the entire cutting surface; so I alternate side edges of the cutter each month to start the spread of oil. I run the cutter for a few minutes to get the oil worked into the cutter&#x27;s recesses.&lt;br /&gt;I keep the exterior of the cutter clean. I use Q-tips to get the bits off the surfaces. I use the brush, SUPPLIED, after each use to clean the blade and cutter exterior. I store the trimmer in the holder for the trimmer, brush, comb, oil, WAHL trimmer attachments...Tho I just keep the one attachment I use in the holder. The other attachments are in a zip lock baggie IF ever I should need them. ALL the attachments fit in the holder but I didn&#x27;t want to sift through the attachments till I found the \\&quot;I\\&quot; I use.&lt;br /&gt;I use, just the one, cutter cover labeled \\&quot;I\\&quot;. This allows me to get a nice trim on my eyebrows. I use the cutter without a cover to trim my nose, ears and ensuring my side-burns are even.&lt;br /&gt;For a while I tried to have a beard looking as nice as my Son&#x27;s...SIGH!!!!! It is NOT TO BE...I have all this silver in my beard...matches my head in the color....hahahahaha...&lt;br /&gt;This is ONE TERRIFIC TRIMMER. I cannot recommend this trimmer too highly...WE never see quality tools anymore, at an affordable price....I have never used the nose/ear trimmer that was supplied with the kit. The primary WAHL trimmer meets ALL my requirements.&lt;br /&gt;Tom</li>
            <li> I bought this one because I had a really nice Wahl beard trimmer but my 1 yr old son has hidden it from me. At first I was really impressed, but after the first use, it lost the power it initially had. I turned if off, cleaned up out, put some more oil in it and it did fine. Just a pain to have to lubricate it every couple of minutes. Thought it does do the job, I miss my old one, because it was a beast and you only had to lubricate it every couple weeks. It does the job, but I hope it does not die on me in the next few uses.</li>
            <li> It is an ok trimmer. My old one was better. Next trimmer I&#x27;ll spend the extra money for better quality.</li>
            <li> it was a gift for a friend</li>
            <li> it beautiful,but did not use it yet</li>
            <li> Nose trimmer broke after very few uses and can only be used if I keep the  battery cover off and jiggle the battery into place just right, but shaver works well and is still going strong after many months.</li>
            <li> this was a replacement for one that was retired.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I was a little worried as I thought I ordered a rechargeable unit but this one is battery operated (must purchase separately).  I have been using a few times a week for my bikini line.  It doesn&#x27;t pinch or cut and gets hairs close to skin (not to be confused with a straight razor but good for what I need).  I wouldn&#x27;t use the nose hair trimmer as I have a little grooming tool I like better but I still kept it just in case.  Can&#x27;t beat for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad but the noise trimmer does not work from day 1, and the blades on the clipper looks to be getting rusty in less then a month.</li>
            <li> Great for trimming my beard and mustache...</li>
            <li> Work perfectly for my beard and side burns, gives a good shape up as well, definitely great quality for the price</li>
            <li> Thanks arrived on time and works well.  Have only used trimmer for sideburns so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Not 100% happy with the quality of the unit but for the price it is worth it</li>
            <li> This set is great and compact. The battery can be removed and replaced and it meets all my simple needs. It would&#x27;ve been great to get a case instead of a stand, but I cannot really complain about anything about this product. The packaging is a little difficult to open though.</li>
            <li> Recomiendo 100% al vendedor. El producto me llegó en perfectas condiciones y en el tiempo que lo necesitaba. Realmente era lo que esperaba y mucho mas. Espero seguir comprando a éste proveedor en muchas ocasiones mas</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed and as described.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly thick beard. It shaved it down to close shave. No problems getting through the thicker parts. Its light not to loud. Cant ask for any more for the price</li>
            <li> It works great to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> It was great while it worked. However, the trimmer broke down and will not turn on after a month of casual use.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the beard trimmer and it does it&#x27;s job very well. It&#x27;s size is very comfortable to the hand and it does not pull the hair as I trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had a small problem in operating it as the battery contacts weren&#x27;t touching the batteries. Other than that. it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great and is sold at the right price. My only problem with it is that I like to keep my beard at 1-2 centimeters in length, and this trimmer doesn&#x27;t offer any heads to accommodate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longest head still cuts my bear down to 1/3&amp;#34; or so. So if you only intend of keeping a short beard or stubble, this is a great trimmer. Otherwise I would look for something else.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my boyfriend who didn&#x27;t have anything to trim with, just shave! He loves it! He says that it is pretty powerful and precise and only cut him once his first time using it. He hasn&#x27;t used the nose/ear trimmer though so I don&#x27;t know how well those work. Would highly recommend if someone in your life needs an affordable first time trimmer!</li>
            <li> Beard trimmer lasted two seconds &amp; shut off forever. I tried another set of new batteries, it is still broken.</li>
            <li> terrible product. it was not what i was looking for. I had to buy another product and just wasted 15 bucks for this crap</li>
            <li> I hate this trimmer, I&#x27;ve been buying multigroom products for several years now, Remington, norelco etc. this was simply the worst. I bought this for personal grooming, the machine is so loud giving the illusion of it being powerful. I was afraid to use it anywhere on my body, especially the nether regions. It kept pulling my hair, and is simply horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing is that all components and attach work.</li>
            <li> A great, inexpensive device.</li>
            <li> This machine was waiting for the time, the truth has fulfilled my expectations. A long time ago I needed to care for my skin</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying out a friends Wahl. It works well and I found it to be more then capable of trimming my large and thick beard. Its not super high end, its made of cheap plastic, however its hard to complain when you get a bonus trimmer all for around ten bucks. This has to be one of the best cheap trimmers on the market. So far I cannot find fault with its function. The only complaint I have is that is would be nice if the included stand had holders for the attachments and extra trimmer. Other then that its a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> the nose trimmer didn&#x27;t even operate properly.</li>
            <li> Junk with no batteries..</li>
            <li> Product came in good condition everything worked great and at an awesome price! Well worth the buy! 1 2 3</li>
            <li> I honestly thought it was going ti be better than the reviewss had said it was going to be , but my fiance hates it. He has only used it when needed because it pulls to bad. Battery life is good but functions are not.</li>
            <li> Product worked as advertised and delivered when promised. No issues. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product great price</li>
            <li> A well received gift for a friend. I bought this 25 years ago for the same person. It just died so got him a new one. Hope it last another 25 years!</li>
            <li> Works well gift was exactly what he wanted for Christmas thanks amazon for comin thru when I needed you the most</li>
            <li> Good product for the price,</li>
            <li> Happy with it, although the nasal one is a bit dodgy - lots of handy diverse bits so i can do facial and head</li>
            <li> Not a bad by. Well worth the money. They cut GRAY hair and you guys how tuff they are! So I say go ahead. They also got here faster than I could go to Wal-Mart and get em.</li>
            <li> item well described and performs as expected; no frills,great price, great kit; good value, meeting my expectations with no hassle</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain much considering the price. It does well on batteries. It&#x27;s very loud. Didn&#x27;t buy it for the nose trimmer but it turns out that works well too.</li>
            <li> Worked great especially for such an inexpensive trimmer.  Like battery operated so no need to carry a travel power adapter when I go overseas.</li>
            <li> When our previous Wahl shaver died, I didn&#x60;t think we could replace it. Was thankful to find this. It&#x60;s a great little shaver that doesn&#x60;t eat batteries. Great for trimming mustaches as it doesn&#x60;t pull the hair.  We love it.</li>
            <li> Strips of metal that hold batteries in place were weak and already bent upon purchase. Then broke within first week. Massive design oversight.</li>
            <li> Running it with niCads so battery life is hard to gauge. It does catch/pull occasionally when going too fast. Really loud, so plan around others sleep.&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it does what you need.&lt;br /&gt;Takes about 8 minutes to get the job done to my satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an on/off beard guy and like it short, so this is the ticket.</li>
            <li> I tried to save some money, and beat out walmart by $3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this kit, and the functionality isnt Bad, but leave more to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;I have a trimmed beard, but a functional actual beard, so i trim it alot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this gets slightly jammed on thicker parts of my beard, but the real dissapointment is the massive&lt;br /&gt;waste of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stand is flimsy and overloaded, in the end I will not lie, it does get the job done when i shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried the nose trimmer yet,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- otherwise you&#x27;re still better off spending a couple more bucks on one that has a internal rechargable battery</li>
            <li> Is serves the purpose for personal grooming from time to time. My barber has one and is the reason I bought this.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these and it failed within a few weeks. Figuring it must have been a one-off, I bought a second. It failed within one day. This product has some very serious quality control issues.</li>
            <li> not the best beard trimmer but it works runs on AA battries the nose hair trimmer is the best piece in the package</li>
            <li> For the price, item works great! Can&#x27;t be beat. Runs on simple AA batteries and needs low maintenance. Simply clean with brush and oil provided and item will last.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Worked for half a second. Cuts like crap.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item strongly for personal hygiene..  The clipper works great , I love it..  If you are hairy and want to trim some this will do it..</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work out of the box. It never turned on. I would not suggest this product. I&#x27;m very disappointed..</li>
            <li> Put battery in, turned on to see that it worked.  First time I went to use it, it wouldn&#x27;t work.  Seems the cheap switch had already broken.  Normally this is a very good company, I got a dud.</li>
            <li> Trims personal hair.&lt;br /&gt;Should be adjustable without arbitrary length attachments, cost a star.&lt;br /&gt;Seems pretty reliable so far.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend and he loves it. Had a Wahl clipper set with a smaller clippers that broke so had to replace. Thank You</li>
            <li> Good buy for the money</li>
            <li> No damm good at all do not buy go to Walmart first</li>
            <li> The quality is not great. I can see why it is only $10.00</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice, and it  does a fine job trimming my beard and neck. Much better than my previous one. The Wahl shaves much closer to the skin. I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t need to be charged. I don&#x27;t know what the battery life is yet.</li>
            <li> Much more than I expected paying what I payed... have been using the kit over a year and everything works great!!!</li>
            <li> Powerful trimmer and works well.  However, it rusts quickly when taking into the shower.  Have had other trimmers and they didn&#x27;t rust.  For the money, a good trimmer . . . i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll have to replace more often.</li>
            <li> It does an ok job for the price. Replaceable batteries have far more power then any of their rechargeable units.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimming kit for the price</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, have used more than a year, still going strong.</li>
            <li> not too bad does what it says works good</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t cut very well</li>
            <li> good, but I Think it is a little small, bigger is better</li>
            <li> The Wahl brand for the last thirty years has provided by far the best (and cheapest) mens shaver.  The little gimmicks for limiting the depth of cutting have been to guys with beards the most terrific and simple ideas of great value to men.</li>
            <li> Men might use this but I&#x27;m a woman. I really love this for shaving. I hate razors because they give me razor bumps, but this thing is a lifesaver! And you don&#x27;t have to get in the shower to use it.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the bargain price, and it does the job, as needed.</li>
            <li> This set is everything it said it was. It runs such a long time without changing batteries. 2 flaws though. The batteries don&#x27;t fit perfectly in place of the beard trimmer and that makes it feel cheap. And it sometimes snags onto facial hair which can be very painful. Otherwise mobile and easy to use</li>
            <li> Does not cut &amp;#34;cleanly&amp;#34;. No pulling, but it&#x27;s just not an even trim. It works, and I take it on trips where size matter, but for home my Whal hair clippers on the 1.25 inch setting do a waaaay better job.</li>
            <li> so far so good. Only wish it had a little longer beard length guide.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut my husband&#x27;s beard without pulling and pinching. Disappointed</li>
            <li> ordered for gifting , i am pleased</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this for the price</li>
            <li> it works  well my husband loves it</li>
            <li> Beard trimmer works great. Ear, nose trimmer is just OK, a little underpowered and hard to get correcy battery contact.</li>
            <li> Looking at amazon website..i thought of trying it..but when i got it..it did not work and was simply waste of money...I have uses WAHL Products earlier too..but this time it was not upto mark.</li>
            <li> Dead on arrival right out of the packaging. Don&#x27;t waste you time or money..........it&#x27;s not even worth sending it back!</li>
            <li> Cool beans were found with this item.</li>
            <li> Love it....works wonders for the beard.</li>
            <li> This product works for the small job that I need it for. I like the ease of use and the fact that there is not a cord to get in the way.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. I opened it upped &amp; plugged it in and everything worked like a charm. Thank you!</li>
            <li> excelente muy product complacido , lo recomiendo / Excellent product very pleased , would recommend</li>
            <li> This is a pretty darn good set for the price. It does not include batteries. The nose trimmer uses a single battery. At first I thought that it would be too weak, but it mowed the inside of my nostril with ease. Prime Shipping made this a real bargain!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Plus you can put your own batteries in it.  I use rechargable ones.</li>
            <li> Replaced my worn out trimmers I confident these well be a good as the previous Wahl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.  Not as powerful as my commercial clipper, but it is cheaper.  The nose clipper doesn&#x27;t really work very well.  At least it came with oil for my commercial one.</li>
            <li> This very inexpensive Wahl did better than my three times more expensive Norelco. It just has one job of trimming my mustache and with better attachments for it than the Norelco it does a better job.</li>
            <li> Very good quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY THIMG THAT WORKED IN THIS KIT WAS THE NOSE TRIMMER STAY WAY DON&#x27;T BUY THIS S***!I WAS SO PISSED I  JUST THREW IT STRAIGHT IN THE TRASH NOT WORTH THE SHIIPING CHARGES WENT TOO FRY&#x27;S AND BOUGHT BETTER QUALITY TRIMMER</li>
            <li> I BROUGHT THIS FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT .SO I HOPE MY BOYFRIEND LIKE IT .I THINK HE WILL LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars due to the fact its so cheap and works like it&#x27;s supposed to. I have a beard and use this, works fine. Nose hair trimmer is nice too!</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked great....for the first month or two. After that it started to sputter and be less effective. It shares the same problem that the nose trimmer that it comes with does, poor design. The battery casing does not hold the batteries in properly this results in lower battery life, sporadic motion, and shot life span. Its a great buy for someone who is just getting into bearding.</li>
            <li> This product is really nice, we especially liked the round nose hair cutter, that is a nice feature.  The quality of the product is good, and the guys love using it.  It was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great but you&#x27;ll go death from the noise of this think. NO joke it will make you go death</li>
            <li> works well, does the job, inexpensive, shipped fast. Had a similar razor Conair and I like this one much better</li>
            <li> The page on Amazon describing this product say &amp;#34;About Wahl&lt;br /&gt;Wahl has been inventing and manufacturing grooming appliances for over 89 years in Sterling, IL. .... The company remains steadfast to its roots by providing professional quality products. Unlike its competition, its trimmers are engineered and manufactured in a Wahl factory. &amp;#34; So you&#x27;d guess that the product is made in the US, right? Wrong. It is made in China. Every piece is marked &amp;#34;Made in China.&amp;#34; . The instructions were even printed in China. I suppose it was even packaged in China.</li>
            <li> This tamed my beard.  It small but powerful for a battery powered device.  I&#x27;ve owned 110v units in the past and this unit is just like them.</li>
            <li> Pulls beard hair constantly, It&#x27;s no good</li>
            <li> this kit is excelent is complete and too good, and the shipping was excelent all the description is right, very clear and the quality is perfect</li>
            <li> they work good so far, don&#x27;t like that they run on batteries. thought it would have been a built in battery&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I like this brand more than other at home brands I have used.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to trim my mustache and beard. Contrary to what I have read, the batteries last a long time it does trim the way I like it and it is a very good product. I don&#x27;t know why people have to be so critical about products. Perhaps they received a lemon or they complain about everything. I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, I have had this product for about 5 months now, perhaps a bit longer. I am using the same batteries I put in it when I bought it and it works just fine. So much for the batteries don&#x27;t last long. Perhaps those complaining shouldn&#x27;t use it to cut their grass!!!</li>
            <li> Not very sharp.. Batteries die fast</li>
            <li> The quality of this thing is seriously bad.&lt;br /&gt;I never had a beard trimmer so bad.&lt;br /&gt;The hairs constantly get caught in the trimmer attachment which leads to painful pulling of single hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously bad design.&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this product, there is a reason why it is as cheap as it is.</li>
            <li> Great little machine for the price. Works very well. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> excellent product, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Nose trimmer is nice, but the razor quits after a few shaves, GET A RECHARGEABLE RAZOR.</li>
            <li> Works fine, really like the AAA batteries.  Seemed like the last one I had always needed a charge when I needed to trim the beard.</li>
            <li> nice! wish it were a rechargable unit.</li>
            <li> Good price but OK quality. The different length plastic guards catch hair sometimes on beard. Have to hold at a specific angle. May try a different brand/style.</li>
            <li> We have only recently received the items.  They have performed as expected to date.  Great item.</li>
            <li> This is definitely better than the &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; reviews, if you ask me. Sure, it&#x27;s no luxury beard trimmer, and occasionally, it tugs at my hair. But for the price, the few times it gives me that minor discomfort can be easily overlooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 preset length guides are really easy to put on and take off, and the compact size and storage rack make it really easy to keep out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it about a month so far, trimming 1-2x a week, and I can tell you that I&#x27;m happy. No regrets, and not considering purchasing a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; trimmer at this point.</li>
            <li> Does not cut great. Nose trimmer just cut up the inside of my nose. For the price.... Guess I should have known.</li>
            <li> I choose the battery unit instead of the rechargeable just because in the past ive had issues with rechargeable units, has everything you need to get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for the money. My only complaint is the motor is loud but other than that excellent product.</li>
            <li> good product for the price.</li>
            <li> For the money, you can&#x27;t beat the item.  Surprised with all the little extras that came with my order. Great</li>
            <li> Excellent! Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> i like how easy it is to use them</li>
            <li> love it! for the price it is a fantastic choice. you cant go wrong with this product it has everything you need</li>
            <li> Needed a cheap trimmer and have always liked Wahl in the past. The trimmer does it&#x27;s job but it doesn&#x27;t come with many long clippers. The 3 it comes with only trim very short. It is also pretty loud. Other than that though it&#x27;s great and worth the price.</li>
            <li> item was as described and new in package, was definately what i expected and would definately buy items from again</li>
            <li> llego a tiempo. en el tiempo que se estaba esperando. tiene muy buena calidad. aun lo estoy usando. buen articulo.</li>
            <li> Cons - The guides and stand are very chintzy/flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Pros - It&#x27;s cheap. It trims well, better without using the guides. Uses AA batteries. Batteries are better because usually we run through trimmers because the irremovable battery stops keeping a charge. Trimmer is slim and light for easy traveling. After 4 months, it hasn&#x27;t rusted yet.</li>
            <li> It works great! Trim your moustache, beard (if you have one), nose and ear hairs with ease. Anyone who needs a trimmer should buy this kit! And very reasonably priced as well</li>
            <li> This is a very nice battery operated trimmer , it works well and its easy to travel with. nicely made as well.</li>
            <li> This set comes with everything you need.The clippers and the nose trimmers do a very good job.All the attachments really come in quite handy.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product. Doesn&#x27;t yank hairs out and moves smoothly. The clips look like they may break over time but that is yet to gee seen. For the money, it&#x27;s agood buy</li>
            <li> These are wonder for any guy who likes to keep well groomed. Whal clippers are the best in the business.</li>
            <li> Item works really well. I love trimmers with AA batteries - they are easy to replace and you never have to worry about the battery losing charge over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular model comes with a few attachments, all necessary accessories, and a convenient stand for the bathroom to hold everything. Perfect for your everyday trimming needs. Great value.</li>
            <li> Me gusto mucho. Cumplio mis expectativas.!</li>
            <li> Pure awesomeness! Stylin&#x27; and profilin&#x27;!</li>
            <li> it cuts the hair off my body parts with ease and glory&lt;br /&gt;snip snip now im socially acceptable</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> It was just as expected. Compact and very much what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This is about the third trimmer i&#x27;ve tried and they are all garbage. This one really doesn&#x27;t trim anything, and the nose hair trimmer is basically useless. It doesn&#x27;t cut anything. I still have to jam scissors up my nose and cut them that way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for a few months now. The attachments get stuck on the machine (the one I have now wouldn&#x27;t come off) and the blade pulls on my beard and is not very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very powerful and the metal rusts if you rinse it in a sink. But for 10 bucks if I get a year out of use it seems worth it. Does what it needs to.</li>
            <li> It works great considering the price. if you&#x27;re looking for something to used on a daily basis, I&#x27;d look for something more upscale but for an occasional touch up you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I would like to return. It back, it works on battery ,</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He just grew his first beard and I wanted him to hVw something to maintain the shape. Comes with everything he needed!</li>
            <li> Very poorly made, rips hairs out instead of cutting them, buyers beware,  spend more and get a better quality.</li>
            <li> For what it costs it works fine.  The holder isn&#x27;t really all that effective or useful as it doesn&#x27;t have a spot for the small rotary trimmer or all of the length guards.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the cheap price.  And after 1 use, the razor acts up now and is dull and does not shave well.  The &#x27;free&#x27; nose and ear trimmer were used once and the 2nd time, it sounded like an old car rattling.  I personally am not pleased and don&#x27;t recommend it.  I&#x27;ve got to buy another one now to replace this one.</li>
            <li> Good value for money- works as needed.</li>
            <li> Great price, like the different length combs. Use to trim mustache, light beard.  Works well. Also the nose/ear trimmer is nice accoutrement to pkg.</li>
            <li> Fine for the price after the first trimmer was replaced because it didn&#x27;t work.  You would think the manufacturer would&#x27;ve tested this before sending to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Took forever to arrive. WHAT HAPPENED, did the company run out of new products and sent returned items from their warehouse slated to be refurbished. The product I received did not work and upon closer inspection appeared used. I was so disgusted with the trimmer, I just threw it in the trash. Absolutely the worse on line purchase I&#x27;ve ever experienced!</li>
            <li> You had one job and you failed. This shaver is no match for an actual beard, the guards don&#x27;t let hair through and the motor is horribly under powered.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money. Just as described.</li>
            <li> It does not power on but I will get back to that later.&lt;br /&gt;First let&#x27;s talk about shipping:  what is the deal with Amazon order tracking information arriving the day before the order arrives?  I&#x27;m all for free fast shipping (I always select Super Saver Shipping) but I just can&#x27;t imagine why the tracking information cannot be sent the moment the label is generated.  Do I blame the USPS for that?&lt;br /&gt;Next let&#x27;s talk about packing: The beard trimmer is &#x27;blister packed&#x27; with the typical clear plastic shell around it.  Apparently the packers didn&#x27;t want to waster the proper size box so they used a box that wasn&#x27;t deep enough which cause the item&#x27;s packaging to get crushed.&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s talk about the trimmer:  For ten bucks I didn&#x27;t expect a lot but I did expect it to power on.  I tried brand new batteries, then other batteries, to no avail.  The power slider switch actually felt as though it wasn&#x27;t connected to anything since I felt no resistance when sliding it on/off.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t try the nose hair trimmer mostly because I don&#x27;t have nose hair that needs to be trimmer but also because I knew I&#x27;d be returning the entire thing.&lt;br /&gt;Everything inside feels very cheap.  I can&#x27;t believe Wahl puts their name on this product but then most likely the Wahl brand name was sold to some investment company years ago anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I will now take the time to visit local retailers to find something that works.  While Amazon&#x27;s return process if simple and proved to be hassle free the one time I used it previously I am now left without a beard trimmer.  Not the end of the world but I hope as Amaozn gets bigger this does not become the norm.&lt;br /&gt;Once they start charging sales tax what benefit will there be by ordering online vs. shopping local?</li>
            <li> Does everything it supposed to do very well</li>
            <li> Wow these are amazing for my first pair Trimmers. I havent had a problem with them so far. They work great for trimming up my face, hair line Etc..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really pick up on the &amp;#34;battery operated&amp;#34; part. Also this thing is terrible about catching my beard hairs and pulling them. Very painful!</li>
            <li> I have owned and used both the Wahl 9906-2001 and Wahl 5537-1801 mustache/beard trimmers for a number of years.  Both have worked well for me; I keep my facial hair trimmed very short, using the blade as opposed to the combs -- so I can&#x27;t comment on the combs and other accessories. I like the AA-battery feature as I travel to places without 110v electricity.  I use Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries (on almost all my battery operated gadgets) and a single charge lasts a long time (a few months) when using the trimmers every other day at home. -- While they have taken a lot of use, neglect and rough handling over the years of use and travel, they are not indestructible -- tonight I dropped my 5537 on a tile floor and broke the blade. &lt;frown - about my carelessness&gt;  So I&#x27;m online tonight, placing an order for a replacement.  While I&#x27;m waiting for it to arrive, I&#x27;ll pull the other 9906 trimmer out of my travel pack to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the cost. My only real complaint is that the trimmer attachment sizes aren&#x27;t that long. The longest one does not even leave a quarter of an inch of hair. I would highly recommend this to anybody looking for a cost effective trimmer set.</li>
            <li> I like this set, it cuts good and batteries last longer in it than advertised.  I would recommend these. I will send an update on any problems that come up.</li>
            <li> Very light weight.  I bought to shave small spots on my mini dog&#x27;s &amp;#34;very fine&amp;#34; hair and it is perfect  for my required use.  Not sturdy enough for much else.  For the price, good for my requirements.</li>
            <li> Get what u pay for I guess.  Don&#x27;t bother to buy this.  Spend a little more and get one that actually works.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is powerful enough and it&#x27;s actually a benefit to use rechargeable AA batteries in this compared to a cheap built in NiCad. The trimmer does occasionally catch a hair and pull or snag on it from time to time. But I would happily buy another one of these at less than $10 instead of a $40 unit next time I need a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works well and was priced right.  Have only used it a couple of times so far, but I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A GREAT PURCHASE,GAVE IT AS GIFT!  WOULD DEF PURCHASE AGAIN IF NEED BE! GREAT PRICE ALSO. WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> It is as expected and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely got what i paid for. I do not think i will use all the attachments though lol</li>
            <li> This was a great buy! Still have it months later and it works perfect. Anything by Wahl is great so if you find it at this low price buy it and you will not regret it</li>
            <li> Nice and light weight ... easy to use and clean ... great battery life ... Happier than a bee in clover that I got it ...</li>
            <li> I purchased this and had to return it for a refund as it didn&#x27;t even work right out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> For less than $10 you get a nose trimmer, beard trimmer and all of the accouterments.  I bought a similar one and it lasted about 7 years.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and in good condition...............Works like its suppose to.......Though it not the best in quality but i guess you get what you pay for............But it does work well</li>
            <li> Very handy, easy to use, I like it!</li>
            <li> Nose trimmer stopped working after 5 weeks, to clarify... The device works IF unattached from connected trimmer cap. I&#x27;ve cleaned it and still un-working&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed Wahl...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my husband. He will use it as soon as he buys the batteries for it. It appears to be everything he needs...(especially the nose hair trimmer).</li>
            <li> This item is a great kit. I bought it to use as a trimmer when giving the kids a haircut. Cutting behind the ears and neck area is easy when using this beard trimmer..</li>
            <li> Very Poor Quality and unsafe</li>
            <li> I wanted something to trim my eyebrows and nose, and something with a stand, so the trimmer &amp; attachments wouldn&#x27;t be scattered by my sink. Cost wasn&#x27;t a priority for me, but it didn&#x27;t hurt that this was so cheap.&lt;br /&gt; Two trimmers, a number of attachments, and a stand, come in the package. I knew from another reviewer that the &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; nose &amp; eyebrow trimmer doesn&#x27;t fit in the stand, but it&#x27;s flat-bottomed, and stands up just fine. A small bottle of oil is also included, and has its own spot in the stand, along with slots for the comb and cleaning brush. Other attachments go into a tray.&lt;br /&gt;  The nose trimmer didn&#x27;t run when I first installed the batteries. I just bent the battery contact out a little and that fixed the problem. Poor quality control, you guys. The trimmer is the round type: the outer, round guide is stationary, and the blades spin inside. It worked like a charm, without any pulling or discomfort. My old one had a narrow, straight blade, and it took a long time to do the job. This one was quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;  The instructions recommended using the nose hair trimmer for eyebrows, but that seemed a one-hair-at-a-time job. Instead, I just used the &amp;#34;5-position guide&amp;#34; on the beard trimmer, set to its longest position. After one run on each eyebrow, the errant hairs (or at least the errant parts of them) were gone.&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t have a beard these days, but I tried the trimmer on my side-burns, and it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve only used this once, so I don&#x27;t have experience on how well it will last, but I&#x27;ll only need to use it a few times a month.&lt;br /&gt;  For now, it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a size between the longest fitting and the next one down... For me anyway it wen&#x27;t from just a tad longer than I wanted to back about 3 weeks of hair growth. So, an in between fitting would make all the difference on that. Easy to use though, maybe a little pinching if I go to quickly.</li>
            <li> Thought it would have been bigger</li>
            <li> Would have been better off spending more money for a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality, battery doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a month and a half!</li>
            <li> great for the price and works well.</li>
            <li> U have to put batteries in it. Husband other one it plugs into the charger when dead. Everything else is like his old one that he likes.</li>
            <li> I use it to trim my beard and mustache every week to 10 days. It is very easy to use and and very light weight. I would recommend it to EVERYONE!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the 2015 version of the first beard trimmer I ever bought more than 24 years ago! It was a solid buy then. It is still the &amp;#34;gold standard&amp;#34;! Amazon&#x27;s pricing for this complete grooming package simply cannot be beat! In fact, I will be ordering two more for relatives. One improvement over the older model - and this is GREAT news - the trimmer does not &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; batteries when not in use for a week like the older models did!“We want teachers to have an open conversation about bullying in their classrooms,” she tells Yahoo Parenting. “At the beginning of the year, teachers should talk to their students about how we want, as a class, to create a climate that says we don’t accept bullying and that includes calling kids out on their bad behavior.” The trimmers last for years - usually until you drop it forty or fifty times and the case finally gives up. Wahl is the same brand that barbers and stylists use. Works for them, and it has worked for me for a LOT of years now. I could not be more satisfied with this economical, practical and complete grooming set!</li>
            <li> A workhorse and great for travel.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping I was very happy</li>
            <li> It is a mediocre product, but priced very well.  It goes through a set of batteries every two uses or so</li>
            <li> Blade sucks, runs out of batt in minutes, does not have the right size of attachments that normal shavers have. My last shaver was also Wahl and I liked it. But this one was a piece of s**t</li>
            <li> For the price, this is an amazing deal.  I love the trimmer.  This was a replacement for a really old WAHL trimmer that finally just stopped working.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for this price but the value far exceeds the price.  I don&#x27;t know that you can spend a better $10 for a male grooming product.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It was cheaply made.  I purchased another brand and it was so much better.</li>
            <li> Finally got my bear lookin nice for cheap!!</li>
            <li> Very effective kit for good price</li>
            <li> Has everything I need, works great</li>
            <li> I got this because I needed something to clean up my side burns/back of the neck between haircuts. The trimmer works well, even if it feels really cheap. I got this because I saw that it has the nose and brow trimmer, but unless you&#x27;re alright with still having visible nose hairs, the nose/brow trimmer really won&#x27;t be of much use to you.</li>
            <li> Works, is handy and does a fair job.</li>
            <li> the attachments are not like the typical Wahl attachments - none of them allow for trimming longer hair</li>
            <li> I must admit that I mostly bought this when adding items to get above $25 for super saver shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;ve ordered more sets now as gifts, because it&#x27;s a nice product. Does a fine job, sharp blades, comes with oil, nice size in the hand, plenty of cutting power, great for sideburns &amp; moustache... and if I ever grow another beard, it&#x27;ll be great for that. I have used it to mow back my neck hair and it&#x27;s better than the hair clippers I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And surprisingly, the nose hair thingy works well too. I had left it in the package since I felt it was a silly product... I&#x27;ve used scissors to do my nose hair as needed for years.... even though it&#x27;s not 100% safe, and cutting yourself inside a nostril is a good way to get a MRSA infection. But the little device takes just one AA battery, and does a dandy job with zero risk of cutting yourself. Frankly, the little nostril trimmer is worth the price of the whole set easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that several people have complained about battery life. Honestly, anyone still buying and discarding alkaline batteries deserves poor performance. These devices, like virtually all else that runs on AA batteries, will will work brilliantly and long on standard eneloop rechargeable NiMH cells... which cost about $2 each on amazon and which will each take 1500 charge cycles. They also put out power very well for high-drain purposes, and do not self-discharge significantly. I have used both the items in this kit now for months, and have not had to recharge the eneloop batteries in them yet.  And once I do, I&#x27;ll be able to do it indefinitely at no additional expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is a nice Amazon deal. Hey, if you only need one of the devices, keep what you need and give the other one to someone else. Everyone knows a beautiful woman who would be a bit more beautiful if she pruned her nose garden back a bit. Everyone knows someone with uneven sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For value and utility, I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> batteries have to be jammed into case with a hammer...very cheaply made (in China of course). Choose something else!</li>
            <li> Bought for Movember beard. Works great. Lots of useful extras. Cant beat the value and it works well.</li>
            <li> Son loves it, touches up/grooms as needed. Saves a couple dollars at the barber.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer works absolutely great. My issue is with the Ear, Nose and whatever accessory. When I first attempted to use this in my nose, it felt as if I were using tweezers. Have you ever tried that? It freakin&#x27; hurts!</li>
            <li> Works well for a battery operated trimmer</li>
            <li> Like most trimmers, these are not really heavy duty and are not meant years..  If you get 2 or 3 years out of them, you&#x27;ve done well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made of plastic  (what isn&#x27;t these days) but seems a little lightweight - you get what you pay for I suppose.  Of course, you&#x27;re not going to get a metal shaver for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, it has all the attachments men (and women) ever need from beard, to nose, to grooming.  I prefer cordless  trimmers as you can take them with you when away from home as well as not be restricted in the bathroom by being tied to an outlet.  However I also prefer rechargeable ones so saving on batteries - although changing a battery IS easier than having to wait while it charges when it runs flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to oil the head every couple of weeks otherwise the head starts grating and eventually it wears out the motor.  This part is very important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - it&#x27;s OK for the money but is a cheap machine.</li>
            <li> Professional quality grooming products at a ridiculously low price. I love the precision and ease with which these wall product trim my beard mustache, and nose hair. I can&#x27;t believe the quality at such an affordable price. Highly recommend to someone who is looking to give this as a gift to someone else who needs to &#x27;tighten&amp;#34; up their look . . .</li>
            <li> I was hoping it had a rechargeable battery but requires extra batteries for operation</li>
            <li> hair particles stick to the rubberized handle of the razor and simply won&#x27;t come off.  Works okay but is a mess.</li>
            <li> Nose n ear trimmer still wont work I guess that&#x27;s  y it was free second one I&#x27;ve tried!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome very sharp blade ...works great</li>
            <li> Way too much noise from clipper and uneven cutting - misses some hairs &amp; you must go over a spot again to get the hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;Am surprised a major name company would produce such an inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;Would NOT recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love that this trimmer just uses plain old AA batteries which can be easily changed, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about having it plugged in to the wall all of the time. It does a perfectly fine job on my goatee.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied! I&#x27;m comparing this beard trimmer to my previous one, a Philips Norelco G370 All in One Grooming Kit that I bought at a drug store for 25 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature of the Wahl 5537-1801 is the replaceable AA batteries. This Wahl beard trimmer uses two batteries. By comparison, the Norelco G370 had a single NiCad AA battery that was not intended to be replaced by the user. (I saw a YouTube video and took it apart to solder in a new battery, but it was a pain, and the clippers were still so-so.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched corded trimmers, and the professionals seem to use either the [[ASIN:B002D4IK0I Wahl Peanut]] or the [[ASIN:B000143C0K Andis T-Outliner]]. Those will last forever. I also liked the [[ASIN:B001GQ3GEY Wahl 9854-600 Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer]], but I did not see an easy way to replace the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 11 bucks on Amazon, I like the Wahl 5537-1801. It is made of plastic and will not last a lifetime like the corded models, but it should last 10+ years, assuming you oil the blades with blade oil. This listing says [[ASIN:B000B9SFQG 3310-230 Wahl Blade Oil Professional Blade Maintenance by Wahl Professional Animal]], but if you look at the package, it&#x27;s the same oil that they use for beard trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and this Wahl 5537-1801 makes no financial sense unless you have a stock of rechargable AA batteries. I&#x27;m using the [[ASIN:B00HZV9WTM AmazonBasics AA High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries (8-Pack)]].</li>
            <li> Perfect just perfect.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> For the price, this item is a steal of a deal. Ideal for travelling or to have on-the-go.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my previous beard trimmer was dying after 2 years. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Low Price&lt;br /&gt;* Does a decent job&lt;br /&gt;* Comes with attachments/accessories&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Feels Cheap&lt;br /&gt;* Nose Hair Trimmer doesn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an inexpensive trimmer that does basic trimming, this is a pretty good trimmer for the cost. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing if you are looking at utilizing the nose hair trimmer as it doesn&#x27;t work. If you are looking at styling your beard, side burns, back of head...I might recommend going for something a little more expensive. I&#x27;m not sure how long this trimmer will last but for the price I&#x27;m not too worried as I just need it for basic trimming of my beard.</li>
            <li> Does everything it should and does it well. Very good value and arrived in good time. Errant hair now under control.</li>
            <li> Great price and works great.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done much better than trimmers 4x the price. Also love not having to plug it in.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t use it yet but it seems pretty decent. I beleive I will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> these are the best clippers. last forever and do a great job</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and it appears to be a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is one of their selling points, but I dropped it in the toilet and it still works.</li>
            <li> Works great, Husband loves it. On batteries so it is easy to travel with it.The price was so low ,I could not pass this item up.&lt;br /&gt;Batteries last along time. I would recommend this shaver to all .</li>
            <li> UPDATE::3/07/2016::&lt;br /&gt;I figured i should give an update, today my Wahl trimmer finally quit working, sad day indeed! But i can tell you, this is the only trimmer ill ever buy, its lasted me 7 years! 7 years from a trimmer less then $15. I did not treat this well, never serviced it or anything. I am beyond happy with this product, i highly recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I am a lifetime beard grower, and have had many different trimmers, and I happen to by a Wahl one day, and its outlasted all my other big name trimmers, and i totally mistreated it and abused it, and it still trims like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided when i was looking to update my trimming kit to look at some Wahl Timmers, and i was not dissapointed, its plastic and feels lite but it does the job, and it does it the first time. It comes with everything i needed, and the cradle held everything pretty well. The instructions included are very useful as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this if your looking for a budget trimmer, I bought a wahl as a back up, cheap trimmer, and its become my primary trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++This is not a shaver, i think people are confusing this for a different job, This is made to trim, maintain, and sculpt a beard or mustache. If you try to shave it will pull your hair or not cut well++</li>
            <li> works as it says. havent checked the battery life since its been about 10 times or so.</li>
            <li> not worth the money for me. if you are only doing &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; trimming, they may work, but anymore than that and they cant function properly.</li>
            <li> I love this shave kit.  It is much more powerful than my old Remington one that had a chargeable battery.  Get you one you will like it.</li>
            <li> very light weight(plastic)  with a strong motor. Easy attachment change over.&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t sure about durability because of the plastic accessories but it seems to hold up just fine.</li>
            <li> Awful product. Looks like you are getting a lot for you money. I am surprised to see Wahl put their name on this. I was going to use it to trim my dog&#x27;s face, but it didn&#x27;t have enough power to do anything. I thought it might work better than my electric, since I thought it would be quieter than the electric. Yes, not as loud. Works, no.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it a few times and when I went to return it, I saw that I missed the date to return it. I don&#x27;t have the same impression of Wahl anymore that I used to have.</li>
            <li> It worked twice, and then quit. Just quit. I changed the batteries. Nothing. It is cheaply made. Was willing to over look that. But assumed for even the price, it would last a year. But two weeks? Shame. Pure junk.</li>
            <li> None of these low priced trimmers are built to last. Not that anything more expensive is that much better.</li>
            <li> Works for nearly every beard grooming task I need! Always have trusted Wahl for a good product. Your key to better looks!</li>
            <li> (Reprint of review on 1st product in Black w/edit) This product performed exactly as it was designed to and then some! I would recommend it to anyone who has, and will ask about it, and will buy another one like it, or an upgraded Wahl product when the time comes to replace the current one. Update 4/8/2016 : Purchased new Wahl trimmer in White in addition to Black one already owned and still in excellent working order</li>
            <li> It worked quite okay. It is not the best. But great for the price paid! We are happy so far.</li>
            <li> was a gift, everything works just great and is useful for everyday, the plastic caddy has compartment for each tool.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this for quite some time, I still use it twice a month to cut my husbands hair.  There aren&#x27;t as much clipper size guards as we would like.  My husband has ordered more size guards just this week.  Other then that I have no complaints at all.  Works well and easy to use.  Not a high end model, but we are just using it for a military hair cut.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have heavy beard so people with heavy beard may have different experience. I bought this kit recently and it works excellent for me. The beard and mustache trimmer as well as the bonus ear, nose, and brow trimmer work very well and an excellent value for the price I paid at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great battery life, nice options, does a great trim job... only wish it list which guards it came it.. seeing 4 i was thing 1, 2, 3, and 4 but no the larger one is a ???? but i will probably use it as a 5 guard once grown out that far, and if it looks ok at that length</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I like that it uses AA batteries and doesn&#x27;t have to be charged.  Great value!</li>
            <li> Cuts are pretty easy and it&#x27;s not as heavy as other model I&#x27;ve had before. my only concern is that it started to sound funny (Loud noise) after 15 0r 20 minutes of use on my first try, i wont use it till like a month after, but i hope this doesn&#x27;t become a problem. An Instructional Manual for different hair cuts would had been great to include with the package for people like me who are starting to learn how to cut hair.</li>
            <li> A great gift for the man in your life whether it&#x27;s a family member, friend or significant other. This purchase was for the number 1 man in my life, my Dad!!!</li>
            <li> i receive verry wrong item. nose trimmer not work&lt;br /&gt;beard trimmer not effective and so bad&lt;br /&gt;dont buy it&lt;br /&gt;it is a werry bad item!!!!&lt;br /&gt;just toy</li>
            <li> Cheap, starts making noises after a while and it doesn&#x27;t work on steady speed since day one... also ager a few days i saw rust on the blades (although never exposed to water), and it starts pulling beard hair (the oil included doesn&#x27;t help)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess i&#x27;m gonna throw it away eventually after just a couple of months os use.</li>
            <li> Very happy. Would order again.</li>
            <li> Pretty bad beard trimmer. I bought it to replace an older one that worked well, and this has awful battery life, and doesn&#x27;t trim well at all (you have to go over the same spot multiple times). I&#x27;d definitely steer clear of here- I bought based on price and should&#x27;ve just spent $10-15 more.</li>
            <li> All of it works great, I especially like the fact that its all battery powered, no charging base required to waste a plug and counter space. I&#x27;ve used this for 4 months now and the nose hair trimmer is excellent. far better than previous ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> is rusting a tiny bit and feels cheap but trims like a dream!&lt;br /&gt;Will gladly buy another if it breaks for any reason.</li>
            <li> Got this for the hubby for fathers day he loves it</li>
            <li> This thing will tear your face up. It rusted over within the first week I got it and frequently cuts out.</li>
            <li> Not a knock off, item in original pkg, in tact and with all parts! Great gift for dad, BF or any man.</li>
            <li> My old set just like this quit working (switch problem) after a few years. Tried another name brand for kicks and ended up giving it away to a friend with less demanding needs and bought another Wahl. It simple cuts better and closer than the other brand. I use it a lot without a guard and the closeness of the cut is nice for roughing in the shape of my beard.</li>
            <li> Handles my beard and eyebrow trimming needs adequately.  However I was expecting it to have a rechargeable battery.  Also to handle trimming my hair.</li>
            <li> Not so bad for general beard-upkeep but not a long term product.  It feels flimsy but it does the job. Not a bad offer for $10 anyway.</li>
            <li> It is NOT giving smooth touch on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;appears like 2 days shaving ..NOT liking much&lt;br /&gt;NOT advised for purchase</li>
            <li> Not the finest trimmer on the market but for the price it works quite well.  You have to keep the blades well oiled and they work much better.  Lots of trimming size choices.  Also there is a nose hair trimmer that is quite useful.  Keep in mind this is for trimming beards, goatees, and sideburns.  It is NOT a shaver.  That being said, this is a great product for a well-groomed man whether you have a full beard, goatee, or just want that 5 day growth look.</li>
            <li> Good for the right person. I don&#x27;t like to shave often and felt that it needed more power than the battery provided.</li>
            <li> Good, convenient, such a perfect product can be 100 - 5 to be the normal price, I recommend that you buy, you will be pleased, the quality is also good to have</li>
            <li> The nose and ear trimmer never worked</li>
            <li> Excellent works very well and has many accessories. Performance is outstanding recommend it to all men looking for a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> i am in the military and require to hv my hair in standard all the time so these trimmer give me a option to fix my hair a little bit and save me money at the barber shop</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a WAHL ...enough said, no really a very good tool for home dressers and hair dressers for cleaning up facial hair and edging buzz cuts.</li>
            <li> I gave a five star rating for excellent performance and cost.I just tried it out and it worked very well.I like the fact that you don&#x27;t need to charge it.Uses  two AA battery&#x27;s.The ear and nose trimmer is a plus takes one battery.I just replaced the old chargable Wahl model I had for twenty years finally gave out.I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco trimmers over the years, and the battery pack eventually dies.  I like having this battery operated Wahl, as I can always just pop in another AA and be back in business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All attachments work fine, and the smaller trimmer is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased overall.</li>
            <li> Works but just bearly.&lt;br /&gt;1. do not cut well&lt;br /&gt;2. getting clogged right away&lt;br /&gt;3. batteries depleted rapidly&lt;br /&gt;4. feels like a one time use gizmo</li>
            <li> Man&#x27;s happy with it. Great price</li>
            <li> I should have bought this 40 years ago. Oh, that&#x27;s right -- these did not exist in this form back then! When I was a young man, I let my beard get as bushy as I could stand it, using scissors to maintain a good-looking appearance. My facial hair then was curly, and it was easy to maintain. Now, with straight, spiky, gray facial hair, scissors do not do a good job. On the recommendation of a friend, I bought this and have wondered how I got along without it for so long. The bonus ear/nose unit works great on those hard-to-get-at places that plague older men. No more hairy ears for this old goat!</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase, and for the price too. Has been working ok since I bought it. What I really like is the simplicity so that you can take around anywhere you go without bothering about the weight nor the electricity. Good stuff</li>
            <li> This item bought as a gift. Son was very pleased with it. Love that this had a lot of attachments with it.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected. For the price, I got what I wanted and it got the job done without breaking the bank or getting too fancy,</li>
            <li> this product is exelent..me callo como anillo al dedo es muy buena es como la queria tiene lo que necesito</li>
            <li> i like it cuz it cuts my beard. i like it cuz it cuts my beard. i like it cuz it cuts my beard.</li>
            <li> Me gusto primero el hecho de que es de baterías.. así la puedo llevar a donde quiera.. y si tiene fuerza para afeitar tranquilamente!! Saludos a todos  desde Venezuela!!</li>
            <li> This does the job it needs to, I&#x27;ve heard no complaints so far from my fiance. Love the price, so I won&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> no problems ok ok ok ok ok ok  ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok.ok?ok?submit review, this site is screwy</li>
            <li> This product worth for the price. I dont see any issue with this. Small, compact all accessories in the pack.&lt;br /&gt;For home use it is the great one. I bought a rechargeable battery pack with this one. Works great with that.</li>
            <li> Good product - no problems and priced right.</li>
            <li> Its a little less close than i thought it would be but it still gets a close enough shave</li>
            <li> Bought for my bf, works very well</li>
            <li> Batteries stay charged for a long time and it works pretty well. for the price I would recamend it, just needs a longer attachment</li>
            <li> The bonus nose and brow trimmer doesn&#x27;t shave properly. You&#x27;ll have to press the rotating blade a little too firmly against your nostril to get a good cut. I expected it to be a bit more... nimble and seemingly effortless (if you get my drift). Its really almost like cutting with a blunt razor though with a little persistence, it does get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer on the other hand shaves quite well - I&#x27;m not too particular about a smooth shave as long as its low enough to be neat and looks well trimmed.</li>
            <li> Great trimmers only thing is I wish they had a stand for the ear/nose trimmer to sit in</li>
            <li> Stopped working 3 weeks after ordered</li>
            <li> Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. He has had it for quite awhile now and it still works like a charm.</li>
            <li> For the price it isnt bad.. small trimmer has no place to sit in holder.. has to be kept in drawer.</li>
            <li> delivered very quickly. i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the merchandise.iwill suggest this product to any of my friends who need a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> battery operated so don&#x27;t expect anything extraordinary.  Works OK with plenty of attachments.  Not what you would see in a barbershop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this trimmer a couple times and for the price, I guess it&#x27;s okay.  I generally use it without the guides to get a close trim around my neck line.  My old Wahl trimmer that&#x27;s about 20 years old, was a lot more comfortable.  I do like the nose and ear trimmer which is almost worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> VERY LIGHT AND WORKS VERY WELL</li>
            <li> The received product is very poor in quality. I do understand that &amp;#34;you get what you for&amp;#34; but the trimmer not working after 4 uses is not acceptable.</li>
            <li> Wahl Timmers, I was not dissapointed, its plastic and feels lite but it does the job, this cordless it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Nothing in this order worked.  Replaced batteries several times and still nothing.  My son has a similar product and it worked fine with the same batteries so it is the product that is faulty.  Strange thing, neither the trimmer nor the nose tool worked.  And it is to inexpensive to send back so I&#x27;m left with a product that is worth nothing but to be thrown in the garbage!!!</li>
            <li> works as promised. I do not know how it can be so inexpensive. My beard is always trimmed now</li>
            <li> it is doing what it supposed to do&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT DID NOT WORK. Had to go the next day and buy another from Walmart.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last 5 beard trims before running out of energy.  Replaced with brand new batteries and it would never start again.  Totally useless!  Don&#x27;t be enticed by its low price - it isn&#x27;t even worth the inexpensive cost.  Avoid this product!</li>
            <li> Great for my growing boy</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer was completely useless. It wasn&#x27;t sharp at all. Even will completely new batteries, I couldn&#x27;t trim or shave anything. I even tried it on my sideburns and nothing. The nose trimmer actually did what it was intended for. It even was able to cut my sideburns that the beard trimmer couldn&#x27;t.    *EDIT* Changing it from 1* to 3*s. Taking a look closer at the trimmer, I believe I had an incorrectly assembled item. The blade was installed too far behind the teeth where the hair catches. I had to unscrew and move the blade further up into the teeth so it would cut the hair as they get caught. Anyone less observant will initially think the trimmer was too dull or defective. It works fine now. I would give it 4* if it came working as it should have.</li>
            <li> what should or need to do cause the nose trimmer some how is broken the top part keep pop or shoot out lucky it never shoot in my nose cause I have to keep holding the top part while I am every time I USED I don&#x27;t think it is save and need to do that so tell me what it&#x27;s going on I REALLY don&#x27;t know what to do or may be trash but I paid brand item why I am to get mad my self thank you</li>
            <li> The excellence you expect from one of the finest grooming product companies, at a very reasonable price, I have had several rechargeable trimmer sets...and they only last so long, this one was priced right at around 10$, and I have rechargeable batteries anyway, which can be changed. Works great for trimming beard and mustache, and the nose/ear/eyebrow trimmer works much better than the last 3 I owned. The Wahl quality far exceeds the last 2 Remington sets I had, and will surely last much longer, 2 yr. warantee! Buy it!</li>
            <li> It doe&#x27;s everything it claims it can do.  I am pleased so far.</li>
            <li> This shaver does not work well. It pulls my hair every time I used it. It is a cheap price for a reason. I would spend more and get a better product.</li>
            <li> for 10$ great deal for a wahl, cuts great, all parts came, nose clipper works great,trimmer sharp and works great. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> on the first use of this trimmer it was a good result. living here on the gulfcoast we have power outages. i dont have to worry about it being charged up or running down. this is the best non electric trimmer i have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is exactly what I was looking for, it runs on batteries and is small enough to get into tight spaces but big enough to so it doesn&#x27;t take forever to trim your beard or mustache.  The guards that come with it snap on/off with ease and provide you with four different levels to trim your beard to.  Great item at a great value.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husban and after seeing bad reviews about, i went and bought it anyways husban seems to love it and works great</li>
            <li> Sure was a good buy for the money. Does what I want it to do for my beard.  Being cordless is great also</li>
            <li> I used it about 10 times, now it won&#x27;t work anymore.&lt;br /&gt;The feel of the trimmer and the cutting abilities aren&#x27;t very good. Clearly bad quality - don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs.  Has held up well with no issues</li>
            <li> Product was what I expected for a battery operated unit.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Works pretty good but has a cheap quality and feel to it. Come&#x27;s with a lot of accessories which is a plus. I was looking for cheap product that I would end up using sparingly anyways so I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars. If you want a high quality product that will last forever, then consider this a 2 star.</li>
            <li> I got excellent service with this purchase; a quality item; I will get lots of use of this beard trimmer; this was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Well that machine is best to use i have use  in my life wish i could get  another one  for free from amazon thanks</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband, who has a small beard.  Either his barber would trim it up, or he would try to clean it up with his razor, which did not work as well as he had hoped.  Not only did this set arrive quickly, my husband is quite pleased with how well this trimmer works.</li>
            <li> Product came to me dead on arrival. Very disappointed. I have better things to do than run out to return defective products and so instead I will just avoid doing business with you and spread the word. Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Todo estuvo satisfactorio vinieron bien embalados y en perfecto estado 5 estrellas y el tiempo de envió el lo especificado</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer, juiced to use it. Popped some batteries in it and WHAT DO YOU KNOW! Doesn&#x27;t work..&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping for a decent device, my expectations weren&#x27;t high, I mean for what I paid, but I mean come on at least turn on..&lt;br /&gt;So now I got a nose trimmer..</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to not see this info anywhere on the product page before purchasing it. For anyone who wants the info - 3 AA batteries. If I had known this in advance I would have purchased batteries on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> My beard has never been so well groomed.  Dollar for dollar this the nicest trimmer set I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Its just a walmart version of their beard trimmers. I&#x27;d shop around more next time. It also goes through batteries to fast.</li>
            <li> very satisfied finding the products I&#x27;m looking for.  the trimmers were easy to use and trimmed with ease and light weight</li>
            <li> very light, battery operated and quiet.  Wahl comes up with another great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what people expect for 10-15 bucks these days.  Works great.  Only four stars because the &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; ear and nose trimmer isn&#x27;t that efficient.  Works but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> It does what I purchased it for</li>
            <li> this was the highlight of my primeday  experience  works good mainly bought for the mini trimmer and the 35% off deal that day</li>
            <li> Nice product, great size, hopefully works for a long time :)</li>
            <li> motor is erratic.......... speed varies from very slow to extremely fast&lt;br /&gt;some times it wont even turn on.......... bad switch?</li>
            <li> I am one who usually goes to the barber to get my beard trimmed and shaved. But it&#x27;s really taking a toll on my wallet going everyone week or two. So I decided to purchase this set. I was looking for something that had a trustworthy name and price. I searched and stumbled upon this set. I&#x27;ve used the Norelco beard trimmer set before, but let me tell you this shaves through the roof. I will never buy Norelco again and will stick the Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;First off I&#x27;ve noticed it a solid trimmer, good feel and the razors are sleek and agile. Giving me that barber shop look.  My lines on my beard are impeccable and I love how easy and efficient this cuts.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s battery operated  (AA), and thats a plus for me since I don&#x27;t have to worry about charging or the battery dying half way into a trim.&lt;br /&gt;I really love how easy the interchangable clips are too, easy and snap on. The nose trimmer is a big plus! . Overall I am debating purchasing another one just to have its so well worth it.</li>
            <li> And the only reason I have to call this the &amp;#34;second-best&amp;#34; razor is because it has more parts than I know how to work with. The blade is sharp, cuts close, and leaves me with no stubble, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s any danger of it catching skin or yanking out hairs. I can even use it without the aid of a mirror, simply by feeling the difference on my chin and neck. As a separate note, the &amp;#34;first-best&amp;#34; razor I ever used was also a Wahl.</li>
            <li> I should have realized this was battery, only.  The battery clippers do not have the power of a rechargeable clipper.  I have purchased a rechargeable to replace this.</li>
            <li> I have gotten previous opportunities to use Whal products and I have never been disappointed. This shaver shaves very close and the blades are sharp. I have used it only twice so far so I don&#x27;t know how long it will remain sharp, but so far it is doing as the product description said it would.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone. I have even used it to shave my scalp - because of my receding hairline, my hair style of choice is a bald shave. This shaver does a quick efficient job for me.</li>
            <li> So uch a great bathroom tool. I have a goatee and trying to maintain the shape of it with a Bic razor is next to impossible. This makes it simple and quick to maintain with the 3 guard lengths. The nose/brow trimmer is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this Wahl Cordless to replace one that lasted 5 years. The attachments from the old one don&#x27;t fit onto this new version, the blade is wider. The blade doesn&#x27;t seem to be calibrated very well, it pulls at the hairs. The provided attachments are inferior to my previous Wahl, the 3/16&amp;#34; or the 1/8&amp;#34; make no adjustment to my beard. I worried that the stubble 1/16&amp;#34; which could reduce my beard to nothing but it doesn&#x27;t perform adequately either. I&#x27;m disappointed in the performance of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I gave a five star rating for an excellent working trimmer.I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile now and  have not had  any issues.The cost is very affordable and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.I would recommend this item to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Quality is much higher then I expected.  Cordless makes it so convenient.  Comes with all the accessories needed.  Great product for home use.</li>
            <li> Great item for the price. It does feel cheaply made but it works great! I bought this for my husband so when he travels he does not need to take his trimmer that needs to be plugged in and charged. He loves the fact that it works well and is battery operated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the beard trimmer. I have to go over the same spot several times. However, the nose trimmer works like a dream. It&#x27;s quiet, but gets the job done quickly and efficiently. I&#x27;ve been using Wahl products for 7 years or so, and I usually love what I purchase. This was just a little underwhelming.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate this low enough, this is HORRIBLE! Absolute garbage, it stopped working after a month. I sent it in for repairs, but they apparently consider &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; to mean &amp;#34;do nothing&amp;#34; because after waiting for weeks for it to return in the mail, it still didn&#x27;t work. I asked to get it exchanged for another product, that stopped working after a short while too! AVOID ALL WAHL PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for some time and it has yet to fail me.  Very good product!</li>
            <li> I just purchased the unit four weeks ago. I use it pretty infrequently. The battery life is pretty good. I like the power and efficiency of the unit. The nose trimmer is excellent. I only use the smallest guide comb for my beard; and it works very well. I clean my unit with isopropyl alcohol, and it&#x27;s not very effective. It&#x27;s probably better to use the oil that Wahl packs in the package. But overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My beard is very thin so it works perfectly for me. I think this is a very complete product and I am very happy of getting it at that price.</li>
            <li> For the price it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband before Father&#x27;s Day 2 years ago and I put it away and forgot to give it to him.  I just found it TODAY&lt;br /&gt;and gave it to him and it doesn&#x27;t work at all!  I am going to contact Wahl directly and will report back if they uphold the 2-year warranty ONE day before it expires!  Wish me good luck!</li>
            <li> Being both mustachioed and bearded, I don&#x27;t need much attention from a trimmer, but this package is more than adequate and worth twice the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not all that hairy so my usage is every 2 weeks. No wear-and-tear noted and it&#x27;s easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little trimmer set. A great value for the price, and does what it was bought to do. Batteries last a long time, too.  Very pleased with this little trimmer set.</li>
            <li> This is the second whale beard trimmer we have purchased.  The first lasted years.  We are pleased with the product and the quality of trimming it provides.</li>
            <li> great valuefor the price. i like the way it will trim around ears and eye brows and musctache. i would recomend this tripper.</li>
            <li> Excellent product !!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice beard and moustache trimmer for my husband and this is perfect.  It makes it easy for him to keep groomed.  We received the trimmer just as promised and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly good.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe all the accessories and attachments that are included at that price! Comes in handy if I don&#x27;t have time to visit the barber. Takes personal hygiene to a new level</li>
            <li> It is a great clipper for the price. The nose hair trimmer works great too. Shipping was fast and the packaging is protective.</li>
            <li> This took forever to receive.  Once I finally got it it barely runs.  I&#x27;ve put different batteries in it over and over and it&#x27;s just junk.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my dad as a Xmas gift and he loved it especially the nose shaver that came with it. The price is just great along with the product. I would recommend this as it is a very good buy.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome set for the price!!!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say here. It does its job well without snagging as advertised. I haven&#x27;t seen it snag once. It runs on batteries. They feel a little cheap and are a bit noisy, but I don&#x27;t see that a problem given what the product is.</li>
            <li> the 2 smaller guards broke the first day and i didn&#x27;t even use them i put them on the trimmer just to see if it fits and how it looks. There is no place on the plastic stand for the nose trimmer. Other wise its all right but its worth spending 10 dollars more for a better one.</li>
            <li> For the money this thing has been awesome.  Really? $12 for all this stuff.  I have never replaced the batteries.  I only use it once in a while but it has been a fantastic little hair cutting machine</li>
            <li> nice, I liked the product equal to the publication , excellent price</li>
            <li> Nose trimmer works good. Beard trimmer is a little nosy.</li>
            <li> Bad product&lt;br /&gt;Anymore to say</li>
            <li> Perfect for the beard and mustache trim.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift for my father and he has had good use of it. It brings different size trimmers and a ear/nose trimmer too. It has a stand to place the cordless razor . Battery or plug operated.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it!!</li>
            <li> The trimmer works decent, however the included nose trimmers broke after one use. Not the best quality, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> a gift for my brother love your gift</li>
            <li> I wanted a grooming tool to use on areas other than my face. I also didn&#x27;t want to spend $30+, and I wanted a trimmer with a 1/16&amp;#34; tool attachment (oddly hard to find). This product fit the bill, and I have been satisfied with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be clear, this is a small, economy-built, AA-battery-powered trimmer. It will not clear out the brush of the Amazon Rainforest. But, if you comb the hair with the included brush and shave in the direction of grain, it will not pull your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose hair trimmer is a substantial added plus. To now have an extremely quick and easy (painless) alternative to tweezers, I am grateful. Should this thing ever break, I will have a hard time going back to tweezers again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $10-15, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Good bang for the buck. Works well, no complaints other than the packaging is hard to open.</li>
            <li> GREAT BATTERY OPERATED CLIPPER AND TRIMMER.  MY LAST ONE I HAD TO KEEP PLUGGED IN ALL THE TIME.  THIS IS EASY...</li>
            <li> Works Great , lots of attachments.</li>
            <li> Vicious as all hell, please refrain. This smells burnt when you run it longer than 2 minutes, and it clips the hell out of your skin, not your hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working fine, so far. I have no complaints at all, so far. It seems a fair purchase, for the price. I have to see how it goes, and give it some time before I can say for sure if we like it, more. If so, I will increase my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After having this item for over six months, I just increased my rating from 3 to 4 stars. I do find it useful from time to time in trimming hair, and it does a much better job than I could do any other way. So, it serves a purpose, and does a fine job, and it definitely was was worth it for the modest price. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who does the family hair trimmings.</li>
            <li> Great product for reasonable price</li>
            <li> Perhaps this review is premature for I have had the trimmer only a few weeks with limited use.  That being said, I can say thus far I am pleased with the product.  It appears to be of good quality and does a good job for what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> very nice for the price</li>
            <li> Amazon hit the estimated delivery right on target and this set from Wahl is proving to be an excellent purchase at a bargain price with a nose trimmer included free of charge.  I checked and other nose trimmers sell for twice what this entire package cost.  I wish I&#x27;d discovered this set a long time ago and saved myself all the pruning with scissors.</li>
            <li> excelecte entregado a tiempo recomendado</li>
            <li> Everything was good except I received 2 number II guides and no number I guide.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and a good price.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a nose trimmer and found this. I could always use another beard trimmer. The nose trimmer is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great value clippers, arrived just like the picture shows. Also arrived early and did not have to wait to long. Build of the product is sturdy. The nose trimmer is a great value added.</li>
            <li> Ordered this beard trimmer 2 days and I am very impress with what I got,more important how well the trimmer work and also the nose hair trimmer and would highly recommend this product for purchase.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a while now.  No problems.  I use it several times a week.</li>
            <li> Seemingly good price but after using it about 8 times in 3 months it doesn&#x27;t cut hair anymore. Not sure what the issue is but new batteries don&#x27;t fix the problem. Disappointed this brand produced such poor quality garbage.</li>
            <li> For less $11 this seems to be a great deal, especially with the nose trimmer being a completely different unit from the beard trimmer.  The guards are cheap plastic but easy enough to use, change, and clean as needed.  It also doesn&#x27;t pull my hairs when trimming.  I only need to trim once every other week or so, but the battery life seems good for me.  I&#x27;ve had the product now for several months.</li>
            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  You can use it in the shower and clean it under water!!</li>
            <li> Cheaply made batteries don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son. These always come in handy. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected</li>
            <li> I received the package, some body took it. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> The price was excellent  and based on my last purchase of Wahl beard trimmer about 10 years ago, I&#x27;m assuming the quality and long term use will be the same or better. I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> VERY handy device. Seems well made.</li>
            <li> Best $10 trimmers around. Highly recommend. Alot of complaints on the plastic. Honestly what&#x27;s that matter? Has great power to trim easy to use and awesome price.</li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer is mediocre at best. The battery connection to nose hair trimmer is spotty at best. Every so often it cuts out. Everything else is great.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this system. Meets my needs</li>
            <li> After 2 shaves it completely stopped working. I put new batteries but it still will not turn on. The nose trimmer works fine but the Trimmer no longer works. I cant see or hear anything broken or loose either. Its a shame because it cut really well.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that when they batteries die I can replace them instead of throwing away the trimmer when it can&#x27;t be recharged anymore.</li>
            <li> Wahl is known for high quality products, this is no exception except as a battery operated product it has no power as a beard trimmer, nose trimmer works though I give it that. Maybe with a future product make them rechargeable with lithium batteries.</li>
            <li> Works great just don&#x27;t know how to use the guards correctly</li>
            <li> Excelent setup for the price.</li>
            <li> very good product, is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to my friends,&lt;br /&gt;I figured it was not that good. I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> This is a very good beard trimmer it works just like advertized i would recommend it to any one else.</li>
            <li> Good price for basically two gadgets a beard trimmer trimmer and a nose hair trimmer. But no batteries are included which makes it useless out of the box. That is why I give this item 3 Stars. I tried it for a brief period of time after I was able to find batteries for it and it seems okay.</li>
            <li> Execellent product with the worth of price. I love this product and I will defiantly recommend to buy this product.</li>
            <li> This does the job !! Great buy and price !!!</li>
            <li> Great product work&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Quality at a great price!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product. A++</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husbands birthday in January, he took it out to use it for the first time last week, after trying several new batteries in it, the darn thing would not work.</li>
            <li> after one use it broke-_-dont buy</li>
            <li> I have no complaints, works perfect for trimming my facial hair. If you&#x27;re a hairy guy like a wolf, then this product isn&#x27;t for you. I would recommend something from the gardening section, like a weed wacker.. but if you&#x27;re just an average joe like me, then there is no need to spend more money, this gets the job done every time..</li>
            <li> My husband was looking for something to maintain his facial hair but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. This nice set has plenty of accessories and helps him keep nice and trimmed. So far he has no complaints.</li>
            <li> GoodGood good good Good good goooooooooooooooood good h g g g g o o o o d d d d good good go</li>
            <li> for 12 bucks, you can&#x27;t beat it! I really thought it would fall apart after a few weeks. It&#x27;s been months now and still works great! It doesn&#x27;t eat batteries either.</li>
            <li> Great product. shipped fast</li>
            <li> Works great for me. I&#x27;m using rechargeable batteries with the product.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t cut at all, just makes a buzzing noise. I am going to give it to my little nephew so he can pretend to be a barber.</li>
            <li> Works well not rechargable but thats not the worst thing ever.  AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.  Works as expected, no snags or pulls.  Only detraction - apparently they changed the model of the nose trimmer and it doesn&#x27;t fit in the stand/tray.</li>
            <li> perfect for timming my little 5# doggie</li>
            <li> The razor does not work.  It&#x27;s piece of s*....*.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR CASH. I want my money back.  It&#x27;s a german named product made in china. JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK</li>
            <li> I almost bought these at a store black Friday and decided to wait.. they sold out of course and so I ordered them here. I heard goo d review from co-workers and friends.  They work better that I had expected for the price. Good way to keep that 5-o-clock shadow and still look clean.. nose trimmer works too</li>
            <li> It does what it claims and keeps working, I have no complains yet.  Wahl is a pretty solid company, so I knew I was in good hands.</li>
            <li> Use it to fix up my facial hair mostly. I also am able to shape up my hairline whenever i need it. Dont really use the nose trimmer but still nice to hae</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice &amp; working properly.</li>
            <li> good product and it works great, great for travel and economic, is only required to buy rechargeable batteries with charger</li>
            <li> I bought this kit to keep in our RV. I didn&#x27;t expect muchfor the price, I was very surprised as it works better than my much more expensive unit. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> very nice and less than walmart</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loved it</li>
            <li> Its was nothing less than great!</li>
            <li> Okay so this little thing is as cheap as it is awesome.  Have been using it for a few months now with rechargeable batteries and have not had to recharge them yet. One issue, the blades will rust if you don&#x27;t apply oil on them so avoid getting them wet use the brush to clean it up after use. In my experience, a used toothbrush does the job better than the dinky brush that comes in the package.  But for the price, a little is expected. Corrosion is not an issue on the nose hair trimmer.  Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> Love this. Exactly what my husband needed.</li>
            <li> This item is as simple as they come and they offer it in a cost effective package. Providing the nose trimmer and marketing it as a bonus would be more meaningful if it actually worked; it does not. Since I note nothing wrong with the item, I cannot suppose it is just mine that does not work.  I have revisted this a few months later. This is junk. The head and plate it attaches to are rusted. I have a 4 year old cheap Chinese knockoff i bought in Bangkok that still works and is not rusty. I thought this would be a better, more precise tool for me. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It allows you a 2 year warranty (through the manufacturer) and wahl is a great brand. It&#x27;s super affordable and does what it needs to for my uncle, who I gave it to as a gift.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He uses a lot of the pieces and seems to have no problems with it whatsoever. And I, personally, am happy with the results :)</li>
            <li> Works Great. A worthwhile product that can save you money. Can even cut your own hair short if desired. Thanks</li>
            <li> Look, you get what you pay for so its definitely cheap. However, it works GREAT. The nose trimmer is a very nice bonus. Again, cheap but effective.I could justify paying $25 for this set.</li>
            <li> I recommend it 100% this Zoom G1N Guitar Multi Effects Pedal. The product is very good. Good buy, I&#x27;m from Venezuela</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Wahl doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It is plastic but works like a champ</li>
            <li> Nice item as described thanks</li>
            <li> Works like the kind the pros use.</li>
            <li> Works nice, if you&#x27;re looking for something at low price and usefull you should buy this trimmer</li>
            <li> My husband was happy with  it I just wish I had realized it wasn&#x27;t rechargeable.</li>
            <li> for the cost you can&#x27;t beat this product. works well and does not take up much space. recommended to anyone that needs a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> Like others have stated, this product is very cheaply made. I am mad I didn&#x27;t spend the extra $10 or so to buy a decent trimmer. It is extremely painful to use as it feels like the blades are not sharp enough or not strong enough because it feels like my hair is being ripped out of my skin rather than trimmed from the surface. I have owned 2 trimmers prior to this one, and this is by far the worst beard trimming product I have ever used/owned. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the 4.5 star reviews, this product is bad.</li>
            <li> El producto es nuevo, de buena calidad, trae todos los accesorios originales y el vendedor cumplió con lo establecido a la hora de la entrega.</li>
            <li> I loved the first I purchased so much, I went ahead and purchased another.  I don&#x27;t use much of it considering how much comes in the small package, but what I do use, I like very much.</li>
            <li> You get what u pay, item satisfactory</li>
            <li> muy buen producto muchas gracias, en perfecto estado, excelente vendedor lo recomiendo. muchisismas gracias. desde venezuela, todo muy bien jeje</li>
            <li> Great gift! He absolutely loved it and he uses them all the time. I love WAHL products and he was really impressed with it too.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a decent trimmer.  Battery operated so it&#x27;s only so powerful.  I have yet to have to replace the batteries on either unit, so that&#x27;s a good thing.  A little loud, but not an issue for me.  I bought it strictly on price.</li>
            <li> I must recant a previous review of this by me,the clip is adjustable,from the metal guide, seems sturday,Im pleased with product</li>
            <li> As expected for price</li>
            <li> It was crap,It didn&#x27;t work I got a refund.stuff made in China is poor quality made by poorly paid people who don&#x27;t understand about quality</li>
            <li> It works for what I need it for. I use it to cut my hair also, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for some years, but the batteries did not fit well into the compartment. Finally it was impossible to get them to fit correctly so I thought I&#x27;d get a new one, thinking that Wahl might have solved the problem. They did not. Once in properly the trimmer works well. Like most everyone I&#x27;ve had many battery operated devices and never had this problem with any other. Minus the battery fit problem, the trimmer does a good job.</li>
            <li> Used it once and it killed the batteries...</li>
            <li> This thing was broken when I got it. It wasn&#x27;t worth the return. And on top of that I didn&#x27;t even realize it wasn&#x27;t rechargeable. What the hell isn&#x27;t rechargeable now a days??? Defective product, 1 star. If I could go lower, I would. The quality of the product felt inferior and it would no doubt break in a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go get yourself a Phillips Norelco if you really want a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> so far so good it will depend on how long batteries last</li>
            <li> Excelent nic color smooth</li>
            <li> replaced an earlier model that was broken from being dropped too many times</li>
            <li> Broken. So if I leave the batteries in the beard trimmer it drains them even when the thing is off.</li>
            <li> Works well for light touch ups.  Not hevy duty, but for the price it is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Beard trimmer operates good. Would have liked it rechargable. but batteries seem to last a longer than i expected. Good buy. Trims great!</li>
            <li> works perfectly to shave my beard!</li>
            <li> Wahl is synonymous with a quality product. The shaver works well and I like all the attachments needed for a trim or a really close grooming. It was a fair price paid for this type of product.</li>
            <li> battey operated is no good</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheap.  I have a beard occasionally and I wanted something to clean up.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was a very solid little unit.  Has a good weight, comfortable to use and the batteries are AA and easy to replace anywhere I am.  I don&#x27;t know if this is the best unit for professional beard guys but for me it is worked perfect.</li>
            <li> Bad product! After 1 MN working it smells like burning and the noise is really really high</li>
            <li> Great for shaving Nether region.</li>
            <li> A bit loud but it works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have owned several versions of this Wahl beard trimmer.  The main design flaws are a) the outer blade housing is prone to rust; and b) eventually the built-in battery completely dies.  This Wahl 5537 at least addresses the battery issue because it uses two AA batteries (the nose trimmer uses one).  I am optimistic that this will lengthen the service life of this unit.  The rust issue appears to be cosmetic; I have never observed it to actually affect functionality.  RJB.</li>
            <li> The Silver colored models are good quality - this one didn&#x27;t work out of the box. Cheap, flimsy feel - just junk. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a bit more durable. It says here that twelve more words are required. That&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use it since they did not work, even though I chance the batteries twice</li>
            <li> I know these are trimmers but what a gem this turned out to be. Although I was expecting a power cord, imagine my surprise when I discovered it was powered by 2 AA batteries. Yes, I completely missed the &amp;#34;cordless battery operated&amp;#34; header when I made the purchase. Still even better, no cord to deal with. And it&#x27;s fully functional too. Its great for beards, nose hairs and anything else you require for trimming. What a deal too!</li>
            <li> This is crap! The batteries kept falling out, the opening was too small. When we finally got it to work the blade did not cut evenly. It reminded me of a child&#x27;s toy.</li>
            <li> i thought this would be a little sturdier but hey it works and i paid a lot less than retail so im happy</li>
            <li> this was good and strong or a battery operated machine, but you cannot retract and extend the metal blade.  So it is good for close cuts, but if you have a 4 day growth, it doesn&#x27;t work so well. Great for shaving from 1-3 days of growth.  The nose clipper is great too!</li>
            <li> Really like the nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> wish it was rechargeable.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Well worth its very reasonable price. Easy to get the hang of it. Has good power for being battery operated. Various attachments allows user a lot of options.</li>
            <li> The trimmer part of this is excellent, don&#x27;t like the heads. The comb heads have to be sort of forced down onto the clippers and they are very short, way shorter than I liked. It&#x27;s inexpensive and runs on regular AA batteries so I will keep it anyway as it&#x27;s a fairly high quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> said good bye to other machines</li>
            <li> I received the trimmer put batteries in it and it doesnt even work waste of money. I am pretty dissappointed</li>
            <li> Works as It should. It is very Durable and holds up to the humidity in the bathroom. Another plus is its all waterproof.</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl trimmers for 45 years, but will not be using them anymore. My daughter-in-law bought me a rechargeable Wahl that was so dull that it pulled even short whiskers, and this battery operated Wahl is killing batteries way too fast, one decent trim and then it is slo-mo. Wahl used to be so good.</li>
            <li> This is my second or third one of these.  I love them.  They&#x27;re reliable, the charge lasts long enough to trim hair and beard.  Wahl makes great products and when you combine that with the great pricing, it&#x27;s a perfect combination.</li>
            <li> I found this devise to be very useful. I recommend this set to men. I think it is a good value for money.</li>
            <li> Wahl is the best brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this for me but my roommate uses it more than me . When I did use it it had my gotee looking good</li>
            <li> Bought this for the trimmer and should have known by the price that it wouldn&#x27;t have been great. The beard trimmer yanks out hairs constantly. Still giving it 3 stars though as the nose trimmer works quite well. Bought a different trimmer and just going to keep this for the nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  Felt that it doesn&#x27;t hold the battery charge long enough. I feel that it is made with cheap plastic that feels like it’s going to fall apart. I don’t really have the time to go through any hassle in returning it. I just do not recommend buying this product to anyone. Sorry.</li>
            <li> when using the product it tends to grab at the hair and left a couple of bald spots..may be sending it back as it could just be defective product.</li>
            <li> Works great! Throw in a couple of batteries, and go to town. If you have to choose between a 12-pack of beer, or this trimmer, I&#x27;d definitely select this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is the most useless thing I&#x27;ve ever paid money for .. I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would even bother selling a beard trimmer that is too dull to cut hair.. It literally does NOT cut . It is completely useless , I am baffled .</li>
            <li> Plastic looks junky, but it works well.</li>
            <li> It actually worked than I had expected very pleased.</li>
            <li> bought this for my dad on christmas works fine</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut or trim at all. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Does not do a good job.  Kills battery life and hurts to use.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Stopped working within a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have had this brand as a wireless rechargeable razor. This, powered by AA batteries leaves me desiring more cutting power it was cheap so I guess I cannot expect too much. Or perhaps I have a thick beard. I&#x27;ve seen thicker. Anyways, it&#x27;s ok for trimming will upgrade to something more substantial in time.</li>
            <li> Great trimer. Make sure you have 4 aa batteries. I used the rechargeable ones</li>
            <li> I meant to give it 5 stars not four.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer died after 3 uses and we were just outside the &#x27;return&#x27; window.  I&#x27;m really surprised a company like Wahl would build such an poor trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was cheap and, therefore, I&#x27;m not going to try and return it for a partial refund. Instead I may try to take it apart and see if I can find the problem myself.</li>
            <li> I just received this product.  I put the batteries in it and it does not work at all.  It will not do anything.  The nose trimmer that came along with it works but that is not why I ordered it.  It is clearly made of cheap plastic and was made in China.  I rarely write reviews but I had to write this review since the product does not work in order to save people from buying this product in the future and wasting money.</li>
            <li> I should have known. You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose hair trimmer does work. However, the main shaver does not. I know how to install batteries, I know how to trouble shoot batteries. It simply will not turn on. The housing in the back for the batteries is a poor design, as has been mentioned by other reviewers. I would like to offer a review on it&#x27;s effectiveness. However, being cheap in design and quality has been the only thing I can review. It just will not power on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please save yourself some money. Do not buy this product. It is not worth shipping allllll the way back for a refund. I will have to absorb this loss and learn from it. You do not have to. Again, this is not worth your investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even working, I do not see how this cheap plastic piece of junk could get 5 stars. Wahl... you have fallen a long way.</li>
            <li> I finally found a trimmer w/ attachments at a decent price. Battery-operation makes the unit less cumbersome. Also Included is a nose-hair trimmer, which makes this a good deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> this was a gift to my friend and none of the products worked! I even went to buy brand new batteries, and they wouldn&#x27;t even cut on.</li>
            <li> Received is bad, just throw away.Is really not ideal shopping at a time.New things is bad, let I doubt about the brand.</li>
            <li> Realy nice device.good size,nice work. It&#x27;s not the best but i can use. Good job Wahl.the most good thing is that it is portable.</li>
            <li> they threw it in when i bought some hair clippers, batteries not included so i haven&#x27;t tested them but the stand is kinda cheesy and there isn&#x27;t a slot for the nose hair trimmers in it.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  However, the beard trimmer worked only once &amp; never worked again.  I gave it one star because the nose/ear hair trimmer is still functioning.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things, lost mine during Super Storm Sandy &amp; couldn&#x27;t wait till I was able to get a new one, Thanks to Amazon for their quick services &amp; shipping it wasn&#x27;t long before I was able to trim again. This product is great for beards, sideburns mustaches &amp; what ever. &amp; the bonus ofa ear &amp; nose trimmer is great also.</li>
            <li> some teeth managed to break off within a few weeks of me owning this.  Not sure how they broke just being in my shaving kit.</li>
            <li> Super limited battery life. Barely gets through one use</li>
            <li> work better then the Conair I  have! and the battery life is great I use it every day</li>
            <li> A great grooming set.</li>
            <li> I prefer the low cost and simplicity of regular batteries.  No rubberized grips with is good.  Rubber doesn&#x27;t wear well.  Great for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Nice item comparing to its price ...</li>
            <li> Worth what I paid for it.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great value for those of us who have facial hair and like to stay clean and neat.</li>
            <li> I think I spent ten bucks on this and so far it works great. I use the shortest clip to shave my balls and my wife really loves it!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent price!</li>
            <li> This was so cheap that I thought it would be worthless. It works great. I&#x27;ve had mine for some time now and it seems reliable. The ear and nose trimmer works.</li>
            <li> The person that I purchased this item for was disappointed felt it was poorly made and did not work well not a good buy</li>
            <li> This set seems very sturdy and I loved the stainless steel tips. Feels like it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great Buy for the money..</li>
            <li> Superb product and cheap</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my husband and so far I must say it works great</li>
            <li> i see that  this product is use what is says in the descriptions can it be use hair on heads</li>
            <li> This is the best Beard Trimmer I have ever used.  Very good product.  It holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great for male hygiene.</li>
            <li> After using a Phillips Norelco All In One Grooming system for a decade, when it died I thought I would give this cheap option a try.  There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s so cheap.  It kinda works, but is so inferior to the Norelco, I think I&#x27;ll go ahead and spring for another Norelco.</li>
            <li> for the money it works great</li>
            <li> My step-father has this exact Wahl set and I always sneak and use it when I&#x27;m visiting. I finally broke down and bought one for myself now that winter is here and I&#x27;m letting the beard grow.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the price which was even better. I like that it runs on batteries and is cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As pictured, it comes with 4 attachments, a comb, a cleaning brush, oil, the caddie, and also a blade cover that is not pictured. The nose trimmer is a nice bonus but there is not a place for it in the caddie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is the perfect size for trimming your beard, neck, bangs, sideburns and let&#x27;s not forget some man scaping on the chest, pits, or other hairy areas. It&#x27;s safe to the touch, light weight, and there&#x27;s no pesky cord to worry about so your range is wide open. I can even reach some troublesome areas on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caddie does not take up a lot of space on the vanity though I have mine stored in the cabinet under the sink. Perfect size for travel and on-the-go too. I&#x27;d definitely buy this same set again if mine wore out, or I&#x27;d even give it as a gift.</li>
            <li> For my son. He loves the convenience of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> es buena pero pensé que era recargable</li>
            <li> works great, my reason for buying this is to cary it in the field when bird hunting. I use it for triming burs from my bird dogs, from their armpits and feet. it keeps them from quiting and keeps them from getting torn up from stickers rubbing them raw.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s okay, I suppose.  The teeth seem to be too close together to get a good clip the first time; the battery lid keeps coming off the ear/nose trimmer.  But it is much handier and lighter than the plug-in Wahl.</li>
            <li> This works good and is exactly has described. The only thing i don&#x27;t like is it is battery operated. It takes AA batteries and is not rechargeable. For the money it is a great buy and recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> 3+ years and still going strong. I haven&#x27;t oiled it or anything. I just clean it with the brush after every use and it works great. I use the unit 2/3 per month and Batteries last about year and a half for me. I use cheap cvs batteries.</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked fine for the first few trims, even though the included adjustable guide doesn&#x27;t really work, the fixed length guides work OK.  However there is clearly something wrong with the power switch, as it goes on and off as you turn it on....you have to mess with it and be careful in how you move it, or it will shut itself off in the middle of trimming.  Poor build quality and really isn&#x27;t worth the $10 I payed for it.  Spend a little bit more and get something made far better.  Shame that Wahl is now playing the &amp;#34;quantity over quality&amp;#34; game.  They used to be a surefire name for good products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting rid of this and paying a little more for a much better product.  I&#x27;d recommend you skip the first part and just move on to better things.</li>
            <li> great price, quick ship, works fine ,use often, it is a very great item, use it it all the time</li>
            <li> I got these for my husband. He loves these. They cut great and are very light weight. I like the counter organizer. I don&#x27;t have any complaint about this product other that I wish there was more little organizer slots for everything it came with.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome set and works great I use it weekly on one person or another</li>
            <li> I had bought this specifically for body grooming. I don&#x27;t need the fancy extendable arm or fancy design. Just give me something that trims my hair down so that it look normal, not like I intentionally shaved. Works perfect, except for the occasional tug. Would love a rechargeable feature but for the price I would make an exception. Comes with a cheap little stand, plus some decent different sized guards. Keep in mind, this is the cheap option, so your not getting a luxury trimmer. It does sometimes pull hairs, and the battery option causes it to lose cutting power when the batteries need replacing. But if you don&#x27;t feel like paying 50 bucks for something that does the same job, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> One of the best ones that r battery operated</li>
            <li> The price says it all. Very cheap quality, and really NOISY!!.  I would not recommend, spend $5 more and purchase better.</li>
            <li> if you wake up late and cant shave your face with a guillet this shaver helps you to look a litter better, its no what i spect, but ...</li>
            <li> Wow, it works.  I should have looked for a more robust and solid built unit.</li>
            <li> Very vague instructions on how to use the eyebrow and moustache accessories, but it trims very close and looks great for the beard.</li>
            <li> My partner is very satisfied and says it works well, only complaint is that it&#x27;s noisy but at the price, that&#x27;s acceptable.</li>
            <li> feels cheep (because you are paying less than $15) but works as expected (though It probably is not waterproof).</li>
            <li> It works very well  I used it on my eye brows  ,my arm pits with the interchangeable heads . It has a great deal of power  not wimpy I had gotten a different manufacturers product and was very disappointed with the operation.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my son and he hasn&#x27;t really used it much but it seems to do what it say very well.</li>
            <li> As an overall product, we&#x27;d give it five stars. But...the guards could be a little better. Not much of a difference between all three guards. Besides that, loved the product. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Works well with the batteries. Always thought battery operated would be waste of money, but this product proved me wrong. With the batteries, it is lasting longer and the trimmer is very good compared to the rechargeable trimmers at the same cost. Don&#x27;t be hindered by the fact that it is battery operated. One thing though, the blades should be oiled or else rust accumulates.</li>
            <li> What can I say 😉!! 5 Stars Right out the box to my face!!</li>
            <li> loved it -excellent product and price- fast shipping</li>
            <li> after using it just one time 3 days later the metal part was all rusty, it is not stainless, i regret not searching more about this product, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its cheap! kills batteries really quick!</li>
            <li> The trimmer feels solid in your hand and obviously is pretty well made - surprising given its price.&lt;br /&gt;The blade is sharp and trims my beard with no effort. Getting used to the several guards takes&lt;br /&gt;some time, but that simply is a matter of practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose hair trimmer works well for me. It will not do much on ear hair; I have another trimmer for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is a bit flimsy - really a minor quibble. Overall I am very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> works just fine..........however the batteries don&#x27;t  have gone thru a few batteries in a brief amount of time..........</li>
            <li> Exceptional product, great value</li>
            <li> This is a good item for the price. It was purchased to replace a worn out clipper system similar to this one. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it is not rechargeable like the others we have purchased in the past. The price is great on this little gadget and my husband seems pleased with it. If it lasts a year then it will have been worth the price.</li>
            <li> The hair trimmer works but the nose trimmer was broken. That was very disappointing and its to cheap to send back but also no point in buying another one. If your looking for a very cheap but easy to use hair trimmer for basic maintenance go for it...otherwise I do not recommend buying despite its low cost.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product originally; however, the company Wahl went above and beyond to help me out and replace my trimmer.  They have great customer service, so I&#x27;m changing my rating to 5 stars.  Nice job Wahl!</li>
            <li> This replaces a 15 year old trimming kit.  It works very well and was a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Quality product for a reasonable price.  it works very well for me.  I have a short beard that now looks well cared for every day, I recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Quit working after 2 months of use!</li>
            <li> What can I say ?,it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> great product to throw around and it keeps your face trimmed and tidy</li>
