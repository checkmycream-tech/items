            <li>Particularly nice for the crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>Setting aside claims of rejuvenation, I&#x27;ve found it just to be a nice, year-round moisturizer for my combination skin--eliminates dryness without making things oily.</li>

            <li>I appreciate Amazon.com to have the products that I need and ordering is made very easy.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better, smoother and it feels nice.</li>

            <li>I use it twice a day and my skin is much more moisturized</li>
            <li>Smell is ok, not roses</li>
            <li>More information on the pycnogenol is here:</li>
            <li>but this was much more convenient since the closest store that carries this item is about 40 miles each way.</li>
            <li>Since I am a moisturizer junkie, I have many products and I use this one at night every night.  </li>

            <li>I love Derm e products.</li>
            <li>Love that it is made of nature ingredients.</li>

            <li>I pleased I found this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok mosturizer.</li>
            <li>Love this product by Dema e.  </li>
            <li>but I am buying a couple more bottles today just&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>OK nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li>Makes my (usually dry) skin feel great!</li>
            <li>perfect for aging skin, dry skin!</li>
            <li>But most important:  </li>
            <li>GREAT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li>It does not work well under makeup for me or provide a smooth finish unless I apply it 30 mins or more ahead of applying the BB I use.  </li>
            <li>The product came very quickly and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I have an olive complexion that scars easy.</li>
            <li>I stopped using the cream, and the pimples/bumps are disappearing very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have problem skin and with a healthy diet, exercise and as much sleep as I can manage this cream helps my skin stay nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviews, this product does not leave a residue on my face at all, instead it goes on light and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>Calmed redness, and dramatically reduced fine lines, etc.  </li>
            <li>It does disminish fine lines and wrinkles as stated.  </li>
            <li>but I find that it helps smooth fine lines.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change In my skin after using this for about 3 mo.</li>
            <li>I have been through two jars now, and my skin is smooth, no under eye puffiness, no blotchy skin, youthful return.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>I had been using the product for several years and was happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It is so light and silky and didn&#x27;t upset my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin on my face smooth and silky--very silky.  </li>
            <li>(smooth skin w/</li>
            <li>No crap in it--which is always a dealbreaker--and you can always trust Derma E to treat your skin as well as you as a customer, well.</li>
            <li>Amazing product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>very nice facial cream</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really excited for this cream to arrive</li>
            <li>I have seen a significant improvement in my poors.  </li>
            <li>it goes on super smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>It also has some great ingredients for us more mature skin gals such as retinyl palmitate,</li>
            <li>This creme is light, absorbs well, and helps to calm my skin.</li>
            <li>My dryish 53 year old skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>True True......</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream.</li>
            <li>I really noticed the difference when I ran out before I had ordered more.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>but when I have an injury to my skin because it seems to help the skin heal much faster and more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>ALSO, pycnogenol is not recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding girls, and the warning is not on the DermaE package...</li>
            <li>I am currently using the Bull dog moisturizer and I am having good success with that.  </li>
            <li>This Derma e product is definitely the product for me--love, love, love.</li>
            <li>has a super mild scent and is moisturizing on the face, but it caused me to break out with pimples all over my chin and around my nose.  </li>
            <li>my skin never peeled or flaked, first time ever!</li>
            <li>I use this daily &amp; love how it makes my face feel!</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years to help calm my rosecea.  </li>
            <li>My family notices the smooth much much improved skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice overall moisturizing creme.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would address my Rosacea and sensitive skin better and help my skin heal.  </li>
            <li>i am 71 years young and most people don&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>I love this derma e line of products as it is formulated  for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it useful as a healing balm for my family, when they&#x27;ve not been mindful of their skin and the weather.</li>
            <li>Best kept secret in the cosmetics world.</li>
            <li>vitamins E, A, C along with other good stuff and is certified organic by the USDA.</li>
            <li>Seemed to make my skin softer and fresher right from the start.</li>
            <li>Fine lines softened and I feel a new firmness.</li>
            <li>I liked the way my skin felt when I applied it, but certainly walking around with big bumps on my face is not the effect I&#x27;d hoped for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this same product for many years and have never had a problem with an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>My skin began to feel soothed before the end of the first week.</li>
            <li>Delivery was prompt and exact.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently and have seen a reduction in my redness; I&#x27;ve also seen a reduction in wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Packaging , once I open the box, more than 5% of the cream already spilled out from the bottle . ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also cruelty-free and that&#x27;s the first thing I look for.</li>
            <li>I am not used to daily moisturizing, and I am trying to develop a better habit, but this just makes my face feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>I use the same brand of face wash and while I like it, I don&#x27;t love it like I do the cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using the cream from the latest jar  for the last month and have noticed that my skin is not getting softer</li>
            <li>Interestingly, also seems to reduce some intermittent facial redness.</li>
            <li>Very soothing to winter skin, have not had any problems with breakouts using every night before bed!</li>
            <li>I just ordered other Derma E products that haven&#x27;t arrived yet, hopefully I will love those too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a month and saw a big difference.</li>
            <li>I have a fair olive complexion that is on the dry side, my skin is usually clear with oily spots under my mouth.</li>
            <li>The other amazing thing is that this is affordable and it works.  </li>
            <li>Good under make-up but fabulous for healthy bare skin look- actually seems to smooth and plump up my thin aging</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores, and very very soothing.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly leaving skin soft.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the scent nor the somewhat odd residue or \\&quot;feel\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It feels good going on and the scent is not offensive, and as a person allergic to petroleum products it is hard for me to find something that doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li>There was a problem with every moisturizer I tried - from the cheapest to very pricey.  </li>
            <li>It has NEVER broken out my skin.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well without being oily.  </li>
            <li>cream was a darker color and much thinner.  </li>
            <li>price is much lower here than in health stores .</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that this item is packaged in glass.  </li>
            <li>Now I go out without any make up at all or very</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference since using this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a couple of weeks and really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
            <li>I bought this to correct spider veins and it doesn&#x27;t work very well for that application.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do too much as of now, been about 3 weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  - very creamy</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I have not seen much difference in my hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>It should have a whole page devoted to it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know it really helps my dryness though.</li>
            <li>It did not moisturize my skin very well</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t review products very often</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say whether or not it&#x27;s really working (rebuilding collagen, enhancing texture/elasticity etc.)</li>
            <li>I am 68 years old and it has diminised the lines on my face and makes my skin look very fresh and young.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things, but this is the cream I keep coming back to, for one thing the really high Vitamin E content keeps my skin looking fabulous - and at 45 it is nice to be mistaken for about 10-15 years younger than I am (mind you</li>
            <li>I am new to Derma e, and overall love their products so far--my skin is very sensitive, and their products haven&#x27;t caused any irritation.</li>
            <li>As long as you are not planning to go outside or into the warm room</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about its anti-aging capabilities but it is good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>First thing that went was the overly sensitive burning feeling to my face.</li>
            <li>The dark wrinkles under my eyes were gone and over all my skin looked so much better</li>
            <li>I expect I will use it until I stumble across something even better, but I am not actively searching for another product.</li>
            <li>then I did give it to a friend after one time use and lots of water to wash it down :-)</li>
            <li>(The package advertises this feature, although the main Amazon bullets don&#x27;t mention it.)  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for middle-aged women.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Four of the last six jars I&#x27;ve received have been brownish and somewhat runny with a distinctly uncreamy texture.  </li>
            <li>that my laugh lines are not as deep as they used to be</li>
            <li>and I feel like I need to put more on a few minutes after this goes into my skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product a few weeks ago, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This really does smooth and moisturize without making a mess.</li>
            <li>I am still trying to find a good moisturizer that offers at least 30 SPF broad spectrum protection.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, with some rosacea.  </li>
            <li>59 yr old skin!</li>
            <li>Decided to hunt for more natural less chemical and found derma e. YEAH!!  </li>
            <li>For my skin, 30 y.o., very light complexion, with maybe the start of a couple tiny wrinkles on my forehead, this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>It is more of a gel than a lotion, which made me skeptical at first, but after using it I realized it works better than any other product I have used in recent years.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clear it up</li>
            <li>My acne did clear up.  </li>
            <li>Even my husband says he can clearly see the difference.  </li>
            <li>I do have realy sensitive skin and this cream is burning like fire ...</li>
            <li>I would not like others to give out the money IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN ...</li>
            <li>And it leaves skin soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It really helps with the red spots on my face from Rosacea.</li>
            <li>I also like that the ingredients are natural and don&#x27;t contain harmful parabens etc.</li>
            <li>This product is for sensitive &amp; roacea &amp; redness.  </li>
            <li>No heavy scents.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, and I get a burning feeling and rashes from everything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Makes your face so soft and velvety.</li>
            <li>my skin is just ultra sensitive.</li>
            <li>Still too early to tell</li>
            <li>It performs as well as it was described leaving my skin soft and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised to read from one of the reviews that the manufacturer denies any product changes.</li>
            <li>I am 68 years old with extremely sensitive skin that is sun damaged.</li>
            <li>All though, I did notice it made my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Checked with Derma e - Product sent to me was the old name and packaging (Anti-Aging Pycnogenol Moisturizing Creme)</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I had to reorder directly from Derma e.</li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of expensive creams and this is just as good if not</li>
            <li>do have fairly sensitive skin, so I can only assume this allergic reaction is not common for others based on all the accolades I read.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the derma e Pycnogenol Soothing Moisturizing Creme with Vitamins C, E and A - for anyone suffering with dermatitis, winter chafed skin and especially, in my case, Rosacea and Seborrheic</li>
            <li>Not quite fragrance free, but the small amount of scent doesn&#x27;t irritate my usually-sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>and I started getting irritated eyes and a heavy feeling in my fafe,, like I was getting a full headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, rosacea prone, normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I tried many many products only making things worse, absolutely no better.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on, not like a traditional&lt;br /&gt;body cream that has a drag or a heavy feeling at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>mild not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>My skin has less lines and is more subtle after consistent use now for two-three months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and the jar will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one bottle so far</li>
            <li>The product I am accustomed to is light in color, thick, and creamy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK not great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too thick and it leaves my face super soft.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for people who normally have dry skin.</li>
            <li>it left behind (for lack of a better description) but it didn&#x27;t affect make-up application and is nothing detectable to anyone else.</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;d rather have calm skin with a few lines, than a red blotchy face with no wrinkles!  </li>
            <li>Before I was using more and more liquid make up for sensitive skin in an attempt to hide at least some of the bad looking face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>- does not irritate my sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li>I did not see any change at all for the first 2 weeks and was ready to be disappointed, when suddenly after that, several brown spots on my cheek were fading to light tan, and the fragile skin under my eyes was firming up.  </li>

            <li> Particularly nice for the crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> Setting aside claims of rejuvenation, I&#x27;ve found it just to be a nice, year-round moisturizer for my combination skin--eliminates dryness without making things oily.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of moisturizing without being greasy or shiny.</li>
            <li> I appreciate Amazon.com to have the products that I need and ordering is made very easy.  </li>

            <li> More information on the pycnogenol is here:</li>
            <li> but this was much more convenient since the closest store that carries this item is about 40 miles each way.</li>
            <li> Since I am a moisturizer junkie, I have many products and I use this one at night every night.  </li>

            <li> I love Derm e products.</li>
            <li> Love that it is made of nature ingredients.</li>

            <li> Love this product by Dema e.  </li>

            <li> perfect for aging skin, dry skin!</li>
            <li> But most important:  </li>
            <li> GREAT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> It does not work well under makeup for me or provide a smooth finish unless I apply it 30 mins or more ahead of applying the BB I use.  </li>
            <li> The product came very quickly and was well packaged.  </li>

            <li> I stopped using the cream, and the pimples/bumps are disappearing very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have problem skin and with a healthy diet, exercise and as much sleep as I can manage this cream helps my skin stay nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviews, this product does not leave a residue on my face at all, instead it goes on light and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Calmed redness, and dramatically reduced fine lines, etc.  </li>
            <li> It does disminish fine lines and wrinkles as stated.  </li>
            <li> but I find that it helps smooth fine lines.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change In my skin after using this for about 3 mo.</li>
            <li> I have been through two jars now, and my skin is smooth, no under eye puffiness, no blotchy skin, youthful return.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I had been using the product for several years and was happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It is so light and silky and didn&#x27;t upset my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the skin on my face smooth and silky--very silky.  </li>
            <li> (smooth skin w/</li>
            <li> No crap in it--which is always a dealbreaker--and you can always trust Derma E to treat your skin as well as you as a customer, well.</li>
            <li> Amazing product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> very nice facial cream</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really excited for this cream to arrive</li>
            <li> I have seen a significant improvement in my poors.  </li>
            <li> it goes on super smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> It also has some great ingredients for us more mature skin gals such as retinyl palmitate,</li>
            <li> This creme is light, absorbs well, and helps to calm my skin.</li>
            <li> My dryish 53 year old skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> True True......</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream.</li>
            <li> I really noticed the difference when I ran out before I had ordered more.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> but when I have an injury to my skin because it seems to help the skin heal much faster and more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> ALSO, pycnogenol is not recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding girls, and the warning is not on the DermaE package...</li>
            <li> I am currently using the Bull dog moisturizer and I am having good success with that.  </li>
            <li> This Derma e product is definitely the product for me--love, love, love.</li>
            <li> has a super mild scent and is moisturizing on the face, but it caused me to break out with pimples all over my chin and around my nose.  </li>
            <li> my skin never peeled or flaked, first time ever!</li>
            <li> I use this daily &amp; love how it makes my face feel!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years to help calm my rosecea.  </li>
            <li> My family notices the smooth much much improved skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice overall moisturizing creme.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would address my Rosacea and sensitive skin better and help my skin heal.  </li>
            <li> i am 71 years young and most people don&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> I love this derma e line of products as it is formulated  for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it useful as a healing balm for my family, when they&#x27;ve not been mindful of their skin and the weather.</li>
            <li> Best kept secret in the cosmetics world.</li>
            <li> vitamins E, A, C along with other good stuff and is certified organic by the USDA.</li>
            <li> Seemed to make my skin softer and fresher right from the start.</li>
            <li> Fine lines softened and I feel a new firmness.</li>
            <li> I liked the way my skin felt when I applied it, but certainly walking around with big bumps on my face is not the effect I&#x27;d hoped for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this same product for many years and have never had a problem with an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> My skin began to feel soothed before the end of the first week.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and exact.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently and have seen a reduction in my redness; I&#x27;ve also seen a reduction in wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Packaging , once I open the box, more than 5% of the cream already spilled out from the bottle . ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also cruelty-free and that&#x27;s the first thing I look for.</li>
            <li> I am not used to daily moisturizing, and I am trying to develop a better habit, but this just makes my face feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I use the same brand of face wash and while I like it, I don&#x27;t love it like I do the cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream from the latest jar  for the last month and have noticed that my skin is not getting softer</li>
            <li> Interestingly, also seems to reduce some intermittent facial redness.</li>
            <li> Very soothing to winter skin, have not had any problems with breakouts using every night before bed!</li>
            <li> I just ordered other Derma E products that haven&#x27;t arrived yet, hopefully I will love those too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a month and saw a big difference.</li>
            <li> I have a fair olive complexion that is on the dry side, my skin is usually clear with oily spots under my mouth.</li>
            <li> The other amazing thing is that this is affordable and it works.  </li>
            <li> Good under make-up but fabulous for healthy bare skin look- actually seems to smooth and plump up my thin aging</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores, and very very soothing.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly leaving skin soft.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the scent nor the somewhat odd residue or \\&quot;feel\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It feels good going on and the scent is not offensive, and as a person allergic to petroleum products it is hard for me to find something that doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> There was a problem with every moisturizer I tried - from the cheapest to very pricey.  </li>
            <li> It has NEVER broken out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well without being oily.  </li>
            <li> cream was a darker color and much thinner.  </li>
            <li> price is much lower here than in health stores .</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that this item is packaged in glass.  </li>
            <li> Now I go out without any make up at all or very</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference since using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of weeks and really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
            <li> I bought this to correct spider veins and it doesn&#x27;t work very well for that application.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do too much as of now, been about 3 weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  - very creamy</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> I have not seen much difference in my hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Too much</li>
            <li> It should have a whole page devoted to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know it really helps my dryness though.</li>
            <li> It did not moisturize my skin very well</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t review products very often</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether or not it&#x27;s really working (rebuilding collagen, enhancing texture/elasticity etc.)</li>
            <li> I am 68 years old and it has diminised the lines on my face and makes my skin look very fresh and young.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things, but this is the cream I keep coming back to, for one thing the really high Vitamin E content keeps my skin looking fabulous - and at 45 it is nice to be mistaken for about 10-15 years younger than I am (mind you</li>
            <li> I am new to Derma e, and overall love their products so far--my skin is very sensitive, and their products haven&#x27;t caused any irritation.</li>
            <li> As long as you are not planning to go outside or into the warm room</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about its anti-aging capabilities but it is good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> First thing that went was the overly sensitive burning feeling to my face.</li>
            <li> The dark wrinkles under my eyes were gone and over all my skin looked so much better</li>
            <li> I expect I will use it until I stumble across something even better, but I am not actively searching for another product.</li>
            <li> then I did give it to a friend after one time use and lots of water to wash it down :-)</li>
            <li> (The package advertises this feature, although the main Amazon bullets don&#x27;t mention it.)  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for middle-aged women.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Four of the last six jars I&#x27;ve received have been brownish and somewhat runny with a distinctly uncreamy texture.  </li>
            <li> that my laugh lines are not as deep as they used to be</li>
            <li> and I feel like I need to put more on a few minutes after this goes into my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This really does smooth and moisturize without making a mess.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to find a good moisturizer that offers at least 30 SPF broad spectrum protection.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, with some rosacea.  </li>
            <li> 59 yr old skin!</li>
            <li> Decided to hunt for more natural less chemical and found derma e. YEAH!!  </li>
            <li> For my skin, 30 y.o., very light complexion, with maybe the start of a couple tiny wrinkles on my forehead, this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is more of a gel than a lotion, which made me skeptical at first, but after using it I realized it works better than any other product I have used in recent years.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clear it up</li>
            <li> My acne did clear up.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband says he can clearly see the difference.  </li>
            <li> I do have realy sensitive skin and this cream is burning like fire ...</li>
            <li> I would not like others to give out the money IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN ...</li>
            <li> And it leaves skin soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with the red spots on my face from Rosacea.</li>
            <li> I also like that the ingredients are natural and don&#x27;t contain harmful parabens etc.</li>
            <li> This product is for sensitive &amp; roacea &amp; redness.  </li>
            <li> No heavy scents.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, and I get a burning feeling and rashes from everything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Makes your face so soft and velvety.</li>
            <li> my skin is just ultra sensitive.</li>
            <li> Still too early to tell</li>
            <li> It performs as well as it was described leaving my skin soft and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised to read from one of the reviews that the manufacturer denies any product changes.</li>
            <li> I am 68 years old with extremely sensitive skin that is sun damaged.</li>
            <li> All though, I did notice it made my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Checked with Derma e - Product sent to me was the old name and packaging (Anti-Aging Pycnogenol Moisturizing Creme)</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I had to reorder directly from Derma e.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of expensive creams and this is just as good if not</li>
            <li> do have fairly sensitive skin, so I can only assume this allergic reaction is not common for others based on all the accolades I read.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the derma e Pycnogenol Soothing Moisturizing Creme with Vitamins C, E and A - for anyone suffering with dermatitis, winter chafed skin and especially, in my case, Rosacea and Seborrheic</li>
            <li> Not quite fragrance free, but the small amount of scent doesn&#x27;t irritate my usually-sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> and I started getting irritated eyes and a heavy feeling in my fafe,, like I was getting a full headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, rosacea prone, normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I tried many many products only making things worse, absolutely no better.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on, not like a traditional&lt;br /&gt;body cream that has a drag or a heavy feeling at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> mild not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> My skin has less lines and is more subtle after consistent use now for two-three months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and the jar will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one bottle so far</li>
            <li> The product I am accustomed to is light in color, thick, and creamy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK not great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and it leaves my face super soft.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for people who normally have dry skin.</li>
            <li> it left behind (for lack of a better description) but it didn&#x27;t affect make-up application and is nothing detectable to anyone else.</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;d rather have calm skin with a few lines, than a red blotchy face with no wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> Before I was using more and more liquid make up for sensitive skin in an attempt to hide at least some of the bad looking face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> - does not irritate my sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li> I did not see any change at all for the first 2 weeks and was ready to be disappointed, when suddenly after that, several brown spots on my cheek were fading to light tan, and the fragile skin under my eyes was firming up.  </li>
            <li> I had been experimenting with other natural products with no luck, so</li>
            <li> Recently I noticed that i have headache all night long if I use this cream in the evening.</li>
            <li> long as I get the same result - I will continue to use it</li>
            <li> I always have problems when the weather gets colder with dry skin, finally I have something that seems to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately 9 weeks now and it has made a tremendous transformation in the way that I look.</li>
            <li> This is for normal-&amp;#62; dry skin and really turns around dehydrated (flaky and dry but oily and acne-prone) skin when use with a toner (I use a raw apple cider vinegar toner).</li>
            <li> Applied it again - all night long I was having a headache.</li>
            <li> A litte goes a long way.</li>
            <li> let me know other women were having the same problems as me.  </li>
            <li> well, it&#x27;s moistureisez my dry skin, but do not expect any wrinkle disappearance miracle.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this to anyone who has sensative , dry skin.</li>
            <li> After use I can still see dry spots and it sometimes takes two applications to help with that dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to start off by saying that I like Derma e products, especially their hyaluranic acid wash and lotion, but I wanted to try a less greasy</li>
            <li> But I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Other products, worsen the condition and cause breakouts or dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Every product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but these products seem to work for me to help correct a few wrinkles and possibly prevent others.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I tried it out, and within only a few days we noticed wrinkles fading away.</li>
            <li> This creams glides on beautifully, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> - a little goes a long way (lasts almost a</li>
            <li> I do not find this product greasy at all and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products here and there, but always continue to use this one.  </li>

            <li> Accordingly, I&#x27;m cancelling my subscription of this product and will find another source for the other product too.</li>
            <li> I also use one of their eye creams and I can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other products.</li>
            <li> I have tried other creams but this one seemed to work well for me.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a glow that I have never achieved w/ any other product.  </li>
            <li> I am going to look for other options for the scars.  </li>
            <li> Some product is really expensive but this creme is inexpensive and really makes my face smoother</li>
            <li> After a few weeks no changes, will continue usage until container empty.</li>
            <li> There are few other side effects the DermaE never mentioned on the product package.</li>

            <li> It broke me out and made my skin look worse just in general.</li>
            <li> It laves some film in the face and even if you do not perspire at all your face will be a little sweaty.</li>
            <li> little.</li>
            <li> So the smell is a little acid.</li>
            <li> A little goes a lonnng way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that said, it is a little on the heavy side, and feels like a mud consistency when applying -</li>
            <li> It is so hard finding a moisturizer that is thick enough without being so oily that it aggravates my skin.</li>
            <li> Since using this product year round, I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a few years now, along with the Derma-e Papaya and Soy Milk Foaming cleanser which I also recommend.</li>
            <li> The cream does work well if used everyday.</li>
            <li> I had been looking long an hard for a product that moisturizes the dry skin on my face without irritating it.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product a glowing review a few years ago, but in the past 6 months the jars I have received through my Amazon subscription have been inconsistent in color and texture.  </li>
            <li> Have purchased from health food stores in the past</li>
            <li> I use it under my day cream usually.  </li>
            <li> Everything I have tried makes my face red and angry.  </li>
            <li> I read about this product in a small paragraph in a magazine.</li>
            <li> While not thrilled with those points, I&#x27;d still rather use this than something packed with chemicals and/or synthetic perfume.</li>
            <li> The recent purchase was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to be negative, giving product time and opportunity to see benifits.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and hydrates your skin like crazy!!</li>
            <li> I feel like I can see subtle results.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle too..</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> It is not too bad as other creams though.</li>
            <li> Skeptically I began using this cream after learning that pycnogenol helps to increase collagen &amp; elastin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be very sad if they discontinue this</li>
            <li> Product may have gone bad from age, heat, etc.</li>
            <li> After read another review about a bad smell I did not find that to be the case</li>
            <li> so disappointed . ..</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hated to even be seen.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Two years ago, I was given this product as a gift by my daughter,  and have been looking to purchase it again but to no avail.  Then one day as I was cruising through the Amazon beauty goodies, I saw it. The other amazing thing is that this is affordable and it works.  It also has some great ingredients for us more mature skin gals such as retinyl palmitate, vitamins E, A, C along with other good stuff and is certified organic by the USDA.</li>
            <li> This is a nice overall moisturizing creme.  I was hoping it would address my Rosacea and sensitive skin better and help my skin heal.  I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference in the redness, but it did not irritate my skin either.  I used it in tandem with the derma e Pycnogenol Cleanser.  It wasn&#x27;t my miracle cure, but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I have ever used. I always have problems when the weather gets colder with dry skin, finally I have something that seems to work. My skin looks healthier than it ever has.</li>
            <li> Great cream!  Feels silking on your face and does not irritate of chuck up.  Fits well under makeup.</li>
            <li> I do have realy sensitive skin and this cream is burning like fire ... just sharing then I would not like others to give out the money IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN ... cant say anything else then I did give it to a friend after one time use and lots of water to wash it down :-)</li>
            <li> I use the product twice a day morning and evening after cleansing my face and neck. My skin has less lines and is more subtle after consistent use now for two-three months.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, with some rosacea.  There was a problem with every moisturizer I tried - from the cheapest to very pricey.  No problems with this one!  But most important:  AMAZING RESULTS IN HOURS, LITERALLY.  Could not believe the change overnight.  Calmed redness, and dramatically reduced fine lines, etc.  And it leaves skin soft and not greasy.  I&#x27;ll be very sad if they discontinue this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very important to me that it does not have any parabens, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I use it twice a day and my skin is much more moisturized but I am taking Pycngenol internally also.  I found this product online so I thought I would try it.  I would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. It really helps with the red spots on my face from Rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately 9 weeks now and it has made a tremendous transformation in the way that I look. The tone, texture, clarity have greatly improved. Fine lines softened and I feel a new firmness.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and hydrates your skin like crazy!!</li>
            <li> Especially in the winter I use to flake around my eye area.  Since using this product year round, I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and have no complaints at all.  I have tried other products here and there, but always continue to use this one.  It has NEVER broken out my skin.  It moisturizes very well without being oily.  Absorbs quickly leaving skin soft.</li>
            <li> Last shipment was not the usual color or consistency that I&#x27;ve received in the past.&lt;br /&gt;The cream was a darker color and much thinner.  When I contacted the Derma E I was informed me that the ingredients have not changed.  I&#x27;ve stopped using this last shipment because it&#x27;s giving me an allergic reaction.  I&#x27;ve been using this same product for many years and have never had a problem with an allergic reaction. Product may have gone bad from age, heat, etc.</li>
            <li> My skin just feels good after applying this product .The price is much lower here than in health stores .</li>
            <li> The cream does it&#x27;s job well, it&#x27;s moistureisez my dry skin, but do not expect any wrinkle disappearance miracle. As long as you are not planning to go outside or into the warm room it&#x27;s good. It laves some film in the face and even if you do not perspire at all your face will be a little sweaty. It is not too bad as other creams though. Smell is ok, not roses but it is not stinky.    Recently I noticed that i have headache all night long if I use this cream in the evening. I tried not to use it - no headache. Applied it again - all night long I was having a headache. I did some research and ONE of the side effects of  pycnogenol is a headache. There are few other side effects the DermaE never mentioned on the product package. More information on the pycnogenol is here: [...]    ALSO, pycnogenol is not recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding girls, and the warning is not on the DermaE package...</li>
            <li> Helps with wrinkles and smooths out skin. Makes my wife look 10 years younger. My wife uses it under her eyes and it smooths out her skin.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years to help calm my rosecea.  It helps reduce my redness.  I really appreciate that this item is packaged in glass.  Have purchased from health food stores in the past but this was much more convenient since the closest store that carries this item is about 40 miles each way.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a changed in skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for a few years now, along with the Derma-e Papaya and Soy Milk Foaming cleanser which I also recommend. I have very sensitive, rosacea prone, normal to dry skin. This creme is light, absorbs well, and helps to calm my skin. I&#x27;m not sure about its anti-aging capabilities but it is good for sensitive skin.  I also use their Fruit Smoothee Moisturing Creme, which is not one of their stronger anti-aging formulas but I find that it helps smooth fine lines. (However, it is not as calming as the Pycnogenol Creme.) Personally, I&#x27;d rather have calm skin with a few lines, than a red blotchy face with no wrinkles!  I also like that the ingredients are natural and don&#x27;t contain harmful parabens etc.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has the ingredients I wanted.  The pycnogenol and the Vitamins C, E and A.  Since I am a moisturizer junkie, I have many products and I use this one at night every night.  It is not greasy like some moisturizers can be so you could use it under make up and not cause a problem.  I think anyone that moisturizes their face could use this product.  The ingredients are wonderful.  The product came very quickly and was well packaged.  I would have no hesitation in using this company again.</li>
            <li> II ordered this product because the product contains ingredients recommended by Dr. Oz&#x27;s show.  My face looks better and the price is great!</li>
            <li> I gave this product a glowing review a few years ago, but in the past 6 months the jars I have received through my Amazon subscription have been inconsistent in color and texture.  The product I am accustomed to is light in color, thick, and creamy.  Four of the last six jars I&#x27;ve received have been brownish and somewhat runny with a distinctly uncreamy texture.  I have been experiencing a quality consistency problem with another product I&#x27;ve been purchasing from Amazon and am starting to wonder if they&#x27;re sourcing &amp;#34;seconds.&amp;#34;  Accordingly, I&#x27;m cancelling my subscription of this product and will find another source for the other product too.</li>
            <li> This product is for sensitive &amp; roacea &amp; redness.  True True...... I had fought for several years break outs [I am 66 so not achne] red veiny lines,soreness and reaction to almost every emotion and type of weather. I tried many many products only making things worse, absolutely no better.  Decided to hunt for more natural less chemical and found derma e. YEAH!!  I do the regiment of derma e facial cleanser, serum and moisturizing cream two times a day.  My skin began to feel soothed before the end of the first week. First thing that went was the overly sensitive burning feeling to my face. I am now in my 6th month of using derma e. My family notices the smooth much much improved skin.  Before I was using more and more liquid make up for sensitive skin in an attempt to hide at least some of the bad looking face. Hated to even be seen.  Now I go out without any make up at all or very little. What a wonderful change!</li>
            <li> I like that there are no synthetic or harmful ingredients in this moisturizer. I was looking for something safe to try on my toddler son&#x27;s arms &amp; face as he has keratosis pyloris. It didn&#x27;t clear it up but I was just experimenting, so I can&#x27;t blame the product. I also used it on my face and it was a good moisturizer. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the scent nor the somewhat odd residue or \\&quot;feel\\&quot; it left behind (for lack of a better description) but it didn&#x27;t affect make-up application and is nothing detectable to anyone else. While not thrilled with those points, I&#x27;d still rather use this than something packed with chemicals and/or synthetic perfume.</li>
            <li> This product is cheaper than anywhere else as I have done my research.  Delivery was prompt and exact.  I appreciate Amazon.com to have the products that I need and ordering is made very easy.  Thanks to the seller!</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer.  Doesn&#x27;t sting like many I&#x27;ve tried.  No heavy scents.  Use it daily on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> mild not too heavy.  great complement to the cleanser .  I highly recommend it for middle-aged women. Not too pricey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using all kinds of organic product line for more than 10 years. Some product is really expensive but this creme is inexpensive and really makes my face smoother and I noticed scars from acne also improved.</li>
            <li> Being a man, I like something simple that works.  The creme does not build up, is not greasy, and I only need to apply it once after I shower.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin is sensitive, and I get a burning feeling and rashes from everything else I&#x27;ve tried. No rash or burning with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently and have seen a reduction in my redness; I&#x27;ve also seen a reduction in wrinkles on my forehead. It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this cr√®me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cream and I have tried many. It&#x27;s the perfect companion to my apple cider vinegar toner, hyluronic acid serum this cream on top. My dryish 53 year old skin looks and feels amazing. This creams glides on beautifully, a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m signing up for the regular deliveries, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product line for over five years now. Everything else I use either breaks me out, dries me out, or leaves me with itchy red blotches on my skin. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using derrma e products for years and pycnogenol is one of their best products ever!  perfect for aging skin, dry skin!</li>
            <li> This cream made my face breakout and I did not like the way it made my skin fee.  I was able to return the product and get a refund.</li>
            <li> Seemed to make my skin softer and fresher right from the start. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Makes your face so soft and velvety. I&#x27;ve only used one bottle so far but I like it.</li>
            <li> Def. works to combat wrinkles I use it under my day cream usually.  Another great product by Derma e.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect summer time facial moisturizer. I have used this Soothing Moisturizer as a day creme and the Derma e Night Creme for evening but I found it too moisturizing for summer months so my Derma e Soothing is my only moisturizer now and my skin has cleared up from the sudden breakouts I was having. It is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now to deal with my red skin.  Other products, worsen the condition and cause breakouts or dry skin.  Derma E refreshes my skin and helps minimize the red.  I use it night and day.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> My mom called and wanted a product with these ingredients. She is 81 and has always worried about wrinkles so she takes great care of her skin. This product has been great for her. I will be ordering some for myself soon.</li>
            <li> i like the moisturizer - is didnt make me break out and didnt make me feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that said, it is a little on the heavy side, and feels like a mud consistency when applying - i like a lighter feel moisturizer, but it does the job without any issue.</li>
            <li> This is another good product.  Every product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but these products seem to work for me to help correct a few wrinkles and possibly prevent others.  I will keep using them.</li>
            <li> i am 71 years young and most people don&#x27;t believe it.  A good regimine for a youthful look is vitamin enriched moisterizing creme.  This does the job.</li>
            <li> What a terrific find.  I have been through two jars now, and my skin is smooth, no under eye puffiness, no blotchy skin, youthful return.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible ! Packaging , once I open the box, more than 5% of the cream already spilled out from the bottle . .. so disappointed . ..</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream. I&#x27;m now on my second jar and I have to say I really love it! Leaves skin smooth and isn&#x27;t greasy. I&#x27;m in my 50s now and I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference since using this product. It&#x27;s also cruelty-free and that&#x27;s the first thing I look for. I also use one of their eye creams and I can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other products.</li>
            <li> Love the product will order again. A litte goes a long way. My dentist - of all people- told me about it. Said to combien thei with the oral version.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on this one for me. I am new to Derma e, and overall love their products so far--my skin is very sensitive, and their products haven&#x27;t caused any irritation. I have used this product for a couple of weeks and really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing anything. I also bought the Derma e Hyaluronic Acid Rehydrating Serum, which I like much better than this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this to correct spider veins and it doesn&#x27;t work very well for that application.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help my skin look better but it didn&#x27;t work.  It felt good but didn&#x27;t do as the reviews had said it would.</li>
            <li> I love this cream with in 2 weeks I noticed the difference in my skin. The dark wrinkles under my eyes were gone and over all my skin looked so much better</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the derma e Pycnogenol Soothing Moisturizing Creme with Vitamins C, E and A - for anyone suffering with dermatitis, winter chafed skin and especially, in my case, Rosacea and Seborrheic dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face was staying in a winter cycle of inflammation, itching and burning until I purchased this creme.  What a blessing to be able to sleep through the night without my face itching and burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores, and very very soothing.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to so many products but this keeps my skin moist and no rash or redness&lt;br /&gt;as long as I get the same result - I will continue to use it</li>
            <li> I liked that it was made for alkergy irritated skin. However, it burned slightly in places on my face  after applying and I started getting irritated eyes and a heavy feeling in my fafe,, like I was getting a full headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited for this cream to arrive so I could try it out and hopefully switch to this line if skin care products as ive heard great things about the line from beauty shop employees.guess my skin is just ultra sensitive. Bummer.</li>
            <li> I have tried other creams but this one seemed to work well for me.  I really noticed the difference when I ran out before I had ordered more.</li>
            <li> May be there are some Vitamins in here. So the smell is a little acid. But I used it almost one month. I can adapt the smell now</li>
            <li> Still too early to tell</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes my skin feel softer..&lt;br /&gt;Feel that my laugh lines are not as deep as they used to be</li>
            <li> The cream does work well if used everyday. It has actually removed some facilial lines. My wife really likes it. I have ordered it a couple times. A jar lasts abt 4 or 5  months.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Definitely does moisturize, but tends to be a bit oily in my opinion.  I am not used to daily moisturizing, and I am trying to develop a better habit, but this just makes my face feel greasy.  I am currently using the Bull dog moisturizer and I am having good success with that.  Before that I used the Jack black moisturizer, and I didn&#x27;t like it as also made my face feel greasy.  I am still trying to find a good moisturizer that offers at least 30 SPF broad spectrum protection.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with a clean yet nourishing texture. Good under make-up but fabulous for healthy bare skin look- actually seems to smooth and plump up my thin aging 59 yr old skin! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product almost a year. This summer I was out in the sun and started to notice that if I used this product on my sunburn my skin never peeled or flaked, first time ever!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer.  I love Derm e products.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a bottle of this. I am 68 years old and it has diminised the lines on my face and makes my skin look very fresh and young. Love that it is made of nature ingredients. I don&#x27;t have to use much. My friend bought it wholesale but Amazon&#x27;s price was even better.</li>
            <li> Soft , not greasy ,  it perfectly moisturizes the skin and makes it smooth . I ordered another from Italy to match with the soothing serum. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I really do love this stuff. I have sensitive, dry skin. It is so hard finding a moisturizer that is thick enough without being so oily that it aggravates my skin. This really does smooth and moisturize without making a mess. It soaks in well and works in all seasons. I use the same brand of face wash and while I like it, I don&#x27;t love it like I do the cream.</li>
            <li> Was looking forward to a moisturizer that would help with &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; rosacea; as some testimonials professed.  To my dismay, I broke out with actual bumps on my face and rosacea seemed to get darker instead of lighter.  This was after about a week - so I discontinued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have fairly sensitive skin, so I can only assume this allergic reaction is not common for others based on all the accolades I read.</li>
            <li> I use this daily &amp; love how it makes my face feel!</li>
            <li> I have done an extensive research on moisturizers and it was a purchase based on my research results. I have to say that I am extremely happy with this product. It performs as well as it was described leaving my skin soft and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11-11-17 Update: I had been using the product for several years and was happy with the results. The recent purchase was disappointing. It appears that the consistency, color, and composition of the cream have changed. I have been using the cream from the latest jar  for the last month and have noticed that my skin is not getting softer the was it used to. I was surprised to read from one of the reviews that the manufacturer denies any product changes. I have to say that actions speak louder than words. The cream HAS changed. I am switching to another product.</li>
            <li> I love this derma e line of products as it is formulated  for sensitive skin. I would suggest using the Derma e soothing serum along with this moisturizing cr√®me. It&#x27;s a great duo. Price is the best I have found. VERY pleased w/seller.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time.  Seems to be good at hydrating. I&#x27;ve research the ingredients seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m fooling myself, but I swear that this makes me look younger. Particularly nice for the crow&#x27;s feet. Interestingly, also seems to reduce some intermittent facial redness. (The package advertises this feature, although the main Amazon bullets don&#x27;t mention it.)  Setting aside claims of rejuvenation, I&#x27;ve found it just to be a nice, year-round moisturizer for my combination skin--eliminates dryness without making things oily. Not quite fragrance free, but the small amount of scent doesn&#x27;t irritate my usually-sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> mine came opened with finger prints in it but i was fully refunded so still giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Very soothing to winter skin, have not had any problems with breakouts using every night before bed! Also a great antiager which is a huge bonus!!</li>
            <li> Helps a LOT with rosacea!</li>
            <li> I am 68 years old with extremely sensitive skin that is sun damaged. I think I have found the answer in this product. I would highly recommend it. It is reasonably priced and the jar will last you a long time. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do too much as of now, been about 3 weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Everything I have tried makes my face red and angry.  I have celiac and a forum discussion let me know other women were having the same problems as me.  Many of them were using Derma E so I tried it.  What a find!  It is so light and silky and didn&#x27;t upset my skin at all.  Best of all, the sandpaper effect the celiac causes is mostly gone!  I would recomend this to anyone who has sensative , dry skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change In my skin after using this for about 3 mo. All though, I did notice it made my skin soft. That&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. It broke me out and made my skin look worse just in general. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had been looking long an hard for a product that moisturizes the dry skin on my face without irritating it.  This Derma e product is definitely the product for me--love, love, love. It leaves the skin on my face smooth and silky--very silky.  It gives me a glow that I have never achieved w/ any other product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two years now--I will never use anything else again!&lt;br /&gt;Pros - odorless&lt;br /&gt;  - very creamy&lt;br /&gt;  - a little goes a long way (lasts almost a year)&lt;br /&gt;  - does not irritate my sensitive, dry skin&lt;br /&gt;  - actually does make me look younger!!  (smooth skin w/ less wrinkles)&lt;br /&gt;Cons - none</li>
            <li> I used this for a week and felt like my wrinkles increased and skin was irritated. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
            <li> I swear this stuff is the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It feels good going on and the scent is not offensive, and as a person allergic to petroleum products it is hard for me to find something that doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out. Probably the very best part of using this though, is that my skin looks fantastic. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different things, but this is the cream I keep coming back to, for one thing the really high Vitamin E content keeps my skin looking fabulous - and at 45 it is nice to be mistaken for about 10-15 years younger than I am (mind you I have never been a fan of suntanning) I&#x27;ve been using this since I was 40. I used it not only on my face but when I have an injury to my skin because it seems to help the skin heal much faster and more thoroughly. I&#x27;ve found it useful as a healing balm for my family, when they&#x27;ve not been mindful of their skin and the weather. I expect I will use it until I stumble across something even better, but I am not actively searching for another product. I have also used it in the gel format, but I find that I like the feeling of the creme better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really good product.</li>
            <li> Use this for daytime to moisturize face without any hint of perfume or fragrance.  Love the texture of the creme.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I feel like I can see subtle results. But I have very dry skin and I feel like I need to put more on a few minutes after this goes into my skin. But I like the product. The scent is subtle too..</li>
            <li> I am on my second jar of this product.  I have seen a significant improvement in my poors.  I have not seen much difference in my hyper-pigmentation. My acne did clear up.  The scars have not.  I think over all I will continue to use this product.  I am going to look for other options for the scars.  I have an olive complexion that scars easy.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. My girlfriend and I tried it out, and within only a few days we noticed wrinkles fading away. Seriously.</li>
            <li> Product received different name than soothing moisturizing creme.  Checked with Derma e - Product sent to me was the old name and packaging (Anti-Aging Pycnogenol Moisturizing Creme) I think the picture should match the product, but is seems to be okay to use.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for about 2 weeks and I only ordered it bceause Dr Oz recommended hthe ingredients. Still waiting ......</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I have problem skin and with a healthy diet, exercise and as much sleep as I can manage this cream helps my skin stay nice and moisturized. No crap in it--which is always a dealbreaker--and you can always trust Derma E to treat your skin as well as you as a customer, well. This is for normal-&amp;#62; dry skin and really turns around dehydrated (flaky and dry but oily and acne-prone) skin when use with a toner (I use a raw apple cider vinegar toner). If you have oily skin get the gel version. A little goes a lonnng way. Too much and it may clog your pores.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks no changes, will continue usage until container empty. Don&#x27;t want to be negative, giving product time and opportunity to see benifits.</li>
            <li> very nice facial cream</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY moisturizing creams for my face -- some of them moisturize, but peel when I apply my foundation makeup. Some of them make my skin feel pinched. This one is always comfortable, not greasy, and my makeup goes on flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to start off by saying that I like Derma e products, especially their hyaluranic acid wash and lotion, but I wanted to try a less greasy formula.&lt;br /&gt;This has a super mild scent and is moisturizing on the face, but it caused me to break out with pimples all over my chin and around my nose.  I almost never get pimples.  When I do, it&#x27;s maybe one tiny one.  This caused about 10 big red bumps on my face over night (has never happened to me before).  I stopped using the cream, and the pimples/bumps are disappearing very quickly.  I liked the way my skin felt when I applied it, but certainly walking around with big bumps on my face is not the effect I&#x27;d hoped for.  For my skin, 30 y.o., very light complexion, with maybe the start of a couple tiny wrinkles on my forehead, this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Best kept secret in the cosmetics world. Amazing product at a reasonable price. I read about this product in a small paragraph in a magazine. It should have a whole page devoted to it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s not too thick and it leaves my face super soft. I use the microderm scrub as well.</li>
            <li> I am still determining this products effectiveness.  I&#x27;ve used it only 3-4 times and for only three weeks.  I hope to offer my final decision following my fifth use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago, and I absolutely love it. It is more of a gel than a lotion, which made me skeptical at first, but after using it I realized it works better than any other product I have used in recent years. I have a fair olive complexion that is on the dry side, my skin is usually clear with oily spots under my mouth. Unlike other reviews, this product does not leave a residue on my face at all, instead it goes on light and feels wonderful. I had been experimenting with other natural products with no luck, so I pleased I found this one. I just ordered other Derma E products that haven&#x27;t arrived yet, hopefully I will love those too!</li>
            <li> I wanted to use the entire jar before making my review.  I did not see any change at all for the first 2 weeks and was ready to be disappointed, when suddenly after that, several brown spots on my cheek were fading to light tan, and the fragile skin under my eyes was firming up.  I have been thrilled ever since!  In fact, I just ordered my next jar.  Even my husband says he can clearly see the difference.  And I also have several apps on my I Pad that show me how &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; different beauty/cosmetic products are, before I order them.  derma e came out with great ratings.  My advice is to buy the cleansing lotion with the creme.  I think that gives the best treatment for your skin when you use them together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok mosturizer. I don&#x27;t know it really helps my dryness though.</li>
            <li> Skeptically I began using this cream after learning that pycnogenol helps to increase collagen &amp; elastin.  Have been using for just under a month now &amp; have noticed my skin is smoother &amp; firmer.  I do not have sensitive skin so cannot comment on that but I have never used anything that does what it says, no matter what the hype or what the price.  I do not find this product greasy at all and a little goes a long way.  Thumbs up for this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product by Dema e.  It does disminish fine lines and wrinkles as stated.  However the second time I tried to order it the vendor said the product was damaged in route and did not respond in a timely fashion. I had to reorder directly from Derma e.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing cream is wonderful.  I use it am and pm and it is a great feeling on your face.</li>
            <li> This works. I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a month and saw a big difference. My skin is smoother and pimples never appeared in my face anymore.</li>
            <li> Soothing. Although, I haven&#x27;t seen it offer my skin any benefits. It did not moisturize my skin very well but it was soothing. After use I can still see dry spots and it sometimes takes two applications to help with that dryness. It does not work well under makeup for me or provide a smooth finish unless I apply it 30 mins or more ahead of applying the BB I use.  I am 28 with combination skin. I use a hat and spf for sun protection whenever I go outside. I would not recommend this product for people who normally have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of expensive creams and this is just as good if not better.&lt;br /&gt;Glides on but not in a silicone way..it is very light and creamy.. I have been using&lt;br /&gt;this for several months and the skin on my face is definitely smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my hands, neck, chest and lower legs.  I love the way it goes on, not like a traditional&lt;br /&gt;body cream that has a drag or a heavy feeling at all.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t review products very often but I am buying a couple more bottles today just&lt;br /&gt;to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months and it has really worked well.  My skin looks better, smoother and it feels nice.</li>
            <li> purchased as a night cream, having use it for about a month. It&#x27;s OK not great. After read another review about a bad smell I did not find that to be the case</li>
            <li> I had used this for a couple weeks and had not noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of moisturizing without being greasy or shiny.</li>
            <li> OK nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether or not it&#x27;s really working (rebuilding collagen, enhancing texture/elasticity etc.) since I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks, but...it goes on super smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I even use it as eye and neck cream. Makes my (usually dry) skin feel great! Excellent cruelty-free creme! Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A very nice soothing creme.  I will order again.</li>
    </ol>
