            <li>Good price and convenient</li>
            <li>Smells good too</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s not sticky and is waterproof, I think it would be a good sports sunscreen for golf, tennis, cycling ect.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the price</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and did not burn.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to order this and check it off my winter vacation to do list.</li>

            <li>make my own sunscreen as well as</li>
            <li>make my own sunscreen as well as</li>
            <li>nice 2 pack.  </li>
            <li>sprays out nicely.</li>
            <li>This 2-pack was a nice value.</li>
            <li>The product is good but you can&#x27;t always rely on being able to apply it.</li>
            <li>It completly dries outyour skin and isnt all that effective in protecting from sun exposure.</li>
            <li>The spray does appear to be effective.</li>
            <li>It is great for quick application</li>
            <li>SPF 50, good coverage as it is easily to apply.</li>
            <li>FYI, consumers reports for this year liked the Banana Boat SunComfort spray better.  </li>
            <li>I love the ulra mist sunscreen spray and it is effective preventing me from getting sunburnt.</li>
            <li>I tried it today for the first time and it worked great.</li>
            <li>quick and easy, great coverage.</li>
            <li>Works fine, just don&#x27;t forget to rub it in!</li>
            <li>Pleasant sweet scent and easy to apply mist.</li>
            <li>product does not work like I expected, my very fair skinned child did not receive good sun</li>
            <li>It works ok if you rub it in but</li>
            <li>You still have to rub it in if you want to try to even out the coverage a bit more.  </li>
            <li>and I felt much more protected.</li>
            <li>This sprays a refreshing mist of sun deflecting goodness on your most volatile areas.</li>
            <li>included: sprayer is more focused</li>
            <li>I use many brands and I will not use any sunscreen in any form recommended by Consumer Report since those are all chemical sunscreens when infact</li>
            <li>may offer protection but offer many unwanted chemicals as well.</li>
            <li>ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>The more zinc, the more protection</li>
            <li>but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to VCO.</li>
            <li>The more zinc, the more protection</li>
            <li>but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to VCO.</li>
            <li>Better than the lotion.  </li>
            <li>We will buy more.</li>
            <li>It never did that before, so I&#x27;m fairly sure this is the culprit.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter love spraying herelf</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Banana Boat SPF 30 spray is interesting.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The toxin pack arrived as promised and am sure they will do the job well.</li>
            <li>stays on pretty good - but i re-apply after laying out a while or when in water.  </li>
            <li>used it on my latest outing and it seems to wear off very quickly.  </li>
            <li>easy spray top.</li>
            <li>If chemicals are not disturbing, then roofing tar offers the best sun protection on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc</li>
            <li>This stuff really works good even after swimming alot.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for the athlete who is in the sunny part of the year and needs a little more protection.</li>
            <li>No problems with the quality of the spray lotion, but the spray bottle caps crack extremely easily.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover well, and smears off too easily after application.</li>
            <li>Spray sunscreen is so wasteful but it is also so easy to apply..  </li>
            <li>there are few brands out there with good ingredients and great protection.</li>
            <li>The spray on part of it makes it incredibly easy to apply....  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, decent price.  </li>
            <li>Great price, love how easy it is to apply, it protects from the sun for a long time, no sticky feeling, no pungent smell, and it lasts for 3 days on a beach vacation, for a family of four.</li>
            <li>It is especially nice for when you are in a hurry, it takes a lot less time than spreading on and in lotions.  </li>
            <li>As a sunscreen it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>This is what kept me burn free and probably skin cancer free</li>
            <li>I would recommend the 9.5 ounce family size if available.</li>
            <li>Use as a light spray from about 8 inches</li>
            <li>Overall value is great however for sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Further, I have experienced some irritation on my forearms.  </li>
            <li>Went burn free for 2 weeks at the beach using this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Once the ocean is warm enough to spend time in it, I&#x27;ll know if this product is effective.</li>
            <li>press with all my strength on the top right into my hand and then apply.  </li>
            <li>For comparison, 2 bottles of lotion would easily have lasted for the full week with plenty to</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and quickly with the exception that you are warned not to spray it on your face.</li>
            <li>i am using it for my small children and it is doing a perfect job.</li>
            <li>Terrific product, good price.</li>
            <li>If I were using it full body it would probably be 2 applications.</li>
            <li>My kids MUCH prefer the mist sunscreen to the lotion, so they will use it more...</li>
            <li>I use it when I go hiking or skiing in the mountains where the UV is more intense than at sea level.</li>
            <li>This is good for re applications once you&#x27;ve already been outside.</li>
            <li>So far I like it in the aerosol cans!! :)</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful of ingredients, certified organic at least 95% and FREE OF; fragrances, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, or UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane and alcohol.</li>

            <li>This is a great thing when it&#x27;s time to reapply, but you aren&#x27;t dried off well.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh.</li>
            <li>good product for the sun, love the spray on versus the thick lotion that takes 30 mins.</li>
            <li>Living in the deep south, we are all kind of &amp;#34;misty&amp;#34; during the summer months anyway.</li>
            <li>For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution.</li>

            <li>And when you are in the sand and it&#x27;s stuck to your body, it is like sand paper when you rub on lotion, but this you can just spray it right on.  </li>
            <li>I bought another 6oz of a different brand when this ran out and it lasted me 5 more days.</li>
            <li>The first was soccer practice (my knee caps burnt</li>
            <li>, as with any sunscreen all day isn&#x27;t really all day!</li>
            <li>I would agree that sprays do not last as many days as lotions.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost and delivered fast with Prime.</li>
            <li>recommend ;-)</li>
            <li>The generic brand from target is a better bottle/sprayer than this.</li>
            <li>It has protected me from the sun, and I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li>Exact product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t perform for nearly as many uses as a similarly priced or sized lotion would - for just 2 people, each spray was good for about 1.5 days on the beach without much time in the water (and that included still getting burned - so clearly not using it as frequently as we should have).  </li>
            <li>I like it so much ;-)</li>
            <li>Definitely make sure you are outside before you spray, which kind of defeats the apply before you go outside point.  </li>
            <li>Sprays on very smooth and dries fast without a dry feel.</li>
            <li>The 30 SPF level offers nice sun protection in a long wearing water resistant formula.  </li>
            <li>Who needs that messy rub on lotion any more?!</li>
            <li>Very deceiving.</li>
            <li>but that was because I used too much.  </li>
            <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li>Overall it goes on light and the wait time is shorter, def.</li>
            <li>Our whole family sprayed ourselves generously with the Banana Boat spray and then headed out for 3 hours of boating and swimming.  </li>
            <li>High quality product!</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time outdoors and live in a hot climate</li>
            <li>The spray works fine and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc.</li>

            <li>Also, the locking mechanism isn&#x27;t secure so if you&#x27;re packing for a long trip, it may spray all over your bag(trust me, I know from experience).</li>
            <li>line because it is easy to apply on wet or sweaty skin.</li>
            <li>I finally started putting a second coat of a sunscreen lotion on over top of this mist</li>
            <li>Especially since that means I am more likely to apply it when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I love having simple things delivered to my house in the middle of the winter!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>With the high heat and humidity this summer, the lotion sunscreen I was using was proving ineffective.</li>
            <li>I wore this stuff for college marching band camp, where you have no time to do anything like buying new sunscreen, and IT ATTRACTS BEES.</li>
            <li>and it will dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>If this is something to throw in your pool bag to drive down the road, it should work fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sprays are the most damaging type of any type of sunscreen due to their mix and where it may land, especially on the face and eyes.</li>
            <li>I cannot say the same for the others using a higher spf rating.</li>
            <li>ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the negative side, this one happened to stain my white swimsuit top!</li>
            <li>It  was a little gummy when I first put it on the first time I used it</li>
            <li>The ad clearly states &amp;#34;Twinpack, 12 ounce&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally clear and you can&#x27;t feel it on your skin after it dries (a minute or so).</li>
            <li>It lasts pretty long for a spray on.  </li>
            <li>I think this is underrated as far as UVA B.  </li>
            <li>Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li>Totally worked, kept me free of sunburn in the middle east, despite my constant sweating!  </li>
            <li>So far, the smell is unoffensive and the lotion is not too oily.</li>
            <li>I use it to when playing tennis on sunny days: no signs of sunburn even after 2-3 hours under direct sunlight at noon.</li>
            <li>It is one very concentrated ray soaking everything in its path but only covering an inch or two in diameter.</li>
            <li>However, there has been almost a complete lack of sun (and warmth) this spring.  </li>
            <li>The only issue is that it tends to go everywhere, particularly if there&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty rough.</li>
            <li>Even less fun when your wife gets it</li>
            <li>It dried quickly and held up in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is broad spectrum, meaning that it will protect you from UVA and UVB rays.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen itself was very good, the packaging and distribution of the product was crap.</li>
            <li>A large bottle of cream usually lasts me the whole summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the white collar on my cycling jersey developed a yellow-brown stain after using this stuff.</li>
            <li>(waterproof only means it will last the suggested time in water which is normally 90 mins) and after sweating..</li>
            <li>but it turned the white strap around the neck a dark golden yellow.</li>
            <li>Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>

            <li> It is great for quick application</li>
            <li> SPF 50, good coverage as it is easily to apply.</li>
            <li> FYI, consumers reports for this year liked the Banana Boat SunComfort spray better.  </li>
            <li> I love the ulra mist sunscreen spray and it is effective preventing me from getting sunburnt.</li>
            <li> I tried it today for the first time and it worked great.</li>
            <li> quick and easy, great coverage.</li>
            <li> Works fine, just don&#x27;t forget to rub it in!</li>
            <li> Pleasant sweet scent and easy to apply mist.</li>
            <li> product does not work like I expected, my very fair skinned child did not receive good sun</li>
            <li> It works ok if you rub it in but</li>
            <li> You still have to rub it in if you want to try to even out the coverage a bit more.  </li>
            <li> and I felt much more protected.</li>
            <li> This sprays a refreshing mist of sun deflecting goodness on your most volatile areas.</li>
            <li> included: sprayer is more focused</li>
            <li> I use many brands and I will not use any sunscreen in any form recommended by Consumer Report since those are all chemical sunscreens when infact</li>
            <li> may offer protection but offer many unwanted chemicals as well.</li>
            <li> ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> The more zinc, the more protection</li>
            <li> but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to VCO.</li>
            <li> The more zinc, the more protection</li>
            <li> but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to VCO.</li>
            <li> Better than the lotion.  </li>
            <li> We will buy more.</li>
            <li> It never did that before, so I&#x27;m fairly sure this is the culprit.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter love spraying herelf</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Banana Boat SPF 30 spray is interesting.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The toxin pack arrived as promised and am sure they will do the job well.</li>
            <li> stays on pretty good - but i re-apply after laying out a while or when in water.  </li>
            <li> used it on my latest outing and it seems to wear off very quickly.  </li>
            <li> easy spray top.</li>
            <li> If chemicals are not disturbing, then roofing tar offers the best sun protection on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc</li>
            <li> This stuff really works good even after swimming alot.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect for the athlete who is in the sunny part of the year and needs a little more protection.</li>
            <li> No problems with the quality of the spray lotion, but the spray bottle caps crack extremely easily.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover well, and smears off too easily after application.</li>
            <li> Spray sunscreen is so wasteful but it is also so easy to apply..  </li>
            <li> there are few brands out there with good ingredients and great protection.</li>
            <li> The spray on part of it makes it incredibly easy to apply....  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, decent price.  </li>
            <li> Great price, love how easy it is to apply, it protects from the sun for a long time, no sticky feeling, no pungent smell, and it lasts for 3 days on a beach vacation, for a family of four.</li>
            <li> It is especially nice for when you are in a hurry, it takes a lot less time than spreading on and in lotions.  </li>
            <li> As a sunscreen it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> This is what kept me burn free and probably skin cancer free</li>
            <li> I would recommend the 9.5 ounce family size if available.</li>
            <li> Use as a light spray from about 8 inches</li>
            <li> Overall value is great however for sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Further, I have experienced some irritation on my forearms.  </li>
            <li> Went burn free for 2 weeks at the beach using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Once the ocean is warm enough to spend time in it, I&#x27;ll know if this product is effective.</li>
            <li> press with all my strength on the top right into my hand and then apply.  </li>
            <li> For comparison, 2 bottles of lotion would easily have lasted for the full week with plenty to</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and quickly with the exception that you are warned not to spray it on your face.</li>
            <li> i am using it for my small children and it is doing a perfect job.</li>
            <li> Terrific product, good price.</li>
            <li> If I were using it full body it would probably be 2 applications.</li>
            <li> My kids MUCH prefer the mist sunscreen to the lotion, so they will use it more...</li>
            <li> I use it when I go hiking or skiing in the mountains where the UV is more intense than at sea level.</li>
            <li> This is good for re applications once you&#x27;ve already been outside.</li>
            <li> So far I like it in the aerosol cans!! :)</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful of ingredients, certified organic at least 95% and FREE OF; fragrances, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, or UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane and alcohol.</li>

            <li> This is a great thing when it&#x27;s time to reapply, but you aren&#x27;t dried off well.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh.</li>
            <li> good product for the sun, love the spray on versus the thick lotion that takes 30 mins.</li>
            <li> Living in the deep south, we are all kind of &amp;#34;misty&amp;#34; during the summer months anyway.</li>
            <li> For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution.</li>

            <li> And when you are in the sand and it&#x27;s stuck to your body, it is like sand paper when you rub on lotion, but this you can just spray it right on.  </li>
            <li> I bought another 6oz of a different brand when this ran out and it lasted me 5 more days.</li>
            <li> The first was soccer practice (my knee caps burnt</li>
            <li> , as with any sunscreen all day isn&#x27;t really all day!</li>
            <li> I would agree that sprays do not last as many days as lotions.  </li>
            <li> Worth the cost and delivered fast with Prime.</li>
            <li> recommend ;-)</li>
            <li> The generic brand from target is a better bottle/sprayer than this.</li>
            <li> It has protected me from the sun, and I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Exact product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t perform for nearly as many uses as a similarly priced or sized lotion would - for just 2 people, each spray was good for about 1.5 days on the beach without much time in the water (and that included still getting burned - so clearly not using it as frequently as we should have).  </li>
            <li> I like it so much ;-)</li>
            <li> Definitely make sure you are outside before you spray, which kind of defeats the apply before you go outside point.  </li>
            <li> Sprays on very smooth and dries fast without a dry feel.</li>
            <li> The 30 SPF level offers nice sun protection in a long wearing water resistant formula.  </li>
            <li> Who needs that messy rub on lotion any more?!</li>
            <li> Very deceiving.</li>
            <li> but that was because I used too much.  </li>
            <li> Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li> Overall it goes on light and the wait time is shorter, def.</li>
            <li> Our whole family sprayed ourselves generously with the Banana Boat spray and then headed out for 3 hours of boating and swimming.  </li>
            <li> High quality product!</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time outdoors and live in a hot climate</li>
            <li> The spray works fine and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc.</li>

            <li> Also, the locking mechanism isn&#x27;t secure so if you&#x27;re packing for a long trip, it may spray all over your bag(trust me, I know from experience).</li>
            <li> line because it is easy to apply on wet or sweaty skin.</li>
            <li> I finally started putting a second coat of a sunscreen lotion on over top of this mist</li>
            <li> Especially since that means I am more likely to apply it when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I love having simple things delivered to my house in the middle of the winter!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> With the high heat and humidity this summer, the lotion sunscreen I was using was proving ineffective.</li>
            <li> I wore this stuff for college marching band camp, where you have no time to do anything like buying new sunscreen, and IT ATTRACTS BEES.</li>
            <li> and it will dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> If this is something to throw in your pool bag to drive down the road, it should work fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sprays are the most damaging type of any type of sunscreen due to their mix and where it may land, especially on the face and eyes.</li>
            <li> I cannot say the same for the others using a higher spf rating.</li>
            <li> ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the negative side, this one happened to stain my white swimsuit top!</li>
            <li> It  was a little gummy when I first put it on the first time I used it</li>
            <li> The ad clearly states &amp;#34;Twinpack, 12 ounce&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally clear and you can&#x27;t feel it on your skin after it dries (a minute or so).</li>
            <li> It lasts pretty long for a spray on.  </li>
            <li> I think this is underrated as far as UVA B.  </li>
            <li> Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li> Totally worked, kept me free of sunburn in the middle east, despite my constant sweating!  </li>
            <li> So far, the smell is unoffensive and the lotion is not too oily.</li>
            <li> I use it to when playing tennis on sunny days: no signs of sunburn even after 2-3 hours under direct sunlight at noon.</li>
            <li> It is one very concentrated ray soaking everything in its path but only covering an inch or two in diameter.</li>
            <li> However, there has been almost a complete lack of sun (and warmth) this spring.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is that it tends to go everywhere, particularly if there&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty rough.</li>
            <li> Even less fun when your wife gets it</li>
            <li> It dried quickly and held up in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is broad spectrum, meaning that it will protect you from UVA and UVB rays.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen itself was very good, the packaging and distribution of the product was crap.</li>
            <li> A large bottle of cream usually lasts me the whole summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the white collar on my cycling jersey developed a yellow-brown stain after using this stuff.</li>
            <li> (waterproof only means it will last the suggested time in water which is normally 90 mins) and after sweating..</li>
            <li> but it turned the white strap around the neck a dark golden yellow.</li>
            <li> Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li> only reason that I did not give 5 stars is because the spray stream is a bit weak making it hard to spray your own back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m only using it on face, neck, forearms and lower legs, it just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t spray even and doesn&#x27;t last long when swimming.</li>
            <li> Long lasting (4h)</li>
            <li> goes on even and is not wet and oily like other sun blocks that I use.  </li>
            <li> , the second was a backyard BBQ (3 applications in a 4hr time frame) and my arms and tops of my feet burnt, and the third was today at a water park with my children (reapplied heavily 4 times and my chest, shoulders and neck are fried with different shades of red and tan).</li>
            <li> A little more expensive, doesn&#x27;t last as long as lotions, but for the convenience and the coverage, it is all we use.</li>
            <li> Banana Boat has long been my sunscreen of choice.</li>
            <li> and then the next day noticed it at the local WalMart for about $5 less.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected but one of the capps were broken.. kept it anyway because I was going on vacation the next day</li>
            <li> Comparing, the spray can with the tube, I see that the active ingredients are similar.</li>
            <li> I used this on my arms and legs and got absolutely no redness not even the minor sunburn that sometimes shows up in the evening but goes away by morning.  </li>
            <li> However, not very sweat-proof despite &amp;#34;waterproof for 80 mins&amp;#34;. Will need to reapply the product on long strenuous activity because it washes off with sweat.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t sweat, don&#x27;t swim, down use a towel, it will probably last all day..</li>
            <li> But again, the above activities break it down and cause it to not work as well..</li>
            <li> It also stained by white running shirt with a slight beige color around the neck and the bottom of the sleeves</li>
            <li> It is not clear however, that this is due to Banana Boat.  </li>
            <li> Just from these three occasions one can is empty.</li>
            <li> The family size should work for 2 people for 5-7 days, but it will probably empty at that time.  </li>
            <li> Even applying it 3 different times throughout the 4 hour round, I and everyone else in my foursome who used the spray</li>
            <li> can only imagine how poorly it would work if we were actually playing a sport that made you actually sweat.</li>
            <li> Applied this liberaly, didn&#x27;t get wet,  and still got sunburned.</li>
            <li> It works as expected...</li>
            <li> For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc.</li>
            <li> For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t burn if it gets in my eyes like other sunblock</li>
            <li> extremely red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep one in the trunk of the car just in case, and the other one in my backpack when heading out on an adventure.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened but keep it away from white swimwear.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Active Ingredients:  Avobenzone 2.0%, Homosalate 7.0%, Octocrylene 5.0%.  </li>
            <li> Spray covers a tiny area making it hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t press the button hard enough, it was literally the lightest spray I&#x27;ve ever seen.  </li>
            <li> Sunburn on vacation is no fun.  </li>
            <li> Even the fairest Irish skin can use this to prevent that common lobster hue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember all sunscreen has to be reapplied after toweling, after swimming (The chemicals break it down)</li>
            <li> protection, sweat resistant e water resistant, therefore, a little sticky (one thing leads to the other).</li>
            <li> We all came back with serious sunburn everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Stays on for the long runs, or at least it smells like it is staying on.</li>
            <li> It stayed on me for the day I was at the ocean and it did allow me to get a little color.  </li>
            <li> it was just a wet mess that slowly dripped out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m missing spots.</li>
            <li> I have used it almost everyday</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of its ease of use, I am likely to use the spray for casual sun exposure, say bike riding or walking in partial shade, instead of using nothing because of the trouble involved with applying the cream variety.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t run or drip into my eyes even with heavy sweat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if we got a defunct product or if this mist truly doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Apply liberally and don&#x27;t forget to re-apply after water exposure or excessive sweating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened</li>
            <li> I hardly ever had sun burns working as an aquatics director..</li>
            <li> Works well, but does stain white clothes an awful yellow</li>
            <li> Expensive for how little you get.</li>
            <li> The mister is weak, feels like someone may have used it before</li>

            <li> Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens.</li>

            <li> Definitely not happy with this bottle.  </li>
            <li> I got so frustrated that I would just put it on a hard surface,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several sprays but this seems to be the worst.  </li>
            <li> Completely useless!</li>
            <li> Even with thorough use and reapplication I still burned badly.</li>
            <li> It has that &#x27;sunscreen smell&#x27; but it isn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>
            <li> I have used aerosol sunscreen before with no hassle but these bottles were annoying.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Treat yourself&amp;#34; and protect yourself from the evil sun rays that want to hurt you.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> The way the nozzle distributes the spray is terrible.</li>
            <li> This sunblock works well but has horrible fumes when you spray it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Patchy coverage.  It works ok if you rub it in but all in all I would prefer cream.  Sunburn on vacation is no fun.  Even less fun when your wife gets it 😜</li>
            <li> rip off. The ad clearly states &amp;#34;Twinpack, 12 ounce&amp;#34;. It is actually two (2) 6 ounce cans. Very deceiving.</li>
            <li> We bought a twin pack for a vacation, having never used the spray type of sunscreen before. It didn&#x27;t perform for nearly as many uses as a similarly priced or sized lotion would - for just 2 people, each spray was good for about 1.5 days on the beach without much time in the water (and that included still getting burned - so clearly not using it as frequently as we should have).  For comparison, 2 bottles of lotion would easily have lasted for the full week with plenty to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also provides patchy coverage. You still have to rub it in if you want to try to even out the coverage a bit more.  Expensive for how little you get.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works good even after swimming alot.  It lasts pretty long for a spray on.  One can, on two girls lasted one week using it every day.  It is especially nice for when you are in a hurry, it takes a lot less time than spreading on and in lotions.  And when you are in the sand and it&#x27;s stuck to your body, it is like sand paper when you rub on lotion, but this you can just spray it right on.  A little more expensive, doesn&#x27;t last as long as lotions, but for the convenience and the coverage, it is all we use.</li>
            <li> I bought it for our vacation later this month. I haven&#x27;t used it yet. So far I like it in the aerosol cans!! :)</li>
            <li> Great sun spray for those who don&#x27;t want to take the time to spread lotion on. Works well.</li>
            <li> It is what it says, SPF 30 UVA/UVB protection, but one bottle is enough for about 2 coats. Didn&#x27;t seem like 6oz to me. I bought another 6oz of a different brand when this ran out and it lasted me 5 more days.</li>
            <li> Stays on for the long runs, or at least it smells like it is staying on. I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy when you put it on. Smell does stay in clothes after wash however. It also stained by white running shirt with a slight beige color around the neck and the bottom of the sleeves, basically where the shirt would come into contact with the sunblock. But the product works.</li>
            <li> good price, good product</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very effective and provides me with protection against the UV rays.</li>
            <li> Use these all the time. Great price!!!</li>
            <li> Got these cheaper on Amazon than your local store.  No problems with the quality of the spray lotion, but the spray bottle caps crack extremely easily.  Handle with care and you will like this stuff.  Especially when you have to prep 4 kids to go out in the sun and pool!  Who needs that messy rub on lotion any more?!</li>
            <li> I went out on a limb and tried this mist on 3 separate occasions. I applied the mist several times for each occasion and have burnt each time. The first was soccer practice (my knee caps burnt and I reapplied it  2 times in a 2hr time period), the second was a backyard BBQ (3 applications in a 4hr time frame) and my arms and tops of my feet burnt, and the third was today at a water park with my children (reapplied heavily 4 times and my chest, shoulders and neck are fried with different shades of red and tan). Just from these three occasions one can is empty. I do not use sparingly and I ensure all areas exposed are sprayed so it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m missing spots. I feel as if the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t come out and it&#x27;s just aerosol. I finally started putting a second coat of a sunscreen lotion on over top of this mist and I felt much more protected. I will never purchase this again and I can&#x27;t recommend it. I&#x27;m not sure if we got a defunct product or if this mist truly doesn&#x27;t work. I spend a lot of time outdoors and live in a hot climate and I&#x27;ve never had this issue before with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Hate it. It doesn&#x27;t cover well, and smears off too easily after application. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Spray sunscreen is so wasteful but it is also so easy to apply..  I was an aquatics director for 10 years and this is all I used! If a user is following the directions, this stuff works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember all sunscreen has to be reapplied after toweling, after swimming (The chemicals break it down) (waterproof only means it will last the suggested time in water which is normally 90 mins) and after sweating..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as with any sunscreen all day isn&#x27;t really all day! If you don&#x27;t sweat, don&#x27;t swim, down use a towel, it will probably last all day.. But again, the above activities break it down and cause it to not work as well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this stuff is great.  I hardly ever had sun burns working as an aquatics director.. This is what kept me burn free and probably skin cancer free</li>
            <li> Good price and convenient it came to my door. I always forget it at the store</li>
            <li> my go-to sunscreen.  takes care of me</li>
            <li> It is great for quick application</li>
            <li> As a runner, I look for things that won&#x27;t rub off or sweat off.  This is perfect for the athlete who is in the sunny part of the year and needs a little more protection.</li>
            <li> Great sun block.  Es spray on and does the job.  Smells good too</li>
            <li> As a sunscreen it&#x27;s fine but it smells like bug spray! No idea why. I have had people comment on the fact that it smells like bug spray. Hense the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This sprays a refreshing mist of sun deflecting goodness on your most volatile areas. Even the fairest Irish skin can use this to prevent that common lobster hue. Apply liberally and don&#x27;t forget to re-apply after water exposure or excessive sweating.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, the spray is a great way to apply. However, it doesn&#x27;t spray even and doesn&#x27;t last long when swimming. Used on a 1/2 day at the pool in the Texas sun on 4 kids. Going to try another brand.</li>
            <li> The husband I both like this because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and you can spray and go.</li>
            <li> Great!  Terrific product, good price.</li>
            <li> Its sunscreen and it does its job well.  &amp;#34;Treat yourself&amp;#34; and protect yourself from the evil sun rays that want to hurt you.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t turned your shirt yellow like Coppertone</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, but it seem improved for the summer of 2015.  Improvements that I noticed included: sprayer is more focused so it goes where you want it to, it has less of an odor while on your skin (still smells while spraying), much less sticky, and it dries quickly in 1-3 minutes.  Because it&#x27;s not sticky and is waterproof, I think it would be a good sports sunscreen for golf, tennis, cycling ect.  FYI, consumers reports for this year liked the Banana Boat SunComfort spray better.  It was one of their best bets along with Walmart SPF 45 Lotion, Coppertone WaterBabies zinc oxide formula, and a Target lotion modeled after Neutrogena.  They gave this spray an A on UVA A (skin cancer rays) and and a B on UVA B(sunburn rays).  I think this is underrated as far as UVA B.  I used this on my arms and legs and got absolutely no redness not even the minor sunburn that sometimes shows up in the evening but goes away by morning.  I would agree that sprays do not last as many days as lotions.  I would recommend the 9.5 ounce family size if available. It&#x27;s about 8.00 at Target.  The family size should work for 2 people for 5-7 days, but it will probably empty at that time.  All in all an excellent product</li>
            <li> This stuff works great as sun block.  It even traveled in my suitcase on the plane with no issues.  It  was a little gummy when I first put it on the first time I used it but that was because I used too much.  Use as a light spray from about 8 inches and it will dry quickly.  It stayed on me for the day I was at the ocean and it did allow me to get a little color.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Active Ingredients:  Avobenzone 2.0%, Homosalate 7.0%, Octocrylene 5.0%.  Inactive Ingredients: Alcohol Denat., Isobutane, Isododecane, Diisopropyl Adipate, Lauryl PEG-8 Dimethicone, Phenylisopropyl Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate/Isostearate/Dimer Dilinoleate Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Methyl Abietate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Mineral Oil, Panthenol, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sprays are the most damaging type of any type of sunscreen due to their mix and where it may land, especially on the face and eyes. I use many brands and I will not use any sunscreen in any form recommended by Consumer Report since those are all chemical sunscreens when infact there are few brands out there with good ingredients and great protection. Target, Hawaiian Tropic, Copper tone, Nutrogina, etc. may offer protection but offer many unwanted chemicals as well. Bottom line, what ingredients are you looking for and how well it protects you for what you pay per ounce. If chemicals are not disturbing, then roofing tar offers the best sun protection on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own sunscreen as well as I purchase sunscreen for times when I do not have time to make any since I need to surf. For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. The more zinc, the more protection but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to VCO. Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun. For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution. A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful of ingredients, certified organic at least 95% and FREE OF; fragrances, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, or UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane and alcohol. What goes on the skin is the same as being consumed through the skin. Chemicals, alcohol and fragrances are no protection for the skin.d to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes.

            <li> Better than the lotion.  This is unscented.  It also doesn&#x27;t burn if it gets in my eyes like other sunblock I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for running...I&#x27;ve run in the sun for 3+ hours without a burn.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price</li>
            <li> We used both containers on beach excursions during a Caribbean cruise. I was amazed that for once my very fair skin was not sunburned. We will buy more.</li>
            <li> As sunscreen, this gets 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For ease of application, it also gets 5 stars. Especially since that means I am more likely to apply it when I&#x27;m in a hurry. The only issue is that it tends to go everywhere, particularly if there&#x27;s a breeze. That includes clothes, see below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For value for money, though, it only gets 2 stars. Even though I&#x27;m only using it on face, neck, forearms and lower legs, it just doesn&#x27;t last long. 4 or 5 applications is all I get out of a can. If I were using it full body it would probably be 2 applications. This is why I recommend, and use, a cream as back up. A large bottle of cream usually lasts me the whole summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the white collar on my cycling jersey developed a yellow-brown stain after using this stuff. It never did that before, so I&#x27;m fairly sure this is the culprit.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I golf a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my latest outing and it seems to wear off very quickly.  Even applying it 3 different times throughout the 4 hour round, I and everyone else in my foursome who used the spray all left the course extremely red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only imagine how poorly it would work if we were actually playing a sport that made you actually sweat.</li>
            <li> Pleasant sweet scent and easy to apply mist. However, not very sweat-proof despite &amp;#34;waterproof for 80 mins&amp;#34;. Will need to reapply the product on long strenuous activity because it washes off with sweat. Overall value is great however for sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Did not work at all. Spray covers a tiny area making it hard to apply. Even with thorough use and reapplication I still burned badly.</li>
            <li> This stuff works GREAT and it is cheaper on amazon.com so stock up before the sun is burning you and you family!!</li>
            <li> I was in Haiti where people were wearing 50, 75 and 100 spf.  I am fair skinned and did not burn.  I cannot say the same for the others using a higher spf rating.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and then the next day noticed it at the local WalMart for about $5 less. I couldn&#x27;t return because it&#x27;s considered a flammable item. I will never order this on Prime again.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen.  It dried quickly and held up in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason that I did not give 5 stars is because the spray stream is a bit weak making it hard to spray your own back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> My kids MUCH prefer the mist sunscreen to the lotion, so they will use it more...that is a thumbs up this Mom!</li>
            <li> Sprays on very smooth and dries fast without a dry feel. Smells fresh. Used it all day on a boat and no burn. Was too good as it also kept me from a tan! Have used it on the beach as well. Did not even need to reapply. Worth the cost and delivered fast with Prime.</li>
            <li> goes on even and is not wet and oily like other sun blocks that I use.  Stays on through sweat and rain too.</li>
            <li> good product for the sun, love the spray on versus the thick lotion that takes 30 mins. to activate before you can go out into the sun (as opposed to 15 mins. with this product).  Overall it goes on light and the wait time is shorter, def. recommend ;-)</li>
            <li> Works great, no rubbing in.  Spray it on and go.  It&#x27;s totally clear and you can&#x27;t feel it on your skin after it dries (a minute or so).</li>
            <li> Perfect sun screen! i am using it for my small children and it is doing a perfect job. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s up with the sprayer? The generic brand from target is a better bottle/sprayer than this. I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Our whole family sprayed ourselves generously with the Banana Boat spray and then headed out for 3 hours of boating and swimming.  We all came back with serious sunburn everywhere.  We will never use this again!</li>
            <li> I wore this stuff for college marching band camp, where you have no time to do anything like buying new sunscreen, and IT ATTRACTS BEES. My nickname was &amp;#34;Queen Bee&amp;#34; for an entire season because I constantly had anywhere from 3-7 bees circling around me. It wasn&#x27;t a coincidence either, because I let someone borrow it and then all of a sudden he had bees circling him, too! No sunburns though.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen. The spray works fine and the bottle lasts a long time. It has protected my family from sunburn and there has been no irritation.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is broad spectrum, meaning that it will protect you from UVA and UVB rays. I have used it almost everyday and it goes on smoothly. It has that &#x27;sunscreen smell&#x27; but it isn&#x27;t that bad.  It has protected me from the sun, and I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, decent price.  I keep one in the trunk of the car just in case, and the other one in my backpack when heading out on an adventure.</li>
            <li> Very good. Exact product.</li>
            <li> Totally worked, kept me free of sunburn in the middle east, despite my constant sweating!  Love the two-pack, a great buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen, easily to apply and has a great smell! I like this &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34; line because it is easy to apply on wet or sweaty skin. This is a great thing when it&#x27;s time to reapply, but you aren&#x27;t dried off well. Living in the deep south, we are all kind of &amp;#34;misty&amp;#34; during the summer months anyway. SPF 50, good coverage as it is easily to apply.</li>
            <li> I love the ulra mist sunscreen spray and it is effective preventing me from getting sunburnt. On the negative side, this one happened to stain my white swimsuit top! I&#x27;m not sure what happened but it turned the white strap around the neck a dark golden yellow. Not sure what happened but keep it away from white swimwear.</li>
            <li> Excellent item, as good as described.</li>
            <li> Bought this before our week in Mexico. Great coverage and protection. We were out in the sun daily and no burns!</li>
            <li> nice 2 pack.  sprays out nicely. not greasy at all.  stays on pretty good - but i re-apply after laying out a while or when in water.  easy spray top.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I like it so much ;-)</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient, I&#x27;ll buy it again! I have used it for a month</li>
            <li> Works well, but does stain white clothes an awful yellow</li>
            <li> Once the ocean is warm enough to spend time in it, I&#x27;ll know if this product is effective. So far, the smell is unoffensive and the lotion is not too oily.</li>
            <li> I keep one in the car for touch ups and one in the bathroom to prep for my day. My granddaughter love spraying herelf</li>
            <li> The 30 SPF level offers nice sun protection in a long wearing water resistant formula.  My family likes spray on sunscreen rather than lotion, but it can sometimes be pricey.  This 2-pack was a nice value.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - keeps the sun from burning me and GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> product does not work like I expected, my very fair skinned child did not receive good sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;the product was packaged well in shipping, just does not perform like we needed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good and effective. just can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> went to Jamaica and this came in very handy!!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!  High quality product! Very convenient when you don&#x27;t feel like getting all messy with regular sun screen.</li>
            <li> I love having simple things delivered to my house in the middle of the winter!  It&#x27;s good to order this and check it off my winter vacation to do list.</li>
            <li> Works fine, just don&#x27;t forget to rub it in! It won&#x27;t cover everywhere with the spray alone.</li>
            <li> Great price, love how easy it is to apply, it protects from the sun for a long time, no sticky feeling, no pungent smell, and it lasts for 3 days on a beach vacation, for a family of four.</li>
            <li> This product worked great when we were in Granada. Excellent value.</li>
            <li> the spray malfunctions, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work at all. The product is good but you can&#x27;t always rely on being able to apply it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected but one of the capps were broken.. kept it anyway because I was going on vacation the next day</li>
            <li> The mister is weak, feels like someone may have used it before</li>
            <li> Great value. Great Product.</li>
            <li> Cannot use it enough when working on the farm. Multipack price is the way to go!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I use it to when playing tennis on sunny days: no signs of sunburn even after 2-3 hours under direct sunlight at noon.</li>
            <li> This sunblock isnt much good. It completly dries outyour skin and isnt all that effective in protecting from sun exposure. I wont be using this sunblock again.</li>
            <li> Banana Boat has long been my sunscreen of choice. Until now, I have used the cream product that comes in squeeze tubes. I use it when I go hiking or skiing in the mountains where the UV is more intense than at sea level. I used to use the SPF 30 cream, but moved up to SPF 50 when the 50 became available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Banana Boat SPF 30 spray is interesting. It is easier to apply than the cream. It goes on easily and quickly with the exception that you are warned not to spray it on your face. You are advised to spray it on your hands and then rub it on your face. That does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of its ease of use, I am likely to use the spray for casual sun exposure, say bike riding or walking in partial shade, instead of using nothing because of the trouble involved with applying the cream variety. The spray does appear to be effective. Comparing, the spray can with the tube, I see that the active ingredients are similar.</li>
            <li> Excellent, very happy with the product</li>
            <li> Good price and goes on well. I like this brand of sunscreen for me but use something different on my face.</li>
            <li> The way the nozzle distributes the spray is terrible. It is one very concentrated ray soaking everything in its path but only covering an inch or two in diameter. I&#x27;d guess that the nozzle was broken or blocked. Same problem on both bottles though so maybe manufacturer&#x27;s defect. The second bottle broke after two very short uses and instead of a mist it was just a wet mess that slowly dripped out of the bottle. Completely useless!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I am a soccer coach who spends a lot of time out in the sun. With the high heat and humidity this summer, the lotion sunscreen I was using was proving ineffective. I went through the Amazon reviews and ordered the Banana Boat Ultramist. I tried it today for the first time and it worked great. Didn&#x27;t run or drip into my eyes even with heavy sweat. I&#x27;d fully recommend this product to anyone who spends time outdoors.</li>
            <li> Used it seems to work good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it because it can go with plane</li>
            <li> This sunblock works well but has horrible fumes when you spray it.  I&#x27;ve used several sprays but this seems to be the worst.  Definitely make sure you are outside before you spray, which kind of defeats the apply before you go outside point.  This is good for re applications once you&#x27;ve already been outside.</li>
            <li> The toxin pack arrived as promised and am sure they will do the job well.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest coverage.  You still have to rub it in to get it to work well, which defeats the purpose of having spray sunscreen&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> This product appears to protect against the sun&#x27;s rays.  However, there has been almost a complete lack of sun (and warmth) this spring.  Further, I have experienced some irritation on my forearms.  It is not clear however, that this is due to Banana Boat.  Will let you know.</li>
            <li> What it promised it realised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dermatologist and fully recommend this sunscreen protector for outdoor activities. Long lasting (4h) protection, sweat resistant e water resistant, therefore, a little sticky (one thing leads to the other).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sunscreen. It screens the rays of the sun. The spray on part of it makes it incredibly easy to apply....  And if you&#x27;re worried about spraying your face, spray it into your hand then rub it on your face.</li>
            <li> I think we received defective bottles.  I have used aerosol sunscreen before with no hassle but these bottles were annoying.  I couldn&#x27;t press the button hard enough, it was literally the lightest spray I&#x27;ve ever seen.  I got so frustrated that I would just put it on a hard surface, press with all my strength on the top right into my hand and then apply.  Definitely not happy with this bottle.  The sunscreen itself was very good, the packaging and distribution of the product was crap.</li>
            <li> Good deal didn&#x27;t get burnt</li>
            <li> Went burn free for 2 weeks at the beach using this stuff.  I think I prefer Coppertone to this based solely on the spray ( coppertone spray is wider and easier to apply ).  Other than that, I have no complaints</li>
            <li> quick and easy, great coverage.</li>
            <li> Nope. Over priced. Doesn&#x27;t spray well. Just go buy some from CVS</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty rough. Also, the locking mechanism isn&#x27;t secure so if you&#x27;re packing for a long trip, it may spray all over your bag(trust me, I know from experience). If this is something to throw in your pool bag to drive down the road, it should work fine.</li>
            <li> Still got sunburn. Applied this liberaly, didn&#x27;t get wet,  and still got sunburned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sunscreen.  It sprays evenly.  It works as expected...</li>
