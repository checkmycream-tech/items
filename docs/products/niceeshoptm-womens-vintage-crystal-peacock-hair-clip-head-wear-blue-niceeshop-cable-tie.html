            <li>Such Beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>It is large so would look best at back of heard.  </li>
            <li>So yes I paid cheap and thats what i got was cheap.</li>
            <li>But, the one I received has gold colored metal &amp; looks cheap.</li>
            <li>It arrived in good shape no missing stones.</li>
            <li>So pretty!!</li>
            <li>Pretty however not that great of quality, several stones fell out when it arrived.</li>
            <li>Very shiny and outstanding.</li>
            <li>Unique, pretty, inexpensive hairclip</li>
            <li>but it was so worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute especially when u put on ur hair.</li>
            <li>It is really pretty</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to wear it with my blue dress! :)</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I ordered the blue.  </li>
            <li>it might look good in small girls pony , its too tiny , looks cheap and wasn&#x27;t worth the wait..</li>
            <li>The stones do not look cheap, but the yellow metal would look better if it were white, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>this hair clip is a nice one and is ok but similar ones go for the same amount so there really is no big deal on this one</li>
            <li>we got fast service also.</li>
            <li>Shipped really fast .</li>
            <li>Extremely reasonable price and arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t really function as it should.</li>
            <li>It looked so much cuter in the pic</li>
            <li>This is a very cute hair clip, much smaller than I expected but will go very well with an up-do hair style.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality, beautifully detailed, 2nd piece to my collection.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t  close around any decent amount of hair.</li>
            <li>Like I say the pic makes it look so much cuter than it is I won&#x27;t be wearing this sadly to many missing stones</li>
            <li>It was a bit smaller than I expected, but still lovely and still very well received!</li>
            <li>This looks really striking against my dark hair!</li>
            <li>It just looks a little more brighter than the picture</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful hair clip although a little heavy.  </li>
            <li>So cute for my little daughter, holds really well, even young adults would enjoy wearing this little beauty.</li>
            <li>Maybe each one is different, but the one that I received was all light blue.</li>
            <li>I was expecing it to be a bit bigger but other than that it pretty and not bad quality</li>
            <li>I replaced the stones because they were a little cheap looking</li>
            <li>I cannot clip to my 4 yr old daughters hair too..hard to  close or clip...</li>
            <li>Now belongs to my 3 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>The clip works well, size fits slightly more than palm of hand not too big or heavy.</li>
            <li>it can only hold a small amount of hair, was hoping it would clip on more</li>
            <li>This is a cute hair clip that holds your hair up well, but the glue used to hold the stones in is not good.</li>
            <li>and I do not have a lot of hair and still fit small</li>
            <li>Although it is a little smaller than I expected, I still love it and recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it - it didn&#x27;t look extremely different that what was pictured...it just looked cheap.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little long to get it since it is shipped international but worth the wait.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a cute hair clip that holds your hair up well, but the glue used to hold the stones in is not good. Bubble gum would have been a better adhesive. I replaced the stones because they were a little cheap looking and they came off very, very easily.</li>
            <li> This was very beautiful, the bright colors are so pretty. This looks really striking against my dark hair! And it arrived very quickly, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I received entirely different peacock clip.  Rather than the turqouise and blue colors which match a comb I have the clip I received is purple, pink. peach and teal.  It is garish compared to the all blue peacock clip the photo shows.</li>
            <li> I like it I was expecing it to be a bit bigger but other than that it pretty and not bad quality</li>
            <li> The clip has to be bent every time I use it. I tried to contact the seller, no response. want a replacement. Guess I am stuck w what I have. It is nice &amp; pretty.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair clip for my granddaughter and she love it.  It stays in her hair and doesn&#x27;t slide down plus it is beautiful.  we got fast service also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve to say this ! This is a real nice shop ! I&#x27;ve been taking care of my problem and they have a great customer service ! So don&#x27;t matter what I&#x27;m still shopping with them ! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Shipped really fast . I love it</li>
            <li> This vintage crystal peacock hairpin is very beautiful, though it&#x27;s kind of small.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite hairpiece. it did take a long time to get to me but it was so worth it. it looks just like the picture except the gold is a little darker. all the gems were intact when i received this and still are. i constantly get compliments on this</li>
            <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a small gift to a teacher who loves peacocks. She was thrilled and put it in her hair immediately! Extremely reasonable price and arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> The picture was not clear enough for me to tell it was gold toned. My wedding colors are silver and teal. I wish it came in silver tone</li>
            <li> We gave this as a present and was delivered to her.  we did not see it, but the recipient loved it!!  No complaints!!!  She thought it was quite lovely!</li>
            <li> Unique, pretty, inexpensive hairclip It arrived in good shape no missing stones. The clip works well, size fits slightly more than palm of hand not too big or heavy.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is beautiful and true to color .  I love it so much that I ordered the blue.  Takes a little long to get it since it is shipped international but worth the wait.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> So pretty!! The picture does not do it justice!!! The colors so pretty and bright. Very easy to clip in, very nice design!!!</li>
            <li> But it is tiny, Its not put together well. The clasp doesn&#x27;t work well and no i would not recommend this piece because of the fastener.</li>
            <li> I received this clip today...but it is hard to clip...it only take few hairs but I cannot clip it..i donot buy this..very poor quality..I cannot clip to my 4 yr old daughters hair too..hard to  close or clip...</li>
            <li> I ordered this as part of my Mrs. Peacock outfit for Halloween.  When it arrived, one of the colored stones was missing from the clip.  I also have to say that it did not look as nice as it did online.  I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it - it didn&#x27;t look extremely different that what was pictured...it just looked cheap.  I ended up returning it and just wearing peacock feathers in my hair instead.</li>
            <li> The picture is defiantly prettier. The stones are kind of cloudy, and some of them are almost plastic looking. The metal is a weird yellow color. It doesn&#x27;t  close around any decent amount of hair. So it doesn&#x27;t really function as it should. I have to use a hair tie to pull my hair back and then clip it around a very very small amount of hair so it will actually stay closed. I&#x27;ll use, but I&#x27;m not really happy with how I have to make it work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute especially when u put on ur hair. It just looks a little more brighter than the picture but it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for beautiful, high quality hair accessories and have now found the most awesome seller.  This is a high quality, beautifully detailed, 2nd piece to my collection.  It sparkles, it&#x27;s sturdy and well crafted.  Its a gorgeous piece and looks like a tiara when worn on top of a bun.  My daughter wore it to the prom and was stunning in it.  It was delivered sooner than expected and its description, didn&#x27;t do it just.  It is a stunning piece.  High quality and detail for an awesome price.  Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, gave as gifts and they were very liked. Very nice size, not heavy to wear. Very shiny and outstanding.</li>
            <li> So yes I paid cheap and thats what i got was cheap. It looked so much cuter in the pic but once it got in my hands there was several dislodged rhinestones. I am not blaming the seller because I don&#x27;t think he/she is the one that sits and makes them. Like I say the pic makes it look so much cuter than it is I won&#x27;t be wearing this sadly to many missing stones makes it look all the cheaper!</li>
            <li> i like this clip. the detail is very good and i love the color. it can only hold a small amount of hair, was hoping it would clip on more</li>
            <li> So cute for my little daughter, holds really well, even young adults would enjoy wearing this little beauty. The stones do not look cheap, but the yellow metal would look better if it were white, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> this hair clip is a nice one and is ok but similar ones go for the same amount so there really is no big deal on this one</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hair clip although a little heavy.  It is large so would look best at back of heard.  Item arrived during estimated ship time although it was a long wait - I believe it is shipped from China.</li>
            <li> It was a bit smaller than I expected, but still lovely and still very well received! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a very cute hair clip, much smaller than I expected but will go very well with an up-do hair style.  Not to heavy on your head.</li>
            <li> I guess I forgot to look at the size of the clip before ordering, it was smaller than I pictured in my mind. (Of course when I looked at the description after I received it, the misperception was my fault.) However one thing to note, the item is not two toned. Maybe each one is different, but the one that I received was all light blue. It is really pretty and I am looking forward to wearing it soon. I would not mind having this clip in several different colors.</li>
            <li> Pretty however not that great of quality, several stones fell out when it arrived. Still for the price great deal.</li>
            <li> I received my clip today and it just as beautiful as it is on the pic. Although it is a little smaller than I expected, I still love it and recommend it to anybody. All the jewels came intact and the clip was packaged so as not to get any damage. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it with my blue dress! :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way too small and I do not have a lot of hair and still fit small I do not really like it did but its okay for the price I paid. Now belongs to my 3 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> It arrived in almost a month . It was my mistake to buy it because i didn&#x27;t check its dimensions.  it might look good in small girls pony , its too tiny , looks cheap and wasn&#x27;t worth the wait..would give it away.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the metal to be silver, like it is in the photo. But, the one I received has gold colored metal &amp; looks cheap.</li>
            <li> Its cute I liked it. I recently cut my hair to shoulder length and it still works well I like em.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful blue crystal hair clip and a great value.  You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this.  I purchased more.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day.this was nice and elagent and it looked nice on my moms hair</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A GIFT !! HAD ALREADY ORDERED ONE FOR A GIFT THAT I HAVE GIVEN ALREADY, SUCH A HIT I ORDERED ANOTHER .</li>
