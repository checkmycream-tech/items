            <li>All my life I&#x27;ve had very fine, stick-straight hair, and this lotion, used after shampooing but before the curling iron, gives my hair some body, which it wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have, and enables it to hold curl.</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for year and have not been able to find anything else even close to this product.</li>
            <li>Better than mousse.</li>
            <li>It also was easy to comb and style after drying.  </li>
            <li>This is, far and away, the best product I have ever found for truly thickening fine, straight hair.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;It gave my fine hair body and bounce, which was what I was seeking.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and there&#x27;s not a lot of it</li>
            <li>Well then, I shouldn&#x27;t have been able to order it in the first place!</li>
            <li>It gives my fine, straight hair the body it needs to be able to style the hair.</li>
            <li>It is awesome for thin baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, &amp; came quickly!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Great stuff to add volume and a slight hold.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and I do keep it short.  </li>
            <li>I received my order quickly and packaged very well</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I found this product on Amazon because it is really hard to find.</li>
            <li>came quickly, well packaged, no leaks, used once so far, did help with making hair feel thicker, but not amazing new wonderful hair !</li>
            <li>My hair feels more voluminous and doesn&#x27;t hang flat anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for the past 5 or more years and it&#x27;s not always easy to find for some reason.</li>
            <li>This lotion is much better than other messy wet gels and especially better than a mouse.  </li>
            <li>None of them really make much of a difference.   </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Even my husband uses it and he has much thicker hair than mine.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and will continue to order it.</li>
            <li>It really does work and it works well.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li>This product adds some body and helps hold curls after using rollers better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair feeling like there is a film on it like so many other thickening products.</li>
            <li>Second, I have very fine, pin-straight blonde hair</li>
            <li>Anyone with thin fine hair would be pleased with the volume this product provides.</li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t order again as I use the Chavez product line with better results and less fuss.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years for my baby fine hair; it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that actually makes it seem like my hair is thicker!  </li>
            <li>Finally, a thickening lotion that actually gives my baby fine hair body.</li>
            <li>I live in fear of it going off the market someday.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried over the counter products as well as products recommended by various hair stylists (and only available there).  </li>
            <li>Left my very fine hair feeling chalky and weighted down.</li>
            <li>First off, I ordered this product on a Friday afternoon with standard shipping, and received it on Monday.</li>
            <li>Most leave my hair sticky, and hard to comb.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product I have found that really does add body to my hair.</li>
            <li>I was very please with Redken Thickening Lotion as it left my hair feeling and looking fuller.  </li>
            <li>Mousse, gels --- even the super hold ones --- don&#x27;t do a thing but weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin  hair and this product gives my hair a lot of body.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin.  </li>
            <li>A bit expensive but well worth it especially if you have Amazon Prime which will give you free 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent way too much money over the years on hair products trying to get some lift and poof in my hair.  </li>
            <li>it does give some body to my thin hair and makes it more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 62 and have always had thin fine hair.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much though it can be stiff and sticky , this bottle will last me years!</li>
            <li> Just the oposite made hair greasy and flat.</li>

            <li> However, I find it difficult to assess how much is too much or too little and</li>
            <li> rub my palms aver my hair, , comb it through and style my hair wet.  </li>
            <li> When I use mousse, I never feel like I can distribute it evenly, I mean its like putting on big clumps of egg white for heavens sake.  </li>

            <li> Use it after the shower towel dry hair apply small amount to hair then comb and blow dry.</li>
            <li> I just massage  a small amount through my hair, fluff it up and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling like there&#x27;s product weighing it down</li>
            <li> It gives lots of body without weighing it down at all.</li>
            <li> I use a little spray on my bangs.  </li>
            <li> have used this product for 3 years love how it thickens without making my hair dull or sticky!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> I have used  06 lotion for few years.</li>
            <li> that others that I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> You can use a lot of it without fear that it will make your hair gummy or dull.</li>
            <li> My hair is almost to my shoulder ,but thin .</li>
            <li> , you name it - some of them quite expensive.    </li>

            <li> Have used this product for years for my baby fine hair; it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that actually makes it seem like my hair is thicker!  I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Could not live without this.</li>
            <li> Great stuff to add volume and a slight hold. Use it after the shower towel dry hair apply small amount to hair then comb and blow dry. BOOM your done and looks great. Been using for two years no dandruff or dryness.</li>
            <li> This is, far and away, the best product I have ever found for truly thickening fine, straight hair.   I have used all kinds of styling products - mousse, gels, you name it - some of them quite expensive.    None of them really make much of a difference.   This does.   I live in fear of it going off the market someday.   I just hope I get fair warning, so that I can buy a truckload!</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner, well packaged, product as advertised. Works well on thin/limp hair, providing body.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It gives my hair volume and adds thickness and body.  I will continue to use this product.  Its great, thanks</li>
            <li> This product is great for men with thinning hair. It makes my hair feel thicker when I apply it. After blow drying my hair it looks great. Its the best for me. SOLD, SOLD &amp; SOLD.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer who said she&#x27;s lives in fear they will take it off the market. If I could by it by the gallon, I would. This is the ONLY product I have found that really does add body to my hair. Mousse, gels --- even the super hold ones --- don&#x27;t do a thing but weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 years and am most satisfied with the results.  Anyone with thin fine hair would be pleased with the volume this product provides.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product off and on for about 4 months.  It isn&#x27;t bad...it does give some body to my thin hair and makes it more manageable.  However, I find it difficult to assess how much is too much or too little and often wind up with more than I want making my hair yucky quicker.  Probably won&#x27;t order again as I use the Chavez product line with better results and less fuss.</li>
            <li> Finally, a thickening lotion that actually gives my baby fine hair body.Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This met my expectations, unlike other thickening lotions like bumble and bumble.&lt;br /&gt;It gave my fine hair body and bounce, which was what I was seeking.</li>
            <li> I have used this Redkin product for several years and purchased it locally. Recently the salon that I usually bought it at quit carrying it. I found it on line in a larger size and cheaper that I was paying at the salon! Once again it pays to shop on line!! I received my order quickly and packaged very well so no leaks/spills.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, &amp; came quickly!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for fine hair. It gives my hair the volume and the hold that it needs.</li>
            <li> came quickly, well packaged, no leaks, used once so far, did help with making hair feel thicker, but not amazing new wonderful hair !</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo and this thinking finally something to help thicken my hair.Just the oposite made hair greasy and flat.</li>
            <li> My wife was having trouble getting this product that she really likes.  She was very happy I could get her a new bottle.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my stylist and now I keep it at home and use daily. This lotion is much better than other messy wet gels and especially better than a mouse.  When I use mousse, I never feel like I can distribute it evenly, I mean its like putting on big clumps of egg white for heavens sake.  I have very fine, thin  hair and this product gives my hair a lot of body.  I feel like I have more hair and the product does not feel sticky or gummy on my hair. No white or flaky residue.  I shampoo my short hair, put  about a dime size amount in my palm,  rub my palms aver my hair, , comb it through and style my hair wet.  I let my hair air dry ( dryer if in  a hurry) I just brush out and my hair stays put all day .  I use a little spray on my bangs.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best! You can use a lot of it without fear that it will make your hair gummy or dull. I have baby fine hair and it adds incredible volume and manageability. I&#x27;ve tried them all. God forbid, they ever stop making it!</li>
            <li> First off, I ordered this product on a Friday afternoon with standard shipping, and received it on Monday. Nice! Second, I have very fine, pin-straight blonde hair and I&#x27;ve always shied away from thickening products because they leave a sticky gunky residue on my roots. This one does not! I massage a dime-sized amount onto my roots after my morning shower and blow dry upside-down. My hair feels more voluminous and doesn&#x27;t hang flat anymore. It works and it works well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Redkin Thickening Lotion for years and wouldn&#x27;t be without it. All my life I&#x27;ve had very fine, stick-straight hair, and this lotion, used after shampooing but before the curling iron, gives my hair some body, which it wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have, and enables it to hold curl. I like to combine a quarter-size dollop of the lotion with a dime-size dollop of Redkin 01, Brilliance and Shine, work it through my towel-dried hair, and then use the curling iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is almost to my shoulder ,but thin . I only use a nickle size amount and blow dry .</li>
            <li> Use it all the time.  Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Not like a lifting spray.  Left my very fine hair feeling chalky and weighted down.</li>
            <li> Eh, it&#x27;s ok. Leaves my hair feeling like there&#x27;s product weighing it down</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I found this product on Amazon because it is really hard to find. It is awesome for thin baby fine hair. It gives lots of body without weighing it down at all. A bit expensive but well worth it especially if you have Amazon Prime which will give you free 2 day shipping.Even my husband uses it and he has much thicker hair than mine. He says he likes how it makes his hair feel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the thickening lotion for many years and love it.  I have very fine hair, and I do keep it short.  Redken thickening lotion provides excellent hold that I can comb through.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will continue to order it.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Don&#x27;t use too much though it can be stiff and sticky , this bottle will last me years! Great deal!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few years now.  My hair is very fine and thin.  This product adds some body and helps hold curls after using rollers better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past 5 or more years and it&#x27;s not always easy to find for some reason. When I found it through Amazon, I bought a BIG one. My hair is fine and there&#x27;s not a lot of it and this is the best volumizing product I&#x27;ve found and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a bunch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can get this product through Amazon. It gives my fine, straight hair the body it needs to be able to style the hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have been using it for year and have not been able to find anything else even close to this product. Creates great volume without residue. It&#x27;s not sticky or heavy. It does not leave my hair feeling like there is a film on it like so many other thickening products. I Love It!!</li>
            <li> My biggest fear is this product will be discontinued.  I&#x27;ve spent way too much money over the years on hair products trying to get some lift and poof in my hair.  I&#x27;m 62 and have always had thin fine hair.  I&#x27;ve tried over the counter products as well as products recommended by various hair stylists (and only available there).  I have never had any luck and always come back to this product.  It really does work and it works well. So I tend to stock up and just hope I can always find it.</li>
            <li> I was not sure that this product would be any different that others that I have tried in the past.  Most leave my hair sticky, and hard to comb.  I was very please with Redken Thickening Lotion as it left my hair feeling and looking fuller.  It also was easy to comb and style after drying.  I was looking for a product that eliminate the need for blow drying my hair, and this works.  I just massage  a small amount through my hair, fluff it up and let it dry.  What could be simpler.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this product  on my hair and I loved how it worked. I found it online to order on amazon. I recommend to give body to blimp hair. Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> have used this product for 3 years love how it thickens without making my hair dull or sticky!!!!!  buy now girls</li>
            <li> I like it a lot...when I can get it!  Received an email from shipper telling me that it is unavailable.Well then, I shouldn&#x27;t have been able to order it in the first place!</li>
            <li> I have used  06 lotion for few years. It works great for my fine and thinning hair. Better than mousse.</li>
