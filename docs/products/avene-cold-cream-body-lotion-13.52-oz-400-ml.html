            <li>This pleasant smelling body cream with cold cream is light but moisturizing.</li>
            <li>While most of the ingredients are the same, the minor differences seem to be the anti-inflammatory ingredients, are those are absent from the Lait corporel nourrissant, and the product does not work for me as the Emulsion corporelle does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that works for me right now.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a great all around cream, and it works wonders for around the eyes.</li>
            <li> It is the best Body Lotion I have ever had. It makes skin being very smooth and soft the whole day.  A friend of mine suggested me to buy it and I have never regretted for doing so.</li>
            <li> Non fragrant, moisturizing, non-oily, great product. Helps my skin look smoother and softer. I really like it a lot and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> great product- I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I received this product on time and in perfect condictions. It&#x27;s really easy to use and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> It feels like it was diluted with something, maybe water. I have been using Av&#x27;ene for a while and this one feels less concentrated than what I am used to. Still okay but not as good as the one I purchased before in the medium or small size tubes.</li>
            <li> I thought since it was just a body lotion I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I was wrong.  It has a very light fresh smell and it really puts the moisture back in my legs.  (I hope my back too.)</li>
            <li> This pleasant smelling body cream with cold cream is light but moisturizing. A great find  - produced in France is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh, smooth not greasy, soaks in &amp; keeps your skin moist &amp; soft thru the day, feels great! Worthy, as I use it after my bath. Excellent lotion.</li>
            <li> This cream is perfect to hidrate your body.</li>
            <li> very creamy, absorbs well. Great for dry skin. Wish it was a little thicker. Am Happy with results, skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li> I use this on my son&#x27;s skin.  It&#x27;s such a better product than baby&#x27;s Johnson n Johnson and not to mention, makes him smell good.  I love this lotion.  The lip balm is great too!</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this cream and it lasts a long time.  However, I only gave 4 stars because the scent is a little too strong.</li>
            <li> THIS CREAM DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME QUALITY AS THE FACE PRODUCTS OF THE SAME COMPANY. LOVE THE FACE PRODUCTS , SO I THOUGHT I&#x27;D TRY THIS. NOT SO GOOD, IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK ANY BETTER THEN MUCH LOWER PRICED CREAMS</li>
            <li> I would like this product, but the scent is so strong it makes me sick.  I&#x27;ve tried to wear it several times thinking I&#x27;d get used to it.  Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t and end up feeling nauseous.</li>
            <li> I have try many lotion for my dry skin but this has done the job for me</li>
            <li> This one star review is specifically for the product description, not the product itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Avene Cold Cream Emulsion Corporelle, and wanted to order more as it works well for me. I have found that most Avene Cold Cream products are described as such, and the specific type is shown in the picture. If it is not, I ask before ordering. The picture in this listing shows Emulsion Corporelle, however, the item I received was Lait corporel nourrissant. These two products are not the same. While most of the ingredients are the same, the minor differences seem to be the anti-inflammatory ingredients, are those are absent from the Lait corporel nourrissant, and the product does not work for me as the Emulsion corporelle does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone looking to order Avene Emulsion Corporelle Cold Cream, this is not it! You will receive Avene Lait corporel nourrissant Cold Cream instead!</li>
            <li> One of the best body lotion ever!!!</li>
            <li> I DO love this lotion, I use it all the time. It is the only thing that works for me right now.</li>
            <li> The Avene line has become a favorite of mine. It is mid price for excellent skin creams, and they are non-greasy in whatever mode you use. I am so pleased with the two face creams I have purchased and used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avene Body Cream Lotion is something I really need in the winter. I live in the cold New England area, and my skin can become dry. I use body lotion year round, but I particularly want a lotion that is creamy enough for skin but non greasy.  This body cream is a great comfort and moisturizerizes my dry skin. It has a rich texture that provides lasting wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this body lotion is very light but noticeable. It is really enticing,and that light scent lingers. After I apply it to my body I use the extra and rub into my hands. In the winter my feet become very dry, and after a shower, I rub extra body lotion onto my feet and soles.  Avene is an excellent line for face and body products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 01-13-15</li>
            <li> Rich and luxurious.  Keeps skin feeling moisturized throughout the day.  Light scent.</li>
            <li> non greasy and the cold cream in it does wonders. i golf and am in the sun all year round. i have tuned some of my friends onto this product. a little goes a long way.</li>
