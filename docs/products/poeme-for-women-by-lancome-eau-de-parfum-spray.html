            <li>That&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>If you are a perfume collector you will love it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s ok, but it was a gift for my mother</li>
            <li>Most stores in our area no longer carry it.</li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE.  </li>
            <li>TO FIND IT ON LINE AT SUCH A GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get many compliments when wearing this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully I found it online and was not disappointed with the service!</li>
            <li>Great soft smell.</li>
            <li>I find that it is harder to buy the lotion, but I was able to find the perfume on Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li>This has become a favorite for every day or special occasions.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this scent the first time I smelled it!</li>
            <li>My wife had dropped me very strong hints long ago that Poeme is her favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but she is worth it.</li>
            <li>Nice, lasting, not too florid or fruity.</li>
            <li>This is still my favorite scent and it was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves the perfume and wears it almost every day.   </li>
            <li>Amzaon shipped it extremely fast.</li>
            <li>Does anyone suggest a modern version of this?</li>
            <li>I could absolutely bathe in this perfume.</li>
            <li>If you put too much on it will be overpowering...</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my mother in law also loved it and bought her own recently.  </li>
            <li>Most compliments from men and women then any other perfume I have worn.</li>
            <li>Getting more and more difficult to find as we were told it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Poeme by Lancôme.</li>
            <li>Surprised to learn it&#x27;s an older item.</li>
            <li>We got the larger 3.4 oz size for almost the same price of the smaller 1.8 oz that you find in many department stores.</li>
            <li>Seeing as I definitely DO NOT want to be smelling like my MOL, I am seraching for a new fragrance.  </li>

            <li> My wife has been using this perfume for 15 years and has never bought anything else. It smells great, not an overpowering scent and the scent lasts about 8-10hrs. Even though this perfume it&#x27;s kinda pricey, it&#x27;s worth it!!! I highly recommend Poeme by Lancôme.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent the first time I smelled it! I was so upset when I learned that the stores discontinued it. Thankfully I found it online and was not disappointed with the service!</li>

Seeing as I definitely DO NOT want to be smelling like my MOL, I am seraching for a new fragrance.  That&#x27;s ok, it was time to change it so I&#x27;m up for that.  Does anyone suggest a modern version of this?</li>
            <li> Most compliments from men and women then any other perfume I have worn. Pleasant smell, not overpowering,last all day. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.....heard this product is being discontinued.....even loved the powder we can no longer get&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase Poeme wherever I can; even in Mexico</li>
            <li> This perfume is irresistable for any man. It is not a cheap scent. If you are a perfume collector you will love it. It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I could absolutely bathe in this perfume. I love it!  Great soft smell. I am having trouble finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s ok, but it was a gift for my mother and she loves it, I think it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but she is worth it.</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived in a timely fashion and was undamaged.  I always receive compliments when I wear this perfume.  I wear it so often that I don&#x27;t even notice it myself anymore, but the compliments make me feel confident that those around me find it very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for 18 years now and I still get compliments about it!! I find that it is harder to buy the lotion, but I was able to find the perfume on Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume! Getting more and more difficult to find as we were told it has been discontinued. Most stores in our area no longer carry it. Once again Amazon has come through.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND IN THE STORES AND QUITE EXPENSIVE.  THRILLED TO FIND IT ON LINE AT SUCH A GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this same perfume for over 55 years -- it (and she) just seems to improve with age!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years, but the department stores in my area no longer carry it!  I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has notes of narcissus, rose and mimosa.  It&#x27;s floral with a hint of vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.  I only use one spray. If you put too much on it will be overpowering...TO EVERYBODY!</li>
            <li> This is still my favorite scent and it was exactly what I expected.  Best price around!  Would heartily recommend it!</li>
            <li> Found this scent on a rec center visitor. Surprised to learn it&#x27;s an older item. Nice, lasting, not too florid or fruity. A keeper in my collection which started with Chanel #5.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments when wearing this.  It&#x27;s my favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Have been wearing this for years and now Lancôme is discontinuing it.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  It lasts long and I still get compliments late in the day after I have put it on in the morning.</li>
