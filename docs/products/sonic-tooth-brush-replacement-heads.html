            <li>Fit perfectly  great replacement</li>
            <li>Excellent product, reasonable price  and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>product is okay, but Bling is not the kind of company I care to buy from.</li>
            <li>Quick shopping and good value</li>
            <li>so I guess I better be glad they arrived at all.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist says I have more plaque build up</li>
            <li>I love my Diamond tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Found much much more cheaper package</li>
            <li>Good product, price is right.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and the price was great also.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and can be used for multiple family members since they are each color coded.</li>
            <li>Exactly the product I needed, arrived quickly and at a great price.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Good, fast service.  </li>
            <li>Brushes look like the original ones and were purchased as replacements, Will know more after use.</li>
            <li>They took a while to get here but they actually a better than the original brushes we got with the product.</li>
            <li>After 2 1/2 years, this toothbrush is still going strong...</li>
            <li>Same great quality as original, no need to say more.</li>
            <li>They were fine.</li>
            <li>They are what they are and since they are the ones that go with the appliance they should fit fine.</li>
            <li>The brushes are durable, fit into the sanitizing container accurately, and feel comfortable on both gums and teeth.  </li>
            <li>Cheap looking and feeling.  </li>
            <li>Originally, I had purchased the Electronic toothbrush from Groupon, December 2013.</li>
            <li>NOT the quality that came with the original purchase of the Diamond Elite Sonic Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>but if you own their sonic system, you&#x27;ll need new brushes.</li>
            <li>If you own this Diamond toothbrush, and need new replacement heads, just go to amazon.com and place the order.</li>
            <li>This product is somewhat hard to find and I was very to happy to find someone who had them in stock.</li>
            <li>Great replacements and work as expected.</li>
            <li>But based on the packaging could have come in a larger quantity, would have liked that option but am happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li>Because the Diamond product is somewhat pricey, I was pleased with the reasonable cost of the brushes.</li>
            <li>They dont fit right</li>
            <li>Quick service</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend these brushes, especially if purchased on Amazon, as the price is right and the delivery superior.</li>
            <li>Other than that, these replacements fit good &amp; work well.</li>
            <li>They last&lt;br /&gt;for a long time and give good &#x27;brush.&#x27;</li>
            <li>They fit, they&#x27;re good and these guys charge less than Diamond Sonic.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, they fit okay, but it you have multiple people using this tooth brush....</li>
            <li>This really detracts significantly to effectiveness of usage i.e. it&#x27;s a hell of a bother putting them in place and in removing them.</li>
            <li>Right product and timely shipping.</li>
            <li>Fortunately my debit card is through PayPal, so I was able to stop it immediately, but it probably would not have mattered, since they&#x27;d had my debit number for so long that it had expired.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes do not last more than 3-4 weeks before they deteriorate by losing their shape and becoming too soft.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Even with their 33% first time order coupon code, amazon.com offered it with shipping (no prime) at a lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s possible that their brushes will fit</li>
            <li>Very aggravating</li>
            <li>There is no way three heads should cost this much..</li>
            <li>I tried and tried to buy this direct from the distributor without success.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush, electric, works very well.</li>
            <li>My two Sonic Care electric brushes work just as well and the replacement heads are available at most major chain stores, though a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these for the Diamond Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are a very soft bristle</li>
            <li>Clearly the product photo show&#x27;s replacements being (3) color heads.  </li>
            <li>...wish they had medium bristles and not just soft.</li>
            <li>they see to be getting soft already????</li>
            <li>There is no &amp;#34;guest check-out&amp;#34; and no way to ask for a new password so after multiple attempts, I told them to kiss off.</li>
            <li>Not much to say here but that they fit as expected</li>
            <li>This is the second Diamond brush we have had although the battery didn&#x27;t last long on the first one.</li>
            <li>and I believe they&#x27;re the same item you would get directly from the company.</li>
            <li>Apparently I registered when I bought the toothbrush, but had forgotten my password.</li>
            <li>Product was fine but the cost of any power brush head is absolutely ridiculous.</li>

            <li> I was down to my last new replacement head and</li>
            <li> but this time they only last a few times before they won&#x27;t stay on while you are brushing.  </li>
            <li> The items was as expected prompt service</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> but what other option is there?</li>
            <li> as expected!</li>
            <li> Not sure what I would do next time!!!!  </li>
            <li> Really too expensive for what they are</li>
            <li> Also, they&#x27;re about half the price...</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment!  </li>
            <li> I have nothing but trouble with the Bling people who charged my debit card for a pack of brushes I didn&#x27;t order - 3 years after I bought the brush, using my credit information that they still had on file.</li>
            <li> Inserting and removing the heads is still very difficult, which led to the present replacement being necessary.</li>
            <li> I was never on an automatic order system where they send brushes quarterly, so that failed as an excuse for them.</li>
            <li> after hours of screwing around with the morons at Diamond, I ordered it from amazon.com and even with shipping, the cost of six new heads, two packs, was less than the offer by Diamond.</li>
            <li> Rather annoyed to say the least.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the quitlity of your brush replacents heads.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it would not fit the tooth brush head just by looking at it.  </li>
            <li> Quite expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> Outrageously expensive,  </li>

            <li> I have looked all over for these replacement heads and finally found them on Amazon.  I ordered them and they came within 2 days.  Quick service and I&#x27;m happy with the product.  I would highly recommend these for the Diamond Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They were fine. What is to be said about replacement brushes? They are what they are and since they are the ones that go with the appliance they should fit fine.</li>

            <li> Items still in package, haven&#x27;t used any yet. Brushes look like the original ones and were purchased as replacements, Will know more after use.</li>
            <li> I used these toothbrush heads on an electric diamond toothbrush. They worked well &amp; are a good buy for three of them.</li>
            <li> After 2 1/2 years, this toothbrush is still going strong...no problems whatsoever.  I just reordered replacement toothbrush heads...wish they had medium bristles and not just soft.</li>

            <li> Good product. Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  Perfect fit!</li>
            <li> Not much to say here but that they fit as expected and I got all the colors shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Really too expensive for what they are but if you own their sonic system, you&#x27;ll need new brushes.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit perfectly, but you can get them on by forcing them.  You also have to force them into the holder so the lid shuts.</li>
            <li> product is okay, but Bling is not the kind of company I care to buy from. I have nothing but trouble with the Bling people who charged my debit card for a pack of brushes I didn&#x27;t order - 3 years after I bought the brush, using my credit information that they still had on file. Fortunately my debit card is through PayPal, so I was able to stop it immediately, but it probably would not have mattered, since they&#x27;d had my debit number for so long that it had expired. The charge came as a surprise, since I had not bought anything from them in a while. I was never on an automatic order system where they send brushes quarterly, so that failed as an excuse for them. The Pursonic brand had a model that looks just like the Diamond and it&#x27;s possible that their brushes will fit and I may even risk the expense to find out.</li>
            <li> Great Deal! Quality product.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stay on.  I have bought these before with no problem but this time they only last a few times before they won&#x27;t stay on while you are brushing.  Very aggravating</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my electronic Diamond toothbrush. They fit perfectly and I believe they&#x27;re the same item you would get directly from the company. They fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Same great quality as original, no need to say more. I highly recommend it and the price was great also.</li>
            <li> I purchased these replacements heads for my Diamond electric toothbrush, thinking this was the only place I could find them. Since this purchase, I have found that these are replacements for the sonic toothbrushes as well, &amp; can be found locally. Other than that, these replacements fit good &amp; work well. All in all, a good product.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are a very soft bristle</li>
            <li> Product was fine but the cost of any power brush head is absolutely ridiculous. There is no way three heads should cost this much..</li>
            <li> I tried and tried to buy this direct from the distributor without success. The toothbrush, electric, works very well. I was down to my last new replacement head and after hours of screwing around with the morons at Diamond, I ordered it from amazon.com and even with shipping, the cost of six new heads, two packs, was less than the offer by Diamond. My suggestion is do not attempt to order from Diamond. Apparently I registered when I bought the toothbrush, but had forgotten my password. There is no &amp;#34;guest check-out&amp;#34; and no way to ask for a new password so after multiple attempts, I told them to kiss off. My two Sonic Care electric brushes work just as well and the replacement heads are available at most major chain stores, though a bit more expensive. If you own this Diamond toothbrush, and need new replacement heads, just go to amazon.com and place the order. Even with their 33% first time order coupon code, amazon.com offered it with shipping (no prime) at a lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Courts&lt;br /&gt;July 27, 2014</li>
            <li> These fit my diamond toothbrush perfectly! &#x27; Also, they&#x27;re about half the price...so win for me!!  Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the quitlity of your brush replacents heads.  they see to be getting soft already????</li>
            <li> Quite expensive for what you get. I began using one of the brushes about 3 weeks ago and it is already beginning to wear out.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!!!  I&#x27;ve already bought  replacement heads, and a second toothbrush as a gift!  I will probably purchase a 3rd as another gift.</li>
            <li> Outrageously expensive,  but what other option is there?</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes do not last more than 3-4 weeks before they deteriorate by losing their shape and becoming too soft. They recommend changing every 2 months. My dental hygienist says I have more plaque build up and I think it coincides with my use of these toothbrushes. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Exactly the product I needed, arrived quickly and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Inserting and removing the heads is still very difficult, which led to the present replacement being necessary. This really detracts significantly to effectiveness of usage i.e. it&#x27;s a hell of a bother putting them in place and in removing them. Once in place they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> ok prices! as expected!</li>
            <li> I found the heads a bit pricey.  Three for $15.00.  However, I did need them and Diamond Bling wasn&#x27;t showing any replacement heads or where you could buy them.  Originally, I had purchased the Electronic toothbrush from Groupon, December 2013. I have since been looking for the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment!  Cheap looking and feeling.  NOT the quality that came with the original purchase of the Diamond Elite Sonic Toothbrush.  Love the brush, but these replacement heads are too expensive to be of such sub standard quality.  Not sure what I would do next time!!!!  I was afraid it would not fit the tooth brush head just by looking at it.  I did not receive what I am seeing in the picture by the seller.</li>
            <li> Great deal for three!</li>
            <li> We have use this product before its same as one before</li>
            <li> This product is somewhat hard to find and I was very to happy to find someone who had them in stock. I love my Diamond tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Good replacement brush.</li>
            <li> Great replacements and work as expected.</li>
            <li> Brushes are good - just as though they came from the mfg.</li>
            <li> They are perfect.  I have been looking to replace my brush heads and unsuccessful finding them.&lt;br /&gt;Love them and have two sets of 3 now.  I am good for a while.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Quick shopping and good value</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly  great replacement</li>
            <li> Found much much more cheaper package</li>
            <li> I am having a problem to replace the head. It does not come out. Please advise. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The items was as expected prompt service</li>
            <li> Everything I expected. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Good product, price is right.</li>
            <li> They fit, they&#x27;re good and these guys charge less than Diamond Sonic.</li>
            <li> They took a while to get here but they actually a better than the original brushes we got with the product.</li>
            <li> Right product and timely shipping.</li>
