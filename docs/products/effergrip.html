            <li>One of the best there is.</li>
            <li>Holds great!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and bargain.</li>
            <li>Seems to work best with plate a bit moistened, and be sure to rinse mouth as it states in the directions.</li>
            <li>Ordered it by mistake, Not as good as Fixodent, but good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, drewls out of the teeth, sticks to my gums great but does not adhere to the teeth</li>
            <li>Great product - Great Price - Super packaging - fast delivery</li>
            <li>as has always been with effergrip/ is a good product for denture wearers, the only way to improve it is a good price and good shipping.</li>
            <li>This the best denture adhesive on the American market today.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s better products on the market for the price.</li>
            <li>It suits it&#x27;s purpose, is zinc free and affordable.  </li>
            <li>Easy to remove and clean.</li>
            <li>I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
            <li>and I think it is definitely worth the try !</li>
            <li>You can definitely wear it a good 18 hours and even then, you have to pull it off.</li>
            <li>Pretty much like all the others</li>
            <li>It lasts a whole day and sometimes you have to literally pry the denture out of your mouth when you get home in the evenings.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely DETEST wearing dentures.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>So, what agrees with me, might not be right for the next person.</li>
            <li>I am fairly new at this ...</li>
            <li>I purchase this on a regular basis and like it more than other adhesives I have tried.</li>
            <li>so far,  comes close to EFFERGRIP.</li>
            <li>one year so far</li>
            <li>The texture is just right: not runny or too stiff.</li>

            <li> Much as I think I&#x27;d like to save a bit by purchasing the other adhesive creams, I always purchase Effergrip because of it&#x27;s efficiency in adherence to dentures without leaking as other adhesives do.  </li>
            <li> You have nothing to loose but your teeth!</li>
            <li> It stays on longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my husband who has such a hard time keeping his dentures in.  </li>
            <li> No need to use a lot of it…simply dot the denture at both sides, the front and center and voila!!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a small row of teeth. )</li>
            <li> This is a secondary security to my snap -on</li>
            <li> by the way, they are all no good.</li>
            <li> EFFEERGRIP  is  like cement or crazy glue.  </li>

            <li> Great product - Great Price - Super packaging - fast delivery</li>
            <li> One of the best there is.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, drewls out of the teeth, sticks to my gums great but does not adhere to the teeth so they just fall out after one bite of food or a couple sips of a liquid, inplants are the only way to go. and eliminate this junk all together. by the way, they are all no good.</li>
            <li> This the best denture adhesive on the American market today. Holds great!</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my husband who has such a hard time keeping his dentures in.  The Effergrip is not perfect as he still has issues, but he claims it is better than any of the others I have gotten for him.  I am getting this item on the Subscribe and Save program and has worked well for him.</li>
            <li> Yes, It will hold your dentures in.</li>
            <li> It suits it&#x27;s purpose, is zinc free and affordable.  I purchase this on a regular basis and like it more than other adhesives I have tried.</li>
            <li> Much as I think I&#x27;d like to save a bit by purchasing the other adhesive creams, I always purchase Effergrip because of it&#x27;s efficiency in adherence to dentures without leaking as other adhesives do.  It lasts a whole day and sometimes you have to literally pry the denture out of your mouth when you get home in the evenings.  I apply it at approx. 7 A.M. and at 8 P.M. the glue is still holding.  No need to use a lot of it…simply dot the denture at both sides, the front and center and voila!!  you&#x27;ve got a hold for all day. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use various adhesives, and this is definitely in the rotation. Seems to work best with plate a bit moistened, and be sure to rinse mouth as it states in the directions.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and bargain. I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> Ordered it by mistake, Not as good as Fixodent, but good</li>

            <li> There&#x27;s better products on the market for the price.</li>
            <li> Pretty much like all the others</li>
            <li> I absolutely DETEST wearing dentures. I was not a candidate for a bridge.  I tried every adhesive. Nothing. so far,  comes close to EFFERGRIP. This is a secondary security to my snap -on over -dentures.( fyi- it leaves  the palate completely open!! it&#x27;s just a small row of teeth. ) EFFEERGRIP  is  like cement or crazy glue.  You can definitely wear it a good 18 hours and even then, you have to pull it off. Also, you&#x27;ve got to remember that everyone&#x27;s saliva is different. So, what agrees with me, might not be right for the next person. I am fairly new at this ...one year so far and I think it is definitely worth the try ! You have nothing to loose but your teeth!</li>
            <li> Effergrip denture adhesive now comes in zinc-free. It stays on longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. The texture is just right: not runny or too stiff. Easy to remove and clean.</li>
