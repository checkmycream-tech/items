    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Especially good if your nails have ridges.</li>
            <li>Great color for fall and winter.</li>
            <li>I love this color and the polish is the best.  </li>
            <li>Excellent  buying experience... highly recommend this seller!</li>
            <li>Most amazing polish.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and does not chip easily.</li>
            <li>but you must use the top coat by Vinylux.  </li>
            <li>Love this brand of nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Chipped within 2 days when used with the top coat.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t go on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about the color!</li>
            <li>Easy on and easy off, so much easier than gel</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll deal with that to be able to forego gels and shellac and get a regular manicure that lasts a week a more.  </li>
            <li>Best long lasting polish ever!!</li>
            <li>I first tried it in Manhattan where I used the salon&#x27;s bottle  </li>
            <li>Lovely color and it last</li>
            <li>Thought it would be more deep red/ burgundy.</li>
            <li>This polish really does last a week if you use Bond Aid first on your clean nails, no base coat, and then use CND topcoat.</li>
            <li>One week no chips is for real.</li>
            <li>I do not like blue reds and have been looking for a red with more brown forever.  </li>
            <li>I suspect something in the ingredient that makes the polish more cinnamon instead of blue red causes problems with the application and drying.  </li>
            <li>and I must wait nearly 24  hours before putting on my shoes.  </li>
            <li>This truly lasts so much longer than regular polishes.  </li>
            <li>Please note this color is a very brown red.</li>
            <li>Color is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Actually I had this applied at a nail salon that does a professional job and bought this to touch up chips</li>
            <li>My toes do not dry in our humid climate</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t think it drys to a hard polish finish so quickly in humid climates.  </li>
            <li>However, although I waited for 5 hours before putting on my shoes, it was not dry enough and the big toes smeared at the tips.  </li>

            <li> Very disappointed and normal nailpolish does just as good a job.</li>
            <li> If you are the one who lets say, cooks, or does other activities on the regular basis-it will only last 2 days, JUST like any other nail polish.</li>
            <li> While not as fashionable as the neon brights and odd colors like blue and green, there are still some cinnamon colors in regular polishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to pick online, obviously, but this color is not red...</li>
            <li> The color I received is actually brown, very dark brown.</li>
            <li> Great product, but awful orangy brown color.</li>
            <li> If it dries to the touch in 9 minutes, then it should dry hard enough to put on shoes and sandals at that in 5 hours.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my toe nails b/c if I have my nails done we usually can&#x27;t go out until the next day.  </li>
            <li> They have trouble with just this color.  </li>
            <li> Been using polish now fir a few months.</li>
            <li> There is something wrong with just this color.  </li>
            <li> Because you can&#x27;t return it on amazon, I will be throwing this away unfortunately.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed in the quality of this polish.</li>
            <li> I like the product but the color is awful.  </li>

            <li> I bought this to use on my toe nails b/c if I have my nails done we usually can&#x27;t go out until the next day.  My toes do not dry in our humid climate and I must wait nearly 24  hours before putting on my shoes.  Actually I had this applied at a nail salon that does a professional job and bought this to touch up chips since I only do pedicures every 3 weeks.  However, although I waited for 5 hours before putting on my shoes, it was not dry enough and the big toes smeared at the tips.  So I don&#x27;t think it drys to a hard polish finish so quickly in humid climates.  If it dries to the touch in 9 minutes, then it should dry hard enough to put on shoes and sandals at that in 5 hours.  It did not in our humid climate.  Also I have purchased this color in the regular gel to be applied for me at the nail place.  They have trouble with just this color.  I first tried it in Manhattan where I used the salon&#x27;s bottle  They had to apply it 3 times to get the bubbles out.  It took forever.  There is something wrong with just this color.  I do not like blue reds and have been looking for a red with more brown forever.  I suspect something in the ingredient that makes the polish more cinnamon instead of blue red causes problems with the application and drying.  This could be the problem with this polish too. While not as fashionable as the neon brights and odd colors like blue and green, there are still some cinnamon colors in regular polishes.</li>
            <li> I love this color and the polish is the best.  Lasts a week but you must use the top coat by Vinylux.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed in the quality of this polish.</li>
            <li> I choose two stars for the color of this polish.  The bottle appears to be a reddish brown.  The color I received is actually brown, very dark brown.</li>
            <li> Great color for fall and winter.</li>
            <li> No chips going on 9 days, and I have been doing a lot work with hands.</li>
            <li> This truly lasts so much longer than regular polishes.  As I write this review I am on day 9 of wear and the edges are starting to look a bit ragged.  My rating would be a 5 if it didn&#x27;t stain your nails but I&#x27;ll deal with that to be able to forego gels and shellac and get a regular manicure that lasts a week a more.  Please note this color is a very brown red.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t go on smooth.  Left part of nail still showing through after applying two coats.  Might just be my nails.</li>
            <li> This polish really does last a week if you use Bond Aid first on your clean nails, no base coat, and then use CND topcoat.</li>
            <li> Lovely color and it last</li>
            <li> Most amazing polish. One week no chips is for real. Been using polish now fir a few months. Easy on and easy off, so much easier than gel</li>
            <li> Great product, but awful orangy brown color. Thought it would be more deep red/ burgundy. Excellent  buying experience... highly recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> Color is exactly what I expected.  Polish lasted about five days. I would recommend this product.  Especially good if your nails have ridges.</li>
            <li> I like the product but the color is awful.  It&#x27;s hard to pick online, obviously, but this color is not red...it is a burnt brown/orange.  Because you can&#x27;t return it on amazon, I will be throwing this away unfortunately.</li>
            <li> this nail polish &#x27;system&amp;#34; is claiming that your manicure will &amp;#34;not chip for 7 days&amp;#34;-well, if you using your hands to flip the magazines-it might be. If you are the one who lets say, cooks, or does other activities on the regular basis-it will only last 2 days, JUST like any other nail polish.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of nail polish.  It goes on nicely and does not chip easily.</li>
            <li> Chipped within 2 days when used with the top coat. Very disappointed and normal nailpolish does just as good a job.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the color!</li>
            <li> This color is NOT at all red. It is BROWN and not at all similar to the color shown in the product photo or in the description.</li>
            <li> Best long lasting polish ever!!</li>
