            <li>It also smells amazing.</li>

            <li>I love how this spray leaves a nice shine on my hair,  It can also be used even when you aren&#x27;t straightening in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Hair feels so soft and looks great!</li>
            <li>is the best hair product i bought so far...</li>

            <li>first time using this lovev the results great product</li>
            <li>I was in the store and quickly picked this out because it smells good.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice but too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I felt this really helped me flatten my hair quickly, but that&#x27;s not even the best part.</li>
            <li>Friends that have thicker hair love it</li>
            <li>I like Garnier products and am glad I gave this a try.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair smell.</li>
            <li>Made curling the hair a lot more manageable.</li>
            <li>keeps hair smooth and shiny after  blow drying !</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it:D</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Garnier products</li>
            <li>Love the sleek and shine.</li>
            <li>I also love that when I use it, my hair stays straightened or curled all day.</li>
            <li>I usually love Garnier products</li>
            <li>I feel this dries out my hair more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it works for people.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many heat styling sprays but none of them help.</li>
            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love just about all products that Garnier comes out with</li>
            <li>I will purchase more and more and more and more and more etc etc....</li>
            <li>I tend to be a perfectionist, so I&#x27;m quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Overwhelming alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>Time for her to enjoy it too!</li>
            <li>I love garnier products</li>
            <li>I love Garnier Fructis products and</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and healthy looking without that greasy look.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>but I am sure it might work for some.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t seem to be able to buy this in the UK</li>
            <li>okay, i have never been a fan of Garneir Fructis</li>
            <li>This stuff is alright, I suppose, any protection from heat tools is better than none.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i use this to restyle my synthetic heat safe wigs.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>but I think I should have purchased a better heat protectant.</li>
            <li>but I was told a spray heat protectant would be much better</li>
            <li>exactly sure what this is suppose to do because it does not do what it says it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li>Will purchase again when I need more.</li>
            <li>It works for the most part.</li>
            <li>I bought this mostly because it was on sale.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I have been using this stuff for about 2 weeks and love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>If you have more than 15 minutes it&#x27;ll do a phenomenal job.</li>
            <li>This product is okay</li>
            <li>Ive started straightening my hair more often</li>
            <li>more than if i were to just straighten my hair without product.</li>
            <li>and I was able to do this with this product.</li>
            <li>Product is OK, but it seems to make my hair somewhat oily.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Amazon gladly issued me a refund.</li>
            <li>Since all the sites says to use a protector, I decided on fructis (love the shampoo and conditioner too)  </li>
            <li>and my hair looks healthy again.</li>
            <li>(: i love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I normally love the smell of Garner Fructis products but this one is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>But it protects my hair and makes it healthy after styling it, which is what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Straightened ok.</li>
            <li>Very effective for getting my hair straight quicker</li>
            <li>It flat irons hair well and smells great!</li>
            <li>This product is awesome for my frizzy hair, after flat ironing I apply it</li>
            <li>frizzes at the first drop of sweat or rain, and this keeps my hair looking smooth and great all day.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all great products and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair looked very soft and healthy which was great because i had to take a yearbook picture.</li>
            <li>Very glad i bout this, was worth my three dollars</li>
            <li>If you already have dry hair, then this is probably not going to be the best product for you.</li>
            <li>First of all it smells amazing, and second it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Just a light spritz through the hair before using curling/flat iron and it leaves my hair looking shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and its a good price for a decent size bottle and it delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and would recommend it to anyome who want s a very good flat iron spray for cheap.</li>
            <li>I used this the other day before I shoveled the driveway and when I came inside my hair still looked perfect.</li>
            <li>but nope , i expected failure , i think siliconmix diluted with water is still my best option for perfect hair ( my own idea )</li>
            <li>I have a mix wavy and curly hair that dries easily.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and frizz free; smells great also.</li>
            <li>(my hair ends up still wavy and like straw), but when I use pre-straightener, my hair stays sleek and straight all day (unless it&#x27;s exceptionally humid</li>
            <li>Not too strong of a scent.</li>
            <li>If your looking for something that&#x27;d make your hair smooth, frizz free, soft and smelling great, try something else.</li>
            <li>but it makes you smell like a sweet flower :))</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Very good and works as expected.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in the shine and softness of my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, doesn&#x27;t  help much with frizzy hair</li>
            <li>make my hair look fabulous.</li>
            <li>I dint know if it&#x27;s the amount that is in this product or just that it&#x27;s cheaply made , but I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this received such great reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why I don&#x27;t find it in my nearby supermarkets, but I was happy to find it as an add on item at a low price, bought two of them!</li>
            <li>Instead of being smooth on my hair it comes out of the bottle sticky and gummy.</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend this to everyone that needs a great heat spray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is cheap, worked well with my CHI straightener, and added shine.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for straightening and does not make your hair heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>With this produce, my hair does not have that silky smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel shiny and smooth and i luvvvv the smell.</li>
            <li>15 min is not enough) - it does a great job of taming everything.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s not sticky at all and your hair feels and looks smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>great product will definitely get it again.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, glad to know others had success.</li>
            <li>This is the 1st time to use this lotion and I found it light and straighten my frizzy hair in seconds.</li>
            <li>and it does a good job on natural hair.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much!!!</li>
            <li>So it is really important that you clean it off when you are done.</li>
            <li>new line is nothing short of awesome.</li>
            <li>makes my hair so glossy and soft and easy to straighten and it smells nice too!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also contains alcohol denat which I&#x27;m pretty sure it drying to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well but the overwhelming smell of alcohol....</li>
            <li>At first I fell in love, it had that unmistakeable Fructis smell, after a couple hair straightenings that smell begin almost intolerable, it was so obnoxious.</li>
            <li>As long as I used Biosilk in moderation, my hair felt great afterward.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t straighten my hair on a daily basis, but the spray is wonderful for preventing static in my hair, keeping it sleek and shiny all day into the next day while not making my hair oily.</li>
            <li>Smells great all day long though!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have many lumps from sleeping and its SO shiny and soft that I can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li>Ok, here&#x27;s the thing: I love this product because it protects my hair and it makes my hair really shiny and soft:)</li>
            <li>Nothing too special</li>
            <li>The price is just right as well!  </li>
            <li>Right off the bat I was happy with how this product protected my hair from the heat of my flat iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how you can make frizzy natural curly hair so relaxed with out having to have it</li>
            <li>Overall, though, a good product.</li>
            <li>I really dont like it and don&#x27;t recommend it :)</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product at this price.</li>
            <li>A spritz on top of this caused it to really curl up.  </li>
            <li>it keeps my hair straight and feeling healthy and non greasy.</li>
            <li>It seems like maybe if I used a whole load if it, the heat protection would come into play more.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find a product that gets my hair as straight as this does at ANY price.</li>
            <li>This product leaves hair shiny and bright but after flat ironing it leaves hair sticky and causes hair to have split ends.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, just like every other straightener product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It smelled good going on, but it did not protect against the burnt hair smell from the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>WHO LOVED TO FLAT IRON</li>
            <li>It does a good job when using a flat iron, although my hair can get thick in between cuts and it doesn&#x27;t work too great with thicker parts, I have to spray way more.</li>
            <li>The first one was fine</li>
            <li>It evaporates quickly into my hair.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me the sleek, Hollywood hair that more expensive products do, but it does its best.</li>
            <li>Its good and keeps the hair straight and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hot and humid here in TN, so I&#x27;ll do a follow-up on how my hair held up after a day of running around tomorrow.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that feels light &amp; airy on your hair, not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>It gives you that totally perfectly straight hair look easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much protection it provides, but the straightening/lasting aspect is great!</li>
            <li>Now I can go almost a full week with some dry shampoo because the straigtening mist and flat iron make it perfect to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple in the past that made my hair look really oily and smell like I just got a perm, but this one has that fruity fresh smell just like their shampoos and hair spray and when you heat it up with the straightener it makes your hair smell delicious all day.</li>
            <li>but now my hair feels more damage and more dry as well</li>
            <li>more days after visiting the hair salon :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: After spraying on dry hair, your hair will clump (that&#x27;s why i gave it 4 stars)</li>
            <li>My hair was becoming very dry and breaking very easily.</li>
            <li>Garnier makes a wonderful product will continue to use as long as I am using a flat iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and makes her hair and the extensions silky smooth with out adding too much shine.</li>
            <li>iron spray and Smooth intense serum.  </li>
            <li>I get smooth, shiny, straight hair every time.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair really shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>She uses this on her own hair as well as her human hair extensions</li>
            <li>The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that many of the professional products use an aerosol spray so it goes on evenly, whereas this is a pump.  </li>
            <li>It has a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the fence to be honest, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this product a second time.</li>
            <li>I kinda always felt like I was all thumbs straightening my hair until I found this stuff and at $3 it&#x27;s really worth</li>
            <li>I love it and cannot say enough good things about it- especially for the price!</li>
            <li>found the only way this works and leaves my hair nice is by air drying.</li>
            <li>The fine mist is not too heavy for my fine hair, smells amazing, and gives me a smooth and easy flat ironing job.</li>
            <li>It is also AMAZING protector gainst flat irons</li>
            <li>Works great and it really does keep your hair straight for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I ironed right after spraying this as the directions don&#x27;t warn against that.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I sprayed it in my hair, I felt the texture change right away.</li>
            <li>I spray it right before blow drying</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of money finding the right thing for me , Garnier Fructis products was creating allergic reactions to my skin  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of protecting my hair from the high temperature of my flat iron, as well as keeping my hair straight and shiny.  </li>
            <li>But it works and keeps my hair pretty straight and frizz free.</li>
            <li>BUT if I use too much of this spray my clean hair will immediately look greasy.</li>
            <li>nice shine, lasting curls, or sleek straight.</li>
            <li>Works very well on  with my flat iron and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and it leaves my hair a little softer when I use it.</li>
            <li>Technically you should be doing that anyway, but it is super important if you are going to extend the life of your styling products, you clean this stuff off in particular.</li>
            <li>Does exactly that.</li>
            <li>This product works pretty well for me - I recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used a product like this.</li>
            <li>The smell is also pretty pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Moreover, the first ingredient is alcohol, and it seems like that&#x27;s what its made up of 100 percent.</li>
            <li>the first time i used it i saw the difference, so shine and silky</li>
            <li>I do not feel like my hair is being protected, and it does not make my hair any more shinier/straighter than the next hair product.</li>
            <li>So I discovered this by Garnier and it has totally helped my hair, bringing it make to a healthy look.  </li>
            <li>, the hair looks pretty and shine in the beginning and even curls up</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it actually does a better job at protecting your hair from the heat since this is the first heat protectant I have ever bought, but it does straighten.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I like this because it works well, and it is pretty affordable.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it gets the job done and keeps my hair nice and straight all day long.</li>
            <li>more then it actually &#x27;protected&#x27; it.</li>
            <li>My scalp was very clean, I didn&#x27;t feel and buildup from this product and my curls came back with a vengence!</li>
            <li>Maybe there is some kind of effect they are trying to get, but there are many other flat iron sprays that don&#x27;t have alcohol in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love the flat iron spray.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to creative stuff with your flat iron like me though, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li>The hair stays perfect the whole day when I use it before straightening, and on the second day I usually only have a couple spots (if any) to hit with the flat iron again.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>She is bi-racial, and this product really keeps her hair smooth, soft and under control when we use the flat-iron.</li>
            <li>It definitely keeps my hair straight, and styled, but with regards to protecting my hair from the heat, I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li>Okay, I am not sure though, the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it makes my hair particularly shinier, but It&#x27;s all right for what it does.</li>
            <li>Adds nice shine to hair and hair feels soft after I use this with my flat iron.</li>
            <li>, it was really straight and looked better than ever, i&#x27;m not a big fan of blow drying my hair but with these two products combine it really works and</li>
            <li>It was amazing how my ends laid down</li>
            <li>Until then, I&#x27;m very pleased, especially for the price of $4 bucks from my local Target!</li>
            <li>My hair has a mild natural wave, and I do have hair color in it as well.  </li>
            <li>it will dry even more</li>
            <li>But the Garnier shampoo and conditioner certainly helped to reduce or eliminate the C shape and some of the frizz versus using the cream and spray alone.  </li>
            <li>but for a first it&#x27;s doing a decent job</li>
            <li>This product is especially perfect if you have 15 minutes to get your hair straight (be realistic please, if your hair is suuuper long or thick</li>
            <li>It does smell good, but when I flat ironed with it, my hair was dry like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American and it makes our hair absolutely amazing if used correctly.  </li>
            <li>: Its a lightweight formula and leaves your hair frizz free and straight for the entire day.</li>
            <li>when I straighten it each day it doesn&#x27;t stay perfectly straight, which drives me nuts.</li>
            <li>I straightened my hair and it looked really straight.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really keep up with time</li>
            <li>It really does protect -</li>
            <li>it works really well.</li>
            <li>I recommend it if you need it and it does help hold for the whole day.</li>
            <li>This heat protector actually protects my hair and keeps it smooth &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>It also made my hair feel very straw like.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky and straight</li>
            <li>It was really alcohol-y</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care so much for it</li>
            <li>I really like this spray.</li>
            <li>Was much cheaper than purchasing in the store, plus saved me a trip out of the house.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference when using pre-blowdry</li>
            <li>But , don&#x27;t know how much protection it gives from the heat of the straightner</li>
            <li>Makes the blow drying process so much easier.</li>
            <li>Its very lightweight</li>
            <li>straight the hair well on the lowest setting of my Instyler</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really like the string fumes it has.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair straight for longer</li>
            <li>This spray really holds your style all day if you use it before straightening.</li>
            <li>I have fairly straight hair, but it tends to frizz and look unkempt if it&#x27;s humid, rains or snows.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Hair gets really straight and very shiny.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to try the straight look for awhile</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely astounded at how it made my ends look.  </li>
            <li>very much&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m on day three now and my hair is still perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this</li>
            <li>It helps prevent to much damage to your hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves a good smell and if  any conditioner (including cheaper brands such as white rain) is used before hand , hair stays soft.</li>
            <li>So helpful it keeps my hair nice n shiny last me the entire day with no frizz</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to Tresemme or make my own in the future.</li>
            <li>I find that it is a good detangler when my hair is wet, and if I spray it enough on damp hair, I can let my hair air-dry without any frizzies.</li>
            <li>This product do what it promise , it is just not what I was looking for exactly , if your hair are little oily it will be best to use also on course Asian or Latino hair, if your hair are dry skip it ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Garnier Flat Iron Spray for over a year now because it keeps my hair pin straight and frizz free.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair feel very silky and smooth once I&#x27;ve used it with either my flat iron of hair dryer.</li>
            <li>crinkles)...even though my great flat iron already eliminated that issue by 90%+, this pushed smoothness to 99%...425-430F using Red Pro Silicone Protection flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This product is extremely drying and seemed to do more damage than protecting.</li>
            <li>This spray shortens that time and protects my hair without leaving it greasy or oily like most other straightening and protective products.</li>
            <li>so I never use anything for the body, but I was hoping it will be better for the hair as the other reviews said</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to decide if it actually make a significant difference...</li>
            <li>I put this on my subscribe and save because it is a good product, it is rather inexpensive compared to other flat iron perfectors, and I want to protect my hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair super smooth, straight, and less frizzy!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this product isn&#x27;t a miracle, it simply protects hair strands from  breakage and split ends and reduces frizz nicely, it hasn&#x27;t left my hair soft or silky at all, really.</li>
            <li>I guess the alcohol that need to vaporize before you use your hot iron did this as it will dry the hair out , if you  go for bone straight and without bounce go for it , i like to straighten  my wavy hair  and add some big curls at the end for more bouncing volume</li>
            <li>And afterwards, my hair is smooth and shiny all day long.</li>
            <li>Normally my hair doesn&#x27;t get too straight and by the end of the day it becomes wavy again.</li>
            <li>My hair has not dried out at all thanks to this!</li>
            <li>At first this product made my hair really soft</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d probably re purchase since it&#x27;s decently priced.</li>
            <li>I am glad to say it does not have that greasy feeling either which happened a few times when I used too much Biosilk.  </li>
            <li>Works better than products marketed towards african american hair.</li>
            <li>The main ingredient in this product is alcohol and it will burn your hair.</li>
            <li>The spray smells nice, but I actually think it&#x27;s sometimes harder to straighten my hair when I spray it in.</li>
            <li>best part, my hair dont get frizzy and it dont have that hard flat look that it used to when i used to flat iron my hair without this protector</li>
            <li>, I use it only on the lower part of my 22inch long hair and not on top, the top is still soft and silky but the ends feel dry what was not the case before using this product</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it for someone who uses heat appliances on their hair often.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommended this product to friends.</li>
            <li>Also, it has lasted for a super long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much at all, spray it, comb through, blow dry then flat iron it, so easy!</li>
            <li>I use it on soft, silky &amp; straight.  </li>
            <li>this is totally worth the $4 and will last me a while.</li>
            <li>It last for a long time as well. :)</li>
            <li>I just love Garnier Fructis style sleek and shine flat iron Perfector as my hair is always shiny and clean looking at all times and no more frizzy hair for me.</li>
            <li>My daughter dumped out this brand new bottle</li>
            <li>and I was in need of a new heat protecter.</li>
            <li>Mines normal/curly hair, and it&#x27;s humid where I live.</li>
            <li>So make sure u blow dry then use your flat</li>
            <li>This heat protectant is amazing, it makes my hair so soft and shiny, and it protects my extremely thick african long hair from heat damage, I love this stuff, it also helps with getting my hair bone straight, especially when combined with the anti frizz serum and comb and chase method.</li>
            <li>Do not flat iron from the root of the scalp at first.</li>
            <li>Well let me tell you, after I used this product my hair has been so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff &amp; used it in the past.</li>
            <li>It was so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>Strong, 5.1 Oz (2 Pack)]] and blow dried.</li>
            <li>but I use it sparingly because flat irons are so hot already.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I still have my old, empty bottle of heat protectant spray, so I can just pour this into that one.</li>
            <li>Blow dry, color, flat iron and my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>Using this with the new flat iron I bought, changed so much for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair not frizzy when naturally it is.</li>
            <li>It also keeps my hair from frizzing too much, especially when it&#x27;s really humid.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>naturally curly.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is because it sometimes makes hair oily, if used too much</li>
            <li>and I would have to retouch it, but this prodict kept my hair straight through two nights and two days at school, and it may be even longer, but I don&#x27;t know because this is the second day I have it on.</li>
            <li>At least it&#x27;s better for the environment.  </li>
            <li>Works well on my 7 year old daughters wavy/curly hair that I straighten sometimes.</li>
            <li>It makes your&lt;br /&gt;hair feel silky and soft and shine while it protects your hair from heat 48hrs.</li>
            <li>well i guess i can&#x27;t really tell if it is actually protecting my hair from the heat</li>
            <li>This helps protect hair from heat damage and leaves hair silky soft</li>
            <li>so couldn&#x27;t wash my hair for almost a week which was gross but at least it stayed straight and frizz free the whole time</li>
            <li>No water and no added products outside of the recommended on the package, and you might have all-day straight results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now i am knocking out A LOT of Christmas shopping early &amp; i am buying this for my tween daughter.</li>
            <li>I do use leave in conditoners to make my hair soft.</li>
            <li>It was as soft after I used it as it was before I sprayed it on.</li>
            <li>The only flaw is that the spray/pump thing to get the product out doesn&#x27;t distribute it very evenly, so i would suggest to brush or comb your hair after spraying it on your hair/before straightening.</li>
            <li>My hair is very managable and even getting it&#x27;s shine back.</li>
            <li>I feel that whether or not I use it, doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference, especially with frizz.</li>
            <li>No hair was in my comb and it mixed very when with my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This spray definitely does it job in keeping your hair straight and protected from heat, but the bottle I got has a defective spray nozzle.</li>
            <li>Helped me to straighten my naturally curly 4a hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft and shiny all day.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Maybe their products just don&#x27;t work we&#x27;ll with my hair type (thick, naturally wavy/straight, healthy, never colored or dyed).</li>
            <li>it did okay on her hair her hair is really, really thick</li>
            <li>Use this everyday when flat ironing , keeps hair straight and frizz free</li>
            <li>The smell is just fantastic, but once on my hair, after ironing, it makes it feel stiff.</li>
            <li>With naturally wavy hair, I use a flat iron for straight locks.</li>
            <li>I think adding a few drops of oil and then flat ironing your hair yields way better results than this spray.</li>
            <li>It works really well with flat irons but not with curling irons.</li>
            <li>This product really works to protect the hair from flat iron use.  </li>
            <li>One thing I do use however is the flat iron and as you know it can be very damaging.</li>
            <li>I spray it before I flat iron it, and my haur stays straight all day.</li>
            <li>Totally would recommend this product if your hair spends a lot of time under high temperatures.</li>
            <li>This is the only flat iron protector I use, I have tried many for very expensive to very cheap</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you use the Garnier Blow Dry Perfector before applying this spray...mainly if you have very curly hair that you are flat ironing.  </li>
            <li>REALLY REALLY well with the blow dry cream.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of spraying a bit of this on my hair while dry, thinking it would give my hair a burst of moisture - as my hair was frizzing a bit, and my hair parched up really</li>
            <li>is any straightening i do with my hair in the near or far future.</li>
            <li>hair is straightened just as quickly and as flat without so not sure what it really does for your hair</li>
            <li>In fact, it left my pretty dry after I straightened it.</li>
            <li>I refuse to go out in public with my natural hair</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but also gets very dry in the winter, especially since I blow dry and flat iron just about every day.</li>
            <li>I can feel it when I touch up a spot and don&#x27;t spray this down first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little stickier than I&#x27;d like, but better than some of the other similar products.</li>
            <li>I can condition it all day long but the frizz and dryness really shows up after I flat iron.</li>
            <li>Usually my hair gets damaged quickly.</li>
            <li>Your hair will get frizzy if you are in a place with high humidity(I would recommend looking for a different brand) but it will stand up to places with low or moderate humidity.</li>
            <li>The reason I knocked of a star is because you do have to spray it on every strand you straighten, or at least of them, and it took me a while to straighten, but it was worth it!</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair sleek, shiny and soft even before flat ironing it.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve never found anything that works for 48 hours other than re-straightening - but it DOES keep your hair straight all day (even if the weather doesn&#x27;t feel like cooperating).</li>
            <li>Other than that, I don&#x27;t really have any complaints.</li>
            <li>really protects because my hair doesn&#x27;t smell burnt or feel dry after i flat iron</li>
            <li>I have very dry, wavy hair that is frizzy unless I curl it with a large barrel curling iron or straighten it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>When I got home I was shocked to see my hair looking as great as when I left.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work on African American natural hair.</li>
            <li>The alcohol did not dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>Big fan of Garnier Fructis products here and bought this to use with the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li>the first few times i used it.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of other alternatives to this product whose main ingredient consist of water not alcohol.</li>
            <li>, it left my hair dry and my hair felt kinda sticky and it didn&#x27;t calm down my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair smell weird and it doesnt feel nice and soft afterwords like it does when I use other products for straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>So far, it works as described and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling too dry.</li>
            <li>, the other issue that I had with this thing is that however it dries, it really screwed up my flat iron.</li>
            <li>well i washed my hair, then pour a lil bit of garnier blow dry perfector balm then blow dried my hair, i could tell the difference right away from when i didn&#x27;t use the product and blow drying it, it was almost straight and less frizz , my hair is naturally wavy and gets curly after i shower it and leave it to dry by itself.....</li>
            <li>My hair ended up looking more dry and just.. worse.</li>
            <li>It seems to make my hair a little crunchy sometimes, probably just when I spray too much in one spot.</li>
            <li>and i live in Mississippi where its extremely humid.</li>
            <li>It has good stuff in it, but it also has bad stuff in it (like alcohol).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The product is wonderful, it works very well on my hair and it arrived in an exceptional amount of time.</li>
            <li> Works really great on my hair, but it does leave a very mild greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> The argon oil is really amazing for your hair.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing though, i can give it that.</li>
            <li> It also smells amazing.</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t make it out to be something amazing.</li>
            <li> And lets not forget it smells amazing</li>
            <li> Today it was warm and I took my son to the park.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, too.</li>
            <li> In addition, it leaves a nice smell on my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice product and nice packing.</li>
            <li> and it don&#x27;t has a nice smell</li>

            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny and smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> I love how this spray leaves a nice shine on my hair,  It can also be used even when you aren&#x27;t straightening in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels so soft and looks great!</li>
            <li> is the best hair product i bought so far...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than the smell though, I&#x27;m not so sure about how effective this product is.</li>

            <li> Amazing and sooooooo adorable smell</li>
            <li> love love love!</li>
            <li> first time using this lovev the results great product</li>
            <li> I was in the store and quickly picked this out because it smells good.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice but too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I felt this really helped me flatten my hair quickly, but that&#x27;s not even the best part.</li>
            <li> Friends that have thicker hair love it</li>
            <li> I like Garnier products and am glad I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair smell.</li>
            <li> Made curling the hair a lot more manageable.</li>
            <li> keeps hair smooth and shiny after  blow drying !</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it:D</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Garnier products</li>
            <li> Love the sleek and shine.</li>
            <li> I also love that when I use it, my hair stays straightened or curled all day.</li>
            <li> I usually love Garnier products</li>
            <li> I feel this dries out my hair more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it works for people.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many heat styling sprays but none of them help.</li>
            <li> Just okay.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I love just about all products that Garnier comes out with</li>
            <li> I will purchase more and more and more and more and more etc etc....</li>
            <li> I tend to be a perfectionist, so I&#x27;m quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Overwhelming alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> Time for her to enjoy it too!</li>
            <li> I love garnier products</li>
            <li> I love Garnier Fructis products and</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and healthy looking without that greasy look.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> but I am sure it might work for some.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t seem to be able to buy this in the UK</li>
            <li> okay, i have never been a fan of Garneir Fructis</li>
            <li> This stuff is alright, I suppose, any protection from heat tools is better than none.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i use this to restyle my synthetic heat safe wigs.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> but I think I should have purchased a better heat protectant.</li>
            <li> but I was told a spray heat protectant would be much better</li>
            <li> exactly sure what this is suppose to do because it does not do what it says it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> Will purchase again when I need more.</li>
            <li> It works for the most part.</li>
            <li> I bought this mostly because it was on sale.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for about 2 weeks and love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> If you have more than 15 minutes it&#x27;ll do a phenomenal job.</li>
            <li> This product is okay</li>
            <li> Ive started straightening my hair more often</li>
            <li> more than if i were to just straighten my hair without product.</li>
            <li> and I was able to do this with this product.</li>
            <li> Product is OK, but it seems to make my hair somewhat oily.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> Amazon gladly issued me a refund.</li>
            <li> Since all the sites says to use a protector, I decided on fructis (love the shampoo and conditioner too)  </li>
            <li> and my hair looks healthy again.</li>
            <li> (: i love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I normally love the smell of Garner Fructis products but this one is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> But it protects my hair and makes it healthy after styling it, which is what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Straightened ok.</li>
            <li> Very effective for getting my hair straight quicker</li>
            <li> It flat irons hair well and smells great!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome for my frizzy hair, after flat ironing I apply it</li>
            <li> frizzes at the first drop of sweat or rain, and this keeps my hair looking smooth and great all day.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all great products and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair looked very soft and healthy which was great because i had to take a yearbook picture.</li>
            <li> Very glad i bout this, was worth my three dollars</li>
            <li> If you already have dry hair, then this is probably not going to be the best product for you.</li>
            <li> First of all it smells amazing, and second it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Just a light spritz through the hair before using curling/flat iron and it leaves my hair looking shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and its a good price for a decent size bottle and it delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and would recommend it to anyome who want s a very good flat iron spray for cheap.</li>
            <li> I used this the other day before I shoveled the driveway and when I came inside my hair still looked perfect.</li>
            <li> but nope , i expected failure , i think siliconmix diluted with water is still my best option for perfect hair ( my own idea )</li>
            <li> I have a mix wavy and curly hair that dries easily.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and frizz free; smells great also.</li>
            <li> (my hair ends up still wavy and like straw), but when I use pre-straightener, my hair stays sleek and straight all day (unless it&#x27;s exceptionally humid</li>
            <li> Not too strong of a scent.</li>
            <li> If your looking for something that&#x27;d make your hair smooth, frizz free, soft and smelling great, try something else.</li>
            <li> but it makes you smell like a sweet flower :))</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Very good and works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in the shine and softness of my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, doesn&#x27;t  help much with frizzy hair</li>
            <li> make my hair look fabulous.</li>
            <li> I dint know if it&#x27;s the amount that is in this product or just that it&#x27;s cheaply made , but I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this received such great reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why I don&#x27;t find it in my nearby supermarkets, but I was happy to find it as an add on item at a low price, bought two of them!</li>
            <li> Instead of being smooth on my hair it comes out of the bottle sticky and gummy.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this to everyone that needs a great heat spray.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is cheap, worked well with my CHI straightener, and added shine.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for straightening and does not make your hair heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> With this produce, my hair does not have that silky smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel shiny and smooth and i luvvvv the smell.</li>
            <li> 15 min is not enough) - it does a great job of taming everything.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s not sticky at all and your hair feels and looks smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> great product will definitely get it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, glad to know others had success.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st time to use this lotion and I found it light and straighten my frizzy hair in seconds.</li>
            <li> and it does a good job on natural hair.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much!!!</li>
            <li> So it is really important that you clean it off when you are done.</li>
            <li> new line is nothing short of awesome.</li>
            <li> makes my hair so glossy and soft and easy to straighten and it smells nice too!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also contains alcohol denat which I&#x27;m pretty sure it drying to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well but the overwhelming smell of alcohol....</li>
            <li> At first I fell in love, it had that unmistakeable Fructis smell, after a couple hair straightenings that smell begin almost intolerable, it was so obnoxious.</li>
            <li> As long as I used Biosilk in moderation, my hair felt great afterward.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straighten my hair on a daily basis, but the spray is wonderful for preventing static in my hair, keeping it sleek and shiny all day into the next day while not making my hair oily.</li>
            <li> Smells great all day long though!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have many lumps from sleeping and its SO shiny and soft that I can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li> Ok, here&#x27;s the thing: I love this product because it protects my hair and it makes my hair really shiny and soft:)</li>
            <li> Nothing too special</li>
            <li> The price is just right as well!  </li>
            <li> Right off the bat I was happy with how this product protected my hair from the heat of my flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how you can make frizzy natural curly hair so relaxed with out having to have it</li>
            <li> Overall, though, a good product.</li>
            <li> I really dont like it and don&#x27;t recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product at this price.</li>
            <li> A spritz on top of this caused it to really curl up.  </li>
            <li> it keeps my hair straight and feeling healthy and non greasy.</li>
            <li> It seems like maybe if I used a whole load if it, the heat protection would come into play more.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find a product that gets my hair as straight as this does at ANY price.</li>
            <li> This product leaves hair shiny and bright but after flat ironing it leaves hair sticky and causes hair to have split ends.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, just like every other straightener product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It smelled good going on, but it did not protect against the burnt hair smell from the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> WHO LOVED TO FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> It does a good job when using a flat iron, although my hair can get thick in between cuts and it doesn&#x27;t work too great with thicker parts, I have to spray way more.</li>
            <li> The first one was fine</li>
            <li> It evaporates quickly into my hair.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give me the sleek, Hollywood hair that more expensive products do, but it does its best.</li>
            <li> Its good and keeps the hair straight and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hot and humid here in TN, so I&#x27;ll do a follow-up on how my hair held up after a day of running around tomorrow.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that feels light &amp; airy on your hair, not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> It gives you that totally perfectly straight hair look easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much protection it provides, but the straightening/lasting aspect is great!</li>
            <li> Now I can go almost a full week with some dry shampoo because the straigtening mist and flat iron make it perfect to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple in the past that made my hair look really oily and smell like I just got a perm, but this one has that fruity fresh smell just like their shampoos and hair spray and when you heat it up with the straightener it makes your hair smell delicious all day.</li>
            <li> but now my hair feels more damage and more dry as well</li>
            <li> more days after visiting the hair salon :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: After spraying on dry hair, your hair will clump (that&#x27;s why i gave it 4 stars)</li>
            <li> My hair was becoming very dry and breaking very easily.</li>
            <li> Garnier makes a wonderful product will continue to use as long as I am using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and makes her hair and the extensions silky smooth with out adding too much shine.</li>
            <li> iron spray and Smooth intense serum.  </li>
            <li> I get smooth, shiny, straight hair every time.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair really shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> She uses this on her own hair as well as her human hair extensions</li>
            <li> The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that many of the professional products use an aerosol spray so it goes on evenly, whereas this is a pump.  </li>
            <li> It has a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence to be honest, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this product a second time.</li>
            <li> I kinda always felt like I was all thumbs straightening my hair until I found this stuff and at $3 it&#x27;s really worth</li>
            <li> I love it and cannot say enough good things about it- especially for the price!</li>
            <li> found the only way this works and leaves my hair nice is by air drying.</li>
            <li> The fine mist is not too heavy for my fine hair, smells amazing, and gives me a smooth and easy flat ironing job.</li>
            <li> It is also AMAZING protector gainst flat irons</li>
            <li> Works great and it really does keep your hair straight for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I ironed right after spraying this as the directions don&#x27;t warn against that.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I sprayed it in my hair, I felt the texture change right away.</li>
            <li> I spray it right before blow drying</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of money finding the right thing for me , Garnier Fructis products was creating allergic reactions to my skin  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of protecting my hair from the high temperature of my flat iron, as well as keeping my hair straight and shiny.  </li>
            <li> But it works and keeps my hair pretty straight and frizz free.</li>
            <li> BUT if I use too much of this spray my clean hair will immediately look greasy.</li>
            <li> nice shine, lasting curls, or sleek straight.</li>
            <li> Works very well on  with my flat iron and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and it leaves my hair a little softer when I use it.</li>
            <li> Technically you should be doing that anyway, but it is super important if you are going to extend the life of your styling products, you clean this stuff off in particular.</li>
            <li> Does exactly that.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well for me - I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used a product like this.</li>
            <li> The smell is also pretty pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Moreover, the first ingredient is alcohol, and it seems like that&#x27;s what its made up of 100 percent.</li>
            <li> the first time i used it i saw the difference, so shine and silky</li>
            <li> I do not feel like my hair is being protected, and it does not make my hair any more shinier/straighter than the next hair product.</li>
            <li> So I discovered this by Garnier and it has totally helped my hair, bringing it make to a healthy look.  </li>
            <li> , the hair looks pretty and shine in the beginning and even curls up</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually does a better job at protecting your hair from the heat since this is the first heat protectant I have ever bought, but it does straighten.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I like this because it works well, and it is pretty affordable.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it gets the job done and keeps my hair nice and straight all day long.</li>
            <li> more then it actually &#x27;protected&#x27; it.</li>
            <li> My scalp was very clean, I didn&#x27;t feel and buildup from this product and my curls came back with a vengence!</li>
            <li> Maybe there is some kind of effect they are trying to get, but there are many other flat iron sprays that don&#x27;t have alcohol in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love the flat iron spray.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to creative stuff with your flat iron like me though, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> The hair stays perfect the whole day when I use it before straightening, and on the second day I usually only have a couple spots (if any) to hit with the flat iron again.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> She is bi-racial, and this product really keeps her hair smooth, soft and under control when we use the flat-iron.</li>
            <li> It definitely keeps my hair straight, and styled, but with regards to protecting my hair from the heat, I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li> Okay, I am not sure though, the smell is strong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it makes my hair particularly shinier, but It&#x27;s all right for what it does.</li>
            <li> Adds nice shine to hair and hair feels soft after I use this with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> , it was really straight and looked better than ever, i&#x27;m not a big fan of blow drying my hair but with these two products combine it really works and</li>
            <li> It was amazing how my ends laid down</li>
            <li> Until then, I&#x27;m very pleased, especially for the price of $4 bucks from my local Target!</li>
            <li> My hair has a mild natural wave, and I do have hair color in it as well.  </li>
            <li> it will dry even more</li>
            <li> But the Garnier shampoo and conditioner certainly helped to reduce or eliminate the C shape and some of the frizz versus using the cream and spray alone.  </li>
            <li> but for a first it&#x27;s doing a decent job</li>
            <li> This product is especially perfect if you have 15 minutes to get your hair straight (be realistic please, if your hair is suuuper long or thick</li>
            <li> It does smell good, but when I flat ironed with it, my hair was dry like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and it makes our hair absolutely amazing if used correctly.  </li>
            <li> : Its a lightweight formula and leaves your hair frizz free and straight for the entire day.</li>
            <li> when I straighten it each day it doesn&#x27;t stay perfectly straight, which drives me nuts.</li>
            <li> I straightened my hair and it looked really straight.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really keep up with time</li>
            <li> It really does protect -</li>
            <li> it works really well.</li>
            <li> I recommend it if you need it and it does help hold for the whole day.</li>
            <li> This heat protector actually protects my hair and keeps it smooth &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> It also made my hair feel very straw like.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky and straight</li>
            <li> It was really alcohol-y</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care so much for it</li>
            <li> I really like this spray.</li>
            <li> Was much cheaper than purchasing in the store, plus saved me a trip out of the house.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference when using pre-blowdry</li>
            <li> But , don&#x27;t know how much protection it gives from the heat of the straightner</li>
            <li> Makes the blow drying process so much easier.</li>
            <li> Its very lightweight</li>
            <li> straight the hair well on the lowest setting of my Instyler</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really like the string fumes it has.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair straight for longer</li>
            <li> This spray really holds your style all day if you use it before straightening.</li>
            <li> I have fairly straight hair, but it tends to frizz and look unkempt if it&#x27;s humid, rains or snows.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Hair gets really straight and very shiny.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to try the straight look for awhile</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely astounded at how it made my ends look.  </li>
            <li> very much&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m on day three now and my hair is still perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this</li>
            <li> It helps prevent to much damage to your hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves a good smell and if  any conditioner (including cheaper brands such as white rain) is used before hand , hair stays soft.</li>
            <li> So helpful it keeps my hair nice n shiny last me the entire day with no frizz</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to Tresemme or make my own in the future.</li>
            <li> I find that it is a good detangler when my hair is wet, and if I spray it enough on damp hair, I can let my hair air-dry without any frizzies.</li>
            <li> This product do what it promise , it is just not what I was looking for exactly , if your hair are little oily it will be best to use also on course Asian or Latino hair, if your hair are dry skip it ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Garnier Flat Iron Spray for over a year now because it keeps my hair pin straight and frizz free.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair feel very silky and smooth once I&#x27;ve used it with either my flat iron of hair dryer.</li>
            <li> crinkles)...even though my great flat iron already eliminated that issue by 90%+, this pushed smoothness to 99%...425-430F using Red Pro Silicone Protection flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This product is extremely drying and seemed to do more damage than protecting.</li>
            <li> This spray shortens that time and protects my hair without leaving it greasy or oily like most other straightening and protective products.</li>
            <li> so I never use anything for the body, but I was hoping it will be better for the hair as the other reviews said</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to decide if it actually make a significant difference...</li>
            <li> I put this on my subscribe and save because it is a good product, it is rather inexpensive compared to other flat iron perfectors, and I want to protect my hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair super smooth, straight, and less frizzy!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this product isn&#x27;t a miracle, it simply protects hair strands from  breakage and split ends and reduces frizz nicely, it hasn&#x27;t left my hair soft or silky at all, really.</li>
            <li> I guess the alcohol that need to vaporize before you use your hot iron did this as it will dry the hair out , if you  go for bone straight and without bounce go for it , i like to straighten  my wavy hair  and add some big curls at the end for more bouncing volume</li>
            <li> And afterwards, my hair is smooth and shiny all day long.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair doesn&#x27;t get too straight and by the end of the day it becomes wavy again.</li>
            <li> My hair has not dried out at all thanks to this!</li>
            <li> At first this product made my hair really soft</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d probably re purchase since it&#x27;s decently priced.</li>
            <li> I am glad to say it does not have that greasy feeling either which happened a few times when I used too much Biosilk.  </li>
            <li> Works better than products marketed towards african american hair.</li>
            <li> The main ingredient in this product is alcohol and it will burn your hair.</li>
            <li> The spray smells nice, but I actually think it&#x27;s sometimes harder to straighten my hair when I spray it in.</li>
            <li> best part, my hair dont get frizzy and it dont have that hard flat look that it used to when i used to flat iron my hair without this protector</li>
            <li> , I use it only on the lower part of my 22inch long hair and not on top, the top is still soft and silky but the ends feel dry what was not the case before using this product</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it for someone who uses heat appliances on their hair often.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommended this product to friends.</li>
            <li> Also, it has lasted for a super long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much at all, spray it, comb through, blow dry then flat iron it, so easy!</li>
            <li> I use it on soft, silky &amp; straight.  </li>
            <li> this is totally worth the $4 and will last me a while.</li>
            <li> It last for a long time as well. :)</li>
            <li> I just love Garnier Fructis style sleek and shine flat iron Perfector as my hair is always shiny and clean looking at all times and no more frizzy hair for me.</li>
            <li> My daughter dumped out this brand new bottle</li>
            <li> and I was in need of a new heat protecter.</li>
            <li> Mines normal/curly hair, and it&#x27;s humid where I live.</li>
            <li> So make sure u blow dry then use your flat</li>
            <li> This heat protectant is amazing, it makes my hair so soft and shiny, and it protects my extremely thick african long hair from heat damage, I love this stuff, it also helps with getting my hair bone straight, especially when combined with the anti frizz serum and comb and chase method.</li>
            <li> Do not flat iron from the root of the scalp at first.</li>
            <li> Well let me tell you, after I used this product my hair has been so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff &amp; used it in the past.</li>
            <li> It was so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> Strong, 5.1 Oz (2 Pack)]] and blow dried.</li>
            <li> but I use it sparingly because flat irons are so hot already.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I still have my old, empty bottle of heat protectant spray, so I can just pour this into that one.</li>
            <li> Blow dry, color, flat iron and my hair is fine.</li>
            <li> Using this with the new flat iron I bought, changed so much for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair not frizzy when naturally it is.</li>
            <li> It also keeps my hair from frizzing too much, especially when it&#x27;s really humid.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> naturally curly.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is because it sometimes makes hair oily, if used too much</li>
            <li> and I would have to retouch it, but this prodict kept my hair straight through two nights and two days at school, and it may be even longer, but I don&#x27;t know because this is the second day I have it on.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s better for the environment.  </li>
            <li> Works well on my 7 year old daughters wavy/curly hair that I straighten sometimes.</li>
            <li> It makes your&lt;br /&gt;hair feel silky and soft and shine while it protects your hair from heat 48hrs.</li>
            <li> well i guess i can&#x27;t really tell if it is actually protecting my hair from the heat</li>
            <li> This helps protect hair from heat damage and leaves hair silky soft</li>
            <li> so couldn&#x27;t wash my hair for almost a week which was gross but at least it stayed straight and frizz free the whole time</li>
            <li> No water and no added products outside of the recommended on the package, and you might have all-day straight results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now i am knocking out A LOT of Christmas shopping early &amp; i am buying this for my tween daughter.</li>
            <li> I do use leave in conditoners to make my hair soft.</li>
            <li> It was as soft after I used it as it was before I sprayed it on.</li>
            <li> The only flaw is that the spray/pump thing to get the product out doesn&#x27;t distribute it very evenly, so i would suggest to brush or comb your hair after spraying it on your hair/before straightening.</li>
            <li> My hair is very managable and even getting it&#x27;s shine back.</li>
            <li> I feel that whether or not I use it, doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference, especially with frizz.</li>
            <li> No hair was in my comb and it mixed very when with my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This spray definitely does it job in keeping your hair straight and protected from heat, but the bottle I got has a defective spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> Helped me to straighten my naturally curly 4a hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft and shiny all day.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Maybe their products just don&#x27;t work we&#x27;ll with my hair type (thick, naturally wavy/straight, healthy, never colored or dyed).</li>
            <li> it did okay on her hair her hair is really, really thick</li>
            <li> Use this everyday when flat ironing , keeps hair straight and frizz free</li>
            <li> The smell is just fantastic, but once on my hair, after ironing, it makes it feel stiff.</li>
            <li> With naturally wavy hair, I use a flat iron for straight locks.</li>
            <li> I think adding a few drops of oil and then flat ironing your hair yields way better results than this spray.</li>
            <li> It works really well with flat irons but not with curling irons.</li>
            <li> This product really works to protect the hair from flat iron use.  </li>
            <li> One thing I do use however is the flat iron and as you know it can be very damaging.</li>
            <li> I spray it before I flat iron it, and my haur stays straight all day.</li>
            <li> Totally would recommend this product if your hair spends a lot of time under high temperatures.</li>
            <li> This is the only flat iron protector I use, I have tried many for very expensive to very cheap</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you use the Garnier Blow Dry Perfector before applying this spray...mainly if you have very curly hair that you are flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> REALLY REALLY well with the blow dry cream.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of spraying a bit of this on my hair while dry, thinking it would give my hair a burst of moisture - as my hair was frizzing a bit, and my hair parched up really</li>
            <li> is any straightening i do with my hair in the near or far future.</li>
            <li> hair is straightened just as quickly and as flat without so not sure what it really does for your hair</li>
            <li> In fact, it left my pretty dry after I straightened it.</li>
            <li> I refuse to go out in public with my natural hair</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but also gets very dry in the winter, especially since I blow dry and flat iron just about every day.</li>
            <li> I can feel it when I touch up a spot and don&#x27;t spray this down first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little stickier than I&#x27;d like, but better than some of the other similar products.</li>
            <li> I can condition it all day long but the frizz and dryness really shows up after I flat iron.</li>
            <li> Usually my hair gets damaged quickly.</li>
            <li> Your hair will get frizzy if you are in a place with high humidity(I would recommend looking for a different brand) but it will stand up to places with low or moderate humidity.</li>
            <li> The reason I knocked of a star is because you do have to spray it on every strand you straighten, or at least of them, and it took me a while to straighten, but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair sleek, shiny and soft even before flat ironing it.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve never found anything that works for 48 hours other than re-straightening - but it DOES keep your hair straight all day (even if the weather doesn&#x27;t feel like cooperating).</li>
            <li> Other than that, I don&#x27;t really have any complaints.</li>
            <li> really protects because my hair doesn&#x27;t smell burnt or feel dry after i flat iron</li>
            <li> I have very dry, wavy hair that is frizzy unless I curl it with a large barrel curling iron or straighten it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> When I got home I was shocked to see my hair looking as great as when I left.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on African American natural hair.</li>
            <li> The alcohol did not dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> Big fan of Garnier Fructis products here and bought this to use with the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> the first few times i used it.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other alternatives to this product whose main ingredient consist of water not alcohol.</li>
            <li> , it left my hair dry and my hair felt kinda sticky and it didn&#x27;t calm down my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair smell weird and it doesnt feel nice and soft afterwords like it does when I use other products for straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> So far, it works as described and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling too dry.</li>
            <li> , the other issue that I had with this thing is that however it dries, it really screwed up my flat iron.</li>
            <li> well i washed my hair, then pour a lil bit of garnier blow dry perfector balm then blow dried my hair, i could tell the difference right away from when i didn&#x27;t use the product and blow drying it, it was almost straight and less frizz , my hair is naturally wavy and gets curly after i shower it and leave it to dry by itself.....</li>
            <li> My hair ended up looking more dry and just.. worse.</li>
            <li> It seems to make my hair a little crunchy sometimes, probably just when I spray too much in one spot.</li>
            <li> and i live in Mississippi where its extremely humid.</li>
            <li> It has good stuff in it, but it also has bad stuff in it (like alcohol).</li>
            <li> i have very long thick wavy hair and this product keeps my hair shiny and smooth all day long after i straighten it</li>
            <li> It definitely made the flat ironed hair look straighter</li>
            <li> I bought this product several months ago when I bought my flat iron.</li>
            <li> but then after couple of hours the hair become bone straight and have to just brush them often to not looks stick together and even little fizzy on the back, the hair also feel dry</li>
            <li> The Garnier Fructis Style Sleek &amp; Shine Flat Iron Perfector works for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Then you follow it up by passing the flat iron or whatever you are using on your hair.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often flat iron my hair except for when it&#x27;s time for a trim</li>
            <li> i got it with my remington flat iron and this two combined</li>
            <li> I used this to flat iron - switching from tresemme as a trial.</li>
            <li> I can finally let my hair grow out long because this stuff prevents split ends, it makes my hair soo shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> and I get that flat, shinny look.</li>
            <li> I tried it once without a flat iron and just blow drying, and could not see any results.</li>
            <li> Saying that, yes, it has reduced frizz and split ends and breakage from the flat iron, so I&#x27;m thankful for that.</li>
            <li> This flat iron perfector straightener sucked.</li>
            <li> It works well with a blow drier as well - for those days you want to give your  hair a rest from the flat iron.</li>
            <li> So I thought I&#x27;d try this out as a prep for my hair after blow drying but before flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Flat Iron Perfector spray may work well</li>
            <li> used to have to spend about an hour flat</li>
            <li> I would rather use the chi flat iron spray instead.</li>
            <li> When I flat iron my own hair (as opposed to going to the salon), it usually kinks up at least a little the next day.</li>
            <li> No girl should flat iron her hair without using some sort of flat iron protector!</li>
            <li> Not enough to feel weighed down or affect styling, but if I go more than a day without washing my hair after using this it can feel a little icky.</li>
            <li> So now I know just how important this stuff is for your hair before flat ironing because I was sadly making the big mistake of not protecting my hair before ironing it, I burnt my bangs!</li>
            <li> my only complaint is my hair never stays straight.</li>
            <li> I have never liked any of Garnier&#x27;s products as they leave my superfine blond hair feeling heavy and looking oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a complete mess after this product.</li>
            <li> I like this (the flat iron spray, the morroccan oil treatment and the blow dry cream.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and lifeless after using this product withy my flat iron</li>
            <li> it left my hair rough feeling...will not will buying it again...</li>
            <li> Her hair is not nearly as damaged as before.</li>
            <li> and it takes twice as long to re-straighten it.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product as long as Garnier continues to sell it.</li>
            <li> COMPLETE SHIT.</li>
            <li> I have used this product multiple times when straightening my hair and have not really noticed a difference in the finished result.</li>
            <li> My hair is long.. damaged.. split..</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not quite enough to protect my tips (which I expected)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have really frizzy, wavy, and thick hair.</li>
            <li> Will recommend it for flat ironing hair, but do be careful because the heat it radiates hurts like hell on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the product for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it takes away all frizz, if dry hair isnt a problem for you then this is your jam</li>
            <li> My hair stayed dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> It turns dry, lifeless, and gets lots of split ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my sister and me, leaves the hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> This stuff will dry your hair out over time.</li>
            <li> and my hair had never felt so dry and hay like.</li>
            <li> It can also leave your hair dry and it can feel like straw after so</li>
            <li> if I keep my hair mostly dry.</li>
            <li> I use it every single time I straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been reading about hair protectors due to me flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it was just not good enough , but i will use it sometime for the only straight look but only sometimes as I am afraid it will dry to much my hair when I use to often</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very curly hair that always takes an incredibly long time to straighten.</li>
            <li> The directions say that you need to mist it over 2-inch wide sections of dry hair.</li>
            <li> On the bottle it recommends spraying in while wet and blow dry then</li>
            <li> but my hair feels rough and dry.</li>
            <li> on wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have very very dry hair</li>
            <li> , my hair are very dry from nature</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I get a C shape or a loose S shape to my hair length if the strand is wet.  </li>
            <li> This helped with frizz only a little.  </li>
            <li> but the trick is to spray it and give it a few seconds to dry before flat ironing.</li>
            <li> plus it stays like that all day long!!!</li>
            <li> and as expected</li>
            <li> But I guess I should have expected that- since it&#x27;s a Garnier product.</li>
            <li> My ends have old color (or lack of) from bleaching that I&#x27;ve been slowly getting rid of with trims.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry thin and frizzy and usually when i blow dry my hair the next day it looks absolutely horrible.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It helps with straightening sometimes when I&#x27;m too lazy to blow dry my hair properly</li>
            <li> I try to straighten my hair as little as possible but when I do, I use the lowest heat setting and only straighten each section no more than 2, 3 times max.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the only problem is that if you apply it to make a too thin layer, your style wouldn&#x27;t last that long in humidity.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> then after i blow dried it i sprayed some garnier style sleepk shine flat iron perfector and straighten my hair</li>
            <li> Wow it seriously works.</li>
            <li> Usually my hair is really soft and a bit fluffy (wavy and curly).</li>
            <li> Another stylist, years later, is telling me the Biosilk is not good and probably caused some of my recent split ends...</li>
            <li> I also found a little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have tries so many heat protecting sprays and most of them make my hair feel weird and nasty, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super thin, but it isn&#x27;t thick either.</li>
            <li> Reversion should be almost zero without any other products or \\&quot;treatments\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference between using this and using any other spray.</li>
            <li> I just realized last week that I would have to cut it due to my ends looking so frizzy and dead!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I hoped it would be compatible with other Garnier hair products that I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> But needed other products to work.</li>
            <li> It makes it all glossy and shiny, but it feels a little dry throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Like their previous product that was discontinued, leaves unclean feeling in hair even when using minimal amount.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel really heavy and leaves it dry.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair still was frizzy felt brittle and dry looking waste of money.</li>
            <li> and everytime after taking a shower, my bangs had the dry, crinkled, frizzy mess look!  </li>
            <li> so it does&#x27;nt weigh the hair down</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this since it was half the price of Tresemme&#x27;s heat protectant spray.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a slight brittle feel to it and even a bit knotty.</li>
            <li> Seems to keep her hair straighter and less frizzier longer than some of the others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I promise I won&#x27;t ever settle for less again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However when I did use it, I found that it was slightly sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> downside - I have slightly oily hair, so a little added dryness didn&#x27;t hurt me.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used a flat iron spray in about 2 years, because I was told that if I bought an expensive flat iron, that I didn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> I have thick dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair always looked a little shinier and smoother after using it.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you don&#x27;t use it the way it was intended it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It seemed to add a little shine but not an oily/gross look.  </li>
            <li> I even use mine as a little hair spray.  </li>
            <li> Might make it a little smoother</li>
            <li> My hair texture feels dry and hard to tame.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a pump, it can tend to go on a little heavy in spots.  </li>
            <li> dried my ends out a little, but if you have moisturizing conditioner it works.</li>
            <li> I have not used products on my hair other than shampoo and conditioner for YEARS!!  </li>
            <li> It has a weird smell, like how a shower cap smells after a while - like old, shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and it just doesn&#x27;t do anything but make your hair sticky and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few months and</li>
            <li> I have noticed a sticky residue from using it on my hair it makes it feel dried out and sticky which i dont like.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money.</li>
            <li> and I have stopped using any sort of harsh chemicals like relaxers on my hair for a while now.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I have quite a few hair products by Garnier</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look oily and feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Usually after flat ironing my hair it back to wavy and crazy within a half an hour.</li>
            <li> but this one smells like plain alcohol.</li>
            <li> It sort of made it stiff, but also greasy looking.</li>
            <li> but I do have to use something to tame the curls (also Fructis)and</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve straighten it everyday for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> This actually dries out your hair really bad and causes dry, breaking ends after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I used it on small sections in conjunction with Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Anti-Frizz Serum.</li>
            <li> I had straightened my hair at night at fell asleep on it and usually I would wake up with my hair already wavy</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job and no more.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how it would work for someone with thicker hair though.</li>
            <li> I became ill and had to go into the hospital several months ago</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the past.  </li>
            <li> The store ran out of the brand (Nexxus) I usually carry.</li>
            <li> The store was going through a rough patch that day and was poorly stocked.</li>
            <li> Garnier lives up to expectations as usual.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure how to rate this product because I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy it again.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Just spray a small amount...</li>
            <li> It had very few heat protector sprays, but it had this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid if excessive use of this product would cause a damage of my flat iron since it leaves residue on the iron.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t stay for 24 hours, even just going outside for 30 minutes and a cold fall day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m considering lobbying parliament to have it sold in the UK or at least on the UK</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled or displeased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I keep a small bottle with this in it to freshen my hair and look less scary.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this sucks!</li>
            <li> It was sticky when applied to my dry hair, which was a bad sign.</li>
            <li> Hated this, made my hair super dirty.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what some people mean by saying it makes their hair dryer, cause mine doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I ended up not liking it for my thin hair</li>
            <li> I was not happy with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible for your hair and it makes it feel like absolutely paper.</li>
            <li> hair seems to be worse since I started using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is relatively thin and wavy.</li>
            <li> Not great on my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those who straighten their hair almost everyday and is really bad about using heat protector.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this item it just ruins your hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> I hate it and its a waste</li>
            <li> I do everything wrong to my hair one can do.</li>
            <li> but until i stopped at target and picked the up because of the insane price, i never went back to my chi!</li>
            <li> This product created some insecure days for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe i am using it wrong -</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as someone as else said, it has alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I just knew it would make my hair look dirty.</li>
            <li> In desperate need I did buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointment.</li>
            <li> , I am afraid I will have a strew on my head when i woke up tomorrow in this case</li>
            <li> Immediately, I noticed the alcohol smell and a very, very faint &amp;#34;garnier&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> It dries it out and leaves nasty steamed-in residue in your hair, not good for if you want to do a 2 day style, you will wake up to crinkly crispy hair...</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I hate this one.</li>
            <li> I hate a lot of products</li>
            <li> This product was terrible and it was really disappointing for me because I use the leave in conditioner, shampoo, and conditioner all by Garnier Fructis (and</li>
            <li> but once I did I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not the worst product.</li>

            <li> This stuff is horrible for your hair.</li>
            <li> The texture immediately after applying it to my hair is horrible.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst products I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Not the worst product. It smells nice, doesn&#x27;t  help much with frizzy hair but it makes you smell like a sweet flower :))</li>
            <li> The Garnier Fructis Style Sleek &amp; Shine Flat Iron Perfector works for its intended purpose. My hair always looked a little shinier and smoother after using it.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you don&#x27;t use it the way it was intended it doesn&#x27;t work. The directions say that you need to mist it over 2-inch wide sections of dry hair. Then you follow it up by passing the flat iron or whatever you are using on your hair. Which means that you cannot go spraying it all over your hair and then flat-ironing it. It won&#x27;t work. A friend of mine told me she used it that way and it didn&#x27;t do anything for her. Ladies and gentleman, some directions are meant to be followed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the other issue that I had with this thing is that however it dries, it really screwed up my flat iron. So it is really important that you clean it off when you are done. Technically you should be doing that anyway, but it is super important if you are going to extend the life of your styling products, you clean this stuff off in particular.</li>
            <li> Product works well. I ended up not liking it for my thin hair but that is my fault. Friends that have thicker hair love it and I think it is best for their hair type.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair not frizzy when naturally it is. It leaves a good smell and if  any conditioner (including cheaper brands such as white rain) is used before hand , hair stays soft. On the bottle it recommends spraying in while wet and blow dry then straighten, I use this method and it works great! my only complaint is my hair never stays straight. Despite this it has a shine and stays un-frizzy defiantly recomend!!!</li>
            <li> I have a mix wavy and curly hair that dries easily. I usually don&#x27;t flat iron my hair but when I do I use this product. It leaves my hair soft and shiny and smells wonderful too. It also keeps my hair from frizzing too much, especially when it&#x27;s really humid.</li>
            <li> i didnt like this product. it left my hair rough feeling...will not will buying it again...do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> this stuff works! I have medium thickness so-so straight/wavy hair. when I straighten it each day it doesn&#x27;t stay perfectly straight, which drives me nuts. I saw this stuff and picked it up. Wow it seriously works. My hair looks and stays looking good all day. Today it was warm and I took my son to the park. When I got home I was shocked to see my hair looking as great as when I left. this is totally worth the $4 and will last me a while. I won&#x27;t go without this stuff now that I&#x27;ve found this gem.</li>
            <li> i have very long thick wavy hair and this product keeps my hair shiny and smooth all day long after i straighten it</li>
            <li> I am African American &amp; 3 years naturally curly. I don&#x27;t often flat iron my hair except for when it&#x27;s time for a trim and then I try to get the longest wear out of the straightened style as possible. Right off the bat I was happy with how this product protected my hair from the heat of my flat iron. I used it on small sections in conjunction with Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Anti-Frizz Serum. I would spritz a 2 inch section with the mist then apply a pea sized amount of the serum, I think this helped keep my hair from drying out from the alcohol in the mist. They straightened it better than any product I&#x27;ve used before as well as giving it incredible shine and body! It&#x27;s very hot and humid here in TN, so I&#x27;ll do a follow-up on how my hair held up after a day of running around tomorrow. Until then, I&#x27;m very pleased, especially for the price of $4 bucks from my local Target!</li>
            <li> Okay, I am not sure though, the smell is strong.</li>
            <li> Has alcohol, dries and burns my hair. Terrible product</li>
            <li> So helpful it keeps my hair nice n shiny last me the entire day with no frizz</li>
            <li> This is wonderful! I have frizzy hair that curls/frizzes at the first drop of sweat or rain, and this keeps my hair looking smooth and great all day. I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Works well in humid weather to prevent hair from frizzing up after you use a straightener on it. I also found a little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts quite a while. Nice scent, too. Priced well. I like Garnier products and am glad I gave this a try. I hate humid weather frizzies!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful. I love how it makes my hair smell. My weave wouldn&#x27;t have lasted without this. Made curling the hair a lot more manageable.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I straightened my hair and it looked really straight. Also, my hair looked very soft and healthy which was great because i had to take a yearbook picture. Normally my hair doesn&#x27;t get too straight and by the end of the day it becomes wavy again. In addition, it leaves a nice smell on my hair.</li>
            <li> keeps hair smooth and shiny after  blow drying ! Its great for all types of hairs. The only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is because it sometimes makes hair oily, if used too much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this but my daughter swears by it. She uses this on her own hair as well as her human hair extensions and she just loves it! I bought her the Chi brand and she still prefers this one. It&#x27;s affordable and makes her hair and the extensions silky smooth with out adding too much shine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on African American natural hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it all the time</li>
            <li> i got it with my remington flat iron and this two combined make my hair look fabulous. i like it</li>
            <li> Works Really Great! Keeps my hair hold, and makes my hair softer! Used it for picture day and worked great!</li>
            <li> I had this product for a while and so finally I decided to check it out. Well let me tell you, after I used this product my hair has been so soft and shiny! Never has this happened before! I had straightened my hair at night at fell asleep on it and usually I would wake up with my hair already wavy and I would have to retouch it, but this prodict kept my hair straight through two nights and two days at school, and it may be even longer, but I don&#x27;t know because this is the second day I have it on. The reason I knocked of a star is because you do have to spray it on every strand you straighten, or at least of them, and it took me a while to straighten, but it was worth it! Totally get it! You&#x27;ll love it:D</li>
            <li> Had a bug in the spray I was not happy with it nasty I dump it out the day I got it</li>
            <li> I love how this spray leaves a nice shine on my hair,  It can also be used even when you aren&#x27;t straightening in my opinion.  Price is good, works for me and hair looks healthier too!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair smell weird and it doesnt feel nice and soft afterwords like it does when I use other products for straightening my hair. If your looking for something that&#x27;d make your hair smooth, frizz free, soft and smelling great, try something else.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Garnier products and I hadn&#x27;t tried this yet. I&#x27;m one of those who straighten their hair almost everyday and is really bad about using heat protector. I&#x27;ve had a couple in the past that made my hair look really oily and smell like I just got a perm, but this one has that fruity fresh smell just like their shampoos and hair spray and when you heat it up with the straightener it makes your hair smell delicious all day. Have been using it for a solid week along with the Hydro-recharge shampoo and conditioner and also the creamy leave in conditioner they have as well. I have noticed a huge difference in the shine and softness of my hair. Totally would recommend this product if your hair spends a lot of time under high temperatures.</li>
            <li> Have bought before, will buy again. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I put this on my subscribe and save because it is a good product, it is rather inexpensive compared to other flat iron perfectors, and I want to protect my hair.  The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that many of the professional products use an aerosol spray so it goes on evenly, whereas this is a pump.  Since it&#x27;s a pump, it can tend to go on a little heavy in spots.  At least it&#x27;s better for the environment.  Overall, though, a good product.</li>
            <li> dried my ends out a little, but if you have moisturizing conditioner it works. it takes away all frizz, if dry hair isnt a problem for you then this is your jam</li>
            <li> My daughter dumped out this brand new bottle so I went to the store and bought another. Works great. Love the sleek and shine. Does exactly that.</li>
            <li> loved the product as did the recipient it turned out to be a great gift everyone should buy this product it helps prevent burning</li>
            <li> It flat irons hair well and smells great! My hair looks so shiney after i use it its a great product i will use again.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this since it was half the price of Tresemme&#x27;s heat protectant spray. It was sticky when applied to my dry hair, which was a bad sign. I just knew it would make my hair look dirty. It has a weird smell, like how a shower cap smells after a while - like old, shampoo.  I&#x27;ll go back to Tresemme or make my own in the future.</li>
            <li> Its not what I expected I thought it was gonna make my hair shiny and soft but it didn&#x27;t! My hair stayed dry and brittle. It smells good but thats abt all it did for my hair</li>
            <li> I recommend this product.  For you all in the humid south, try it.  It&#x27;s not expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked better than the expensive products.</li>
            <li> Ok, here&#x27;s the thing: I love this product because it protects my hair and it makes my hair really shiny and soft:) But it doesn&#x27;t stay for 24 hours, even just going outside for 30 minutes and a cold fall day. If it definatley stayed for 24 hours I would rate this a 5, but since it doesn&#x27;t give me the results I want I give it a 4.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle that I ordered from Amazon. The first one was fine but this one smells like plain alcohol.</li>
            <li> I really love the flat iron spray. I have tries so many heat protecting sprays and most of them make my hair feel weird and nasty, but this one doesn&#x27;t. I leaves my hair feeling the same way before I put it on my hair. I also love that when I use it, my hair stays straightened or curled all day. I really love this product and would recommend it to anyome who want s a very good flat iron spray for cheap.</li>
            <li> I usually love Garnier products but I hate this one. It makes my hair feel and look so greasy. It looks greasy to the point where it looks like I have gone 2 weeks without washing it. The argon oil is really amazing for your hair. I dint know if it&#x27;s the amount that is in this product or just that it&#x27;s cheaply made , but I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair. I used this to flat iron - switching from tresemme as a trial. I feel this dries out my hair more. There seems to be a slight brittle feel to it and even a bit knotty. Im also not a fan of the &amp;#34;tangy&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> Nice product and nice packing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years now.  It is the only thing that holds my hair when I use a curling iron.  And believe me I have tried a lot of them.  All the stores in my area seem to stop carrying this product at the same time! It took me over a year to even think of looking for it on Amazon.  Thank God for Amazon!</li>
            <li> Like their previous product that was discontinued, leaves unclean feeling in hair even when using minimal amount.</li>
            <li> Works well on my 7 year old daughters wavy/curly hair that I straighten sometimes. Seems to keep her hair straighter and less frizzier longer than some of the others that I have tried. Not too strong of a scent. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a really good scent.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and it leaves my hair a little softer when I use it. I love it. I recommend using it. It&#x27;s a great heat protectant</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with this product and says it works wonders.  Her hair does definitely look shinier, so I say it works!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really keep up with time but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> This straightening mist works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She is bi-racial, and this product really keeps her hair smooth, soft and under control when we use the flat-iron. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Four stars because it&#x27;s solid, but doesn&#x27;t blow me away. For the price it&#x27;s a no brainer. I use it for heat protection every day - I even use it when I curl my hair because it helps to hold with whatever shape you use. It really does protect - I can feel it when I touch up a spot and don&#x27;t spray this down first.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my niece and she loves it.  You cant beat the price either. Her hair is not nearly as damaged as before.</li>
            <li> This heat protectant is amazing, it makes my hair so soft and shiny, and it protects my extremely thick african long hair from heat damage, I love this stuff, it also helps with getting my hair bone straight, especially when combined with the anti frizz serum and comb and chase method.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SO MUCH! It&#x27;s Garnier Frutics sleek and shine. It makes your&lt;br /&gt;hair feel silky and soft and shine while it protects your hair from heat 48hrs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this received such great reviews.  I&#x27;m glad it works for people.  I bought it and it just doesn&#x27;t do anything but make your hair sticky and heavy.  It&#x27;s cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> My Wife uses this on a daily basis and has no complaints. Great price and as expected</li>
            <li> I have really frizzy, wavy, and thick hair. I refuse to go out in public with my natural hair so I&#x27;ve straighten it everyday for the past 5 years. Usually my hair gets damaged quickly. It turns dry, lifeless, and gets lots of split ends. I have to get a haircut every so often to chop off the split ends. I&#x27;ve tried many heat styling sprays but none of them help. I purchased this product a few months and and I LOVE IT! I can finally let my hair grow out long because this stuff prevents split ends, it makes my hair soo shiny and silky. My hair has not dried out at all thanks to this! i highly recommend it for someone who uses heat appliances on their hair often. it works really well.</li>
            <li> Just okay. It does it&#x27;s job and no more. I recommend it if you need it and it does help hold for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Its okay but it doesn&#x27;t let your hair staright for the next day. I really dont like it and don&#x27;t recommend it :)</li>
            <li> No girl should flat iron her hair without using some sort of flat iron protector! This product works pretty well for me - I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Neutral. Makes me hair greasy. My hair is still frizzy after an hr.</li>
            <li> The quality and price is just awesome!</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super thin, but it isn&#x27;t thick either. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone who has hair like me. It sort of made it stiff, but also greasy looking. I am not sure how it would work for someone with thicker hair though. It smells really nice and its a good price for a decent size bottle and it delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is alcohol based. It&#x27;s horrible for your hair and it makes it feel like absolutely paper. I hate it and its a waste and it don&#x27;t has a nice smell neither. I can imagine what it can do to your hair over time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple heat protectant. I don&#x27;t think it makes my hair particularly shinier, but It&#x27;s all right for what it does.</li>
            <li> well i guess i can&#x27;t really tell if it is actually protecting my hair from the heat but it does make my hair shinier</li>
            <li> With naturally wavy hair, I use a flat iron for straight locks. This helps protect hair from heat damage and leaves hair silky soft</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible for your hair. It dries it out and leaves nasty steamed-in residue in your hair, not good for if you want to do a 2 day style, you will wake up to crinkly crispy hair...and it takes twice as long to re-straighten it. It&#x27;s gross, I threw mine away.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome for my frizzy hair, after flat ironing I apply it and I get that flat, shinny look. I don&#x27;t understand why I don&#x27;t find it in my nearby supermarkets, but I was happy to find it as an add on item at a low price, bought two of them!</li>
            <li> So happy with this spray, it leaves my hair feeling amazing and not so frizzy. I&#x27;d buy this any day over $50 argan oil.</li>
            <li> It is great to use with my straightener. I have very very dry hair and it helps to protect it.</li>
            <li> I do everything wrong to my hair one can do. Blow dry, color, flat iron and my hair is fine. I HAVE to use something to protect my hair from the heat. This works great! I hate a lot of products but I do have to use something to tame the curls (also Fructis)and I use this to protect it.  My hair stays in good condition. I do use an after shampoo conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I also get &#x27;helmet hair&#x27; riding a motorcycle and I keep a small bottle with this in it to freshen my hair and look less scary.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I love just about all products that Garnier comes out with and this is no exception.  Works great with my straightener to maintain that sleek look and does add shine making hair look healthy.</li>
            <li> Very good and works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, wavy hair that is frizzy unless I curl it with a large barrel curling iron or straighten it with a flat iron. I&#x27;ve been using the Garnier Flat Iron Spray for over a year now because it keeps my hair pin straight and frizz free. I became ill and had to go into the hospital several months ago so couldn&#x27;t wash my hair for almost a week which was gross but at least it stayed straight and frizz free the whole time (: Awesome product! I will continue using this product as long as Garnier continues to sell it.</li>
            <li> This is the only flat iron protector I use, I have tried many for very expensive to very cheap Garnier makes a wonderful product will continue to use as long as I am using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> It smells really good, and i guess it prevents my hair from damage. The only thing i dont like about this product is that somehow my hair smelled like burned everytime after use this. Overall, a good product at this price.</li>
            <li> hair is straightened just as quickly and as flat without so not sure what it really does for your hair</li>
            <li> I will purchase more and more and more and more and more etc etc.... Everyone should try it!!!!! It&#x27;s literally the best thing that ever happened to my hair</li>
            <li> This helped with frizz only a little.  It seemed to add a little shine but not an oily/gross look.  It definitely made the flat ironed hair look straighter (no tiny crinkles)...even though my great flat iron already eliminated that issue by 90%+, this pushed smoothness to 99%...425-430F using Red Pro Silicone Protection flat iron.  I tend to be a perfectionist, so I&#x27;m quite pleased.  I highly recommend that you use the Garnier Blow Dry Perfector before applying this spray...mainly if you have very curly hair that you are flat ironing.  Reversion should be almost zero without any other products or \\&quot;treatments\\&quot;.  I am still testing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I get a C shape or a loose S shape to my hair length if the strand is wet.  A spritz on top of this caused it to really curl up.  No water and no added products outside of the recommended on the package, and you might have all-day straight results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another update and 2 stars off:  I don&#x27;t like the smell.  Also, my hair did burn at the ends even at just 400 degrees.  Lastly, this has somewhat of a spritz effect and I don&#x27;t like things adding stiffness to my hair.  I will try a couple of Loreal products Sleek it iron spray and Smooth intense serum.  But the Garnier shampoo and conditioner certainly helped to reduce or eliminate the C shape and some of the frizz versus using the cream and spray alone.  So, I will use the shampoo and conditioner.  Warning:  I ironed right after spraying this as the directions don&#x27;t warn against that.  But I saw a Suave product which said to wait until it dries...so maybe we need to wait to avoid the hair from burning.  If so, it should have been stated on the Garnier label.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the past.  It works really well with flat irons but not with curling irons.</li>
            <li> Big fan of Garnier Fructis products here and bought this to use with the HSI Professional 1 Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron.  Perfect match!  I get smooth, shiny, straight hair every time.  :)</li>
            <li> It works fine. It&#x27;s a little stickier than I&#x27;d like, but better than some of the other similar products. It smells great, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This product is just gold and I&#x27;m in love with it !&lt;br /&gt;My hair was damaged and it is now smoother than ever after using the garnier fructis. It is also AMAZING protector gainst flat irons</li>
            <li> works well smells good and would recommend it and would purchase this item again satisfied with this product good price and timely delivery</li>
            <li> I have used this spray for over a year and I am really happy with it.  It does a great job of protecting my hair from the high temperature of my flat iron, as well as keeping my hair straight and shiny.  My hair has a mild natural wave, and I do have hair color in it as well.  This was a great find and it&#x27;s a bargain at the price!</li>
            <li> Headline says it all. Doesn&#x27;t even work. I&#x27;ve used it on my sister and me, leaves the hair dry and brittle. Ugh</li>
            <li> Ive been using the Chi mist for years, and i thought it did the job. but until i stopped at target and picked the up because of the insane price, i never went back to my chi! it keeps my hair straight and feeling healthy and non greasy. love love love!</li>
            <li> Just loved it. Nice smell and stays on.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. I use it every single time I straighten my hair. I wish I could spray all my hair at once instead of sectional to speed up the process.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful, it works very well on my hair and it arrived in an exceptional amount of time.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair sticky. When used as the bottle recommends it ends up acting like hairspray on my hair. I didn&#x27;t want that so I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while and I love it.</li>
            <li> Works very well on  with my flat iron and has a nice smell. I would buy this again! 3 3</li>
            <li> Overwhelming alcohol smell. My hair ended up looking more dry and just.. worse. My ends have old color (or lack of) from bleaching that I&#x27;ve been slowly getting rid of with trims. I try to straighten my hair as little as possible but when I do, I use the lowest heat setting and only straighten each section no more than 2, 3 times max. Immediately, I noticed the alcohol smell and a very, very faint &amp;#34;garnier&amp;#34; smell. This stuff also has what seems like is probably a gel for &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;. Yay. &amp;#60;&amp;#60;sarcasm</li>
            <li> I love this stuff &amp; used it in the past. Now i am knocking out A LOT of Christmas shopping early &amp; i am buying this for my tween daughter. Time for her to enjoy it too! This stuff smells SO GOOD &amp; works great! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This heat protector actually protects my hair and keeps it smooth &amp; shiny. I don&#x27;t know what some people mean by saying it makes their hair dryer, cause mine doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> This product leaves hair shiny and bright but after flat ironing it leaves hair sticky and causes hair to have split ends.</li>
            <li> I read a couple of reviews with complaining about the scent of it and I worried about it but I like it actually.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s just depends on your taste.&lt;br /&gt;Great product with affordable price- awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the only problem is that if you apply it to make a too thin layer, your style wouldn&#x27;t last that long in humidity.&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m afraid if excessive use of this product would cause a damage of my flat iron since it leaves residue on the iron.</li>
            <li> I love garnier products but this one disappoints me. It smells of and contains alcohol, which we all know isn&#x27;t the best thing for your hair. It also made my hair feel very straw like.</li>
            <li> Adds nice shine to hair and hair feels soft after I use this with my flat iron. It has a fresh scent. I tried it once without a flat iron and just blow drying, and could not see any results.</li>
            <li> COMPLETE SHIT. BURNED MY HAIR OFF WHEN USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I bought this product several months ago when I bought my flat iron. I love Garnier Fructis products and this works well with my hair. It makes my hair shiny and healthy looking without that greasy look. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> It does the job but my hair feels rough and dry. I try using argan oil after I straighten my hair to avoid dryness</li>
            <li> I love this I give this 5+ stars  it did everything it said on the bottle.</li>
            <li> love my hair with this product!</li>
            <li> The store ran out of the brand (Nexxus) I usually carry. It probably ran out because it&#x27;s good quality. The store was going through a rough patch that day and was poorly stocked. It had very few heat protector sprays, but it had this one. Now I know why no one wanted to buy it. In desperate need I did buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair seems to be worse since I started using it. Instead of being smooth on my hair it comes out of the bottle sticky and gummy. The texture immediately after applying it to my hair is horrible. The individual strands of my hair have a sticky gross feeling that I just do not understand. My hair texture feels dry and hard to tame. It starts to get waves in it after a while and it gets frizzy. I do not like it. This is one of the worst products I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows maybe I got a fluky bottle or have fluky hair although I will not be trying it again. I would not recommend it to anyone but I am sure it might work for some. This product created some insecure days for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus I miss you. I promise I won&#x27;t ever settle for less again.</li>
            <li> This product really works to protect the hair from flat iron use.  Leaves hair soft and frizz free; smells great also.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t seem to be able to buy this in the UK so I&#x27;ve bought it through the US Amazon and my Aunt is bringing it over for me this month when she visits. I bought it whilst on holiday in Florida and my friends have brought me some back from their holidays.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair so glossy and soft and easy to straighten and it smells nice too!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this from the US and I&#x27;m considering lobbying parliament to have it sold in the UK or at least on the UK Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it! If you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I really love this product!</li>
            <li> okay, i have never been a fan of Garneir Fructis but i did like this product... the first few times i used it. This actually dries out your hair really bad and causes dry, breaking ends after a few weeks of use. It smells amazing though, i can give it that. It has good stuff in it, but it also has bad stuff in it (like alcohol). I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product worked great on my hair. This is the first time I have ever used a product like this. The alcohol did not dry my hair out. After I wash my hair I do use leave in conditoners to make my hair soft. It was as soft after I used it as it was before I sprayed it on. It evaporates quickly into my hair. I also love that it leaves my hair smelling good.</li>
            <li> I have used this product multiple times when straightening my hair and have not really noticed a difference in the finished result. I have noticed a sticky residue from using it on my hair it makes it feel dried out and sticky which i dont like. Maybe i am using it wrong - i did follow instructions though...</li>
            <li> I wear weave often. This is a great lightweight product. No sticky residue. Just a light spritz through the hair before using curling/flat iron and it leaves my hair looking shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> I was in the store and quickly picked this out because it smells good. Unfortunately, as someone as else said, it has alcohol in it. This stuff will dry your hair out over time. Now I can just use it as body spray, lol.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky and straight</li>
            <li> This product is a total must have. It gives you that totally perfectly straight hair look easily. It has a good smell to. This will protect your hair from split ends to (Thank god!) This is the best heat spray for hair i have ever bought. I am very pleased with this product. The only flaw is that the spray/pump thing to get the product out doesn&#x27;t distribute it very evenly, so i would suggest to brush or comb your hair after spraying it on your hair/before straightening. This is an awesome product! Garnier lives up to expectations as usual. I would totally recommend this to everyone that needs a great heat spray.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Target, saved quite a bit since I didn&#x27;t have to pay for Amazon shipping. This stuff is alright, I suppose, any protection from heat tools is better than none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product isn&#x27;t a miracle, it simply protects hair strands from  breakage and split ends and reduces frizz nicely, it hasn&#x27;t left my hair soft or silky at all, really. Saying that, yes, it has reduced frizz and split ends and breakage from the flat iron, so I&#x27;m thankful for that. I&#x27;d recommend that people give it a shot and I&#x27;d probably re purchase since it&#x27;s decently priced.</li>
            <li> My hair is long.. damaged.. split.. and somehow it still made it shiny and sexy!&lt;br /&gt;Goes REALLY REALLY well with the blow dry cream.</li>
            <li> i use this to restyle my synthetic heat safe wigs.  it gives them a great resurrection.  nice shine, lasting curls, or sleek straight.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the product for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However when I did use it, I found that it was slightly sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also contains alcohol denat which I&#x27;m pretty sure it drying to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t feel like it did anything to protect from heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is cheap, worked well with my CHI straightener, and added shine.</li>
            <li> It was really alcohol-y so I didn&#x27;t like using it but I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money. It worked pretty well but the overwhelming smell of alcohol.... Didn&#x27;t care so much for it</li>
            <li> I have used this product multiple times. You can purchase from CVS or places like that but I perfer to have all of my items shipped. Will continue to use and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME!! It leaves not only my hair but everyone&#x27;s hair I use it on soft, silky &amp; straight.  I&#x27;ve noticed some people run from it because of the alcohol but the trick is to spray it and give it a few seconds to dry before flat ironing. I&#x27;m African American and it makes our hair absolutely amazing if used correctly.  Have been using it for 3 yes. Its a staple for me!!!</li>
            <li> I am not really sure how to rate this product because I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> It works alright but I think I should have purchased a better heat protectant. The ends of my hair still feel brittle sometimes. Smells great all day long though! It was shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible and it was really disappointing for me because I use the leave in conditioner, shampoo, and conditioner all by Garnier Fructis (and I adore what they have done for my hair). I&#x27;m on this mission to get healthier hair and I have stopped using any sort of harsh chemicals like relaxers on my hair for a while now. One thing I do use however is the flat iron and as you know it can be very damaging. I had been using a serum but I was told a spray heat protectant would be much better so I decided to give this a try.  It made my hair smell like it was burning....and my hair had never felt so dry and hay like. Usually my hair is really soft and a bit fluffy (wavy and curly). It was a complete mess after this product. I do not recommend this to anyone with Black/Puerto Rican/Mixed Hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this spray. I am about to be on my third bottle of it. It just works better than others I have tried, and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I have never liked any of Garnier&#x27;s products as they leave my superfine blond hair feeling heavy and looking oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new line is nothing short of awesome. I have none of those problems from these products.  I like this (the flat iron spray, the morroccan oil treatment and the blow dry cream. They&#x27;re all great products and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Hair feels so soft and looks great!</li>
            <li> Im not exactly sure what this is suppose to do because it does not do what it says it&#x27;s suppose to. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Excellent price for this product. Was much cheaper than purchasing in the store, plus saved me a trip out of the house. Would recommend this too a friend. Will purchase again when I need more.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. It doesn&#x27;t give me the sleek, Hollywood hair that more expensive products do, but it does its best. I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference when using pre-blowdry (my hair ends up still wavy and like straw), but when I use pre-straightener, my hair stays sleek and straight all day (unless it&#x27;s exceptionally humid or it rains). The smell is also pretty pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really only tried this when I was in a pinch and just wanted to grab something at Walmart. It does its job, but doesn&#x27;t blow me away. I won&#x27;t intentionally go seeking this out again.</li>
            <li> For some reason or another I follow Garnier and its products, so when I saw this I knew I had to try it. I bought it thinking it would serve as a heat protectant almost, but it might as well just be perfume. At first I fell in love, it had that unmistakeable Fructis smell, after a couple hair straightenings that smell begin almost intolerable, it was so obnoxious. My hair was being burn as I used it and my hair always stayed shiny when straightened so this product did nothing for me. I went back to using Tresemme</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair and my daughters hair. It is perfect for straightening and does not make your hair heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and i recommend this product to anyone who uses heat on their hair! it will help keep your hair undamaged and protect it from heat. it smells great it gives your hair a nice shine not greasy.</li>
            <li> This flat iron perfector straightener sucked. As soon as I sprayed it in my hair, I felt the texture change right away. This product is extremely drying and seemed to do more damage than protecting. Moreover, the first ingredient is alcohol, and it seems like that&#x27;s what its made up of 100 percent. I regret getting this product.</li>
            <li> is the best hair product i bought so far... the first time i used it i saw the difference, so shine and silky plus it stays like that all day long!!! best part, my hair dont get frizzy and it dont have that hard flat look that it used to when i used to flat iron my hair without this protector</li>
            <li> I used to use Biosilk, which was recommended to me from a stylist.  Another stylist, years later, is telling me the Biosilk is not good and probably caused some of my recent split ends... so I bought this product.  It has a good smell, but I am not even sure if it does anything.  As long as I used Biosilk in moderation, my hair felt great afterward.  With this produce, my hair does not have that silky smooth feeling.  I am glad to say it does not have that greasy feeling either which happened a few times when I used too much Biosilk.  Not sure if I would buy it again.  I am not thrilled or displeased with the product.</li>
            <li> Its good and keeps the hair straight and soft. It is not sticky. But , don&#x27;t know how much protection it gives from the heat of the straightner</li>
            <li> It works for the most part. I only used it once and it worked really good. It protected my hair from all the heating tools I use</li>
            <li> I bought this mostly because it was on sale. I find that it is a good detangler when my hair is wet, and if I spray it enough on damp hair, I can let my hair air-dry without any frizzies. However, I would not recommend this product for straightening. I do not feel like my hair is being protected, and it does not make my hair any more shinier/straighter than the next hair product. In fact, it left my pretty dry after I straightened it. My hair is relatively thin and wavy.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all. The smell is just fantastic, but once on my hair, after ironing, it makes it feel stiff. Although it does add shine, it has no softness to it. Would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Hated this, made my hair super dirty.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair sizzle &amp; break. I hate it! Don&#x27;t get this item it just ruins your hair!!!!! 🙅⛔️</li>
            <li> This product- like everyone else says- smells great. That&#x27;s definitely a big win for me, because I really HATE the smell of straightened (ie, BURNT) hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell though, I&#x27;m not so sure about how effective this product is. It definitely keeps my hair straight, and styled, but with regards to protecting my hair from the heat, I&#x27;m not so sure. It seems like maybe if I used a whole load if it, the heat protection would come into play more. BUT if I use too much of this spray my clean hair will immediately look greasy. Not so cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to avoid your roots with this product definitely helps. I&#x27;m on the fence to be honest, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this product a second time.</li>
            <li> I love this. I use it on the body of my hair but it&#x27;s not quite enough to protect my tips (which I expected) so I use something else for them. It also smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used a flat iron spray in about 2 years, because I was told that if I bought an expensive flat iron, that I didn&#x27;t need it. I was wrong. My hair was becoming very dry and breaking very easily. I have been using this stuff for about 2 weeks and love it. My hair is very managable and even getting it&#x27;s shine back. It leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Does not protect hair like similar products I have used.  My hair was dry and lifeless after using this product withy my flat iron</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very curly hair that always takes an incredibly long time to straighten. This spray shortens that time and protects my hair without leaving it greasy or oily like most other straightening and protective products. I use it every time I straighten my hair and I love it!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super smooth, straight, and less frizzy!  The price is just right as well!  No need to spend extra money on a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I am African American and I use this on my hair when is damp. I spray it right before blow drying and it makes my hair sleek, shiny and soft even before flat ironing it.  Works better than products marketed towards african american hair. Makes the blow drying process so much easier. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else. Love this stuff. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel shiny and smooth and i luvvvv the smell. Its very lightweight so it does&#x27;nt weigh the hair down</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find a product that gets my hair as straight as this does at ANY price. This product is especially perfect if you have 15 minutes to get your hair straight (be realistic please, if your hair is suuuper long or thick 15 min is not enough) - it does a great job of taming everything. If you have more than 15 minutes it&#x27;ll do a phenomenal job. I don&#x27;t know about &#x27;48 hour&#x27; finish - I&#x27;ve never found anything that works for 48 hours other than re-straightening - but it DOES keep your hair straight all day (even if the weather doesn&#x27;t feel like cooperating). It works well with a blow drier as well - for those days you want to give your  hair a rest from the flat iron. Plus it&#x27;s not sticky at all and your hair feels and looks smooth after using it. I kinda always felt like I was all thumbs straightening my hair until I found this stuff and at $3 it&#x27;s really worth a try I think.</li>
            <li> So now I know just how important this stuff is for your hair before flat ironing because I was sadly making the big mistake of not protecting my hair before ironing it, I burnt my bangs! and everytime after taking a shower, my bangs had the dry, crinkled, frizzy mess look!  So I discovered this by Garnier and it has totally helped my hair, bringing it make to a healthy look.  Also, it has lasted for a super long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much at all, spray it, comb through, blow dry then flat iron it, so easy!</li>
            <li> Very effective for getting my hair straight quicker and the style lasts. The hair stays perfect the whole day when I use it before straightening, and on the second day I usually only have a couple spots (if any) to hit with the flat iron again.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside - I have slightly oily hair, so a little added dryness didn&#x27;t hurt me. If you already have dry hair, then this is probably not going to be the best product for you.</li>
            <li> Disappointment. But I guess I should have expected that- since it&#x27;s a Garnier product. Maybe their products just don&#x27;t work we&#x27;ll with my hair type (thick, naturally wavy/straight, healthy, never colored or dyed).</li>
            <li> I use this sometimes, it&#x27;s not something I must use when straightening my hair. It seems to make my hair a little crunchy sometimes, probably just when I spray too much in one spot. It helps with straightening sometimes when I&#x27;m too lazy to blow dry my hair properly but I won&#x27;t make it out to be something amazing. I feel that whether or not I use it, doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference, especially with frizz.</li>
            <li> This product do what it promise , it is just not what I was looking for exactly , if your hair are little oily it will be best to use also on course Asian or Latino hair, if your hair are dry skip it ..it will dry even more so you have to wash your hair at last every 48h - 2 days or 3 times per week , I do just 1 time per week since it take me 2 hours to fix my hair each time .. and i don;t have time lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it straight the hair well on the lowest setting of my Instyler , the hair looks pretty and shine in the beginning and even curls up but then after couple of hours the hair become bone straight and have to just brush them often to not looks stick together and even little fizzy on the back, the hair also feel dry , I use it only on the lower part of my 22inch long hair and not on top, the top is still soft and silky but the ends feel dry what was not the case before using this product I guess the alcohol that need to vaporize before you use your hot iron did this as it will dry the hair out , if you  go for bone straight and without bounce go for it , i like to straighten  my wavy hair  and add some big curls at the end for more bouncing volume and it was just not good enough , but i will use it sometime for the only straight look but only sometimes as I am afraid it will dry to much my hair when I use to often , my hair are very dry from nature so it cost me a lot to keep them silky and hydrated , I am afraid I will have a strew on my head when i woke up tomorrow in this case I will make update but i hop not ..  I spend a lot of money finding the right thing for me , Garnier Fructis products was creating allergic reactions to my skin  so I never use anything for the body, but I was hoping it will be better for the hair as the other reviews said but nope , i expected failure , i think siliconmix diluted with water is still my best option for perfect hair ( my own idea )</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but also gets very dry in the winter, especially since I blow dry and flat iron just about every day. I can condition it all day long but the frizz and dryness really shows up after I flat iron. So I thought I&#x27;d try this out as a prep for my hair after blow drying but before flat ironing. And it is AMAZING! The fine mist is not too heavy for my fine hair, smells amazing, and gives me a smooth and easy flat ironing job. And afterwards, my hair is smooth and shiny all day long. I love it and cannot say enough good things about it- especially for the price! Take a chance and try it out.</li>
            <li> Garnier Sleek and Shine Flat Iron Perfector spray may work well but I don&#x27;t really like the string fumes it has.</li>
            <li> Meh.......I don&#x27;t recommend this product. It&#x27;s a complete waste of money. Keep on looking - this is not the product for you. Or for anybody.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it leaves my hair smooth and it smells good so your hair doesn&#x27;t smell burnt.</li>
            <li> It still makes the iron sizzle if you iron seconds after spraying (even though it says to iron immediately after spraying) which is not supposed to happen. It makes it all glossy and shiny, but it feels a little dry throughout the day. but for a first it&#x27;s doing a decent job, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s protecting my hair from heat. I&#x27;m a guy by the way.</li>
            <li> This product is okay but it doesnt work miracles. It leaves your hair straight for longer but it does not make it any shinier. It can also leave your hair dry and it can feel like straw after so i do not believe it actually protects you hair from heat.</li>
            <li> I have bought it and I didn&#x27;t like the results, it left my hair dry and my hair felt kinda sticky and it didn&#x27;t calm down my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference between using this and using any other spray. I think adding a few drops of oil and then flat ironing your hair yields way better results than this spray. Save your money. I have thick dry hair. Perhaps if your hair is a different texture if will work wonders on you but not for me</li>
            <li> LADIES PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!  The main ingredient in this product is alcohol and it will burn your hair. There are plenty of other alternatives to this product whose main ingredient consist of water not alcohol.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday when flat ironing , keeps hair straight and frizz free</li>
            <li> This spray really holds your style all day if you use it before straightening. I have fairly straight hair, but it tends to frizz and look unkempt if it&#x27;s humid, rains or snows. I used this the other day before I shoveled the driveway and when I came inside my hair still looked perfect. Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Ive started straightening my hair more often so i figured i should use something on it to help reduce damage. I have quite a few hair products by Garnier and they&#x27;re fine. This one is not for me. The smell is nice but too strong for me. Makes my hair look oily and feel heavy. It also seems to make it frizz WAY more than if i were to just straighten my hair without product.</li>
            <li> This product works miracles for my frizzy puffy hair. It smells awesome as well. Love Love Love It!!! excellent product!</li>
            <li> Very good product and works really well. Hair gets really straight and very shiny. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually does a better job at protecting your hair from the heat since this is the first heat protectant I have ever bought, but it does straighten. If you&#x27;re trying to creative stuff with your flat iron like me though, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was recommended to me by a friend. She has hair like mine, except she is dominican and I am african american. I am no longer relaxed and I am 7 months post Big Chop and I transitioned out for 9 months. My hair has grown out well and I wanted to try the straight look for awhile and I was able to do this with this product. I used the [[ASIN:B0017WZXPW Garnier Fructis Style Sleek &amp; Shine Anti-humidity Smoothing Milk, Strong, 5.1 Oz (2 Pack)]] and blow dried. My hair was in heaven! No hair was in my comb and it mixed very when with my [[ASIN:B0074BZAS0 Organic Root Leave-In Conditioner, No Boundaries 12 fl oz (354.9 ml)]]. I was speechless because I don&#x27;t expect any product to do as it should, especially with the promises made but it did and ummmm yea! It worked. My scalp was very clean, I didn&#x27;t feel and buildup from this product and my curls came back with a vengence! Very glad i bout this, was worth my three dollars and I am including this is any straightening i do with my hair in the near or far future. TAMTAM</li>
            <li> This spray definitely does it job in keeping your hair straight and protected from heat, but the bottle I got has a defective spray nozzle. Luckily, I still have my old, empty bottle of heat protectant spray, so I can just pour this into that one.</li>
            <li> This product is a good product.  I like this product and it does a good job on natural hair.  It made the hair shine.  I will recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! First of all it smells amazing, and second it works wonderfully. I have very thick, wavy hair and i live in Mississippi where its extremely humid. Usually after flat ironing my hair it back to wavy and crazy within a half an hour. But this stuff keeps it sleek and shiny all day. I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great and it really does keep your hair straight for a long time.  Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Product is OK, but it seems to make my hair somewhat oily. Not sure if I would buy it again</li>
            <li> It smelled good going on, but it did not protect against the burnt hair smell from the flat iron.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Product works well to protect hair, and smells very good.  I even use mine as a little hair spray.  Love it...</li>
            <li> I found this product very light on the hair and the smell is awesome. But for some reason, this wasn&#x27;t very effective on my hair. So, tried returning. But this product can&#x27;t be returned. Amazon gladly issued me a refund.</li>
            <li> Perfect! As described, It works great for my hair. Keeps it straight for 24-48 hours, And it smells wonderful!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner in this &amp;#34;straightening hair&amp;#34; bussiness. But I can say that this oil makes it last and holds. I&#x27;m happy with it. I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have not used products on my hair other than shampoo and conditioner for YEARS!!  I have finally gotten my hair to grow back shoulder length. I just realized last week that I would have to cut it due to my ends looking so frizzy and dead!  They are not split ends just worn and frizzy.  I have been reading about hair protectors due to me flat ironing my hair.  Since all the sites says to use a protector, I decided on fructis (love the shampoo and conditioner too)  I was absolutely astounded at how it made my ends look.  It was amazing how my ends laid down and my hair looks healthy again. I was going to get my ends cut in December thinking they could not be saved but Garnier Fructis has saved my hair!!  It was so soft and shiny!  I wish I could add a photo.  One of the reviews I read had a photo of a hair strand without protector and then one with the protector...  It sold me on the need to protect my hair but the look I got from it makes me want to kick myself from not using it years ago!</li>
            <li> I just love Garnier Fructis style sleek and shine flat iron Perfector as my hair is always shiny and clean looking at all times and no more frizzy hair for me.This leaves my hair so conditioned and I plan to keep on using this great product. It&#x27;s amazing how you can make frizzy natural curly hair so relaxed with out having to have it straightend  at hair salons.</li>
            <li> Using this with the new flat iron I bought, changed so much for me.&lt;br /&gt;I used to have to spend about an hour flat ironing my hair and go over it again daily for about 15min to get out any lumps from sleeping. Now I can go almost a full week with some dry shampoo because the straigtening mist and flat iron make it perfect to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have many lumps from sleeping and its SO shiny and soft that I can&#x27;t stop touching it. I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> Good price and works great keeping my hair straight for up to 2-3 days if I keep my hair mostly dry. It also makes my hair feel very silky and smooth once I&#x27;ve used it with either my flat iron of hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> At first this product made my hair really soft but now my hair feels more damage and more dry as well</li>
            <li> Excellent heat protectiom . smells great , works great , leaves hair smelling wonderful even after styling , gives hair a healthy shine (:</li>
            <li> This product works well, has a pleasant fragrance and is incredibly inexpensive.  I saw this on You Tube and the hairdresser recommended spraying on your hand, rubbing hands together and then applying to sections of hair.</li>
            <li> It smells sooo good and it makes your hair look shiny and nice!!(: i love this product. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> great and it stays for along I like it very much&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it agin of course&lt;br /&gt;great great</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it much. It makes my hair sticky and looks like I got too much oil in my hair, makes my hair heavy and oily. I didn&#x27;t like it but it&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li> I like this product but I use it sparingly because flat irons are so hot already.  I only use it once month to protect my daughters hair from the heat.</li>
            <li> Helped me to straighten my naturally curly 4a hair. I used it with a straightening brush. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Not great on my hair at all. Makes my hair feel really heavy and leaves it dry.</li>
            <li> This spray leaves my hair smelling wonderful and straight with a beautiful shine. I wouldnt hesitate to but it again</li>
            <li> great product will definitely get it again.</li>
            <li> I like this because it works well, and it is pretty affordable. It does a good job when using a flat iron, although my hair can get thick in between cuts and it doesn&#x27;t work too great with thicker parts, I have to spray way more. But it works and keeps my hair pretty straight and frizz free.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my mother who loves product.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and prevent it burning.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It works really great. I spray it before I flat iron it, and my haur stays straight all day. Also it smells great.</li>
            <li> I normally love the smell of Garner Fructis products but this one is not my favorite. Definitely smells like you are putting chemicals in your hair unlike some heat protestant. Other than that, I don&#x27;t really have any complaints. It works well at what it was made to do. Your hair will get frizzy if you are in a place with high humidity(I would recommend looking for a different brand) but it will stand up to places with low or moderate humidity. Like I said, it gets the job done and keeps my hair nice and straight all day long.</li>
            <li> Amazing and sooooooo adorable smell</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I hoped it would be compatible with other Garnier hair products that I&#x27;m using. So far, it works as described and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling too dry.</li>
            <li> this product realy works i use it every day i will be buying it again and telling my friends thank you</li>
            <li> Good product. Used it to strengthen my hair perfectly. Will recommend it for flat ironing hair, but do be careful because the heat it radiates hurts like hell on the scalp. Do not flat iron from the root of the scalp at first.</li>
            <li> The smell is very very good! Just put a mist and it works. It last for a long time as well. :)</li>
            <li> The spray smells nice, but I actually think it&#x27;s sometimes harder to straighten my hair when I spray it in.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, just like every other straightener product I have ever used. Nothing too special but it does smell good.. And it does a good job! No Complaints!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was cheap and I was in need of a new heat protecter. I used this, but when ever I used it, it felt like it damaged my hair more then it actually &#x27;protected&#x27; it. There is a lot of alcohol in this product and it did damage it when i put the heat on it. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Works really great. Leaves hair feeling soft and shiny all day. If you have frizzy, untameable hair, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straighten my hair on a daily basis, but the spray is wonderful for preventing static in my hair, keeping it sleek and shiny all day into the next day while not making my hair oily.</li>
            <li> this stuff isn&#x27;t miracle spray like some people said. I&#x27;m still trying to decide if it actually make a significant difference... maybe it does. Might make it a little smoother</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry thin and frizzy and usually when i blow dry my hair the next day it looks absolutely horrible.&lt;br /&gt;But I must say this product works wonders, its affordable than most !!! After using this product i can let my hair down&lt;br /&gt;for more days after visiting the hair salon :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: After spraying on dry hair, your hair will clump (that&#x27;s why i gave it 4 stars) So make sure u blow dry then use your flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Its a lightweight formula and leaves your hair frizz free and straight for the entire day. And lets not forget it smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;leaving your hair nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Wow. I felt this really helped me flatten my hair quickly, but that&#x27;s not even the best part. When I flat iron my own hair (as opposed to going to the salon), it usually kinks up at least a little the next day. But I&#x27;m on day three now and my hair is still perfectly straight. I&#x27;m not sure how much protection it provides, but the straightening/lasting aspect is great!</li>
            <li> first time using this lovev the results great product</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy at all. Works very well. Would highly recommended this product to friends.</li>
            <li> good product. works well. would keep as a staple&lt;br /&gt;used on wet and dry hair. very nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;good price</li>
            <li> Works really great on my hair, but it does leave a very mild greasy feeling. Not enough to feel weighed down or affect styling, but if I go more than a day without washing my hair after using this it can feel a little icky. But it protects my hair and makes it healthy after styling it, which is what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Straightened ok. But needed other products to work.</li>
            <li> Smells very good and helps your hair alot .</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this but once I did I was very disappointed. Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair still was frizzy felt brittle and dry looking waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy this sucks!</li>
            <li> Maybe there is some kind of effect they are trying to get, but there are many other flat iron sprays that don&#x27;t have alcohol in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good spray, though. It does smell good, but when I flat ironed with it, my hair was dry like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the only way this works and leaves my hair nice is by air drying. Probably because the alcohol evaporates with the water, as my hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, glad to know others had success. I made the mistake of spraying a bit of this on my hair while dry, thinking it would give my hair a burst of moisture - as my hair was frizzing a bit, and my hair parched up really nastily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to someone with normal/oil hair. Mines normal/curly hair, and it&#x27;s humid where I live.</li>
            <li> well i washed my hair, then pour a lil bit of garnier blow dry perfector balm then blow dried my hair, i could tell the difference right away from when i didn&#x27;t use the product and blow drying it, it was almost straight and less frizz , my hair is naturally wavy and gets curly after i shower it and leave it to dry by itself..... then after i blow dried it i sprayed some garnier style sleepk shine flat iron perfector and straighten my hair, it was really straight and looked better than ever, i&#x27;m not a big fan of blow drying my hair but with these two products combine it really works and the best part they are both really cheap in price.</li>
            <li> Immediately after using this product on my hair I instantly saw results! My hair smells great along with being nice and sleek, something that never happened when I used the tresemme heat protector! This product is 10xs better!!</li>
            <li> makes my hair really shiny and smooth. really protects because my hair doesn&#x27;t smell burnt or feel dry after i flat iron</li>
            <li> I have African-American hair and this product worked well for my hair. Just spray a small amount... You don&#x27;t need much!!!</li>
            <li> This is the 1st time to use this lotion and I found it light and straighten my frizzy hair in seconds.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price! This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that feels light &amp; airy on your hair, not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> it did okay on her hair her hair is really, really thick so it took a minute but it helped</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL.  IT SMELLS GREAT TOO! VERY GOOD PRODUCT IF YOU&#x27;RE LIKE ME WHO LOVED TO FLAT IRON YOUR HAIR.MUST GET IT.</li>
            <li> This doesnt protect well against heat damage at all! I would rather use the chi flat iron spray instead. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect to use with any hair straightener or curling iron. It helps prevent to much damage to your hair. It smells great and it&#x27;s not too oily.</li>
