            <li>Comfortable, supportive, and provided some interesting new options for positioning.</li>
            <li>Is very conforteble &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li>Its nice... very firm pillow, good for support during doggy style and missionary positions..</li>
            <li>It is nice for multiple positions and with me being much taller than my fiance, it sure did help with the missionary position.</li>
            <li>None the less this product was great.</li>
            <li>This item works good for us, It is not to large, and it is  firm, it does clean up easily.</li>

            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to make this a little more fun and pleasurable!</li>
            <li>I bought it to help with a large lady, and it is just too small.&lt;br</li>

            <li>As our first Liberator product we were suprised at how firm it was, yet it was also very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It comes with a card to help you with position ideas but even normal positions are helped with this item.  </li>
            <li>It is much firmer then we expected and provides the extra &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; we needed.</li>

            <li> no better than a pillow.  </li>
            <li> it is kinda small (travel size) but still adds a couple of inches to improve angle of penetration.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the small size, with a 6&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is very firm and supports without compression.  </li>
            <li> Either I&#x27;m using this wrong or it&#x27;s a way over priced pillow...</li>
            <li> A lot of positions were either uncomfortable or painful, but the pillow has changed that.</li>

            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.  no better than a pillow.  overpriced.</li>
            <li> The liberator pillow has been a nice addition to our bedroom experience. It is much firmer then we expected and provides the extra &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; we needed. It is nice for multiple positions and with me being much taller than my fiance, it sure did help with the missionary position. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed!!</li>
            <li> Pillow looks like the right thing...  My husband decided it wasn&#x27;t the right size we were looking for.  Prompt with the return process.</li>
            <li> This helps hit the G spot!</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I have made in a long time. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to make this a little more fun and pleasurable!</li>
            <li> Great positioning pillow! It is very firm and supports without compression.  Great service too!</li>
            <li> If I could give this more stars I would!!  It comes with a card to help you with position ideas but even normal positions are helped with this item.  A lot of positions were either uncomfortable or painful, but the pillow has changed that. My husband is a lot taller than me so this give us more leverage for enter angles and positions. We use it almost EVERY time now! (On a side note, it also helps with allergies lol).</li>
            <li> This item works good for us, It is not to large, and it is  firm, it does clean up easily. Shipment was fast</li>
            <li> Is very conforteble &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, supportive, and provided some interesting new options for positioning. The machine-washable cover is a big plus, too!</li>
            <li> I bought it to help with a large lady, and it is just too small.&lt;br /&gt;So unless you are dating a model, you might want to go with the Ramp</li>
            <li> Its nice... very firm pillow, good for support during doggy style and missionary positions.. it is kinda small (travel size) but still adds a couple of inches to improve angle of penetration.</li>
            <li> Although this product wasn&#x27;t shipped with a tracking number, we still recieved it on time. As our first Liberator product we were suprised at how firm it was, yet it was also very comfortable. It&#x27;s a bit on the small size, with a 6&amp;#34; hight, just as advertized so can&#x27;t complain there, but I definetly wish I would have just purchased the Liberator Wedge. None the less this product was great.</li>
            <li> Either I&#x27;m using this wrong or it&#x27;s a way over priced pillow...</li>
            <li> This pillow is great, it allows for you to have more support on the back and hips. this was an excellent buy for the money!</li>
