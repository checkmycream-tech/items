            <li>This set wasn&#x27;t as nice though.  </li>
            <li>Nice tools.  </li>
            <li>Tweezers are nicely aligned.  </li>
            <li>All steel tools in a tidy travel case.  </li>
            <li>She enjoys having her own kit.</li>
            <li>Full size clippers and nippers are great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and compact for easy transport.</li>

            <li>Love it and would order again.</li>
            <li>The case is adorable and its reasonably priced :) I love it</li>
            <li>They have everything you need...made of cheap metal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all aboout  the packaging and this fit me to the tee.</li>
            <li>It is worth much more than I paid for it.</li>
            <li>The clippers cut cleanly and accurately.  </li>
            <li>I have not tested anything but the tweezers and I am glad I picked up a separate tweezers set from another merchant as these ones do not work very well.</li>
            <li>It feels cheap and it doesn&#x27;t do the job right.</li>
            <li>I wanted to replace my old set, which was done by a different maker, and this one did a great job.</li>

            <li>My friends adored it just as much as i did.</li>
            <li>The tools weren&#x27;t as sharp and the box didn&#x27;t close easily.</li>
            <li>Sheek and classy.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a decent set for the price.</li>
            <li>Wish the file was a little bigger but for on the go it&#x27;ll do just fine.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the case, while nice looking, is going to rust.</li>
            <li>Only about half of the items in the case were secure in slot all the other stuff was just flopping around in the package.</li>
            <li>After putting everything back into place the case just barely closes.</li>

            <li> You can feel the quality of the parts and tools, but the box really is small and hard to close.</li>
            <li> Beutifull case, poor elements</li>
            <li> I was actually shocked that they worked.</li>

            <li> I bought this set to replace the one I gave my sister.  This set wasn&#x27;t as nice though.  The tools weren&#x27;t as sharp and the box didn&#x27;t close easily.</li>
            <li> The box that the product comes had been torn and when I opened up the box some of tools came falling out. Only about half of the items in the case were secure in slot all the other stuff was just flopping around in the package. After putting everything back into place the case just barely closes. I have not tested anything but the tweezers and I am glad I picked up a separate tweezers set from another merchant as these ones do not work very well.</li>
            <li> Beutifull case, poor elements</li>
            <li> Nice tools.  The clippers cut cleanly and accurately.  Tweezers are nicely aligned.  Needed stainless steel, because everything rusts in a marine environment.  Unfortunately, the case, while nice looking, is going to rust.</li>
            <li> All steel tools in a tidy travel case.  Wish the file was a little bigger but for on the go it&#x27;ll do just fine.  Full size clippers and nippers are great.</li>
            <li> The brushed steel is very dry, almost feels powdery while holding. The cuticle clippers are soooooo tiny I was actually shocked that they worked. Overall it is a decent set for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for a friend. Making a gift basket and this was to cut to pass up. What is shown and listed comes in it. Great shipping time and packaging.</li>
            <li> Nice design and good material</li>
            <li> You can feel the quality of the parts and tools, but the box really is small and hard to close.</li>
            <li> I expected better quality. They have everything you need...made of cheap metal. It feels cheap and it doesn&#x27;t do the job right. I would not buy this again or recommend it.</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter.  She enjoys having her own kit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all aboout  the packaging and this fit me to the tee. Sheek and classy. My friends adored it just as much as i did. It&#x27;s nice and compact for easy transport. Meet all my grooming needs on the go.</li>
