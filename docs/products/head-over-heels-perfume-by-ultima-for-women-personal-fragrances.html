            <li> I first bought Head Over Heels about 10 years ago from The Cosmetic Center located inside the Pentagon. I like to wear it in the summer at the back of my knees so that when I walk by, the fragrance lingers</li>
            <li> One of my favorites. I looked for this perfume every where! Brought back so many memories. I love it. Couldn&#x27;t believe the price for it as well.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this perfume years ago and could not find it in the stores anymore. I randomly came across it on Amazon.com and stocked up. Bought one as a gift for my sister too. I always get complements when I wear it. Great price too. I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li> When I searched for a perfume I was looking for a fresh peach sent. Not sweet, just light and musky. I read the other reviews for this perfume and decided to get it.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume was not the peach I was looking for, and gave me a headache. I am sensitive to some perfumes, so I put it back in the box. I ended up giving it to my mom since she liked it. For the price I do not regret getting it, since someone in my family does like it.</li>
