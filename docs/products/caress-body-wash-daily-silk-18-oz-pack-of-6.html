            <li>Most definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I  am addicted to this soap I use evenly gorgeous and nature silk  the best ever!</li>

            <li>The product itself smells great and makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying this great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a brown sugar and vanilla-ish scent that lingers lightly throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Just be realistic of the kind of results your skin will reap.</li>

            <li>I like the sweet sugary scent this has.</li>
            <li>So, overall, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>We love the smell and the gentle exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>You can buy this on the Target website with free shipping for 3.99 each right now.</li>
            <li>scent is better for women, very sweet and very reminiscent of burnt sugar.</li>
            <li>The exfoliation is very mild which I found nice since I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m the only person who uses this for its amazing exfoliating &amp; skin smoothing effects.</li>
            <li>This stuff is a concoction of:  warmth comforting spices, soft patchouli with light sugary goodness!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, lasts forever and makes a shower extra nice.</li>
            <li>I have been using this body wash for years,,and not only do I love the rich glow it gives my skin but the pretty smell in leaves me bathed in all day.</li>
            <li>I normally buy the cheap store brand body washes, but I really don&#x27;t mind \\&quot;splurging\\&quot; on this.</li>
            <li>This product will not even out your entire skin so if you&#x27;re trying to purchase it for magical results, save your money.</li>
            <li>It will not give you the same tone skin head to toe, no matter how many bottles you go through, trust me.</li>
            <li>it was on sale first off the smell</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and I like this wash well enough that I ran out and bought more.</li>
            <li>Apart from the smell which i&#x27;m not a huge fan of, this body wash is good..</li>
            <li>and I am so happy I can finally switch from my other body wash that is over-priced.</li>
            <li>Ok, first off I LOVE this product -- but this price (21.55) is really not a good deal at all.</li>
            <li>I certainly have no idea how an even skin tone is supposed to give me a \\&quot;playful, daring attitude.\\&quot;     </li>
            <li>I found an 18 ounce bottle for a lower price at a large drugstore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a citrus--green tea scent person....can stand cloyingly sweet heavy scents, but the silky smooth satiny look &amp; feel this body wash creates is worth it.</li>
            <li>The exfoliant is gentle and I really could feel the difference the moisturizer made on my skin.  </li>
            <li>BUT IT LATHERS VERY WELL</li>
            <li>I will say that you can get it much cheaper at Target or Walmart</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating particles really do the job.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of his body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the exfoliator scrubbing off dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last terribly long and it would be nice to have a coordinating lotion</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a little more than $7/bottle.</li>
            <li>If I could find a perfume that smelled exactly like this I would buy it; fortunately the smell lingers a few hours after I use this stuff.</li>
            <li>I normally dislike body products that smell like food (vanilla, etc.)</li>
            <li>It contains fine scrubbing granules that don&#x27;t scratch or feel sharp.</li>
            <li>Like literally it truly did clear up my chest acne!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>LEAVES THE SKIN INCREDIBLY SOFT &amp; OMG!</li>
            <li>I am a little concerned because I used to be able to get it in my local durg store or supermarket</li>
            <li>only downside is that the scent disappears very quickly!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Five star, in spite of the heavy cheap perfume smell</li>
            <li>This makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>The smell is unbelievable (like burned sugar) and it leaves your skin moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have only paid $7 for it when I&#x27;m in a jam and have no other choice but to buy it at the over priced Duane Reade near my apartment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a really nice, sweet smell but it&#x27;s not overwhelming or fake smelling.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the smell to be more natural (like real burnt sugar), but it really just smells very artificial.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin and get winter eczema</li>
    </ol>

            <li> so the scent would last all day long.</li>
            <li> Bought them in a three pack so have a long way to go before it runs out.</li>
            <li> &quot; IN THE SHOWER OR IN THE BATH AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use drugstore brands because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has very small sugar bits when applied on skin which I didn&#x27;t mind, after all , it IS suppose to be gently exfoliating like the name suggests.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was literally standing in the drug store smelling this stuff like a mental patient!</li>
            <li> The exfoliation isn&#x27;t as extreme as other body washes I&#x27;ve used, but I like that</li>
            <li> I have bought this in regular stores as well, and it is usually about 5-6 dollars --</li>

            <li> (Less than $4 per bottle, vs over $5 per bottle here) Plus no shipping charges or waiting for it to arrive.</li>

            <li> This is yummy-smelling, and it feels great on my skin!  My husband likes it, too.  It is the best body wash for my post-exercise sweaty body each morning.</li>
            <li> I like the sweet sugary scent this has. I don&#x27;t feel the need for a lotion after using this. It has very small sugar bits when applied on skin which I didn&#x27;t mind, after all , it IS suppose to be gently exfoliating like the name suggests. So, overall, it&#x27;s all good. Bought them in a three pack so have a long way to go before it runs out. Yay!</li>
            <li> As others have said before me, the smell of this is amazing.  Wow!  I love it!  It lathers up nicely and seems to clean well too.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last terribly long and it would be nice to have a coordinating lotion but it is great anyway.  The scent really is wonderful and doesn&#x27;t smell like a bargain brand at all!  My sister used this at my house one time and is now a lover of it too!  Try it!  The scent alone is worth the purchase price!    Just a note:  You probably will need a stronger weekly exfoliant like a sugar or salt scrub but for daily use, it is divine!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this body wash and absolutely love it!  Using this body wash is a sensory delight!  My whole bathroom smelled wonderful after showering and it left a wonderful subtle fragance on my skin.  The brown sugar and butter combination smell like someone is baking something delicious!    The exfoliant is gentle and I really could feel the difference the moisturizer made on my skin.  I will definitely be buying this great product.</li>
            <li> I love everything about caress I will never never ever go to another brand of body wash I  am addicted to this soap I use evenly gorgeous and nature silk  the best ever!</li>
            <li> Really love it the smell is amazing</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS OK, I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE MORE EXFOLIATING CRYSTALS  BUT IT LATHERS VERY WELL</li>
            <li> I have been using this body wash for over a year now.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  It is really the best smelling soap I have ever used.  I just wish they made a body spray to go along with it.  I love the crystals too.  Really makes you feel clean and smell so wonderful!  I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other ones because once I tried this I was hooked forever!</li>
            <li> I have used this body wash every day for about 6 months. I am diabetic and have very dry, uneven skintone. Since I began using it, I noticed that my skin appears more healthy looking, almost tan and I avoid the sun at all costs. The smell alone is enough to die for, it makes me hungry every time I take a shower.   I will say that you can get it much cheaper at Target or Walmart (Less than $4 per bottle, vs over $5 per bottle here) Plus no shipping charges or waiting for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of his body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the exfoliator scrubbing off dead skin cells. It was refreshing and my skin felt cool and tingly. Sqeaky clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is better for women, very sweet and very reminiscent of burnt sugar. It is a woman&#x27;s product so the scent is more suited to women then for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating particles really do the job. My skin felt wonderful afterwards and I would recommend this to women.</li>
            <li> This body wash is the best smelling body wash ever! I have never found one that smelled even close to this good! Now they need to make a lotion with the same scent so the smell can cling to you all day!!!</li>
            <li> I ALSO USE AS SHAMPOO BECAUSE MY SCALP WAS FLAKING.  THE EXFOLIANT IN THE BODY WASH HELPS TO CLEANSE MY SCALP</li>
            <li> I received a small sample of this product in the mail.  I tried it and loved it.  The fragrance is wonderful.  The exfoliation is very mild which I found nice since I have very dry skin.  I have used this product every day and have no problems with irritation or skin roughness.  I wish Caress made a body lotion to go along with the body wash because it just smells divine.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY BODY WASH I USED. LEAVES THE SKIN INCREDIBLY SOFT &amp; OMG! THE SCENT!! LUV IT.  IT&#x27;S OVERPRICED HERE. YOU CAN GET IT AT THE FAMILY DOLLAR OR WALMART FOR LESS THAN $5.00. I JUST PICKED UP MY 18OZ YESTERDAY FOR $3.75 THIS IS A \\&quot;MUST HAVE\\&quot; IN THE SHOWER OR IN THE BATH AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK</li>
            <li> I love this body wash, it&#x27;s smells so good. The scent isn&#x27;t over powering, which is great for a person who gets migraines from perfumes and scented body lotions. My skin feels nice after I get out of the shower, no weird residue or filmy feeling. The exfoliating bits aren&#x27;t too course, so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re rubbing course sand or walnut shells on yourself, but they&#x27;re big enough to feel like they&#x27;re doing something. I normally buy the cheap store brand body washes, but I really don&#x27;t mind \\&quot;splurging\\&quot; on this. I would purchase this body wash over any of the stuff sold in bath and body specialty shops any day.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> OK, I have no idea how a body wash is supposed to have an effect on skin tone. I certainly have no idea how an even skin tone is supposed to give me a \\&quot;playful, daring attitude.\\&quot;     What I do know is that this smells great. It&#x27;s a brown sugar and vanilla-ish scent that lingers lightly throughout the day. A little \\&quot;foody,\\&quot; so it depends on whether you like that sort of thing.    I think Caress could just advertise this based on the decadent scent and skip the skin tone silliness.</li>
            <li> Two stars because of the delivery.  The product itself smells great and makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This product will not even out your entire skin so if you&#x27;re trying to purchase it for magical results, save your money. If you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizing body wash that has that grainy feel to help exfoliate you, then this body wash is a good investment. Just be realistic of the kind of results your skin will reap. It will not give you the same tone skin head to toe, no matter how many bottles you go through, trust me. I went through 6 of them.</li>
            <li> I use several different types of body wash but this is by far the best and affordable body wash that I have purchase in a while.</li>
            <li> I was literally standing in the drug store smelling this stuff like a mental patient! This scent is amazing! It&#x27;s like a yummy brown sugary/vanilla scent.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone from Caress is reading...PLEASE make this scent into a lotion, body spray, hair spray, room spray, dog spray... I want to smell this ALL DAY LONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the scent disappears very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, it&#x27;s moisturizing too. Don&#x27;t have to lotion up after my showers. Although I WOULD if they made this scent into a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Just sayin&#x27; :)</li>
            <li> Omgosh the smell is heavenly. Love love love. Great exfoliating as well. I use with a bath brush to get a good scrub.</li>
            <li> Holy grail body wash! I pick this up at my local walmart or walgreens. This body wash not only smells incredible, but it makes my skin so soft and smooth! Love that it contains exfoliating beads. You can use this daily but I tend to use this about 3 days a week in place of my exfoliating body scrub and love the results!! Most definitely worth the money! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using this body wash for years,,and not only do I love the rich glow it gives my skin but the pretty smell in leaves me bathed in all day. I am a little concerned because I used to be able to get it in my local durg store or supermarket but I haven&#x27;t seen it on the shelfs lately ..I hope they are not going to disconutinue it&lt;br /&gt;Samantha</li>
            <li> This STUFF IS AMAZING!!!!! I bought this from target for $2 it was on sale first off the smell is SO GOOOOOOD !!!! I had chest acne marks ! And this stuff cleared it up !!!! Like literally it truly did clear up my chest acne! It says it reveals an even tone to your skin &amp; that it did ! 5 STARS BABY FOR THE PRICE &amp; RESULTS 😝😝😝😝😝</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It smells amazing! If I could find a perfume that smelled exactly like this I would buy it; fortunately the smell lingers a few hours after I use this stuff. The exfoliation isn&#x27;t as extreme as other body washes I&#x27;ve used, but I like that it&#x27;s not too abrasive. I hope they never discontinue this product, it&#x27;s simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use drugstore brands because I have very sensitive skin. Everything makes me break out and I only use expensive brands made for sensitive skin. I decided to try Caress Evenly Gorgeous because of the warm cookie smell and of course the price. OMG! I absolutely love it and I am so happy I can finally switch from my other body wash that is over-priced. I just wish Caress would make a lotion and body spray to go along with the wash so the scent would last all day long.</li>
            <li> The formula is hydrating without leaving any film....the ingredients rock....The SCENT IS SO HEAVENLY! Its hard to describe....its sweeter and spicier than BBWs Warm Vanilla Sugar and not as spicy or tart as their Sensual Amber. This stuff is a concoction of:  warmth comforting spices, soft patchouli with light sugary goodness! Its saved me hundreds of dollars...as i cannot stop using it! ;)</li>
            <li> I was expecting the smell to be more natural (like real burnt sugar), but it really just smells very artificial. Apart from the smell which i&#x27;m not a huge fan of, this body wash is good.. its texture, foaminess, and exfoliation are all top notch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great bodywash, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The smell is unbelievable (like burned sugar) and it leaves your skin moisturized and smooth. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I normally dislike body products that smell like food (vanilla, etc.) but for some reason I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. It has a really nice, sweet smell but it&#x27;s not overwhelming or fake smelling. It leaves no scent once your skin dries which I prefer. The color is a rich, shimmery, brown sugar shade. It contains fine scrubbing granules that don&#x27;t scratch or feel sharp. A little goes a long way. I use it on a scrubby puff. I have dry, sensitive skin and get winter eczema so I was worried that it would make my skin worse but instead it seemed to make the eczema go away. It also made my legs shiny in a nice smooth way.  I received a small bottle as a gift. It&#x27;s almost gone and I like this wash well enough that I ran out and bought more. I also bought some 3 ounce travel size bottles to give to girlfriends. It&#x27;s inexpensive, lasts forever and makes a shower extra nice. I found an 18 ounce bottle for a lower price at a large drugstore.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wash for my daughters and they love it. the smell is great and it makes your skin feel so smooth you dont even need lotion after your bath. Was so glad we found this on amazon just wish we could find it in our stores and not have to order it online.</li>
            <li> We love the smell and the gentle exfoliating.  The scent would be  individual taste, but it is not a perfume scent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, you don&#x27;t have to much to get washed, it comes out easily. And really smells great!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this!</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m the only person who uses this for its amazing exfoliating &amp; skin smoothing effects. I use self tanner, &amp; no matter how hard I scrub with regular wash, the color can be blotchy. I&#x27;m a citrus--green tea scent person....can stand cloyingly sweet heavy scents, but the silky smooth satiny look &amp; feel this body wash creates is worth it. Five star, in spite of the heavy cheap perfume smell</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. This makes my skin so soft. I only use caress and bath and body works body wash. Caress even helps with my acne.</li>
            <li> Ok, first off I LOVE this product -- but this price (21.55) is really not a good deal at all. This is more expensive than it should be in a regular store. I&#x27;m sorry if anyone thinks this is useless but there is no reason that anyone should pay 21+ dollars for 3 bottles of this stuff. That&#x27;s a little more than $7/bottle. You can buy this on the Target website with free shipping for 3.99 each right now. I have bought this in regular stores as well, and it is usually about 5-6 dollars -- I have only paid $7 for it when I&#x27;m in a jam and have no other choice but to buy it at the over priced Duane Reade near my apartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is wonderful. I have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this body wash from where I can&#x27;t remember. But, this body wash is a must- have! It smells oh-so good, lathers nicely, and cleans and moistures my skin where I don&#x27;t even need lotion after my shower or bath, which is a plus! And it arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
