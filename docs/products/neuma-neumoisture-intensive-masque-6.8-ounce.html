            <li>It really is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it was wrapping in some kind of plastic when it is shipped.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>My hair is also very fine, however my beard is like a steel wool pad.  </li>

            <li>I love my hair and love it even more now that I found this.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>then Kerastase - and Kerastase has many ingredients that I feel should not be in a luxury brand/product.  </li>
            <li>I love love love the shampoo too.</li>
            <li>We will probably use this product forever more.</li>

            <li>Ordering it through the &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; saves me even more, and the free shipping from amazon makes it worth it.  </li>
            <li>I am biracial, so my African American hair doesn&#x27;t get washed as often as others may, and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>i use this line exclusively on my hair and have been very pleased the last 2+ years.</li>

            <li>First time I&#x27;ve been cheated, but a lesson for me.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time finding a lotion I wasn&#x27;t allergic to that i loved.  </li>
            <li>, also it is VERY concentrated</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, great for thick hair, does not fade your color actually helps to preserve color longer and hair is so shiny with alot of body!</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s hair is very fine and this conditioner gives it long lasting body.  </li>

            <li>I will never buy this product online again, throwing out what I bought is a huge waste of money that I can&#x27;t afford!</li>
            <li>My hair has really responded to it, and looks shinier and healthier than it has in a long time.  </li>
            <li>This deep conditioner makes my thick frizzy hair so soft and shiny and Healthy.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I just started using The Neuma moisture line and I&#x27;m in love. I have never heard of it before. Okay so I am a hair snob! I love my hair and love it even more now that I found this. This deep conditioner makes my thick frizzy hair so soft and shiny and Healthy. Yes i will buy again. Yes i recommend. expensive yes worth every penny, also it is VERY concentrated so you only need a tiny bit</li>
            <li> I love this product!! The entire look and feel of my hair has changed! I just wish it was wrapping in some kind of plastic when it is shipped. The lid I. The jar of mine had almost come off.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. I have long, course hair and it makes it softer without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Finally a deep conditioner that conditions but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy!  It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s no more expensive then Kerastase - and Kerastase has many ingredients that I feel should not be in a luxury brand/product.  The only down side is that not many salons in my area carry this brand.  Hopefully the word will get out and that will change.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week to give my hair extra moisture and it works great. I love love love the shampoo too.</li>
            <li> Not for crispy or fried hair. Does nothing to help!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this masque for about 2 years. I&#x27;ve tried others, but they don&#x27;t leave my hair as soft.  I always get compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing. i use this line exclusively on my hair and have been very pleased the last 2+ years. get a great rating EWG for quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before for the wife and myself and it is the best hair conditioner we have ever used.  Even 2 days after using it hair still feels wonderful.  My wife&#x27;s hair is very fine and this conditioner gives it long lasting body.  My hair is also very fine, however my beard is like a steel wool pad.  Besides being great on my hair, it has managed to tame my beard.  We will probably use this product forever more.</li>
            <li> Love it! Hair soft and healthy. Nice fragrance. Good price for product. I have tired other products this is the best.</li>
            <li> This does wonders for my fine, color treated hair.  If I use once a week it really keeps my hair in great shape.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair conditioner because my hair salon posted it on their facebook page.  My hair has really responded to it, and looks shinier and healthier than it has in a long time.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After a recommendation from a stylist friend, I use this as my conditioner!  I love it. I am biracial, so my African American hair doesn&#x27;t get washed as often as others may, and this is perfect. When I have time, I try to wash then soak in a tub while this sets in. Then rinse, blow dry, flat iron, and style. Looks fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I pair it with Neuma Moisture Shampoo, then also use Neuma Argon Treatment pre and post blow out.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this after trying a sample my hairstylist gave me, but as with a lot of hair products, it seemed more effective at first.</li>
            <li> I have extremely damaged hair and this product leaves my hair soft and smooth. My hair never felt so good!</li>
            <li> This product is not the same as I received before. The product is defective and an imitation of the real product. Total rip off. I will never buy this product online again, throwing out what I bought is a huge waste of money that I can&#x27;t afford! First time I&#x27;ve been cheated, but a lesson for me. Can&#x27;t trust amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a saving grace for my thin, very curly hair.  I use it every 3 days followed by John freida frizz ease serum. My hair is so soft afterwards without being greasy!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, great for thick hair, does not fade your color actually helps to preserve color longer and hair is so shiny with alot of body!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a lotion I wasn&#x27;t allergic to that i loved.  This one is it.  I love the feel of it after I put it on my face.  It really is amazing.  Ordering it through the &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; saves me even more, and the free shipping from amazon makes it worth it.  I hate shopping in stores.  This product is delivered right to me when I need it.  I can change the shipping frequency anytime I want or need to.</li>
