    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I read about this product in the Oprah magazine and it is great!  </li>
            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>This skin care is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>so the best I could do was call Amazon Customer Service who credited my account.  </li>
            <li>Very good price as well.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with the results I have gotten from this Coral Actives acne treatment.  </li>
            <li>but it is great.</li>
            <li>Used to use ProActive but wasn&#x27;t getting great results.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the great customer service.  </li>
            <li>I read good reviews about CoralActives and thought I would try it out.</li>
            <li>These products are easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I have even seen a reduction in the size of my pores, which is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The 2-step treatment I ordered off of Amazon is absolutely AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything under the sun and even though some products have given me decent results, this kit has given me the best results</li>
            <li>That being said, my skin has not been able to reach that flawless, soft, glowing state</li>
            <li>Tried many products over the years and this by far is the best for hormonal breakouts!  </li>
            <li>have used up my first bottle and am still just so happy.</li>
            <li>The smell of the face wash is light and pleasant, not too strong.</li>
            <li>And, after years of trying tons of different products, this is the best solution I have found, by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Coral Actives!</li>
            <li>and just over all break out more .</li>
            <li>I am close to 40, so the relief this product has provided is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to buy a moisturizer that works for your face with it :)</li>
            <li>But obaji a was too drying on the neck and cost 3 4 times more.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the cleanser</li>
            <li>I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I have switched to Maple Holistics shampoo/conditioner and that has cleared by backne better than anything else.</li>
            <li>I have even changed all my makeup on more than one occasion to anything new and great with anti acne</li>
            <li>Worth the money!!</li>
            <li>Both times I used to product for a minimum of 4 months and even got upgraded to the more advanced formulas.  </li>
            <li>(yes, I loved it so much, I had to tell everyone</li>
            <li>I really hope that this kit will continue to work for me because I now feel so much more confident about my skin!</li>
            <li>Coral Actives cleared up my daughter&#x27; s blemishes very quickly.</li>
            <li>However, the contents seemed in the bottles seemed fine</li>
            <li>I am also sensitive to perfumes and these have light, pleasant scents that don&#x27;t bother me either.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen huge results but seems to be helping witht my acne out breaks</li>
            <li>I was so happy to know that these reviews are actually read!  </li>
            <li>It really does wonders on on acne prone skin!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just really excited to see where my skin&#x27;s going.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that seems to prevent more acne breakouts &amp; evens my skin tone.</li>
            <li>But this did all it needed to while leaving my skin balanced and clean.</li>
            <li>I just received this in the mail, so have yet to give the product a full trial run.</li>
            <li>I wanted a better skin care line that would really nip the acne in the butt.</li>
            <li>I love the gentle retinol cleanser.</li>
            <li>Came quickly to my door.</li>
            <li>and they go away super</li>
            <li>I woke up with a clear nose, no little blackheads, no redness, so irritation, I was so happy.</li>
            <li>(If I don&#x27;t get the new box, I&#x27;ll update this :-) )</li>
            <li>I read great reviews, so tried it, but it seemed to have little impact on our skin.</li>
            <li>It really cleans everything off, makes my skin smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Oil Free moisturizer!</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed into your skin, it doesn&#x27;t sit on it and</li>
            <li>I used this right away.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>and I was told a new box would be coming in the mail, free of charge, and he was looking into how the mistake happened.  </li>
            <li>Once when it very fist became popular several years ago, and then again at the beginning of this year.  </li>
            <li>wish I could say that I stayed calm and collected throughout this whole thing but that&#x27;d be lying.</li>
            <li>the top flap was ripped open.</li>
            <li>My skin became very irritated and this product clogged my pores!</li>
            <li>I tried many products but everything seems to be for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I really really want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very well, I&#x27;ll post it here then:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It is really upsetting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>and it is still working really well</li>
            <li>the top closed.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make that much of a difference that I saw.</li>
            <li>But, it, just like all other products, seem to be effective on my skin for about a month, but then completely stop working or even start to have adverse affects.  </li>
            <li>More than any other product I tried except obaji benzoyl line.</li>
            <li>I use this every day with the items and my skin looks great and I only really notice pimples with hormones fluctuations, but nothing in between; and very few, nothing major if anything noticeable at all.</li>
            <li>I can have really oily skin sometimes, or super dry skin or combinations of that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything OTC (which I&#x27;m sure you all have too), and have tried a few things from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>If it wanted to stay normal, it would stay normal-- until it wanted to be oily.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet received the new box</li>
            <li>The serum is strong and may need to slowly be introduced at first</li>
            <li>Within the first week, I had a few huge, deep zits on my face that hurt and lasted a while.</li>
            <li>Coral Actives has made my skin clear of acne and feel revitalized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 28 years old and have had acne for 15 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are such gentle products.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these do not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money.  </li>
            <li>Has helped my adult hormonal cystic acne quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t home to take the call but a very apologetic message was left</li>
            <li>have red hair, blue eyes and very light, sensitive pale skin.</li>
            <li>All the major drugstore brands, all the department store brands, the things you see on TV, kits you can buy online or at the natural food stores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4 full days have gone by and all the little lumps and bumps are going away.</li>
            <li>I continued to use the product, hoping it would have to get worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li>The top had been broken off and then covered with paper towels and</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to Benzoyl Peroxide, so I have to do small areas first.</li>
            <li>Not only has my acne seriously subsided, but I have also seen a significant decrease in old scare and red marks.  </li>

            <li> It mainly just dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> I am used to the cleansers leave my skin either too oily, not clean or super dry and tight.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much clearer in the past month of using this product.</li>
            <li> Long lasting results</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning: I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using their tea tree oil moisturizer as it made my face break out worse than before and dried it up beyond belief, but this 2 step system is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I tried updating my first review, which was not a good one, because when I opened the undamaged shipping box, I found a damaged product box and a damaged bottle of the Coral Actives cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I will be a consistant consumer for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have found things that I thought would work long term, or for all of my acne.</li>
            <li> It is also not natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 32-year-old female with hormonal imbalance (due to PCOS).</li>
            <li> I will stick with this for as long as I can find it!</li>
            <li> Or dry.</li>
            <li> It has balanced out since the large blemishes, but I see no good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing my skin look worse than it did the day before, every single day since [Comic-] Con.</li>
            <li> I, like many, have tried every product out there for my acne only to constantly be disappointed by products with a lot of hype.  </li>
            <li> so I do still get very small breakouts during extremely stressful times, but they are very manageable and short-lived.  </li>
            <li> and if I do get a new one, its small and gone in no time at all!</li>
            <li> horrible&lt;br /&gt;if made my face greasy and dry and tight.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely stressful job/lifestyle</li>
            <li> but I am not entirely sure that type of product actually exists.  </li>
            <li> but it did dry my skin out a little and leave a little redness on my forehead</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen my skin look so bad... in my entire life.</li>
            <li> This stuff made me break out horribly after a few weeks of use, and my skin became much more oily due to the over-drying side effect of this product, even using it only once a day.</li>
            <li> I was breaking out 4-5 times a week - mainly with cystic hormonal breakouts (the deep skin painful bumps).</li>
            <li> I have found a few things that work, for a while, or half way while trying all these things.</li>
            <li> The bottle inside looked a little grubby.</li>
            <li> I have up&#x27;ed my water intake, I cut out greasy foods, washed with green tea, drank cup after cup of green tea.  </li>
            <li> so I will use this every few nights or so.</li>
            <li> vaguely remember reading something short about the Coral Active and thought, why not.</li>
            <li> looked like it was a badly returned item: the box containing the wash was pretty beat up and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hiding my skin for the past 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still do get a small whitehead here and there, but nothing like before - its manageable</li>
            <li> Either the next day or perhaps the day after, I was called from a Coral Actives rep who had read my unhappy review.  </li>
            <li> And now that  I am over 25, I get really upset, why should I still have to deal with annoying acne.</li>
            <li> And when I say &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; I mean marks I have been dealing with for years.  </li>
            <li> I also left a very unhappy message on Amazon, since I could not find how to do so for Dermawand.</li>
            <li> This smells a little weird, but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> Did not work, made my skin worse!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work for us.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old and have had acne for 15 years. I&#x27;ve tried everything OTC (which I&#x27;m sure you all have too), and have tried a few things from the dermatologist. I read good reviews about CoralActives and thought I would try it out. Within the first week, I had a few huge, deep zits on my face that hurt and lasted a while. I continued to use the product, hoping it would have to get worse before it gets better. But since, my acne still has not improved. It has balanced out since the large blemishes, but I see no good results. Even my blackheads seem bigger. It did not work for me, but maybe it has for others.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the results I have gotten from this Coral Actives acne treatment.  I, like many, have tried every product out there for my acne only to constantly be disappointed by products with a lot of hype.  I have even tried ProActive on several different occasions.  Once when it very fist became popular several years ago, and then again at the beginning of this year.  Both times I used to product for a minimum of 4 months and even got upgraded to the more advanced formulas.  But, it, just like all other products, seem to be effective on my skin for about a month, but then completely stop working or even start to have adverse affects.  I have been using this Coral Actives product for about 5 months now and could not be happier with the results.  Not only has my acne seriously subsided, but I have also seen a significant decrease in old scare and red marks.  And when I say &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; I mean marks I have been dealing with for years.  Additionally, I have even seen a reduction in the size of my pores, which is amazing.  I have an extremely stressful job/lifestyle so I do still get very small breakouts during extremely stressful times, but they are very manageable and short-lived.  That being said, my skin has not been able to reach that flawless, soft, glowing state that all of us desire, but I am not entirely sure that type of product actually exists.  And, after years of trying tons of different products, this is the best solution I have found, by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Coral Actives!</li>
            <li> Came quickly to my door. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to copy and paste what I wrote on FB (yes, I loved it so much, I had to tell everyone I know).&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So. Confession time. I&#x27;ve been hiding my skin for the past 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the longest time, I&#x27;ve had issues with my skin. If it wanted to stay normal, it would stay normal-- until it wanted to be oily. Or dry. Or break out whenever it felt like it. I&#x27;ve been seeing my skin look worse than it did the day before, every single day since [Comic-] Con. This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen my skin look so bad... in my entire life. I had cystic acne, pimples, and zits; essentially a cocktail of different skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say that I stayed calm and collected throughout this whole thing but that&#x27;d be lying. So I googled up some over-the-counter retinol treatments and &amp;#34;Coral Actives&amp;#34; popped up. It&#x27;s got retinol, sea whip extract, and benzyl peroxide to fight acne and help resurface the skin. The 2-step treatment I ordered off of Amazon is absolutely AMAZING. It makes me want to touch my face all the time but I won&#x27;t. It&#x27;s unsanitary. But I want to. I really really want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 full days have gone by and all the little lumps and bumps are going away. I&#x27;m just really excited to see where my skin&#x27;s going.</li>
            <li> This product cleared my achne after about 3 days of use. For whatever reason I waited until I was in my 40&#x27;s to have chin breakouts, and nothing worked until now. I will be a consistant consumer for a long time.</li>
            <li> Coral Actives has made my skin clear of acne and feel revitalized. The smell of the face wash is light and pleasant, not too strong. The serum is strong and may need to slowly be introduced at first but it is great. I do not plan on changing my face regimen any time soon. 10 out of 10 in my book!</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail, so have yet to give the product a full trial run. This review is for the seller, because of how the item was shipped. It arrived looking like the last unwanted item from a dollar store clearance rack...banged up and ripped open, grubby inside the packaging. When I attempted to leave this seller feedback, Amazon deleted it saying that it was a product review. Very well, I&#x27;ll post it here then:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item looked like it was a badly returned item: the box containing the wash was pretty beat up and the top flap was ripped open. The bottle inside looked a little grubby. However, the contents seemed in the bottles seemed fine so I didn&#x27;t return the items.....but next time I&#x27;d appreciate not getting items that looked like they&#x27;d been kicked around the warehouse floor before mailing.</li>
            <li> Used to use ProActive but wasn&#x27;t getting great results. Coral Actives cleared up my daughter&#x27; s blemishes very quickly. She loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 32-year-old female with hormonal imbalance (due to PCOS). I was breaking out 4-5 times a week - mainly with cystic hormonal breakouts (the deep skin painful bumps). I&#x27;ve tried just about everything under the sun and even though some products have given me decent results, this kit has given me the best results so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this kit for 3 weeks only at night before bed and it&#x27;s making a world of a difference. My skin is clearer, brighter, and smoother. I haven&#x27;t had a cystic breakout since I started using this! I still do get a small whitehead here and there, but nothing like before - its manageable and they go away super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are such gentle products. I have sensitive skin and these do not bother me at all. I am also sensitive to perfumes and these have light, pleasant scents that don&#x27;t bother me either. These products are easy to use and very effective. I really hope that this kit will continue to work for me because I now feel so much more confident about my skin!</li>
            <li> horrible&lt;br /&gt;if made my face greasy and dry and tight. and just over all break out more . I dont recommend it</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, I have oily acne-prone skin.  I tried many products but everything seems to be for dry skin.  I read about this product in the Oprah magazine and it is great!  I use the two part product in the night and have already seen a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It really does wonders on on acne prone skin!!! Worth the money!! Long lasting results</li>
            <li> Did not work, made my skin worse!  Do NOT waste your money.  I went back to regular proactive!  My skin became very irritated and this product clogged my pores!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work for us.  I read great reviews, so tried it, but it seemed to have little impact on our skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that seems to prevent more acne breakouts &amp; evens my skin tone. It arrived earlier than was stated by the seller. If only I had taken before &amp; now pictures of my face. I will definitely buy this product again &amp; I&#x27;ll buy if from this seller!</li>
            <li> My skin is so much clearer in the past month of using this product. I have not had one breakout since! I am close to 40, so the relief this product has provided is fantastic! Very happy.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you my story. I was using proactiv and it was like all of a sudden, it stopped working. I switched to Neutrogena products and Clearisil... to no avail. I wanted a better skin care line that would really nip the acne in the butt. Well let me tell you, this works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 2 weeks, my pimples have been healed and cleared and if I do get a new one, its small and gone in no time at all! I use the cleanser about 3 times a day (Morning, take make up off in the middle of the day, and night) and I use the Benzoyl Peroxide 3x a day as well. This skin care is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just be sure to buy a moisturizer that works for your face with it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using their tea tree oil moisturizer as it made my face break out worse than before and dried it up beyond belief, but this 2 step system is fantastic! I use Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Oil Free moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Has helped my adult hormonal cystic acne quite a bit. More than any other product I tried except obaji benzoyl line. But obaji a was too drying on the neck and cost 3 4 times more. I will,order thai again. Very good price as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff made me break out horribly after a few weeks of use, and my skin became much more oily due to the over-drying side effect of this product, even using it only once a day. Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I will start by letting you know about my skin, to see if this would work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have red hair, blue eyes and very light, sensitive pale skin. I have been dealing with acne for years, since I hit puberty I guess. And now that  I am over 25, I get really upset, why should I still have to deal with annoying acne. I can have really oily skin sometimes, or super dry skin or combinations of that. It is really upsetting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have tried it all. All the major drugstore brands, all the department store brands, the things you see on TV, kits you can buy online or at the natural food stores. I have tried every home made remedy, mustard, turmeric,  honey, baking soda, tea tree oil, neem oil, yogurt masks, everything. I have up&#x27;ed my water intake, I cut out greasy foods, washed with green tea, drank cup after cup of green tea.  I have found a few things that work, for a while, or half way while trying all these things. I have found things that I thought would work long term, or for all of my acne. I get blackheads and whiteheads and sometimes the \\&quot;cystic\\&quot; acne under the skin that ache. I have even changed all my makeup on more than one occasion to anything new and great with anti acne hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I vaguely remember reading something short about the Coral Active and thought, why not. I used this right away. I love the gentle retinol cleanser. It really cleans everything off, makes my skin smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I am used to the cleansers leave my skin either too oily, not clean or super dry and tight. But this did all it needed to while leaving my skin balanced and clean. I fell in love with the cleanser right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I put the Acne Serum on my nose to test it. I am sensitive to Benzoyl Peroxide, so I have to do small areas first. I woke up with a clear nose, no little blackheads, no redness, so irritation, I was so happy. This smells a little weird, but not in a bad way. It gets absorbed into your skin, it doesn&#x27;t sit on it and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the serum again for a second night and it worked, no pimples but it did dry my skin out a little and leave a little redness on my forehead so I will use this every few nights or so. I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try! It can&#x27;t hurt....it may be just what you were looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used up my first bottle and am still just so happy. I use this every day with the items and my skin looks great and I only really notice pimples with hormones fluctuations, but nothing in between; and very few, nothing major if anything noticeable at all. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this.  I love this and it is still working really well, my only face help I use!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen huge results but seems to be helping witht my acne out breaks so no complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> I tried updating my first review, which was not a good one, because when I opened the undamaged shipping box, I found a damaged product box and a damaged bottle of the Coral Actives cleanser.  The top had been broken off and then covered with paper towels and the top closed.  I was the unlucky one who received this package.  I ordered from Dermawand.  I tried to call Dermawand but there was no phone number so the best I could do was call Amazon Customer Service who credited my account.  I also left a very unhappy message on Amazon, since I could not find how to do so for Dermawand. Either the next day or perhaps the day after, I was called from a Coral Actives rep who had read my unhappy review.  I wasn&#x27;t home to take the call but a very apologetic message was left and I was told a new box would be coming in the mail, free of charge, and he was looking into how the mistake happened.  He also left me his personal cell phone to call if I felt it necessary.  I haven&#x27;t yet received the new box but I have no doubt that I will.  And I wanted to share this before I forgot.  If there&#x27;s a phone number with the package, I will call and pay for it, since I ordered two and kept the one that was not damaged, and my account has already been credited.  I was so happy to know that these reviews are actually read!  So if you&#x27;re reading this, Coral Actives, I hope you included your phone number!  Thank you for the great customer service.  (If I don&#x27;t get the new box, I&#x27;ll update this :-) )</li>
            <li> Tried many products over the years and this by far is the best for hormonal breakouts!  I will stick with this for as long as I can find it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make that much of a difference that I saw. It mainly just dried my skin out. It is also not natural. I have switched to Maple Holistics shampoo/conditioner and that has cleared by backne better than anything else.</li>
