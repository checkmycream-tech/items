            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>used it for 3 weeks, still in great shape.  </li>
            <li>Great price to go with it.</li>
            <li>It is a great scrubber, but I have not yet figured out how to get soap into it, so it is not so great as a cleaner.  </li>
            <li>However, it feels great as a scrubber/scratching.</li>
            <li>So handy, and with a dollop of body wash I get worn out before the scrubbing ends!  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Not good with bar soap, lathered well with body bath.</li>
            <li>it is a good product</li>
            <li>Good Quality, good service</li>
            <li>Timely delivery and good packaging.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I wonder if it is a conspiracy because they always get rid of the good stuff once I discover it.  </li>
            <li>I WISH dearly that they worked because the dimensions are good.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if the product is any good or not.</li>
            <li>This gets to it and gets it good.  </li>
            <li>They couldn&#x27;t find a fair price to sell one alone.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t anyone make one good quality</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a good length for me and works well.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see this, because it seemed like it would be a great tool for someone with a handicap, and it is.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price ....was a great stocking stuffer for my family who deserves a great exfoliation of there back side</li>
            <li>Also, it does a better job than a brush to exfoliate!</li>
            <li>Love my products !</li>
            <li>Better than a loofa!</li>
            <li>So we got a good chuckle out of it.  :-)  </li>
            <li>It holds lather nicely.  </li>
            <li>nice colors.</li>
            <li>well, it works nicely</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s machine washable is also great because it helps keep it clean and prevent mold and mildew.  </li>
            <li>shipped perfectly, nothing more I can really say.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>These puppies work great for getting at the parts of your back that you can&#x27;t reach and they feel great</li>
            <li>This is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Silky Smooth Skin for sure!  </li>
            <li>And i will be ordering  another one, very very very soon!!!</li>
            <li>Delivers the best back scrub experience of your life.</li>
            <li>love it would buy again</li>
            <li>but I am more of a brush person, otherwise I would have given it a 5 star.</li>
            <li>so pleased to find this.</li>
            <li>They are just ok products.</li>
            <li>ha ha love it</li>
            <li>its better than reaching with a rag and your hand</li>
            <li>These back scrubbers are awesome and do the job every time.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I found them here on Amazon though.  </li>
            <li>These I love, should have repurchased these instead of going cheaper.</li>
            <li>As with all of my reviews I will be sure to follow up should the quality degrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>free to ask any questions that you have!</li>
            <li>I need nineteen more words to describe &amp;#34;awful&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not going to buy 3 more for that price when people complain about them falling apart.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This scrubber seemed okay out of the box</li>
            <li>Its more of a design flaw than anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna make my own handles that secure better.</li>
            <li>Cheap,cheap, cheap!</li>
            <li>Excellent back scrubber</li>
            <li>I love the material</li>
            <li>I am glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would last a couple months while I searched for my ideal one.</li>
            <li>After a Florida hot summer day working in the garden, that clean is a GOOD feeling.  </li>
            <li>My original scrubber was more of a Scotch-Brite pad with cord on the ends.</li>
            <li>But fall apart very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle with rope handles on each end.</li>
            <li>easy to use for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
            <li>So easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>I cant ask for much more, therefore I have no reason not to rate it my rare 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great for washing your back</li>
            <li>I like it because it is light weight</li>
            <li>I thought they would make a cheap stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool for back cleaning.  </li>
            <li>great back cleaner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found them really cheap on another site.</li>
            <li>up quick, rinses easily and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Until then peace and much respect!!!</li>
            <li>It scrubs my back very nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, causes the soap to lather well, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>easy to use, does a good job exfoliating the back.</li>
            <li>and it shrank significantly between uses.</li>
            <li>otherwise you&#x27;ll just be partially clean.  </li>
            <li>He loves this because it does a great job cleaning - and it also helps exfoliate dry skin.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done but not in the most easy way available because you have to go an extra mile to bend your back and hold it in a certain manner for you to get the best use from</li>
            <li>these are nice for old folks who have to be in the shower alone</li>
            <li>I liked using the scrubber, but it got all pilled up (like an old sweater) way too soon.</li>
            <li>Makes a good back scratcher too.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m going back to my Aquis brand, which I&#x27;ve LOVED.</li>
            <li>Look elsewhere for a good back scrub!</li>
            <li>Drains and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>This works wonderfully for scrubbing backs while in the shower and helps remove dead skin and makes skin much softer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to get this in colors other than &amp;#34;sea sponge tan&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is a good back scrubber, and I can finally be able to clean my back each time</li>
            <li>it does exactly what is supposed to do!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made, solid, feels great on my back, cleans and dries easily.</li>
            <li>Works great, and every few weeks I put it in the washing machine on the hottest setting to get decontaminated.</li>
            <li>The material is too rough for me, and the quality is not so good.</li>
            <li>Nice for getting your back in the shower.</li>
            <li>After attempting to use it, the product started to pill and come apart in chunks and then the middle just kind of crumbled.</li>
            <li>frist one broke right away.</li>
            <li>I assumed that I would receive more than just one of these scrubbers from looking at the picture and from the $10 price, since I paid about $3.00 for one at Target and WalMart, but apparently I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for quick delivery also  .</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t want to spend so much each time because it deteriorates so quickly.</li>
            <li>I thought that this back scrubber was great, and the answer to my prayers (I have arthritic shoulders and cannot reach my back) - until the first time I machine-washed it.  </li>
            <li>So far this scrubber works fine.</li>
            <li>And I use to be able to get them at Walmart for a third of the price.</li>
            <li>The rope on one of the sides broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It broke literally the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish that was better is that they lasted longer before having to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>handle broke on the first day of usage.</li>
            <li>I first thought it would be too scrubby</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t much more than a week before it was almost wore through in the middle.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>I love my Back Scrubber!  </li>
            <li>I love this back exfoliator!</li>
            <li>Love these back scrubbers</li>
            <li>The strap broke from the pad upon first use.  </li>
            <li>Also, they were kind enough to send my a color a man can live with.</li>
            <li>He was more concerned with washing, not exfoliating, so I will be getting him one that is soft on one side and exfoliating on the other to see if he likes it better.  </li>
            <li>I rinsed it very well with hot water until the water was clear, and it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li>The one that I received was a dull ivory colour, more similar to grey and would have been more satisfied to have received a more upbeat colour.</li>
            <li>You just have to wet it and then run a bar of soap along it, then it covers the back and feels great.</li>
            <li>an extra added bonus, I also use it when it&#x27;s dry, as the world&#x27;s best back scratcher,</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t use a scrubber I end up w/ an itchy back, and after using this one for several weeks I don&#x27;t have itches, so PERHAPS it&#x27;s as good.</li>
            <li>It feels pretty much like sandpaper.</li>
            <li>As my shoulders become more stiff with age this allows me to massage and scrub my own back.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on sensitive skin, and really leaves skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>something&#x27;s easy to use to wash my back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly buy another if/when this one wears out.  </li>
            <li>Decent price, does exactly what I want it to.  </li>
            <li>So much nicer than any brush or loofah</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I feel like the exfoliating part works really well too.</li>
            <li>Its much softer than what it should be.</li>
            <li>The item is made very robust so tugging it a bit stronger won&#x27;t break it.</li>
            <li>The product is okay, not really &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; but would do its job.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain too much for the price.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t hold the soap very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am VERY disappinted in it.</li>
            <li>I wanted but was sent a pink one, which is my favorite color.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;He really likes this.  </li>
            <li>nice texture, pliable, big enough for me to use who is not as flexible as i use to be.</li>
            <li>This product works very nicely but is starting to come apart at the seams after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I lost my original back scrubber a couple of moves ago.</li>
            <li>My back feels squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a good back scrubber, however it is a little abrassive--kind of like using scotchbrite on your skin.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and it works as I expected.  </li>
            <li>LONG back scrubber  any more.?</li>
            <li>Different but useful item.</li>
            <li>but it seems like a lot of trouble to go to when I have so many bath brushes and scrubbers.  </li>
            <li>However, it is just the right consistency (enough to exfoliate but not rip your skin off).</li>
            <li>just enough scratchiness to clean your back really well.</li>
            <li>And besides I&#x27;ve found that I really like the cheapest of them all, a sisal scrubber which really relieves my itchy back.  </li>
            <li>He says it is long enough for him and really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Wow - this thing helps you reach everywhere!</li>
            <li>I recently got a tattoo on my back and wanted to make sure that I cared for it properly.</li>
            <li>It holds the soap well and scratches my back pretty well while cleaning it.</li>
            <li>The scrubber now curls up into a vertical roll - the only part that touches my back is the sateen ribbon edging, which doesn&#x27;t clean or scrub at all.  </li>
            <li>My expectations for this scrubber wasn&#x27;t very high, given that it was sold for only $5.</li>
            <li>Obviously this is a cheap product, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be anything fancy, but really what is the point of making something at all if you aren&#x27;t going to try even a little?</li>
            <li>So nice to have something that allows you to scrub those hard to reach areas of your back.  </li>
            <li>To be clear I am using this 1-2 months after getting a tattoo</li>
            <li>The use is very simple and straight</li>
            <li>Scrubs my back very well.    </li>
            <li>It was a real John Wayne back scrubber.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;scrubber&amp;#34; is too soft.  </li>
            <li>bathing back is so much easier with this.</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive backs as it&#x27;s pretty rough.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would do to improve it would be to make it 6 inches longer, because I&#x27;m 6 feet tall and have a pretty big</li>
            <li>Works really well but also breaks down really really fast.</li>
            <li>This &#x27;scrubber&#x27; is quite a bit less &#x27;rough&#x27; than another one we have, so at this point I&#x27;m not convinced that it does as good a job as the other does, but time will tell.</li>
            <li>I can tell I&#x27;m really going to like this for a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long, and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>After using it a few times, I discovered it started falling apart, ripping where I&#x27;d hold it mostly, but in other places as well.</li>
            <li>Great quality and do a great job of getting dead skin dirt and other nasty stuff off your skin in the places that are always the hardest to reach.  </li>
            <li>but I should have read a little more carefully because it&#x27;s just too darn short.  </li>
            <li>It really works as expected.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend to anyone especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The soap is concentrated in the fabric of this item, but it is the EDGES that make the most contact with skin, so these are poorly functioning items.  </li>
            <li>when you use it, it doesnt stay flat against your skin just the side edges touches your skin, hard to explain but using a giant towel would work better than this</li>
            <li>They tend to fuzz out and loose their scrubbing ability after a couple of weeks to a month of washing but same is true of other wash aids like loufas etc.</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s trick in getting rid of old skin on your back and reaching all parts of your back, but I would not recommend this product to any friend of mine.</li>
            <li>and I bought this mainly for my husband and a pink one arrived.  </li>
            <li>I got the pink one and it bled pink the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I know it isn&#x27;t super expensive, but I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting that short of a life out of it.</li>
            <li>Looked high and low at my usual stores and found only really soft scrubbers.  </li>

            <li> This is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Silky Smooth Skin for sure!  </li>
            <li> And i will be ordering  another one, very very very soon!!!</li>
            <li> Delivers the best back scrub experience of your life.</li>
            <li> love it would buy again</li>
            <li> but I am more of a brush person, otherwise I would have given it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> so pleased to find this.</li>
            <li> They are just ok products.</li>
            <li> ha ha love it</li>
            <li> its better than reaching with a rag and your hand</li>
            <li> These back scrubbers are awesome and do the job every time.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I found them here on Amazon though.  </li>
            <li> These I love, should have repurchased these instead of going cheaper.</li>
            <li> As with all of my reviews I will be sure to follow up should the quality degrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> free to ask any questions that you have!</li>
            <li> I need nineteen more words to describe &amp;#34;awful&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> and I love them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not going to buy 3 more for that price when people complain about them falling apart.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> This scrubber seemed okay out of the box</li>
            <li> Its more of a design flaw than anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna make my own handles that secure better.</li>
            <li> Cheap,cheap, cheap!</li>
            <li> Excellent back scrubber</li>
            <li> I love the material</li>
            <li> I am glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would last a couple months while I searched for my ideal one.</li>
            <li> After a Florida hot summer day working in the garden, that clean is a GOOD feeling.  </li>
            <li> My original scrubber was more of a Scotch-Brite pad with cord on the ends.</li>
            <li> But fall apart very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle with rope handles on each end.</li>
            <li> easy to use for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
            <li> So easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I cant ask for much more, therefore I have no reason not to rate it my rare 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great for washing your back</li>
            <li> I like it because it is light weight</li>
            <li> I thought they would make a cheap stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for back cleaning.  </li>
            <li> great back cleaner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found them really cheap on another site.</li>
            <li> up quick, rinses easily and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Until then peace and much respect!!!</li>
            <li> It scrubs my back very nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, causes the soap to lather well, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> easy to use, does a good job exfoliating the back.</li>
            <li> and it shrank significantly between uses.</li>
            <li> otherwise you&#x27;ll just be partially clean.  </li>
            <li> He loves this because it does a great job cleaning - and it also helps exfoliate dry skin.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done but not in the most easy way available because you have to go an extra mile to bend your back and hold it in a certain manner for you to get the best use from</li>
            <li> these are nice for old folks who have to be in the shower alone</li>
            <li> I liked using the scrubber, but it got all pilled up (like an old sweater) way too soon.</li>
            <li> Makes a good back scratcher too.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going back to my Aquis brand, which I&#x27;ve LOVED.</li>
            <li> Look elsewhere for a good back scrub!</li>
            <li> Drains and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully for scrubbing backs while in the shower and helps remove dead skin and makes skin much softer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to get this in colors other than &amp;#34;sea sponge tan&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a good back scrubber, and I can finally be able to clean my back each time</li>
            <li> it does exactly what is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, solid, feels great on my back, cleans and dries easily.</li>
            <li> Works great, and every few weeks I put it in the washing machine on the hottest setting to get decontaminated.</li>
            <li> The material is too rough for me, and the quality is not so good.</li>
            <li> Nice for getting your back in the shower.</li>
            <li> After attempting to use it, the product started to pill and come apart in chunks and then the middle just kind of crumbled.</li>
            <li> frist one broke right away.</li>
            <li> I assumed that I would receive more than just one of these scrubbers from looking at the picture and from the $10 price, since I paid about $3.00 for one at Target and WalMart, but apparently I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for quick delivery also  .</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to spend so much each time because it deteriorates so quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought that this back scrubber was great, and the answer to my prayers (I have arthritic shoulders and cannot reach my back) - until the first time I machine-washed it.  </li>
            <li> So far this scrubber works fine.</li>
            <li> And I use to be able to get them at Walmart for a third of the price.</li>
            <li> The rope on one of the sides broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It broke literally the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish that was better is that they lasted longer before having to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> handle broke on the first day of usage.</li>
            <li> I first thought it would be too scrubby</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t much more than a week before it was almost wore through in the middle.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I love my Back Scrubber!  </li>
            <li> I love this back exfoliator!</li>
            <li> Love these back scrubbers</li>
            <li> The strap broke from the pad upon first use.  </li>
            <li> Also, they were kind enough to send my a color a man can live with.</li>
            <li> He was more concerned with washing, not exfoliating, so I will be getting him one that is soft on one side and exfoliating on the other to see if he likes it better.  </li>
            <li> I rinsed it very well with hot water until the water was clear, and it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li> The one that I received was a dull ivory colour, more similar to grey and would have been more satisfied to have received a more upbeat colour.</li>
            <li> You just have to wet it and then run a bar of soap along it, then it covers the back and feels great.</li>
            <li> an extra added bonus, I also use it when it&#x27;s dry, as the world&#x27;s best back scratcher,</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use a scrubber I end up w/ an itchy back, and after using this one for several weeks I don&#x27;t have itches, so PERHAPS it&#x27;s as good.</li>
            <li> It feels pretty much like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> As my shoulders become more stiff with age this allows me to massage and scrub my own back.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on sensitive skin, and really leaves skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> something&#x27;s easy to use to wash my back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly buy another if/when this one wears out.  </li>
            <li> Decent price, does exactly what I want it to.  </li>
            <li> So much nicer than any brush or loofah</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I feel like the exfoliating part works really well too.</li>
            <li> Its much softer than what it should be.</li>
            <li> The item is made very robust so tugging it a bit stronger won&#x27;t break it.</li>
            <li> The product is okay, not really &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; but would do its job.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain too much for the price.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t hold the soap very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am VERY disappinted in it.</li>
            <li> I wanted but was sent a pink one, which is my favorite color.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He really likes this.  </li>
            <li> nice texture, pliable, big enough for me to use who is not as flexible as i use to be.</li>
            <li> This product works very nicely but is starting to come apart at the seams after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I lost my original back scrubber a couple of moves ago.</li>
            <li> My back feels squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> This is a good back scrubber, however it is a little abrassive--kind of like using scotchbrite on your skin.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and it works as I expected.  </li>
            <li> LONG back scrubber  any more.?</li>
            <li> Different but useful item.</li>
            <li> but it seems like a lot of trouble to go to when I have so many bath brushes and scrubbers.  </li>
            <li> However, it is just the right consistency (enough to exfoliate but not rip your skin off).</li>
            <li> just enough scratchiness to clean your back really well.</li>
            <li> And besides I&#x27;ve found that I really like the cheapest of them all, a sisal scrubber which really relieves my itchy back.  </li>
            <li> He says it is long enough for him and really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Wow - this thing helps you reach everywhere!</li>
            <li> I recently got a tattoo on my back and wanted to make sure that I cared for it properly.</li>
            <li> It holds the soap well and scratches my back pretty well while cleaning it.</li>
            <li> The scrubber now curls up into a vertical roll - the only part that touches my back is the sateen ribbon edging, which doesn&#x27;t clean or scrub at all.  </li>
            <li> My expectations for this scrubber wasn&#x27;t very high, given that it was sold for only $5.</li>
            <li> Obviously this is a cheap product, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be anything fancy, but really what is the point of making something at all if you aren&#x27;t going to try even a little?</li>
            <li> So nice to have something that allows you to scrub those hard to reach areas of your back.  </li>
            <li> To be clear I am using this 1-2 months after getting a tattoo</li>
            <li> The use is very simple and straight</li>
            <li> Scrubs my back very well.    </li>
            <li> It was a real John Wayne back scrubber.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;scrubber&amp;#34; is too soft.  </li>
            <li> bathing back is so much easier with this.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive backs as it&#x27;s pretty rough.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would do to improve it would be to make it 6 inches longer, because I&#x27;m 6 feet tall and have a pretty big</li>
            <li> Works really well but also breaks down really really fast.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;scrubber&#x27; is quite a bit less &#x27;rough&#x27; than another one we have, so at this point I&#x27;m not convinced that it does as good a job as the other does, but time will tell.</li>
            <li> I can tell I&#x27;m really going to like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Other than that it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times, I discovered it started falling apart, ripping where I&#x27;d hold it mostly, but in other places as well.</li>
            <li> Great quality and do a great job of getting dead skin dirt and other nasty stuff off your skin in the places that are always the hardest to reach.  </li>
            <li> but I should have read a little more carefully because it&#x27;s just too darn short.  </li>
            <li> It really works as expected.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend to anyone especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The soap is concentrated in the fabric of this item, but it is the EDGES that make the most contact with skin, so these are poorly functioning items.  </li>
            <li> when you use it, it doesnt stay flat against your skin just the side edges touches your skin, hard to explain but using a giant towel would work better than this</li>
            <li> They tend to fuzz out and loose their scrubbing ability after a couple of weeks to a month of washing but same is true of other wash aids like loufas etc.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s trick in getting rid of old skin on your back and reaching all parts of your back, but I would not recommend this product to any friend of mine.</li>
            <li> and I bought this mainly for my husband and a pink one arrived.  </li>
            <li> I got the pink one and it bled pink the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I know it isn&#x27;t super expensive, but I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting that short of a life out of it.</li>
            <li> Looked high and low at my usual stores and found only really soft scrubbers.  </li>
            <li> This makes it very hard to clean anything....</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but it didn&#x27;t last very long before it started to fall apart.</li>
            <li> It works well, just don&#x27;t expect it to last very long if you use it for your feet or knees.</li>
            <li> the only problem with it is that when you&#x27;ve got your hands through each handle with it over your back, it tends to roll in half, putting the &#x27;finished edge&#x27; as what&#x27;s on your back - and since it&#x27;s a bit hard to maneuver, it&#x27;s hard to readjust to make sure the exfoliating part is on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, any other color would work fine with them  - white, blue or green.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing that one isn&#x27;t able to select a colour of choice.  </li>
            <li> , I wanted a pink &amp; blue one</li>
            <li> not directly after!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had one for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> nothing for &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also too long in length.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these in stores anywhere, read reviews, this one seems sturdy and is rough enough to be exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It fell apart pretty quick :(</li>
            <li> Other handle broke on the 3rd day.</li>
            <li> This little miracle helped me reach those spots that were always most difficult.</li>
            <li> I expect the other one to break shortly.</li>
            <li> I would actually like to return the scrubber, it was very rough on the skin</li>
            <li> Hangs in the shower but can also be used dry.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to get him something that would dry</li>
            <li> Bought this for by 6&#x27;2\\&quot; husband who has trouble reaching his entire back.  </li>
            <li> Not worth even the low price at which it is offered.  </li>
            <li> my back is less dry and itchy since I have started using this thing...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit hard to use in a tight shower: I banged my elbows on the fiberglass and door several times the first time.</li>
            <li> Rough and tough and put the dirt right down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for only a few weeks before the fibers started coming loose and rolling, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to maneuver for back scrubbing despite the handles, and by the end of the second use it was severely misshapen so that I ended up using it as a loofah.</li>
            <li> wanted it to be rough and it was.</li>
            <li> but I got 2 pink</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rough &amp; to me that means it is cleaning.</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Do not work as expected.</li>
            <li> but When it gets wet it becomes quite smooth/soft.</li>
            <li> The color didn&#x27;t stain my shower, I could just see pink suds circling the drain.  </li>
            <li> But pink, and both?</li>
            <li> After one use these scrubbers start to fray and there is just not much there to scrub with.</li>
            <li> It is hard to keep it flat when washing my back</li>
            <li> Because I can&#x27;t reach behind me with a bad shoulder, but can clean my back real well holding on to both sides.</li>
            <li> after further review, not as bad as I originally thought?</li>
            <li> throw these out every other month or so as the bacteria can build up.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected!</li>
            <li> And guess what, I received TWO PINK ONES!</li>
            <li> It works extremely well.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s bought brushes and other scrub products and he hates them all.</li>
            <li> Even after wetting and applying soap, the scrubber is very rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> Those hard to get spots on your back don&#x27;t stand a chance.</li>
            <li> Length is too short and makes it hard to manage..</li>
            <li> I Bought this back scrubber for my wife and I because at our age it&#x27;s difficult to reach all areas of our back.  </li>
            <li> After less than a month of use, it start to get very thin, and then it began to wear so thin, that it was developing holes, and at that point, it isn&#x27;t very useful.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there is no choice of color, but I can live with the color that came.</li>
            <li> A little scratchy</li>
            <li> After a while, it gets a little torn, sort of like picking cotton.</li>
            <li> pad is a little softer and flexible.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few, because of customer reviews.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> fell apart after a few use</li>
            <li> I wasted my money</li>
            <li> It is poorly designed, the outer material is not flexible and makes it so that the inner cleaning/scrubbing part doesn&#x27;t touch your skin.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a few inches longer</li>
            <li> Supposed to be somewhat but this one is just too stiff.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it takes very little soap to make it sudsy.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, one of the rope handles broke after the second use.</li>
            <li> Product basically folds in on itself when you pull it accross your back and is rendered useless.  </li>
            <li> This scrubber fails because the scrubber portion between the side stitching just doesn&#x27;t fall on my back.</li>
            <li> However, I am getting older so softer isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hard to use.</li>
            <li> She loves it and can now exfoliate hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that difficult to select a color, not much of a job, and should be done.</li>
            <li> Works, but a little awkward to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have thin skin?</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be like the one I had purchased previously but was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive to have to replace after a month.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Body scrubber&amp;#34; aka sponge is totally useless without handles.</li>
            <li> Very annoying - I&#x27;ve gone back to using a long-handled brush!</li>
            <li> The thing that bothers me, though, is that you can&#x27;t choose a color and will get a random one.</li>
            <li> Pack of 5 is way to expensive for these.</li>
            <li> This product hasn&#x27;t been used yet therefore I&#x27;m unable to comment on the quality.  </li>
            <li> Awkward for me.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a permanent wash cloth, and if it says it&#x27;s not, thats my bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible feel.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great product. nice texture, pliable, big enough for me to use who is not as flexible as i use to be.</li>
            <li> Looked high and low at my usual stores and found only really soft scrubbers.  I needed something a bit scratchy and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done but not in the most easy way available because you have to go an extra mile to bend your back and hold it in a certain manner for you to get the best use from it.&lt;br /&gt;Not good with bar soap, lathered well with body bath.</li>
            <li> Delivers the best back scrub experience of your life. It&#x27;s like scratching your back on a tree but no splinters!</li>
            <li> love it would buy again</li>
            <li> Very Simple...but when I injured my shoulder and my wife was away, I could not soap my back.  This did it.</li>
            <li> For some reason this did not work well for me. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it is a good product but I am more of a brush person, otherwise I would have given it a 5 star. Awkward for me.</li>
            <li> so pleased to find this. had one years ago and couldnt replace it locally</li>
            <li> Good Quality, good service</li>
            <li> They are just ok products. I ordered a few, because of customer reviews.</li>
            <li> It really works as expected. Easiest way to scrub your back.  A little scratchy but I am hoping it will soften up with use.</li>
            <li> Nobody likes to admitt they can&#x27;t do things they use to do. I can&#x27;t reach the middle of my back with a wash cloth anymore. So far this scrubber works fine. Also, they were kind enough to send my a color a man can live with.</li>
            <li> these are nice for old folks who have to be in the shower alone ha ha love it</li>
            <li> They work as needed. But fall apart very quickly. And I use to be able to get them at Walmart for a third of the price. Don&#x27;t think they are&lt;br /&gt;worth the price asked on Amazon. But can&#x27;t find them anywhere else these days.</li>
            <li> This is not what I want..I only used it for about 3 time after I purchased it. The material is too rough for me, and the quality is not so good. It&#x27;s too hard to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, solid, feels great on my back, cleans and dries easily. So much nicer than any brush or loofah I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> wanted it to be rough and it was.</li>
            <li> o.k. its better than reaching with a rag and your hand</li>
            <li> this product is not advertised correctly, It says assorted colors but does&amp;#34;nt  let you choose any colors, I wanted a pink &amp; blue one but I got 2 pink the add looks like you get all 5 colors</li>
            <li> This is very cheaply made.  The rope on one of the sides broke the first time I used it. Bummer!  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Great product.  Timely delivery and good packaging.  The only thing is that I didn&#x27;t have the option to choose the color and I bought this mainly for my husband and a pink one arrived.  So we got a good chuckle out of it.  :-)  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Wow - this thing helps you reach everywhere! Those hard to get spots on your back don&#x27;t stand a chance. I feel like the exfoliating part works really well too. the only problem with it is that when you&#x27;ve got your hands through each handle with it over your back, it tends to roll in half, putting the &#x27;finished edge&#x27; as what&#x27;s on your back - and since it&#x27;s a bit hard to maneuver, it&#x27;s hard to readjust to make sure the exfoliating part is on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m just a spaz but that&#x27;s my experience!</li>
            <li> Disintegrated within a week of use.  (I got the blue one.)  Holes started forming here and there, grew, and joined together in bigger holes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this product. I used it once and it shrank significantly between uses. It&#x27;s hard to maneuver for back scrubbing despite the handles, and by the end of the second use it was severely misshapen so that I ended up using it as a loofah. I threw it out after that and I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a permanent wash cloth, and if it says it&#x27;s not, thats my bad. Nevertheless, I still give it a 3 because i dont feel as if it washes my back that well. It sort of curls up, and only the edges scrub. After a while, it gets a little torn, sort of like picking cotton.</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars I would. It broke literally the first time I used it. Obviously this is a cheap product, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be anything fancy, but really what is the point of making something at all if you aren&#x27;t going to try even a little? I thought it would last a couple months while I searched for my ideal one. No such luck.</li>
            <li> I liked using the scrubber, but it got all pilled up (like an old sweater) way too soon. It&#x27;s too expensive to have to replace after a month. Also - the picture makes it look like you are getting all 4 colors. You aren&#x27;t - just one.</li>
            <li> This scrubber is not worth the money spent, it started to ball up the first week it was used which was 3 times. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received these items in 1 day!!!  Great product too.</li>
            <li> Because I can&#x27;t reach behind me with a bad shoulder, but can clean my back real well holding on to both sides. Also, it does a better job than a brush to exfoliate!</li>
            <li> I used it for only a few weeks before the fibers started coming loose and rolling, etc. It was still functional, but lost integrity.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do &amp; does it well. It arrived on time &amp; intact, which is always a bonus . It&#x27;s rough &amp; to me that means it is cleaning.</li>
            <li> These back scrubbers are awesome and do the job every time.  I had purchased them at local stores before but they seemed to have disappeared from store inventories.  Sometimes I wonder if it is a conspiracy because they always get rid of the good stuff once I discover it.  I am glad that I found them here on Amazon though.  Great quality and do a great job of getting dead skin dirt and other nasty stuff off your skin in the places that are always the hardest to reach.  The only thing I wish that was better is that they lasted longer before having to be replaced.  They tend to fuzz out and loose their scrubbing ability after a couple of weeks to a month of washing but same is true of other wash aids like loufas etc. so I guess you can&#x27;t expect this to last for longer either.</li>
            <li> This product works very nicely but is starting to come apart at the seams after a few uses. It does what it says but I will probably have to re-sew some spots.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;scrubber&#x27; is quite a bit less &#x27;rough&#x27; than another one we have, so at this point I&#x27;m not convinced that it does as good a job as the other does, but time will tell. When I don&#x27;t use a scrubber I end up w/ an itchy back, and after using this one for several weeks I don&#x27;t have itches, so PERHAPS it&#x27;s as good. Again - time will tell.</li>
            <li> These scrubbers are cheaper than what you find in the stores and they work just as well. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is an inexpensive back scrubber. I expect it to hold up for a month or two as reflected by the price. It is the same quality as purchased at a box store. I note no unraveling or problems with this one.i throw these out every other month or so as the bacteria can build up.</li>
            <li> I assumed that I would receive more than just one of these scrubbers from looking at the picture and from the $10 price, since I paid about $3.00 for one at Target and WalMart, but apparently I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look elsewhere, this is a ripoff price at $10.00.</li>
            <li> handle broke on the first day of usage. Other handle broke on the 3rd day. &amp;#34;Body scrubber&amp;#34; aka sponge is totally useless without handles.</li>
            <li> It fell apart pretty quick :(</li>
            <li> This back scrubber/brush gets at the places one can&#x27;t reach. Makes a good back scratcher too. Easy to handle with rope handles on each end. Drains and dries quickly. I like it!</li>
            <li> These I love, should have repurchased these instead of going cheaper.</li>
            <li> This little miracle helped me reach those spots that were always most difficult. I recently got a tattoo on my back and wanted to make sure that I cared for it properly. To be clear I am using this 1-2 months after getting a tattoo not directly after!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suds up quick, rinses easily and is easy to use. I cant ask for much more, therefore I have no reason not to rate it my rare 5 star rating. As with all of my reviews I will be sure to follow up should the quality degrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping!&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask any questions that you have!</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected. Its much softer than what it should be. Do not work as expected.</li>
            <li> The soap is concentrated in the fabric of this item, but it is the EDGES that make the most contact with skin, so these are poorly functioning items.  I WISH dearly that they worked because the dimensions are good.</li>
            <li> I need nineteen more words to describe &amp;#34;awful&amp;#34;.  I tried to use this thing and it &amp;#34;folded up&amp;#34; on me so I only got the satiny edging.  So I&#x27;m going back to my Aquis brand, which I&#x27;ve LOVED.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have had and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great for washing your back</li>
            <li> My expectations for this scrubber wasn&#x27;t very high, given that it was sold for only $5. The material feels rather coarse. Even after wetting and applying soap, the scrubber is very rough on my skin. It does it&#x27;s trick in getting rid of old skin on your back and reaching all parts of your back, but I would not recommend this product to any friend of mine.</li>
            <li> I thought that this back scrubber was great, and the answer to my prayers (I have arthritic shoulders and cannot reach my back) - until the first time I machine-washed it.  The scrubber now curls up into a vertical roll - the only part that touches my back is the sateen ribbon edging, which doesn&#x27;t clean or scrub at all.  Very annoying - I&#x27;ve gone back to using a long-handled brush!</li>
            <li> It is hard to keep it flat when washing my back so I twirl it before I start the wash my back. I like it because it is light weight and I can crunch it and use it like a wash rag.</li>
            <li> Have looked all over for these and you had them.  They are great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit hard to use in a tight shower: I banged my elbows on the fiberglass and door several times the first time.</li>
            <li> It works so well in the shower. I first thought it would be too scrubby but it&#x27;s not at all that way. The item is made very robust so tugging it a bit stronger won&#x27;t break it. The use is very simple and straight forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making this awesome product. I will buy again. â™¥</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but it didn&#x27;t last very long before it started to fall apart. The scrubber part was a floss sort of material but it wasn&#x27;t much more than a week before it was almost wore through in the middle. It works well, just don&#x27;t expect it to last very long if you use it for your feet or knees.</li>
            <li> Works great, and every few weeks I put it in the washing machine on the hottest setting to get decontaminated.</li>
            <li> It could be made clearer that there is only one in the package. I bought this thinking I was getting 4 of them but I just got one blue one. I was buying this for four people who share a house and having 4 color coded scrubbers seems like a simple enough gift. I am not going to buy 3 more for that price when people complain about them falling apart. I thought they would make a cheap stocking stuffer. I have no idea if the product is any good or not. I am stuck with it now and don&#x27;t need it personally.</li>
            <li> shipped perfectly, nothing more I can really say. great product. used it for 3 weeks, still in great shape.  Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I love it.  It is so easy to use and it works as I expected.  I recommend it to anyone that struggles to wash their back.</li>
            <li> This scrubber seemed okay out of the box but When it gets wet it becomes quite smooth/soft. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> easy to use, does a good job exfoliating the back.</li>
            <li> fell apart after a few use</li>
            <li> This back scrubber works well.  It&#x27;s a bit scratchy/rough enough to actually scrub your back, but not too abrasive, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A warning though - I got the pink one and it bled pink the first time I used it.  The color didn&#x27;t stain my shower, I could just see pink suds circling the drain.  I rinsed it very well with hot water until the water was clear, and it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li> after further review, not as bad as I originally thought?</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected!</li>
            <li> The product is okay, not really &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; but would do its job. The thing that bothers me, though, is that you can&#x27;t choose a color and will get a random one. So, I took a risk and ordered two for my husband and son. And guess what, I received TWO PINK ONES! What are the chances. Seriously, any other color would work fine with them  - white, blue or green. But pink, and both? Not happy. It&#x27;s not that difficult to select a color, not much of a job, and should be done.</li>
            <li> Decent price, does exactly what I want it to.  Scrubs my back very well.    Edit:    After using it a few times, I discovered it started falling apart, ripping where I&#x27;d hold it mostly, but in other places as well.</li>
            <li> Horrible feel.  I wasted my money</li>
            <li> My shoulder joints don&#x27;t work so well as I wish they did.  You know that spot on your back where you just can&#x27;t quite scrub or scratch?  This gets to it and gets it good.  It&#x27;s soft enough and rough enough.  It holds lather nicely.  My back feels squeaky clean.  After a Florida hot summer day working in the garden, that clean is a GOOD feeling.  I like the thing.</li>
            <li> Way to short...frist one broke right away. Now I know why they sell them in a bunch of 5 . They couldn&#x27;t find a fair price to sell one alone.  Pack of 5 is way to expensive for these. Can&#x27;t anyone make one good quality LONG back scrubber  any more.?</li>
            <li> I like this product because it takes very little soap to make it sudsy. I had one for quite a long time. it held up well and I am expecting this one to do the same. I recommend this item to others</li>
            <li> I lost my original back scrubber a couple of moves ago. I had been looking at local stores for something to replace it but had run out of luck. My original scrubber was more of a Scotch-Brite pad with cord on the ends. It was a real John Wayne back scrubber. Rough and tough and put the dirt right down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pad is a little softer and flexible. However, I am getting older so softer isn&#x27;t so bad. It holds the soap well and scratches my back pretty well while cleaning it. Not to gross the ladies out, but this one doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out of my back while I am scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good length for me and works well. Great price to go with it.</li>
            <li> So nice to have something that allows you to scrub those hard to reach areas of your back.  Everyone should have one of these otherwise you&#x27;ll just be partially clean.  These definitely do the trick.</li>
            <li> I can tell I&#x27;m really going to like this for a long time. It&#x27;s long, and dries fast. Unfortunately, there is no choice of color, but I can live with the color that came.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this...unfortunately, one of the rope handles broke after the second use. I expect the other one to break shortly. Its more of a design flaw than anything. I&#x27;m gonna make my own handles that secure better. Can&#x27;t complain too much for the price. Not for sensitive backs as it&#x27;s pretty rough.</li>
            <li> Love my products ! Thanks for quick delivery also  .</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for - finally something&#x27;s easy to use to wash my back. Better than a loofa!</li>
            <li> Different but useful item.</li>
            <li> Nice for getting your back in the shower.</li>
            <li> My health recently changed, and I am now in a wheelchair, so bathing is a bit of a challenge for me. I was glad to see this, because it seemed like it would be a great tool for someone with a handicap, and it is. There is only one problem - it doesn&#x27;t last. I have only had it now for about a month, and I&#x27;ve already thrown it out, and started looking for a replacement. I think I have found one. After less than a month of use, it start to get very thin, and then it began to wear so thin, that it was developing holes, and at that point, it isn&#x27;t very useful. I know it isn&#x27;t super expensive, but I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting that short of a life out of it.</li>
            <li> I would actually like to return the scrubber, it was very rough on the skin and it didn&#x27;t hold the soap very well.</li>
            <li> when you use it, it doesnt stay flat against your skin just the side edges touches your skin, hard to explain but using a giant towel would work better than this</li>
            <li> I Love it!!! And i will be ordering  another one, very very very soon!!! Until then peace and much respect!!!</li>
            <li> It is a great scrubber, but I have not yet figured out how to get soap into it, so it is not so great as a cleaner.  However, it feels great as a scrubber/scratching.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;scrubber&amp;#34; is too soft.  A bit &amp;#34;flimsy&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Does nothing for &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also too long in length.  It is 27 inches in length.  A similiar one was only 21 inches in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY disappinted in it. After only using it once, I will NOT use again&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Helen Dalbey,&lt;br /&gt;  hdalbey51@comcast.net</li>
            <li> This is a good back scrubber, however it is a little abrassive--kind of like using scotchbrite on your skin. It works though.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these in stores anywhere, read reviews, this one seems sturdy and is rough enough to be exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Cheap,cheap, cheap! After one use these scrubbers start to fray and there is just not much there to scrub with.</li>
            <li> As my shoulders become more stiff with age this allows me to massage and scrub my own back.  Hangs in the shower but can also be used dry.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well. You just have to wet it and then run a bar of soap along it, then it covers the back and feels great. The only thing I would do to improve it would be to make it 6 inches longer, because I&#x27;m 6 feet tall and have a pretty big back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an extra added bonus, I also use it when it&#x27;s dry, as the world&#x27;s best back scratcher,</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be like the one I had purchased previously but was disappointed.  It is not as sturdy as the Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber.  Was not asked which color I wanted but was sent a pink one, which is my favorite color.  I would recommend the Aquis.</li>
            <li> This product fell apart after only two uses. It is poorly designed, the outer material is not flexible and makes it so that the inner cleaning/scrubbing part doesn&#x27;t touch your skin. This makes it very hard to clean anything.... After attempting to use it, the product started to pill and come apart in chunks and then the middle just kind of crumbled. Look elsewhere for a good back scrub!</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Super scrubber!&lt;br /&gt;Invigorating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d and do, recommend it to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Sent white, I ordered blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy, comfy, to use, makes showering safer w/balance issues.</li>
            <li> Excellent back scrubber</li>
            <li> Works, but a little awkward to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> These puppies work great for getting at the parts of your back that you can&#x27;t reach and they feel great</li>
            <li> This product hasn&#x27;t been used yet therefore I&#x27;m unable to comment on the quality.  A bit disappointing that one isn&#x27;t able to select a colour of choice.  The one that I received was a dull ivory colour, more similar to grey and would have been more satisfied to have received a more upbeat colour.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price ....was a great stocking stuffer for my family who deserves a great exfoliation of there back side</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for back cleaning.  The one thing I worried about was the length - but when I used it, I found it to be perfect!  I&#x27;ll certainly buy another if/when this one wears out.  Would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> She loves it and can now exfoliate hard to reach areas.  The fact that it&#x27;s machine washable is also great because it helps keep it clean and prevent mold and mildew.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love my Back Scrubber!  Can&#x27;t shower without it!  So handy, and with a dollop of body wash I get worn out before the scrubbing ends!  Silky Smooth Skin for sure!  At this value, buy 2!</li>
            <li> great back cleaner. just enough scratchiness to clean your back really well. nice colors. will order again in the future</li>
            <li> I wish I could have chosen the color, I would of rather had white.  Other than that it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Product basically folds in on itself when you pull it accross your back and is rendered useless.  Length is too short and makes it hard to manage..</li>
            <li> Everything it should be. It&#x27;s nice to be able to get this in colors other than &amp;#34;sea sponge tan&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It hurts to use. It feels pretty much like sandpaper. Maybe I just have thin skin? Would not recommend to anyone especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good back scrubber, and I can finally be able to clean my back each time I take a shower.</li>
            <li> About a month after purchasing this, the bands broke off.  It also started pilling within a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> bathing back is so much easier with this. i will buy them again when needer</li>
            <li> easy to use for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this type of product on the internet because I was worried that the scrubber would be too abrasive. However, it is just the right consistency (enough to exfoliate but not rip your skin off). It is easy to use, causes the soap to lather well, and dries quickly. The scrubber is even works well when I use my salt scrub rather than soap. It is by far the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I love the material but I should have read a little more carefully because it&#x27;s just too darn short.  If it were just two or three inches longer it would work.  I think if I make some longer handles I can make it work but it seems like a lot of trouble to go to when I have so many bath brushes and scrubbers.  And besides I&#x27;ve found that I really like the cheapest of them all, a sisal scrubber which really relieves my itchy back.  I&#x27;ve found them really cheap on another site.</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully for scrubbing backs while in the shower and helps remove dead skin and makes skin much softer.</li>
            <li> Works really well but also breaks down really really fast. I want to repurchase this but I don&#x27;t want to spend so much each time because it deteriorates so quickly.</li>
            <li> heh yeah, well, it works nicely I think... my back is less dry and itchy since I have started using this thing... I&#x27;d 5 star it but I can&#x27;t help but think I hear a stitch pop every so often.</li>
            <li> I love this back exfoliator! So easy to use in the shower. Gentle on sensitive skin, and really leaves skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Not too scratchy. Just scratchy enough for my back. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love these back scrubbers</li>
            <li> it does exactly what is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I got this so my husband could wash his back in the shower. He&#x27;s bought brushes and other scrub products and he hates them all. He loves this because it does a great job cleaning - and it also helps exfoliate dry skin. Perfect product, great price!</li>
            <li> It scrubs my back very nicely.  I am glad I got it.  I wish it were a few inches longer so I don&#x27;t have to bend my elbows so such while using it.</li>
            <li> This scrubber fails because the scrubber portion between the side stitching just doesn&#x27;t fall on my back. The side stitching does. Going back to the Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber.</li>
            <li> Bought this for by 6&#x27;2\\&quot; husband who has trouble reaching his entire back.  He had read where some bigger guys used towels but I wanted to get him something that would dry quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He really likes this.  He says it is long enough for him and really easy to use.  His only comment was that since both sides of the scrubber are for exfoliating, it will takes him some time to get used to it.  He was more concerned with washing, not exfoliating, so I will be getting him one that is soft on one side and exfoliating on the other to see if he likes it better.  But thats only because I want him to try it, not that he asked for anything different.</li>
            <li> I Bought this back scrubber for my wife and I because at our age it&#x27;s difficult to reach all areas of our back.  Works great!</li>
            <li> The strap broke from the pad upon first use.  Not worth even the low price at which it is offered.  Caveat Emptor!</li>
            <li> This scrubber is too scratchy. Supposed to be somewhat but this one is just too stiff. I would not recommend.</li>
