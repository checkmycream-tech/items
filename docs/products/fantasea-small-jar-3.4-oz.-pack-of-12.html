            <li> I really like these jars. I decided to make body butter for gifts and just to have fun. It is easy to make and I found all the supplies I needed on Amazon (thank you to all who write reviews)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MOST difficult ingredient to find was the containers! They are very expensive, generally more than $1 each even purchased in bulk. Glass is preferred but with body butter, it isn&#x27;t very hot when you pour it into a container so plastic works also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for 4 oz containers and these are 3.4 oz ... close enough. They are VERY attractive, sort of an opalite white, and have nice secure screw stops. They are a great alternative to the 4oz Ball style jars. And they shipped quickly ~ I received them in a few days. Not Amazon Prime, but with free shipping they are still a very good value!</li>
            <li> These are a much higher quality than I expected.  The lids screw on very smoothly &amp; the plastic is quite thick.</li>
            <li> Purchased these to put home made body scrubs in to give as gifts for the holidays. Lids fit tightly.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> These are so useful... for everything.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like to use them when I have to travel by plane.</li>
            <li> I just got started making my own body scrubs and these are perfect. I didn&#x27;t want anything with glass just in case it dropped in the shower. I love these jars.</li>
            <li> Served it&#x27;s purpose well.</li>
            <li> the jars are a great size, and being see thru is awesome. HOWEVER, they screw tops will leak. I used them for making homemade brown sugar scrubs, so not hugely watery, but they did leak if not kept completely upright. For something dry, this is perfect</li>
            <li> I made lotion as Christmas gifts and I wanted bpa free jars without spending a lot of money on glass jars. These were the perfect size, I only wish I had ordered more...</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Right size for gifts and good price.  First time I purchase this product and I&#x27;m very satisfied. Yes, I recommend.</li>
            <li> These jars are awesome!  I think they are the PERFECT hand-held jar.  Material is sturdy, smooth lines all around.  Plastic is slightly &#x27;rubberized&#x27; so it gives a great seal.... I have no problems with snagging when I seal the lids.... for $12.50 per dozen, I will buy again!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve found all kinds of things to do with these, carrying loose leaf tea for travel, storing nuts and bolts, various craft projects. just a really handy size, when i purchased i had no idea what i&#x27;d do with a dozen of these things but i&#x27;ve already put several in rotation. quality is good and the lid screws on nice, leak free and tight.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed! Snug, water-tight lids on these break-proof jars. Plastic is hydrophobic, so water rolls off insides of sides and lid. Great to be able to see content level inside.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel.  I was able to put my Wen in it for the whole week and it fit in my baggie so I could have it as carry on.  Price it good also.</li>
            <li> Great product perfect size used these for beauty products. Good secure lids</li>
            <li> VERY PLEASED WITH THESE CONTAINERS. THE QUALITY IS NICE AND I LOVE THAT THEY ARE INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED INSIDE A BIGGER BAG. The lid seals on nicely and the container isnt super bulky. It fits nicely into my purse with lotion inside. :)</li>
            <li> I spent way too much time looking at little plastic thing holders, but I did find these and they are wonderful.  They are a perfect size for lots of things, have good lids and are not flimsy.  We used it for homemade shea butter lotion, ethiopian berbery, and have a few left over for various other gifts or utilities.</li>
            <li> these jars have impressed me beyond my belief. The quality is way better than anything that I had imagined and the size is just so perfect. The quality of the jars is amazing in the sense that it is great to touch and smooth to open up. The look is splendid with a pearly kind of finish which is translucent enough to see the contents inside. The lid works perfect and no struggling there itself is a great reason to give this a five star!&lt;br /&gt;I have already put the jars to good use by filling them up with creams and diaper rash creams to be kept in every room. The huge tubs from the supermarket were just too inconvenient for everyday use. The jars are so light weight that they can be used to carry a few kitchen herbs and spices or tea coffee on the go, medicines on the go, knick knacks and what not! The generous 12 pack set and be put to a good multiple uses more than what one could imagine.&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s a great set and I see no cons whatsoever!</li>
            <li> These are great jars, lightweight plastic, and they are so perfect for all my homemade body butter, deodorant, etc. !</li>
            <li> Liquid leaks on all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well for salves, ointments, solids, etc., but not a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps;)</li>
            <li> Great jaws.  I used them for EVERYTHING.  storing.  liquids.  candies.  you name it.</li>
            <li> Great for travel; however, I wish I could have purchased 4 - 5.  I have more than I need</li>
            <li> perfect for my project!!!</li>
            <li> These multi purpose jars are perfect for all the traveling I do. They do not leak and they are just the right size for herbs and spices in my kitchen too!</li>
