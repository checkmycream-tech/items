            <li>love it</li>

            <li>So this may not be a miracle product, but it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone who is looking for a more natural cleanser that still has power.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it before and was very excited to find it on amazon because it isn&#x27;t easy to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Great for my sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t break me out or cause dryness.</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
            <li>but the product contains a lot of great natural ingredients too.</li>
            <li>&quot; The product worked great at first, but now I&#x27;m having frequent breakouts and am getting more cystic acne.</li>
            <li>I use pure hyluronic acid and an organic rose hydrosol to moisturizer my skin as well.</li>
            <li>Mychelle makes a great oil free  facial sunscreen</li>
            <li>Alba has great products overall.</li>
            <li>I used Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil-Free Acne Wash as a kid, which didn&#x27;t work and just made my skin very bumpy, then I went to Proactiv, which worked AMAZINGLY ...</li>
            <li>I thought this fit the bill, but when I used it, it made me break out.</li>
            <li>First off, if you have acne problem, you really should seek a good dermatologist so he/</li>
            <li>Most of the time, acnes can be triggered by many factors, including how many hours/ day you do sleep, your diet, your lifestyle, your stress management style, if you&#x27;re a drinker/ smoker, types of moisturizer/ lotion, make-up that you use, what&#x27;s your daily routine cleansing, etc.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like my face is as clean.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a more gentle vegan / cruelty free acne cleanser I recommend Face &#x27;n&#x27; Earth Grapefruit &amp; Salicylic Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have been using this wash for almost a year now, and I will say that it worked best the first few months I bought it.</li>
            <li>this is a good second wash.</li>
            <li>my face is very sensitive and most acne products are to drying, I recommend this cleanser for anyone with aging acne prone</li>
            <li>rid of acne fast!!</li>
            <li>After years of using prescription products for my skin, I decided I wanted to take a more natural route of acne control.  </li>
            <li>I love products that refuse to test on animals and state it clearly.</li>
            <li>it was so rare for me to get cyst before</li>
            <li>, Two Months Later: Dropped to a 2.5, or in this case, a 2 star rating, aptly named \\&quot;it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just feeling over the moon right now.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling clean and healthy but doesn&#x27;t dry your face out.</li>
            <li>Have been using this stuff for a long time, gel is great for oily skin and it really helps to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>What I did notice is that if you use the face wash and scrub every day, when you use the astringent afterwards, your face is more likely to get that burning sensation(mine</li>
            <li>This product works well if you use the scrub first.</li>
            <li>My skin is completely zit/blackhead free.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought this in a store, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>(wash your hands thoroughly with an anti-bacterial soap, especially before you wash your face), and your skin is sure to heal.  </li>
            <li>for the first two years.</li>
            <li>This products works great if you have the kind of acnes that I do, every few months, I get break-up with a very mild case of acne and this product helps clean my face nicely and keep those small acnes from getting worse.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it will only get better from here as long as I am disciplined about using these morning, night, and post-workout.  </li>
            <li>Makes your face feel natural and clean.</li>
            <li>and I have a passion for using products that are effective but as natural as possible.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and medicinal and the cleanser stripped my skin leaving a rough texture (even after I moisturized).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and the cooling sensation feels lovely on my oily</li>
            <li>Based on the strong minty smell of the product, I&#x27;m guessing that there&#x27;s some variant of peppermint essential oil in the fragrance in this product.</li>
            <li>I will certainly continue to use all the cleansing products and recommend alba acnedote to anyone who will listen</li>
            <li>Even without the lotion though my skin still feels really clean and not dry!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a gentle acne cleanser</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic facial wash.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need much to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I keep it in my shower and the bottle has held up really well.</li>
            <li>although it didnt really help withh my acne problem..</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>If you have adult acne, use these products in combination with improving your diet (cut back on dairy, eat more fruits and vegetables, drink more water), fix your sleep cycle (try to get to where you can fall asleep before 2 am), where a noncomedogenic sunscreen, workout to make your face sweat at least every other day, and be as clean as you can when it comes to yourself or things touching your face</li>
            <li>So much better than conventional face wash.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Keeps oil down most of the day</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a much better and less abrasive product.</li>
            <li>My other \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot; areas have also been fading dramatically and are becoming smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>And so far this stuff has been a life saver and much easier on me.</li>
            <li>texture is a clear, runny gel and lathers really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So back to this product, if you have severe acne problem, this product may not work as quickly, and as well, as you would hope for, you do need to seek a professional recommendation for treatment.  </li>
            <li>I eliminated the Proactiv from my regimine altogether and have been using only all natural products with the occasional Proactiv spot treatment for strong power.</li>
            <li>for helping with breakouts, this seems to help clear existing pimples and keep new ones from forming.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell for a natural product and leaves my skin feeling tingling for a few minutes after use.  </li>
            <li>My acne has gone down significantly.</li>
            <li>Its lowered the amount of white heads and black andand black heads and also made my skin more even toned and that&#x27;s only within less than a couple weeks, so I&#x27;m excited to see how much better my skin will be.</li>
            <li>Kind of a dumb move considering that a lot of people - even those whose skin is not normally sensitive - tend to have mild allergic reactions to peppermint oil when it&#x27;s applied topically.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin clear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, has a planty to smell to it, and comes out almost like liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li>In: So far, I ADORE this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is fairly sensitive; the area of skin that my bangs brush around is ALWAYS breaking out (note to self</li>
            <li>I had been scouring stores and websites for months looking for something like this: a face wash with salicylic acid and a focus on natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It cleans but does not strip my combination skin of its natural oils.</li>
            <li>The search for a better product continues: I&#x27;m going to try tea tree oil next. :\</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling cool and refreshed due to the essential oils, which is also what smells</li>
            <li>This is my new daily face wash!</li>
            <li>I am on my period right now, and I actually woke up this morning with NO NEW PIMPLES!</li>
            <li>This is very misleading if that&#x27;s not the case,  and I could&#x27;ve ordered a single bottle cheaper from another company.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t break out very often, but my skin tends to be a bit on the uneven side--no large zits very often, but little bumps here and there.</li>
            <li>use this product daily and the Alba acnedote face and body scrub for deep cleansing twice a week to keep my skin clear, along with the Alba eventone night moisture, and the Alba Hawaiian Jasmine &amp; Vitamin E Moisture Cream for day moisture.</li>
            <li>It may not have cured my occasional break-outs, but it has improved my skin in general.</li>
            <li>The first few days it irritated it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased the face wash, face and body scrub, face lotion and the astringent, let me just say that this stuff is fantastic!!! A few things to think about though, just after I turned thirty my skin began to change and I started to get the white spots(hormonal acne), I was previously using a $50 bottle of purity, so when that no longer worked I started to worry, that&#x27;s when I found this!! What I did notice is that if you use the face wash and scrub every day, when you use the astringent afterwards, your face is more likely to get that burning sensation(mine did) so I wash my face twice a day with the cleanser and twice a week with the scrub and use the astringent after every wash. My skin has never looked better!! On my personal experience with the face lotion, I have combination skin and by the end of the day, when using the face lotion I was just an oily mess so I opted to stop using that. Even without the lotion though my skin still feels really clean and not dry!  I will certainly continue to use all the cleansing products and recommend alba acnedote to anyone who will listen</li>
            <li> Once ur acne is gone switch to the Alba Botanica hawaiian line</li>
            <li> The same review as for the astringent, made the problem much worse.  Did not help at all!!</li>
            <li> I got this because I thought it came as a kit from the the way the description was, but found that it was just the wash. This product works well if you use the scrub first. I was my face twice so for me this is a good second wash. When I&#x27;m in a hurry and use just this wash I don&#x27;t feel like my face is as clean.</li>
            <li> I love this product.I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been using this wash for almost a year now, and I will say that it worked best the first few months I bought it. I may have to switch soon, but I loved this product the first 9 months or so. I think this is just my skin getting used to it, not a fault of the product itself though. I will also say that one bottle will last almost three months if used twice a day!</li>
            <li> Sheet in it eyes,  srsly when they say that it&#x27;s for a reason.  Hope it burns the  acne  off as well as it burnt my corneas.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Keeps skin clear.  Nice smell.  Non-irritating.</li>
            <li> After years of using prescription products for my skin, I decided I wanted to take a more natural route of acne control.  Using this with the other Acnedote products works wonders.  Salicylic acid is a miracle worker.  My skin is completely zit/blackhead free.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and my skin hasn&#x27;t built up a tolerance to it, like it did with prescription treatments.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but it has failed miserably.  The face wash leaves a sticky film on my face after washing.  The astringent and spot gel dry my skin out.  I have a combination of oily and dry skin and this only made it worse.  Moving on...</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. At first, it made me break out terribly. But, like all facial products, you have to give your skin time to get used to it. Trust me. I don&#x27;t have terrible acne, but I do have some stubborn dark spots from some pimples that never quite seem to heal all the way. With this product, they did! The dark spots are disappearing. Pairing this along with my clarisonic is perfect! I use this, and then apply the Jasmine + Vitamin E lotion from Alba botanica, as well. It is wonderful and I love the results.</li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t break me out or cause dryness. This is my new daily face wash!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve used it before and was very excited to find it on amazon because it isn&#x27;t easy to find in stores. It says on the description &amp;#34;2 per case.&amp;#34; Which I took to mean 2 bottles. I only received 1 though. This is very misleading if that&#x27;s not the case,  and I could&#x27;ve ordered a single bottle cheaper from another company.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break out very often, but my skin tends to be a bit on the uneven side--no large zits very often, but little bumps here and there. This product has resolved that for me. I have combination skin and I have a passion for using products that are effective but as natural as possible. I love that this fits the bill and that they also don&#x27;t test on animals. I&#x27;ve been using around a month and so far it&#x27;s worked great. It&#x27;s cheap enough--give it a shot!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have acne and I liked the Alba Botanica Enzyme pineapple extract cleanser.  I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my skin with this product.  It has a strong smell for a natural product and leaves my skin feeling tingling for a few minutes after use.  Also when I got the product it was so poorly packaged that one of the bottles caps had twisted off and leaked all over.  They delivered it to me in a plastic bag because it had made such a mess of the useless padded envelope it was packaged in.  Anyways,  I&#x27;ll stick to the Alba Botanica Enzyme pineapple extract facial cleanser,  it&#x27;s a much better and less abrasive product.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this in a store, and I absolutely love it. I have tried many different facial cleaners, and I find that a lot of them have a disgusting fragrance smell to them. This one doesn&#x27;t have that at all. My acne has gone down significantly. And most of my cystic acne is gone now.  The only bad thing is that it took out all the oil from my chin, nose, and cheeks. It&#x27;s great for my forehead, which is very oily. (This are my opinions, and this may work differently on different skin types.)</li>
            <li> I have seen results, and it feels lovely on my skin. Also, the price was very fair. Also! I love products that refuse to test on animals and state it clearly.</li>
            <li> BEST face wash for oily skin. Leaves your face feeling clean and healthy but doesn&#x27;t dry your face out. It has helped get rid of blackheads. I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now and won&#x27;t quit using this product.</li>
            <li> First off, if you have acne problem, you really should seek a good dermatologist so he/ she can examine to see the severity and the type of acnes that you have.  It is always difficult to simply snatch an over-the-counter product and hope that it will magically &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; all of your acne problems.  Most of the time, acnes can be triggered by many factors, including how many hours/ day you do sleep, your diet, your lifestyle, your stress management style, if you&#x27;re a drinker/ smoker, types of moisturizer/ lotion, make-up that you use, what&#x27;s your daily routine cleansing, etc.  So back to this product, if you have severe acne problem, this product may not work as quickly, and as well, as you would hope for, you do need to seek a professional recommendation for treatment.  This products works great if you have the kind of acnes that I do, every few months, I get break-up with a very mild case of acne and this product helps clean my face nicely and keep those small acnes from getting worse.  I&#x27;ve noticed that for the last 8 months or so, since using this product, I haven&#x27;t had one acne on my face.  Naturally, every  month or two, prior to using this product, I would get at least a couple of pustules popped up and they were nasty ones.  It generally took at least 2 weeks for these to go away naturally.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this products, I have not gotten one at all.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gentle acne cleanser but I found this one to be very harsh. Just because something&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s gentle! The smell is very strong and medicinal and the cleanser stripped my skin leaving a rough texture (even after I moisturized). If you are looking for a more gentle vegan / cruelty free acne cleanser I recommend Face &#x27;n&#x27; Earth Grapefruit &amp; Salicylic Cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic facial wash. It&#x27;s clear, has a planty to smell to it, and comes out almost like liquid hand soap. If you have a heavy hand, try to be careful with how hard you squeeze the bottle as it comes out in large amounts. You don&#x27;t really need much to get the job done. For years, I have struggled with acne which has been worse than the average person, but not as bad as cystic acne. Upon reading a review on the Alba Botanica website, I came across someone who actually used this and HAD cystic. I figured that if someone who had worse skin than I did could use this and it worked, that it would work for me-- And, it has! This is coming from someone who used to rely on Clinique products and trust me, their acne control line is NOTHING compared to this!</li>
            <li> So this may not be a miracle product, but it works pretty good. I have pretty sensitive skin and this does not irritate it at all. It may not have cured my occasional break-outs, but it has improved my skin in general. Not only that but the product contains a lot of great natural ingredients too. This is a great product for anyone who is looking for a more natural cleanser that still has power. I keep it in my shower and the bottle has held up really well. I have used it for a few months and it still looks new.</li>
            <li> I bought the Alba Botanical Acne Dote cleanser, the astringent, and the oil control lotion.  I have been using them each morning, evening, and after each workout (to wash the sweat off my face) for the past few days since they&#x27;ve arrived in the mail.  This morning, I feel like a miracle happened.  I am on my period right now, and I actually woke up this morning with NO NEW PIMPLES! Also, the tone of my face is noticeably more even.  I&#x27;m just feeling over the moon right now.  I am sure it will only get better from here as long as I am disciplined about using these morning, night, and post-workout.  If you have adult acne, use these products in combination with improving your diet (cut back on dairy, eat more fruits and vegetables, drink more water), fix your sleep cycle (try to get to where you can fall asleep before 2 am), where a noncomedogenic sunscreen, workout to make your face sweat at least every other day, and be as clean as you can when it comes to yourself or things touching your face (wash your hands thoroughly with an anti-bacterial soap, especially before you wash your face), and your skin is sure to heal.  I&#x27;m telling you though, it does take discipline.  These products are an essential part of my routine, but do keep in mind that routine is the key word.  There are no easy fixes.  I would highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Best face wash product ever and, I&#x27;ve tried SEVERAL over the years. Alba has great products overall.</li>
            <li> my face is very sensitive and most acne products are to drying, I recommend this cleanser for anyone with aging acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product daily and the Alba acnedote face and body scrub for deep cleansing twice a week to keep my skin clear, along with the Alba eventone night moisture, and the Alba Hawaiian Jasmine &amp; Vitamin E Moisture Cream for day moisture. My skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Awesome orange smell, gets rid of acne.</li>
            <li> I bought this from another trusted online site, but i didn&#x27;t get to review this product at their page because some technical problem with the site, it didn&#x27;t let me. Anyways, I just want to share my experience with this acnedote wash, this does not suit my face at all. leaves my face sticky afterwash. and gives me cysts not one but more than 3 cysts at once, my face gets out of control. it was so rare for me to get cyst before and now it&#x27;s like my face is the new hometown for cysts, it&#x27;s driving me crazy. very disappointed with this wash. Anw, I have oily and acne prone skin but it was usually just blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Four Days In: So far, I ADORE this product. I&#x27;ve had your run-of-the-mill chronic acne for many many years (I always have at least three or four blemishes on my face, I have nasty acne scars, and I break-out very easily), and I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and have mixed skin. I used Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil-Free Acne Wash as a kid, which didn&#x27;t work and just made my skin very bumpy, then I went to Proactiv, which worked AMAZINGLY ... for the first two years. Then it just stopped working (which is extremely common for Proactiv users). Then I bounced around some random drug store choices for another couple of years before going back to extra-strength Proactiv. But it didn&#x27;t work at all either and just made me bad areas flare up and get redder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a friend recommended this product to me and I figured, hmm, maybe my skin is just delicate and is getting overloaded with chemicals? BINGO. My skin is fairly sensitive; the area of skin that my bangs brush around is ALWAYS breaking out (note to self: switch to sulfate-free shampoo). And so far this stuff has been a life saver and much easier on me. I had two elephant-sized zits on my face for a week and as soon as I started using this, they&#x27;ve become less red and have already started shrinking rapidly. My other \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot; areas have also been fading dramatically and are becoming smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT, Two Months Later: Dropped to a 2.5, or in this case, a 2 star rating, aptly named \\&quot;it&#x27;s okay.\\&quot; The product worked great at first, but now I&#x27;m having frequent breakouts and am getting more cystic acne. I eliminated the Proactiv from my regimine altogether and have been using only all natural products with the occasional Proactiv spot treatment for strong power. No help. The search for a better product continues: I&#x27;m going to try tea tree oil next. :\</li>
            <li> i only have one complaint about this face wash -- contains alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I LOVE it. It smells wonderful. Leaves skin feeling cool and refreshed due to the essential oils, which is also what smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citrus EO is supposed to cause sun sensitivity, which I&#x27;ve read can be a disaster, with skin discoloration, extra sun damage, etc., but this is rinsed off, so hopefully the citrus and the alcohol won&#x27;t be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for helping with breakouts, this seems to help clear existing pimples and keep new ones from forming. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and the cooling sensation feels lovely on my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a clear, runny gel and lathers really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Neutrogena acne wash (the orange stuff), but found out they test on animals, so I switched. Also, the Neutrogena caused dermatitis ALL OVER. After using it for two months or so, I noticed my hands drying out and my feet (standing in a puddle of the suds in the shower), my legs -- horrible stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I found this!!</li>
            <li> This product was okay...although it didnt really help withh my acne problem..i would recommed it to someone with less acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the toner and treatment gel. It is not too drying and perfect for my acne prone aging skin. I use pure hyluronic acid and an organic rose hydrosol to moisturizer my skin as well. Mychelle makes a great oil free  facial sunscreen and I am good to go!</li>
            <li> Cleans out my pores and prevents breakouts. Best product I&#x27;ve used and I have used a lot. Definitely recommend if you have acne.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the way it smells</li>
            <li> Have been using this stuff for a long time, gel is great for oily skin and it really helps to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. I had been scouring stores and websites for months looking for something like this: a face wash with salicylic acid and a focus on natural ingredients. I thought this fit the bill, but when I used it, it made me break out. Based on the strong minty smell of the product, I&#x27;m guessing that there&#x27;s some variant of peppermint essential oil in the fragrance in this product. Kind of a dumb move considering that a lot of people - even those whose skin is not normally sensitive - tend to have mild allergic reactions to peppermint oil when it&#x27;s applied topically. That would explain the big, red, itchy blemishes I got when I used this. If you do decide to buy this and have the same reaction, don&#x27;t throw it out. It works okay when used as a body wash. At least it did for me.</li>
            <li> So much better than conventional face wash. Makes your face feel natural and clean. Tough on acne even cystic acne. I have been on acutane before and have the worst type of acne. This stuff works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Great smell, almost like peppermint&lt;br /&gt;-Great feel, feels euphoric in the morning&lt;br /&gt;-Keeps oil down most of the day&lt;br /&gt;-Gets rid of acne fast!!</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser every evening. It cleans but does not strip my combination skin of its natural oils. Wonderful cleanser!</li>
            <li> Finding is  face wash is not easy so I was happy to find it here. Fair price for a  great product</li>
            <li> Awesome and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Ive been using now for 2 months.. love it</li>
            <li> This face wash is the best for acne prone skin.  I have tried almost everything and this face soap seems to have worked the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this once a day for about a week and a half and it has helped my skin a lot. Its lowered the amount of white heads and black andand black heads and also made my skin more even toned and that&#x27;s only within less than a couple weeks, so I&#x27;m excited to see how much better my skin will be. The first few days it irritated it but then my skin got used to it.</li>
