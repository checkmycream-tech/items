            <li>Your skin feels and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, I think the VENUS BREEZE is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>, I think the VENUS BREEZE is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>These are awesome!  </li>
            <li>But these work well without soap or shaving lotion, you just need water to create a lubricated surface on the skin and to rinse the razor, and it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome!!!  </li>
            <li>What I like best about these razors is no shaving cream or additional lather is required.</li>
            <li>So I got this thinking, perfect!</li>
            <li>for the shave, this is the best razor out there, in my opinion.  </li>

            <li>I was very impressed!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially nice for travelling.</li>
            <li>the VENUS BREEZE would go from a great product to a perfect one.</li>
            <li>the VENUS BREEZE would go from a great product to a perfect one.</li>
            <li>You never get that great close shave.  </li>
            <li>This razor is great.</li>
            <li>Definitely happy with this product and recommend.</li>
            <li>They are great.  </li>
            <li>It give a great shave and the gel strip</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>razor with great results.  </li>
            <li>If you need to buy a razor anyway, you will certainly be happy with this one.</li>
            <li>(Oh, and did I mention that it gives a great shave?)</li>
            <li>great handle,</li>
            <li>The head of the razor is just so bulky and doesn&#x27;t give a great shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it does give a great shave, even on bikini line, and it is very handy to have an all-in one for travel.</li>
            <li>LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I would probably not recommend this for a very effective shaving.</li>
            <li>The spa breeze smell is very nice.</li>
            <li>And even though they are disposable, I have used mine twice successfully without a problem and am still happy with the one blade.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>This razor is the best, never worry about about shaving cream and it glides on so easy.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a good razor to use for some time now that I will stick with.</li>
            <li>I loved this version of the Venus Breeze.  </li>
            <li>I got this this razor to try and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>good around the knees&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so good on underarms</li>
            <li>in all, good razor</li>
            <li>I had heard from another buddy that he borrowed his wife&#x27;s &#x27;Spa Breeze&#x27; and loved it.</li>
            <li>Good stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good razor works well</li>
            <li>but otherwise they do a good job</li>
            <li>smooth performance, moisturizing srips are a nice touch, the best of the Venus line that I have tried.    </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love the shave and the smell of soap is really pleasant</li>
            <li>These razors are amazing.</li>
            <li>I got this item free to try and happy that I did.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to store my razor in the shower, so I can&#x27;t attest to how that works - but the concept is a nice one.    </li>
            <li>so I consider this shaver to be really nicely functional.  </li>
            <li>I thought it contoured nicely, exceptially around the knees.  </li>
            <li>Once the gel bars begin to wear out, I remove the gel attachment and use it on its own over my skin.</li>
            <li>Initially I liked the idea of having moisturizer included.</li>
            <li>They do a nice job of it.</li>
            <li>gel is nice for legs..</li>
            <li>It give a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>She loved this one better.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this razor.</li>
            <li>That said, this product is so good that if you&#x27;re trying to select between comparably priced razors/blades from competitors, I strongly recommend you try this one</li>
            <li>Very easy to use - I appreciate the case that sticks to your shower wall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see this razor come with a cleaning brush and a nice travel pouch instead.</li>
            <li>Also, if your skin is sensitive to scented soap then this probably would not be the best type of razor to use.</li>
            <li>My first use of this light weight, delightfully fragrant shaver was to remove the hairs on my underarms.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nevertheless, this is a very nice shaving tool that is well worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get the best shave with a VENUS BREEZE, soak in a warm tub or stand under the shower to let the heat open up the pores of your skin.  </li>
            <li>All of the venus products do a good, clean, irritation-free job &amp; this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>First, when using on your legs, I have to admit it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li>makes shaving very very smooth.</li>
            <li>I like to very lightly shave there.    </li>
            <li>so that is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>I found the shave to be close and my legs were amazingly smooth after using it (almost as if I had used some kind of baby lotion or shaving cream on my legs).</li>
            <li>I think the Venus breeze gillette could have been better packaged, and the razor more exposed.</li>
            <li>- I think you&#x27;ll be pleased in every way.</li>
            <li>Each cartridge has three blades, which give your legs a sexy, ultra close shave.  </li>
            <li>I have been satisfied with it for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have been satisfied with it for many years.  </li>
            <li>Teens girls will especially love the romantic design - plus, everything you need is included, so you can tuck it into your bag, or keep it in your gym locker.</li>
            <li>It smells great and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>gel&#x3D; more convenient and faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn, but I had a lot of stray hairs around my knees that I wasn&#x27;t able to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t my favorite..</li>
            <li>When you finish with the razor head, you just click a release at the top, and the head falls off.  </li>
            <li>I love the venus razors and the Venus Breeze lives up to the others.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed pilot-testing this razor.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li>This worked better than I thought.</li>
            <li>It glided smoothly and smelled quote nice.</li>
            <li>glad i tried them.</li>
            <li>I would love to stop buying shaving gel</li>
            <li>I have been shaving for many years, and have been a fan of the Embrace cartridges.  </li>
            <li>even after going over an area on my leg many times, i still had stubble.</li>
            <li>I Love these razors.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of my favorite type of razors though because you can switch out the blade part and continue to use the handle part.</li>
            <li>I was excited to learn that Venus had come out with their own version of the Intuition and knew I had to try</li>
            <li>Anyway, all in all, pretty, smells good, shave</li>
            <li>This is a great new razor.</li>
            <li>If you do prefer the shower to the tub, then another nice thing about VENUS BREEZE is that you never have to worry about shaving your legs quickly, before the shaving cream rinses off in the shower spray.  </li>
            <li>Awesome moisture for dry legs and makes shaving a breeze, BUT</li>
            <li>This razor prevents cuts or scrapes and delivers the closest most comfortable shave imaginable.</li>
            <li>The razor is comfortable and provides a safe, close shave.</li>
            <li>When all the conditioning stuff was gone I bought a pack or refills, because I loved it so much.</li>
            <li>I love the Venus Breeze and would highly recommend it to anyone else who thinks shaving cream is a pain!!!!    </li>
            <li>Everything about this razor is easy and efficient.</li>
            <li>I can easily get 15 uses out of a blade.</li>
            <li>It gave a close, clean shave and the lotion bar at the top was convenient as I did not have to continually apply soap to my legs.</li>
            <li>Works well, handy for travel, but some of us are sensitive to chemical perfumes and prefer to use our own brand of lotion.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a razor to use primarily on your legs, then this one is it.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of the Gillette Venus so this seemed like a great upgrade --</li>
            <li>And so smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>My legs aren&#x27;t burning anymore, and they feel somewhat smooth.</li>
            <li>Now, the smell was great, but I&#x27;m left with..why?</li>
            <li>It is amazing - smooth, very close shave - everywhere.</li>
            <li>The company offers a great deal for the bottom part of the razor, then they up the price for the refills...not worth it.</li>
            <li>The moisture strips feel very nice, but the only issue is that they keep falling off.</li>
            <li>The packaging is well done and the way the razor blades are packaged within their own little cups, is a real cute</li>
            <li>The really cool lotion pads on either sides of the blades gives you a soothing, smooth feel combined with an incredibly smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>* to shave and this definitely makes the whole experience a lot more pleasant and easy.</li>
            <li>The new scent is pleasant &amp; the color is pretty and girly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first when I tried it on my legs it was pretty nice...</li>
            <li>I also get compliment from my family for my super smooth legs.  </li>
            <li>For the Spa Breeze razor, the gel/soap bar is scented with a pleasant combination of white tea and tropical flowers.  </li>
            <li>Also, the gel kind of goops, at first especially, and we found it kind of gooping off of she razor when not in use.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I received a free sample of this razor (it came in a clear travel bag, with a free bottle of shower gel and a free bar of deodorant.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth as my regular razor (Schick Intuition - which is nice and gives great results, but so bulky and big), but it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li>This product was fabulous at first!</li>
            <li>Each razor head is individually packaged, so it&#x27;s very easy and safe to take a spare with you somewhere.  </li>
            <li>And honestly, they are all pretty much alike.</li>
            <li>So it came as some surprise that this latest generation really did up the ante a bit from a performance standpoint.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t at all sure of how much pressure to apply....</li>
            <li>This on its own would have been negated by the convenience of using a one-step razor, but the issue with frequent nicks was a dealbreaker for me.</li>
            <li>But they aren&#x27;t really different, so if you&#x27;re thinking about getting rid of a perfectly good one for this one, save your money.</li>
            <li>So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So</li>
            <li>But after shaving twice, the moisture strips on the top and bottom got kind of dry</li>
            <li>I will have to see how many actual uses I get out of one top</li>
            <li>Clearly, the Personal Touch razor, which this consumer used for many many years, didn&#x27;t have as brilliant a marketing strategy, and thus died a quiet death.   </li>
            <li>Works for a quick shave if you&#x27;re not looking for perfection.</li>
            <li>And it takes awhile for it to dry, so this isn&#x27;t a good razor to bring on vacation unless you&#x27;ll be in one place for awhile.</li>
            <li>And it is so pretty!</li>
            <li>It seems to work fine as long as you keep the razor totally satured with warm water and make sure you use a light touch.  </li>
            <li>&quot; fragrance is pleasing but mild, and I think it would pass muster with most sensitive noses.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the Venus razors and frankly didn&#x27;t really see how they could improve upon the version I was using.  </li>
            <li>and the smell is nice, it simply is not functional.</li>
            <li>Its almost worth the price but take my warning</li>
            <li>Inside the holder is space for two spare razor cartridges, each sealed in their own individual packaging.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked the extra moisturizer around the blade.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really worth replacing the razor so often.</li>
            <li>I always find that I rarely cut myself</li>
            <li>These are nice overall.</li>
            <li>but as of right now, I will be buying this tool again.</li>
            <li>The shaving gel is built right into the shaver.</li>
            <li>The holder is handy, and keeps the extra blades handy and dry while holding the razor handle.  </li>
            <li>It worked quite nicely though it did take me 3 times on one arm and 2 on the other to completely clean off both areas.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, Venus does have some brilliant marketing to be able to constantly repackage what is essentially the same product over and over again.</li>
            <li>For those who have used a Venus razor:  The only difference between this Venus and previous instances, as best as I could tell, was the scent of the gel/soap bars and the color of the razor handle.  </li>
            <li>Con:  While this is a great razor, the plastic packaging is bulky and excessive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the same razor blade several times and am still getting a great shave.  </li>
            <li>This version, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR comes in a nice white tea scent that is a very pleasing change of pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor gives a good shave, but I had a similar problem with it nicking me too frequently.  </li>
            <li>For a woman who wants a quick shave, this seems like a solution.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the scent on this one, and I&#x27;m not normally a fan of shave gel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this for those &amp;#34;intimate areas&amp;#34; because its a very gentle shaver.</li>
            <li>I changed the blade and it was great again, but after a week both moisture strips fell off and the blades got really dull.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t shave close, then I feel icky, lol.  </li>
            <li>I have used a VENUS BREEZE for a number of years now, and this convenient, one step razor always gives me soft, smooth legs, with no nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li>I really like these razors!  </li>
            <li>In fact I just bought my first package of refill razors.</li>
            <li>For years, I used the [[ASIN:B000FW2NGC Schick Intuition Plus Shaving Kit for Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, 1 each]]</li>
            <li>During the first use, I noticed two things:</li>
            <li>and then I knicked myself a lot and got ingrown hairs on my armpits for the first time.</li>
            <li>first is the soap/gel bars.  </li>
            <li>Since the blade replacements are individually wrapped, I can keep them in my vanity safely.    </li>
            <li>I buy all my refills at Amazon for a better price than the big box stores.</li>
            <li>Even though I have to shave my legs daily because the hair grows do fast, the Gillette Venus shaved smooth and my legs felt silky smooth immediately after shaving.</li>
            <li>Brand new and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Far superior to the multipacks of those pink daisy razors.</li>
            <li>The grip is comfortable even in my nondominant hand, and the light pink color is very subtle--not too girlie.  </li>
            <li>so I bought the large pack with refills.  </li>
            <li>The gel also is a light moisturizer, but you will still need to use your regular skin cream if you live in any kind of extreme</li>
            <li>I have to admit the Venus Breeze has some real positives to it.</li>
            <li>I shave close enough to feel comfortable, then I have razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I really like the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE RAZOR.  </li>
            <li>The razor itself glides over my legs well, making shaving much quicker as well as painless.</li>
            <li>You really DON&#x27;T need shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>wife indicates that she really likes the lotion bars, that they make it so it does not even feel like one is using a razor.  </li>
            <li>I would have really appreciated the convenience and ease of this years ago, but I&#x27;ll take it now.</li>
            <li>so the razor caddy that sticks to the wall in the shower doesn&#x27;t serve much purpose.</li>
            <li>I needed the travel bag, and it was only (...) for the bag and all the free stuff, so it was a no-brainer).     </li>
            <li>It was absolutely unbearable.    </li>
            <li>I guess it just didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I have to really get the shower nozzle pointed at the razor to get stray hairs out before I put it away, and it feels like I&#x27;m wasting the soap/gel bars when I do it.  </li>
            <li>But my money for the whole product was returned.</li>
            <li>Its gets really slimy fast.</li>
            <li>They are either not sharp enough, or are made of very cheap metal.</li>
            <li>Then shave away in your normal manner, and you will have the softest legs of your life!  </li>
            <li>I tried using this razor when it was first introduced several years ago and quit using it because the gel bars would dissolve too quickly, making a huge mess, and then fall right off the razor.  </li>
            <li>This is a reasonably priced high quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other razors often force you to press directly on the razor head to lock it in, and it&#x27;s very easy to cut your finger while doing it.  </li>
            <li>The VENUS BREEZE RAZOR line is pretty, feminine, and clearly \\&quot;made for a woman, not a man.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about the VENUS BREEZE is that it had considerably improved the built-in gel bars on the razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be nice if Gillette provided a small razor brush to help with cleaning between uses.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see this razor come with a cleaning brush and a nice travel pouch instead.ut cutting yourself on a spare razor while digging through a drawer.    </li>
            <li>The razor itself is a girly pink that is visually appealing - and the handle has a soft grip.  </li>
            <li>That alone is the main reason I discontinued use of the VENUS BREEZE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>gel bars themselves do a decent job of lathering your skin for the shave, but I found the gel felt somewhat gooey.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin, and this was the first time I&#x27;ve ever had a shaving product to make me feel that way.</li>
            <li>but I like the regular Venus shavers better, especially for the arm pit area.</li>
            <li>That said, this is a decent razor.</li>
            <li>But I discovered I could get just as quick a shave with some body lotion, and a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the bottom area still runs out first, as it is used the most, but there is very little on the top bar wasted when the bottom bar is gone.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise,this item deserves a high recommendation.  </li>
            <li>After I shaved my right leg, I immediately began shaving my left leg</li>
            <li>While I was shaving my left leg, my right leg began to sting.</li>
            <li>looking I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>Plus, you can&#x27;t do a quick \\&quot;Dry shave\\&quot; under your arms because of the moisturizer around the blade.  </li>
            <li>very soft</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that often gets razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Not only do you get a really close shave, but so far I haven&#x27;t so much as gotten a nick.   </li>
            <li>Many razors just aren&#x27;t sharp enough to give me a close shave, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the Venus line.  </li>

            <li>Using the Gillette Venus razor compared to my old Schick razor us a no brainier!</li>
            <li>The styling is pretty, pink (real girly-girl factor) and fits well in your hand (ergonomically).</li>
            <li>For a quick shave, try some body lotion and a regular razor, but only if you have a little hair, and remember to lightly press.      </li>
            <li>It has little \\&quot;wings\\&quot; of soap on either side of the triple blades that flex to fit the contours of the body.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;gel&#x27; they have on the cartridge extends so far out that the blades don&#x27;t actually make contact, unless you really push, and I now know that gets you stubble and scars.  </li>
            <li>Oh and I have ridiculously sensitive skin and this razor didn&#x27;t bother me at all</li>
            <li>It is soft and not too</li>
            <li>Also, the design is such that you can&#x27;t really use it</li>
            <li>Also, the design is such that you can&#x27;t really use it</li>
            <li>Finally my old razor got so yucky</li>
            <li>The package, which appeared as if it might be difficult to open, was quite easy to open and the razors themselves are very easy to change.</li>
            <li>The razor itself is the same as the original Venus razor, same number of blades, and does the job well enough.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I was missing a particular &#x27;right&#x27; way to do it</li>
            <li>Honestly, the actual razor heads sold separately  are not a good price value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are three main features of a Venus razor versus a standard multi-blade women&#x27;s razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pink and pretty.</li>
            <li>Where Intuition had a massive amount of shave bar all the way around the razor, leaving much wasted when the area that actually lathers the skin runs out, VENUS BREEZE had gel bars on the top and the bottom.  </li>
            <li>Maybe on later uses they will work better, but this first use left me rather annoyed.</li>
            <li>then the cheap, pink daisy razors that I have always used, but they last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been changing the blade about once every 10 days</li>
            <li>problem with these (versus the other brand of 3-blade girl shavers) is that the strip of shaving gel disappears long before the blade wears out, but the extra surface area where the gel was is then irritating, so you can&#x27;t really use it once the gel&#x27;s gone, even though the blade is still perfectly good.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I had my tween daughter use my extra Embrace cartridges, or she would have been a mess using these.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the same problem with frequent nicks using the Venus Vibrance as I do with the VENUS BREEZE.  </li>
            <li>I could barely feel the shave...</li>
            <li>i normally am sensitive to razors but this one was different.</li>
            <li>This is the only razor that has never cut me, but still leaves my legs with that soft feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin, girly and cute.  </li>
            <li>find the overly large spa strips (with lotion) to be both a positive and a negative factor when dealing with the Venus.</li>
            <li>I rarely get nicks and my shave time is cut in half compared to using regular shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I used the Venus for one straight week and NO bumps, burn or nicks like the other brands.</li>
            <li>The only downside - and one that isn&#x27;t specific to this Venus Spa Breeze - is the ever increasing and now nearly exorbitant cost of razor blades.  </li>
            <li>Plus it comes with a suction cup that you can hang high in the shower and keep it from getting wet...</li>
            <li>However, the soapy bars of moisturizer began to fall off after the first few shaves.</li>
            <li>Allergy now turned into infection, and my poor kid is using topical antibiotic with a possibility of starting an internal one if it doesn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li>and the suction never fails like others have for me in the past and sent a razor hurdling at my bare feet...</li>
            <li>The reason for the three stars is that the gel bars protrude out a little too much and interfere with the contact made by the razor to the skin.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Your skin feels and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, I think the VENUS BREEZE is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> , I think the VENUS BREEZE is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> These are awesome!  </li>
            <li> But these work well without soap or shaving lotion, you just need water to create a lubricated surface on the skin and to rinse the razor, and it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome!!!  </li>
            <li> What I like best about these razors is no shaving cream or additional lather is required.</li>
            <li> So I got this thinking, perfect!</li>
            <li> for the shave, this is the best razor out there, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> in all, the Venus line is excellent.  </li>

            <li> Great!  </li>
            <li> Best shaver ever.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially nice for travelling.</li>
            <li> the VENUS BREEZE would go from a great product to a perfect one.</li>
            <li> the VENUS BREEZE would go from a great product to a perfect one.</li>
            <li> You never get that great close shave.  </li>
            <li> This razor is great.</li>
            <li> Definitely happy with this product and recommend.</li>
            <li> They are great.  </li>
            <li> It give a great shave and the gel strip</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> razor with great results.  </li>
            <li> If you need to buy a razor anyway, you will certainly be happy with this one.</li>
            <li> (Oh, and did I mention that it gives a great shave?)</li>
            <li> great handle,</li>
            <li> The head of the razor is just so bulky and doesn&#x27;t give a great shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it does give a great shave, even on bikini line, and it is very handy to have an all-in one for travel.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> I would probably not recommend this for a very effective shaving.</li>
            <li> The spa breeze smell is very nice.</li>
            <li> And even though they are disposable, I have used mine twice successfully without a problem and am still happy with the one blade.  </li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> This razor is the best, never worry about about shaving cream and it glides on so easy.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a good razor to use for some time now that I will stick with.</li>
            <li> I loved this version of the Venus Breeze.  </li>
            <li> I got this this razor to try and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> good around the knees&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so good on underarms</li>
            <li> in all, good razor</li>
            <li> I had heard from another buddy that he borrowed his wife&#x27;s &#x27;Spa Breeze&#x27; and loved it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good razor works well</li>
            <li> but otherwise they do a good job</li>
            <li> smooth performance, moisturizing srips are a nice touch, the best of the Venus line that I have tried.    </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the shave and the smell of soap is really pleasant</li>
            <li> These razors are amazing.</li>
            <li> I got this item free to try and happy that I did.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to store my razor in the shower, so I can&#x27;t attest to how that works - but the concept is a nice one.    </li>
            <li> so I consider this shaver to be really nicely functional.  </li>
            <li> I thought it contoured nicely, exceptially around the knees.  </li>
            <li> Once the gel bars begin to wear out, I remove the gel attachment and use it on its own over my skin.</li>
            <li> Initially I liked the idea of having moisturizer included.</li>
            <li> They do a nice job of it.</li>
            <li> gel is nice for legs..</li>
            <li> It give a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> She loved this one better.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this razor.</li>
            <li> That said, this product is so good that if you&#x27;re trying to select between comparably priced razors/blades from competitors, I strongly recommend you try this one</li>
            <li> Very easy to use - I appreciate the case that sticks to your shower wall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to see this razor come with a cleaning brush and a nice travel pouch instead.</li>
            <li> Also, if your skin is sensitive to scented soap then this probably would not be the best type of razor to use.</li>
            <li> My first use of this light weight, delightfully fragrant shaver was to remove the hairs on my underarms.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nevertheless, this is a very nice shaving tool that is well worth a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To get the best shave with a VENUS BREEZE, soak in a warm tub or stand under the shower to let the heat open up the pores of your skin.  </li>
            <li> All of the venus products do a good, clean, irritation-free job &amp; this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> First, when using on your legs, I have to admit it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li> makes shaving very very smooth.</li>
            <li> I like to very lightly shave there.    </li>
            <li> so that is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I found the shave to be close and my legs were amazingly smooth after using it (almost as if I had used some kind of baby lotion or shaving cream on my legs).</li>
            <li> I think the Venus breeze gillette could have been better packaged, and the razor more exposed.</li>
            <li> - I think you&#x27;ll be pleased in every way.</li>
            <li> Each cartridge has three blades, which give your legs a sexy, ultra close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have been satisfied with it for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have been satisfied with it for many years.  </li>
            <li> Teens girls will especially love the romantic design - plus, everything you need is included, so you can tuck it into your bag, or keep it in your gym locker.</li>
            <li> It smells great and works very well.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> gel&#x3D; more convenient and faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn, but I had a lot of stray hairs around my knees that I wasn&#x27;t able to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t my favorite..</li>
            <li> When you finish with the razor head, you just click a release at the top, and the head falls off.  </li>
            <li> I love the venus razors and the Venus Breeze lives up to the others.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed pilot-testing this razor.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li> This worked better than I thought.</li>
            <li> It glided smoothly and smelled quote nice.</li>
            <li> glad i tried them.</li>
            <li> I would love to stop buying shaving gel</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for many years, and have been a fan of the Embrace cartridges.  </li>
            <li> even after going over an area on my leg many times, i still had stubble.</li>
            <li> I Love these razors.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of my favorite type of razors though because you can switch out the blade part and continue to use the handle part.</li>
            <li> I was excited to learn that Venus had come out with their own version of the Intuition and knew I had to try</li>
            <li> Anyway, all in all, pretty, smells good, shave</li>
            <li> This is a great new razor.</li>
            <li> If you do prefer the shower to the tub, then another nice thing about VENUS BREEZE is that you never have to worry about shaving your legs quickly, before the shaving cream rinses off in the shower spray.  </li>
            <li> Awesome moisture for dry legs and makes shaving a breeze, BUT</li>
            <li> This razor prevents cuts or scrapes and delivers the closest most comfortable shave imaginable.</li>
            <li> The razor is comfortable and provides a safe, close shave.</li>
            <li> When all the conditioning stuff was gone I bought a pack or refills, because I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> I love the Venus Breeze and would highly recommend it to anyone else who thinks shaving cream is a pain!!!!    </li>
            <li> Everything about this razor is easy and efficient.</li>
            <li> I can easily get 15 uses out of a blade.</li>
            <li> It gave a close, clean shave and the lotion bar at the top was convenient as I did not have to continually apply soap to my legs.</li>
            <li> Works well, handy for travel, but some of us are sensitive to chemical perfumes and prefer to use our own brand of lotion.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a razor to use primarily on your legs, then this one is it.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Gillette Venus so this seemed like a great upgrade --</li>
            <li> And so smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> My legs aren&#x27;t burning anymore, and they feel somewhat smooth.</li>
            <li> Now, the smell was great, but I&#x27;m left with..why?</li>
            <li> It is amazing - smooth, very close shave - everywhere.</li>
            <li> The company offers a great deal for the bottom part of the razor, then they up the price for the refills...not worth it.</li>
            <li> The moisture strips feel very nice, but the only issue is that they keep falling off.</li>
            <li> The packaging is well done and the way the razor blades are packaged within their own little cups, is a real cute</li>
            <li> The really cool lotion pads on either sides of the blades gives you a soothing, smooth feel combined with an incredibly smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> * to shave and this definitely makes the whole experience a lot more pleasant and easy.</li>
            <li> The new scent is pleasant &amp; the color is pretty and girly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> first when I tried it on my legs it was pretty nice...</li>
            <li> I also get compliment from my family for my super smooth legs.  </li>
            <li> For the Spa Breeze razor, the gel/soap bar is scented with a pleasant combination of white tea and tropical flowers.  </li>
            <li> Also, the gel kind of goops, at first especially, and we found it kind of gooping off of she razor when not in use.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I received a free sample of this razor (it came in a clear travel bag, with a free bottle of shower gel and a free bar of deodorant.</li>
            <li> Not as smooth as my regular razor (Schick Intuition - which is nice and gives great results, but so bulky and big), but it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> This product was fabulous at first!</li>
            <li> Each razor head is individually packaged, so it&#x27;s very easy and safe to take a spare with you somewhere.  </li>
            <li> And honestly, they are all pretty much alike.</li>
            <li> So it came as some surprise that this latest generation really did up the ante a bit from a performance standpoint.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t at all sure of how much pressure to apply....</li>
            <li> This on its own would have been negated by the convenience of using a one-step razor, but the issue with frequent nicks was a dealbreaker for me.</li>
            <li> But they aren&#x27;t really different, so if you&#x27;re thinking about getting rid of a perfectly good one for this one, save your money.</li>
            <li> So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So</li>
            <li> But after shaving twice, the moisture strips on the top and bottom got kind of dry</li>
            <li> I will have to see how many actual uses I get out of one top</li>
            <li> Clearly, the Personal Touch razor, which this consumer used for many many years, didn&#x27;t have as brilliant a marketing strategy, and thus died a quiet death.   </li>
            <li> Works for a quick shave if you&#x27;re not looking for perfection.</li>
            <li> And it takes awhile for it to dry, so this isn&#x27;t a good razor to bring on vacation unless you&#x27;ll be in one place for awhile.</li>
            <li> And it is so pretty!</li>
            <li> It seems to work fine as long as you keep the razor totally satured with warm water and make sure you use a light touch.  </li>
            <li> &quot; fragrance is pleasing but mild, and I think it would pass muster with most sensitive noses.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the Venus razors and frankly didn&#x27;t really see how they could improve upon the version I was using.  </li>
            <li> and the smell is nice, it simply is not functional.</li>
            <li> Its almost worth the price but take my warning</li>
            <li> Inside the holder is space for two spare razor cartridges, each sealed in their own individual packaging.  </li>
            <li> and I really liked the extra moisturizer around the blade.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t really worth replacing the razor so often.</li>
            <li> I always find that I rarely cut myself</li>
            <li> These are nice overall.</li>
            <li> but as of right now, I will be buying this tool again.</li>
            <li> The shaving gel is built right into the shaver.</li>
            <li> The holder is handy, and keeps the extra blades handy and dry while holding the razor handle.  </li>
            <li> It worked quite nicely though it did take me 3 times on one arm and 2 on the other to completely clean off both areas.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, Venus does have some brilliant marketing to be able to constantly repackage what is essentially the same product over and over again.</li>
            <li> For those who have used a Venus razor:  The only difference between this Venus and previous instances, as best as I could tell, was the scent of the gel/soap bars and the color of the razor handle.  </li>
            <li> Con:  While this is a great razor, the plastic packaging is bulky and excessive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same razor blade several times and am still getting a great shave.  </li>
            <li> This version, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR comes in a nice white tea scent that is a very pleasing change of pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor gives a good shave, but I had a similar problem with it nicking me too frequently.  </li>
            <li> For a woman who wants a quick shave, this seems like a solution.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the scent on this one, and I&#x27;m not normally a fan of shave gel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this for those &amp;#34;intimate areas&amp;#34; because its a very gentle shaver.</li>
            <li> I changed the blade and it was great again, but after a week both moisture strips fell off and the blades got really dull.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t shave close, then I feel icky, lol.  </li>
            <li> I have used a VENUS BREEZE for a number of years now, and this convenient, one step razor always gives me soft, smooth legs, with no nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li> I really like these razors!  </li>
            <li> In fact I just bought my first package of refill razors.</li>
            <li> For years, I used the [[ASIN:B000FW2NGC Schick Intuition Plus Shaving Kit for Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, 1 each]]</li>
            <li> During the first use, I noticed two things:</li>
            <li> and then I knicked myself a lot and got ingrown hairs on my armpits for the first time.</li>
            <li> first is the soap/gel bars.  </li>
            <li> Since the blade replacements are individually wrapped, I can keep them in my vanity safely.    </li>
            <li> I buy all my refills at Amazon for a better price than the big box stores.</li>
            <li> Even though I have to shave my legs daily because the hair grows do fast, the Gillette Venus shaved smooth and my legs felt silky smooth immediately after shaving.</li>
            <li> Brand new and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Far superior to the multipacks of those pink daisy razors.</li>
            <li> The grip is comfortable even in my nondominant hand, and the light pink color is very subtle--not too girlie.  </li>
            <li> so I bought the large pack with refills.  </li>
            <li> The gel also is a light moisturizer, but you will still need to use your regular skin cream if you live in any kind of extreme</li>
            <li> I have to admit the Venus Breeze has some real positives to it.</li>
            <li> I shave close enough to feel comfortable, then I have razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I really like the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE RAZOR.  </li>
            <li> The razor itself glides over my legs well, making shaving much quicker as well as painless.</li>
            <li> You really DON&#x27;T need shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> wife indicates that she really likes the lotion bars, that they make it so it does not even feel like one is using a razor.  </li>
            <li> I would have really appreciated the convenience and ease of this years ago, but I&#x27;ll take it now.</li>
            <li> so the razor caddy that sticks to the wall in the shower doesn&#x27;t serve much purpose.</li>
            <li> I needed the travel bag, and it was only (...) for the bag and all the free stuff, so it was a no-brainer).     </li>
            <li> It was absolutely unbearable.    </li>
            <li> I guess it just didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I have to really get the shower nozzle pointed at the razor to get stray hairs out before I put it away, and it feels like I&#x27;m wasting the soap/gel bars when I do it.  </li>
            <li> But my money for the whole product was returned.</li>
            <li> Its gets really slimy fast.</li>
            <li> They are either not sharp enough, or are made of very cheap metal.</li>
            <li> Then shave away in your normal manner, and you will have the softest legs of your life!  </li>
            <li> I tried using this razor when it was first introduced several years ago and quit using it because the gel bars would dissolve too quickly, making a huge mess, and then fall right off the razor.  </li>
            <li> This is a reasonably priced high quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other razors often force you to press directly on the razor head to lock it in, and it&#x27;s very easy to cut your finger while doing it.  </li>
            <li> The VENUS BREEZE RAZOR line is pretty, feminine, and clearly \\&quot;made for a woman, not a man.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about the VENUS BREEZE is that it had considerably improved the built-in gel bars on the razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be nice if Gillette provided a small razor brush to help with cleaning between uses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to see this razor come with a cleaning brush and a nice travel pouch instead.ut cutting yourself on a spare razor while digging through a drawer.    </li>
            <li> The razor itself is a girly pink that is visually appealing - and the handle has a soft grip.  </li>
            <li> That alone is the main reason I discontinued use of the VENUS BREEZE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> gel bars themselves do a decent job of lathering your skin for the shave, but I found the gel felt somewhat gooey.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin, and this was the first time I&#x27;ve ever had a shaving product to make me feel that way.</li>
            <li> but I like the regular Venus shavers better, especially for the arm pit area.</li>
            <li> That said, this is a decent razor.</li>
            <li> But I discovered I could get just as quick a shave with some body lotion, and a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the bottom area still runs out first, as it is used the most, but there is very little on the top bar wasted when the bottom bar is gone.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Otherwise,this item deserves a high recommendation.  </li>
            <li> After I shaved my right leg, I immediately began shaving my left leg</li>
            <li> While I was shaving my left leg, my right leg began to sting.</li>
            <li> looking I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> Plus, you can&#x27;t do a quick \\&quot;Dry shave\\&quot; under your arms because of the moisturizer around the blade.  </li>
            <li> very soft</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that often gets razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Not only do you get a really close shave, but so far I haven&#x27;t so much as gotten a nick.   </li>
            <li> Many razors just aren&#x27;t sharp enough to give me a close shave, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the Venus line.  </li>
            <li> Many razors just aren&#x27;t sharp enough to give me a close shave, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the Venus line.  </li>
            <li> Using the Gillette Venus razor compared to my old Schick razor us a no brainier!</li>
            <li> The styling is pretty, pink (real girly-girl factor) and fits well in your hand (ergonomically).</li>
            <li> For a quick shave, try some body lotion and a regular razor, but only if you have a little hair, and remember to lightly press.      </li>
            <li> It has little \\&quot;wings\\&quot; of soap on either side of the triple blades that flex to fit the contours of the body.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;gel&#x27; they have on the cartridge extends so far out that the blades don&#x27;t actually make contact, unless you really push, and I now know that gets you stubble and scars.  </li>
            <li> Oh and I have ridiculously sensitive skin and this razor didn&#x27;t bother me at all</li>
            <li> It is soft and not too</li>
            <li> Also, the design is such that you can&#x27;t really use it</li>
            <li> Also, the design is such that you can&#x27;t really use it</li>
            <li> Finally my old razor got so yucky</li>
            <li> The package, which appeared as if it might be difficult to open, was quite easy to open and the razors themselves are very easy to change.</li>
            <li> The razor itself is the same as the original Venus razor, same number of blades, and does the job well enough.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I was missing a particular &#x27;right&#x27; way to do it</li>
            <li> Honestly, the actual razor heads sold separately  are not a good price value.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are three main features of a Venus razor versus a standard multi-blade women&#x27;s razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink and pretty.</li>
            <li> Where Intuition had a massive amount of shave bar all the way around the razor, leaving much wasted when the area that actually lathers the skin runs out, VENUS BREEZE had gel bars on the top and the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Maybe on later uses they will work better, but this first use left me rather annoyed.</li>
            <li> then the cheap, pink daisy razors that I have always used, but they last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been changing the blade about once every 10 days</li>
            <li> problem with these (versus the other brand of 3-blade girl shavers) is that the strip of shaving gel disappears long before the blade wears out, but the extra surface area where the gel was is then irritating, so you can&#x27;t really use it once the gel&#x27;s gone, even though the blade is still perfectly good.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I had my tween daughter use my extra Embrace cartridges, or she would have been a mess using these.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the same problem with frequent nicks using the Venus Vibrance as I do with the VENUS BREEZE.  </li>
            <li> I could barely feel the shave...</li>
            <li> i normally am sensitive to razors but this one was different.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor that has never cut me, but still leaves my legs with that soft feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin, girly and cute.  </li>
            <li> find the overly large spa strips (with lotion) to be both a positive and a negative factor when dealing with the Venus.</li>
            <li> I rarely get nicks and my shave time is cut in half compared to using regular shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I used the Venus for one straight week and NO bumps, burn or nicks like the other brands.</li>
            <li> The only downside - and one that isn&#x27;t specific to this Venus Spa Breeze - is the ever increasing and now nearly exorbitant cost of razor blades.  </li>
            <li> Plus it comes with a suction cup that you can hang high in the shower and keep it from getting wet...</li>
            <li> However, the soapy bars of moisturizer began to fall off after the first few shaves.</li>
            <li> Allergy now turned into infection, and my poor kid is using topical antibiotic with a possibility of starting an internal one if it doesn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li> and the suction never fails like others have for me in the past and sent a razor hurdling at my bare feet...</li>
            <li> The reason for the three stars is that the gel bars protrude out a little too much and interfere with the contact made by the razor to the skin.</li>
            <li> They do flex a little, but especially when they are new, they are cumbersome and they block the blades from getting close enough to the skin, especially in contoured areas like the knee and the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last very long and left with me with bumps after shaving.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize well, though, and at least for the first use or two, you won&#x27;t need to use any shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much safer and easier replacement process than razors I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  </li>
            <li> Pros:  Blades last a long time,</li>
            <li> About the only minor gripe that I had with the Sea Breeze</li>
            <li> At least on my first use it seemed to take a very long time to shave a tiny area.</li>
            <li> , it actually lasts about twice as long!  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has the pre-gelled part, however the soap on the razor itself does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, 3 out of 4 of those are all really superficial and don&#x27;t amount to much.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this rack to be a complete waste, only because the adhesive will not stay stuck to the shower wall.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this rack to be a complete waste, only because the adhesive will not stay stuck to the shower wall.  </li>
            <li> And the strips are the only thing that make this razor different from any other razor.</li>
            <li> , the VENUS BREEZE is a little more difficult to use in the bikini area, as it is wider than a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cartridges do not fit into the holders unless they are for the same model, so don&#x27;t get any big ideas of upgrading your current handle with replacement blades.</li>
            <li> (For those who are curious, the razor has three blades and is basically the same as the Mach 3, except marketed and packaged for women instead of men.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (For those who are curious, the razor has three blades and is basically the same as the Mach 3, except marketed and packaged for women instead of men.)    </li>
            <li> If your skin&#x27;s not sensitive, this might not be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so have been shaving a long time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave very often, so my leg hair is rather thick.</li>
            <li> the standard (purple) VENUS BREEZE, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR (pale pink) comes with a holder which mounts directly to the wall of your shower or bath.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m making too big a deal of that, but I have a weak stomach, and that really grossed me out.    </li>
            <li> , that I really only need to shave them every other day.)  </li>
            <li> I really only need to shave them every other day.)  </li>
            <li> This may be due to my not having prior experience using this type of &#x27;pre-soaped&#x27; razor.  </li>
            <li> My daughter recently started shaving and she had wanted to try the other razor brand  with built in shave cream.  </li>
            <li> You never want to shave with a dry razor anyway...</li>
            <li> dry shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the bars make it a little tough to clean the razor.  </li>
            <li> I started using the previous Venus razor and have been spoiled for lesser razors.</li>
            <li> However, I found it less than idea for underarms and bikini since it&#x27;s so big!</li>
            <li> a less close shave was the price of skipping the regular shaving cream...until Venus Breeze/Spa proved otherwise.</li>
            <li> The blade lasts for about a week for me, but it could last up to a week and a half.</li>
            <li> only negative about the VENUS BREEZE is that the gel bars do not last as long as the blades!  </li>
            <li> I bought a big package for $20+, but that is now money down the drain because I&#x27;m throwing them away!</li>
            <li> While you are soaking, get the cartridge wet, so that the gel gets creamy.  </li>
            <li> Just wet the blade and shave away.</li>
            <li> downside of these razors is that there is no guard so when they get wet, the lotion bars fall off before they are all used up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink.  </li>
            <li> Love all the other Venus razor blades but these really are terrible.</li>
            <li> Tried for so long and ended up just breaking them all in half.</li>
            <li> the third use, those gel bars have worn down a little (or a lot) and you can get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> However, the bars do mean that you have to press a little harder than you might be used to when the razor head is new to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t attempted to use the razor without shaving cream, as the claims say you can (I have dry/sensitive skin that I feared would not react well), I will say that I think the skin of my legs gets less dry with this razor</li>
            <li> But now with less slobbery gel goop, you are very likely to have irritated skin or little cuts.</li>
            <li> EVERY SINGLE time I&#x27;ve used these I have nicked myself at least once if not multiple times.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that these gel pads don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This razor, as with the other Gilette razors I have tried, does not rust as other brands I have tried do.</li>
            <li> Just want to let other buyers know that the shower hook is still included as of 03/10/15.</li>
            <li> I could detect no noticeable difference between this Venus and any other</li>
            <li> I just wish Gillete would either improve the storage rack or just skip it in favor of other accessories.  </li>
            <li> I just wish Gillete would either improve the storage rack or just skip it in favor of other accessories.  </li>
            <li> The gel bars, the selling point of this product, are meant to be a substitute for soap or some other shaving gel.</li>
            <li> It stays sharp longer and does not cause a lot of nicks.</li>
            <li> I wet my legs, turned the shower off, and sat down inside.  </li>
            <li> In either case, the razor cannot be gripped too firmly because your leg IS going to hurt with a dry shave.  </li>
            <li> The very first thing I noticed about it is that there is a slimy, goopy gook that stretches (picture okra or chicken slime when you&#x27;re cleaning it) as you shave.</li>
            <li> and I typically shave every other day.</li>
            <li> This interference can also lead to nicks because it&#x27;s difficult to gauge how much pressure to apply to get the razor to meet skin.</li>
            <li> Gillette has done it again, but I wish they could do it for less money.</li>
            <li> Just one less thing to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The triple blades are usually very long lasting, but with the irritating little pads dragging along your shaving surface, the long-life blades become an unusable waste.</li>
            <li> It is so convenient not to have to use shaving cream and all the mess that goes with that stuff.</li>
            <li> Yuck and not worth the money and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel I can recommend these for someone with long thick hair.</li>
            <li> (i didn&#x27;t cut myself a lot before, but i don&#x27;t get those little cuts at my ankles and knees).</li>
            <li> Not just little nicks either, ones that have to be bandaged.</li>
            <li> However, when I tried to use it on my underarms and bikini area, I found the stips as well as the pivoting factor of the razor design, to make it awkward and almost impossible to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> I can get away with shaving some areas once a week, but my legs need to be shaved at least every other day during the summer or there is visable black stubble.</li>
            <li> (I had some Nair on my bikini area, so I didn&#x27;t have time to waste).</li>
            <li> :((((( The terrible thing was that her best friend also reported similar symptoms and when I tried to shave a small area on my skin, it was inflamed and covered in blisters within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> On every razor, one of the strips would fall after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Was missing one of the blades.</li>
            <li> (As the bars wear down from use, you don&#x27;t have to press as hard.)  </li>
            <li> I have to use soap to lubricate my skin before shaving if the cartridge is not brand new, and I keep cutting my armpit with this razor</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect after having used the Schick Intuition and being very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy my razors at the store but when I found out that you can buy online at Amazon and still use the $3.00 coupon?</li>
            <li> I usually just toss the razor in the tub for a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;m not sure if this company still tests on animals or not.</li>
            <li> While it isn&#x27;t necessarily a problem, it just felt sort of weird to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> These bars basically provide the glide that you usually get from shave gel or foam.  </li>
            <li> I usually end up ditching the rack and just using an off-the-shelf razor holder instead.  </li>
            <li> I usually end up ditching the rack and just using an off-the-shelf razor holder instead.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to use shaving cream in order to not get razor burn on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I can usually get 5-7 shaving days out of each refill before I need to change the head.  </li>
            <li> Stay away from Venus Spa Breeze products, test it before using on a small area of your skin.</li>
            <li> I tried these new Spa Breeze cartridges and cut myself so badly trying to get a close shave that I now have a scar.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to get everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The moisture parts do fall off after awhile which then makes the razor hard to use.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it any longer than that since blades do dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a growing adolescent teenager and have to shave my legs at least three times a week.</li>
            <li> One, there is a lot of slobbery goop coming off the razor... and two, the shave gel bars that sit above and below the blades make it very difficult to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Too bad Gillette doesn&#x27;t package this razor in a similar way to their men&#x27; products.</li>
            <li> So bad that I actually had to write a review.</li>
            <li> Went to a dermatologist, after she carefully read the ingredients used in Venus Spa Breeze, she was shocked.</li>
            <li> but even worse, they get in the way.  </li>
            <li> feared that this product might not deliver a close shave, but indeed I was wrong.</li>
            <li> These cartridges are just way too expensive to have to replace them so often.</li>
            <li> but the actual blades- are horrible</li>
            <li> I always hated using shaving cream, because of the mess.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using this on my armpits and bikini area; I keep cutting myself or leaving stubble.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using this on my armpits and bikini area; I keep cutting myself or leaving stubble.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself on a spare razor while digging through a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Impossible to get the cartridge off in order to replace it.</li>
            <li> I now have $30 of razors and after weeks of bad shaves and razor burns, I give up.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how bad this experience was.</li>
            <li> I also put lotion on my leg before shaving because of the bad stinging that happened once after shaving.      </li>
            <li> I do so hate cutting myself!  </li>
            <li> THAT MADE IT WORSE!!!</li>
            <li> *hate</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by saying that I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s annoying</li>
            <li> I have a terrible time w/ razor</li>
            <li> Gillette Venus razors are the worst.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has the worst allergy after using this product, dermatologist visit is unavoidable.</li>
            <li> She said it&#x27;s outrageous what they put in that product, she said the worst petrochemicals were used in that gel bar.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> These are the worst Venus razor blades ever invented.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it! I usually buy my razors at the store but when I found out that you can buy online at Amazon and still use the $3.00 coupon? Amazing! This razor is the best, never worry about about shaving cream and it glides on so easy. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a good razor to use for some time now that I will stick with. I have to admit the Venus Breeze has some real positives to it. The styling is pretty, pink (real girly-girl factor) and fits well in your hand (ergonomically). The packaging is well done and the way the razor blades are packaged within their own little cups, is a real cute design.&lt;br /&gt;I find the overly large spa strips (with lotion) to be both a positive and a negative factor when dealing with the Venus. First, when using on your legs, I have to admit it&#x27;s really great. I found the shave to be close and my legs were amazingly smooth after using it (almost as if I had used some kind of baby lotion or shaving cream on my legs). However, when I tried to use it on my underarms and bikini area, I found the stips as well as the pivoting factor of the razor design, to make it awkward and almost impossible to get a good shave. If you are looking for a razor to use primarily on your legs, then this one is it. However, if you are looking for an all around razor, this may not work for you.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Gillette Venus so this seemed like a great upgrade -- so I bought the large pack with refills.  I now have $30 of razors and after weeks of bad shaves and razor burns, I give up.  I agree with other reviewers that these gel pads don&#x27;t work but even worse, they get in the way.  You never get that great close shave.  I have cut myself twice and have razor burn on my legs as I type this.  While I like the look of this product (soft pink instead of the blue/green combo) and the smell is nice, it simply is not functional.</li>
            <li> This is a great new razor. Gillette has done it again, but I wish they could do it for less money. I started using the previous Venus razor and have been spoiled for lesser razors. This razor prevents cuts or scrapes and delivers the closest most comfortable shave imaginable. Bravo!! The skin lotion helps make the shave smoother. Your skin feels and smells wonderful. Its almost worth the price but take my warning, if you start using this you will not go back to cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> I loved this version of the Venus Breeze.  I have a terrible time w/ razor burn~~when I shave close enough to feel comfortable, then I have razor burn.  If I don&#x27;t shave close, then I feel icky, lol.  The really cool lotion pads on either sides of the blades gives you a soothing, smooth feel combined with an incredibly smooth shave.  LOVE it!! I am SO picky about razors, but this one hit a home run with me!!</li>
            <li> I think the Venus breeze gillette could have been better packaged, and the razor more exposed. The way the soapy edges of the razor are covered prevents it from a close shave. I would probably not recommend this for a very effective shaving.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the Venus razors and frankly didn&#x27;t really see how they could improve upon the version I was using.  So it came as some surprise that this latest generation really did up the ante a bit from a performance standpoint.  Not only do you get a really close shave, but so far I haven&#x27;t so much as gotten a nick.   I&#x27;ve used the same razor blade several times and am still getting a great shave.  While I haven&#x27;t attempted to use the razor without shaving cream, as the claims say you can (I have dry/sensitive skin that I feared would not react well), I will say that I think the skin of my legs gets less dry with this razor and I almost didn&#x27;t need body lotion afterward.     The razor itself is a girly pink that is visually appealing - and the handle has a soft grip.  The razor comes with a case that I believe is intended to adhere to the wall of your shower, with storage for razor blades, which come individually packaged.  I don&#x27;t want to store my razor in the shower, so I can&#x27;t attest to how that works - but the concept is a nice one.    The only downside - and one that isn&#x27;t specific to this Venus Spa Breeze - is the ever increasing and now nearly exorbitant cost of razor blades.  If only you could use the blade to shave the price!   That said, this product is so good that if you&#x27;re trying to select between comparably priced razors/blades from competitors, I strongly recommend you try this one - I think you&#x27;ll be pleased in every way.</li>
            <li> My wife reviewed this product.    Pros:  Blades last a long time, smooth performance, moisturizing srips are a nice touch, the best of the Venus line that I have tried.    Con:  While this is a great razor, the plastic packaging is bulky and excessive.  Too bad Gillette doesn&#x27;t package this razor in a similar way to their men&#x27; products.</li>
            <li> I really like the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE RAZOR.  I have used a VENUS BREEZE for a number of years now, and this convenient, one step razor always gives me soft, smooth legs, with no nicks or cuts.  The VENUS BREEZE RAZOR line is pretty, feminine, and clearly \\&quot;made for a woman, not a man.\\&quot;  This version, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR comes in a nice white tea scent that is a very pleasing change of pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the standard (purple) VENUS BREEZE, the GILLETTE VENUS BREEZE, SPA BREEZE RAZOR (pale pink) comes with a holder which mounts directly to the wall of your shower or bath.  Inside the holder is space for two spare razor cartridges, each sealed in their own individual packaging.  Each cartridge has three blades, which give your legs a sexy, ultra close shave.  The three blades are surrounded by gel bars.  There is no need to use shaving cream; just moisten the gel bars to get that silky, satiny feel.  The gel also is a light moisturizer, but you will still need to use your regular skin cream if you live in any kind of extreme climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the best shave with a VENUS BREEZE, soak in a warm tub or stand under the shower to let the heat open up the pores of your skin.  This will help any razor to give you a closer shaver.  While you are soaking, get the cartridge wet, so that the gel gets creamy.  You never want to shave with a dry razor anyway...ouch!  I usually just toss the razor in the tub for a minute or two.  Then shave away in your normal manner, and you will have the softest legs of your life!  If you do prefer the shower to the tub, then another nice thing about VENUS BREEZE is that you never have to worry about shaving your legs quickly, before the shaving cream rinses off in the shower spray.  Just one less thing to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative about the VENUS BREEZE is that the gel bars do not last as long as the blades!  With care, the blades in each cartridge last up to a month.  (The triple blades shave my legs so close, that I really only need to shave them every other day.)  But the gel bars either run out or fall off in 2 - 3 weeks.  Then I go back to the shaving cream until the blades give out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I think the VENUS BREEZE is an excellent product.  I have been satisfied with it for many years.  If Gillette could just make the gel bars last a bit longer...the VENUS BREEZE would go from a great product to a perfect one.I really only need to shave them every other day.)  But the gel bars either run out or fall off in 2 - 3 weeks.  Then I go back to the shaving cream until the blades give out.    Other than that, I think the VENUS BREEZE is an excellent product.

            <li> This razor is great. Very easy to use - I appreciate the case that sticks to your shower wall. The razor itself glides over my legs well, making shaving much quicker as well as painless. This razor, as with the other Gilette razors I have tried, does not rust as other brands I have tried do. I recommend this razor without reservation.</li>
            <li> These are awesome!  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect after having used the Schick Intuition and being very disappointed.  But these work well without soap or shaving lotion, you just need water to create a lubricated surface on the skin and to rinse the razor, and it works wonderfully.  And even though they are disposable, I have used mine twice successfully without a problem and am still happy with the one blade.  The holder is handy, and keeps the extra blades handy and dry while holding the razor handle.  Definitely happy with this product and recommend.</li>
            <li> My first use of this light weight, delightfully fragrant shaver was to remove the hairs on my underarms.  It worked quite nicely though it did take me 3 times on one arm and 2 on the other to completely clean off both areas.  This may be due to my not having prior experience using this type of &#x27;pre-soaped&#x27; razor.  I wasn&#x27;t at all sure of how much pressure to apply....I do so hate cutting myself!  I did not have any razor burn or irritation after use so I consider this shaver to be really nicely functional.  I will have to see how many actual uses I get out of one top but as of right now, I will be buying this tool again.</li>
            <li> You should try this Gillette Venus Breeze Spa for yourself! It is amazing - smooth, very close shave - everywhere. And it is so pretty! Teens girls will especially love the romantic design - plus, everything you need is included, so you can tuck it into your bag, or keep it in your gym locker.</li>
            <li> A bit overpriced for what they are. Don&#x27;t last very long and left with me with bumps after shaving. Will not purchase again. Over rated.</li>
            <li> I wish the item was recyclable and the packaging that came with it recyclable too! Honestly, the actual razor heads sold separately  are not a good price value. The company offers a great deal for the bottom part of the razor, then they up the price for the refills...not worth it. Plus, I&#x27;m not sure if this company still tests on animals or not.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars if it used organic lotion. Works well, handy for travel, but some of us are sensitive to chemical perfumes and prefer to use our own brand of lotion.</li>
            <li> I really like these razors!  They are great.  You really DON&#x27;T need shaving cream.  It&#x27;s awesome!!!  I will definitely use them again.  The smell is relaxing too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a growing adolescent teenager and have to shave my legs at least three times a week. I used to use a regular razor with shaving cream, but I always thought it was a pain. I would lift my leg up onto the built in shower seat but the water would wash away the shaving cream every time. Then my friend got me hooked onto The Venus Breeze built in soap razor. Now, shaving my legs is literally a breeze!!! It&#x27;s a lot easier to do in a time in need. I can even shave legs and underarms when I need too. Like before a trip to the beach in the summer or a school concert. I love the Venus Breeze and would highly recommend it to anyone else who thinks shaving cream is a pain!!!!    lollipopluver</li>
            <li> I got this this razor to try and I loved it.  It smells great and works very well.  When all the conditioning stuff was gone I bought a pack or refills, because I loved it so much. Oh and I have ridiculously sensitive skin and this razor didn&#x27;t bother me at all so that is a huge plus! I would recommend this razor to anyone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel I can recommend these for someone with long thick hair. At least on my first use it seemed to take a very long time to shave a tiny area. I don&#x27;t shave very often, so my leg hair is rather thick. (I&#x27;m Italian.)    Maybe on later uses they will work better, but this first use left me rather annoyed. I probably won&#x27;t be getting the Spa Breeze blades again.</li>
            <li> Just want to let other buyers know that the shower hook is still included as of 03/10/15. I received mine today and it was included.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink and pretty. It give a great shave and the gel strip makes shaving very very smooth. I don&#x27;t know what else to ask of a razor.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Case that comes with the razor acts as a holder that can be on on the shower wall. (thought I wouldn&#x27;t use it, but it is actually handy)&lt;br /&gt;-Very good around the knees&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Not so good on underarms&lt;br /&gt;-Cant dry shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first when I tried it on my legs it was pretty nice...very soft and I really liked the extra moisturizer around the blade.  I thought it contoured nicely, exceptially around the knees.  However, I found it less than idea for underarms and bikini since it&#x27;s so big! It was hard to get everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, good razor but would probably not purchase because of it&#x27;s size. Plus, you can&#x27;t do a quick \\&quot;Dry shave\\&quot; under your arms because of the moisturizer around the blade.  I am going to stick with using my fianc&amp;eacute;&#x27;s mach 4 razor.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Everything about this razor is easy and efficient. The package, which appeared as if it might be difficult to open, was quite easy to open and the razors themselves are very easy to change. The spa breeze smell is very nice. It is soft and not too overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feared that this product might not deliver a close shave, but indeed I was wrong. What I like best about these razors is no shaving cream or additional lather is required. Just wet the blade and shave away. It couldn&#x27;t be easier. I *hate* to shave and this definitely makes the whole experience a lot more pleasant and easy. The blades are a bit more expensive then the cheap, pink daisy razors that I have always used, but they last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been changing the blade about once every 10 days and I typically shave every other day. I highly recommend this product. I will NOT be switching back to my daisy razors and generic shaving cream. In fact I just bought my first package of refill razors.</li>
            <li> This is a reasonably priced high quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife indicates that she really likes the lotion bars, that they make it so it does not even feel like one is using a razor.  It prevents razor burn as well as pulling and tugging.  With this design, it is not necessary to use shaving cream or soap for a lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of these razors is that there is no guard so when they get wet, the lotion bars fall off before they are all used up.  The refills are also a bit pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, this is a very nice shaving tool that is well worth a try.</li>
            <li> For years, I used the [[ASIN:B000FW2NGC Schick Intuition Plus Shaving Kit for Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, 1 each]] razor with great results.  Then they changed something about that razor and it nicked me almost every time I used it.  That&#x27;s when I threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was excited to learn that Venus had come out with their own version of the Intuition and knew I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the VENUS BREEZE is that it had considerably improved the built-in gel bars on the razor.  Where Intuition had a massive amount of shave bar all the way around the razor, leaving much wasted when the area that actually lathers the skin runs out, VENUS BREEZE had gel bars on the top and the bottom.  Yes, the bottom area still runs out first, as it is used the most, but there is very little on the top bar wasted when the bottom bar is gone.  From both a conservation aspect and a money-saving aspect, I like this a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor gives a good shave, but I had a similar problem with it nicking me too frequently.  My daily razor is actually another Venus product, the [[ASIN:B0009W7MD2 Gillette Venus Vibrance Soothing Vibrations Razor for Women, 1 Razor]].  I don&#x27;t have the same problem with frequent nicks using the Venus Vibrance as I do with the VENUS BREEZE.  That alone is the main reason I discontinued use of the VENUS BREEZE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the VENUS BREEZE is a little more difficult to use in the bikini area, as it is wider than a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel bars themselves do a decent job of lathering your skin for the shave, but I found the gel felt somewhat gooey.  While it isn&#x27;t necessarily a problem, it just felt sort of weird to me and I didn&#x27;t care for the texture.  This on its own would have been negated by the convenience of using a one-step razor, but the issue with frequent nicks was a dealbreaker for me.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver. It is so convenient not to have to use shaving cream and all the mess that goes with that stuff. The shaving gel is built right into the shaver. How convenient is that! I would have really appreciated the convenience and ease of this years ago, but I&#x27;ll take it now.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by saying that I hate shaving. I shave a lot of stuff- legs, arms, armpits, bikini area, and my big toe. I can get away with shaving some areas once a week, but my legs need to be shaved at least every other day during the summer or there is visable black stubble. I have very sensitive skin that often gets razor burn and ingrown hairs. So I got this thinking, perfect! Three blades&#x3D; close shave; built in shave gel&#x3D; more convenient and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, there are several issues with this razor. During the first use, I noticed two things: One, there is a lot of slobbery goop coming off the razor... and two, the shave gel bars that sit above and below the blades make it very difficult to get a close shave. They do flex a little, but especially when they are new, they are cumbersome and they block the blades from getting close enough to the skin, especially in contoured areas like the knee and the bikini area. It does moisturize well, though, and at least for the first use or two, you won&#x27;t need to use any shaving cream. I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn, but I had a lot of stray hairs around my knees that I wasn&#x27;t able to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the third use, those gel bars have worn down a little (or a lot) and you can get a closer shave. But now with less slobbery gel goop, you are very likely to have irritated skin or little cuts. I have to use soap to lubricate my skin before shaving if the cartridge is not brand new, and I keep cutting my armpit with this razor and I didn&#x27;t seem to have that problem with the regular Venus razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is either gone or falls off by about the fifth or sixth use. These cartridges are just way too expensive to have to replace them so often. I found that leaving the razor in the shower cuts it&#x27;s life even shorter so I keep it in a cupboard when I&#x27;m not using it... so the razor caddy that sticks to the wall in the shower doesn&#x27;t serve much purpose. Maybe if you are the only one who uses your shower and you shave every time you&#x27;re in there you can get some use out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like using this on my legs during the summer when I shave every day and I don&#x27;t want to spend the extra time with shaving cream. I don&#x27;t like using this on my armpits and bikini area; I keep cutting myself or leaving stubble. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again- the regular Venus is easier to maneuver and shaves closer. Even if I have to buy shaving cream again.ime you&#x27;re in there you can get some use out of it.

Even if I have to buy shaving cream again.</li>
            <li> Used it once and the soap bars are already almost all used</li>
            <li> Having started shaving my head over 20 years ago, I&#x27;ve used just about every razor out there. I had heard from another buddy that he borrowed his wife&#x27;s &#x27;Spa Breeze&#x27; and loved it. I gave it a try and no nicks, cuts, scrapes... And so smooth. Once the gel bars begin to wear out, I remove the gel attachment and use it on its own over my skin. Then I snap the razor back in and shave away. I can easily get 15 uses out of a blade. Good stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes... I&#x27;m a dude and just endorsed a ladies razor. If it works use it!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I received a free sample of this razor (it came in a clear travel bag, with a free bottle of shower gel and a free bar of deodorant. I needed the travel bag, and it was only (...) for the bag and all the free stuff, so it was a no-brainer).     What I like about this razor:  1. It&#x27;s pink.  2. It&#x27;s thin, girly and cute.  3. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold.  4. It has the built-in shaving gel.    Unfortunately, 3 out of 4 of those are all really superficial and don&#x27;t amount to much.    What I don&#x27;t like about this razor:  1. The very first thing I noticed about it is that there is a slimy, goopy gook that stretches (picture okra or chicken slime when you&#x27;re cleaning it) as you shave. It is absolutely, positively gross and unsightly. Perhaps I&#x27;m making too big a deal of that, but I have a weak stomach, and that really grossed me out.    2. I wet my legs, turned the shower off, and sat down inside.  After I shaved my right leg, I immediately began shaving my left leg (I had some Nair on my bikini area, so I didn&#x27;t have time to waste). While I was shaving my left leg, my right leg began to sting. After about two minutes, it became unbearable, so even though the time wasn&#x27;t up on my Nair and I hadn&#x27;t quite finished my left leg, I had to get under some running water.  THAT MADE IT WORSE!!! Both my legs began to burn! Discomfort is an understatement. I was in pain! I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin, and this was the first time I&#x27;ve ever had a shaving product to make me feel that way. It was absolutely unbearable.    So bad that I actually had to write a review. I think in my entire life, I may have been compelled to write a review once or twice. That&#x27;s how bad this experience was. So it&#x27;s been about 15 minutes since I got out the shower. My legs aren&#x27;t burning anymore, and they feel somewhat smooth. Not as smooth as my regular razor (Schick Intuition - which is nice and gives great results, but so bulky and big), but it&#x27;ll do. I don&#x27;t think the blades on this Spa Breeze got as close as I would like.    All in all, I would never buy this razor.</li>
            <li> The razor is comfortable and provides a safe, close shave. Initially I liked the idea of having moisturizer included. However, the soapy bars of moisturizer began to fall off after the first few shaves. (They worked well enough until then that I didn&#x27;t use shaving foam.) And it takes awhile for it to dry, so this isn&#x27;t a good razor to bring on vacation unless you&#x27;ll be in one place for awhile.</li>
            <li> This product was fabulous at first! But after shaving twice, the moisture strips on the top and bottom got kind of dry and then I knicked myself a lot and got ingrown hairs on my armpits for the first time. I changed the blade and it was great again, but after a week both moisture strips fell off and the blades got really dull. It wasn&#x27;t really worth replacing the razor so often. Also,never use it with shaving cream, as it clogs the razor. Overall, I&#x27;d reccomend any Venus razor EXCEPT this one.</li>
            <li> Because I can&#x27;t figure out what it is. And honestly, they are all pretty much alike. I could detect no noticeable difference between this Venus and any other I&#x27;ve used in the past. They shave off hair. They do a nice job of it. But they aren&#x27;t really different, so if you&#x27;re thinking about getting rid of a perfectly good one for this one, save your money. If you need to buy a razor anyway, you will certainly be happy with this one. Also, a note of caution, the only thing that seems to change from razor to razor is the shower caddy. The cartridges do not fit into the holders unless they are for the same model, so don&#x27;t get any big ideas of upgrading your current handle with replacement blades.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t my favorite.. Now, the smell was great, but I&#x27;m left with..why? Why would I want a smell while I&#x27;m shaving? I guess it just didn&#x27;t do much for me - I don&#x27;t see the need. She shave gel - I like it for shaving my legs, but didn&#x27;t care for it while shaving my arm pits. Also, the gel kind of goops, at first especially, and we found it kind of gooping off of she razor when not in use. I also found that while shaving arm pits, you need to apply some pressure to get the blades close to your skin - well, I don&#x27;t like to do that when shaving there. I like to very lightly shave there.    Anyway, all in all, pretty, smells good, shave gel is nice for legs.. but I like the regular Venus shavers better, especially for the arm pit area.</li>
            <li> For those who have used a Venus razor:  The only difference between this Venus and previous instances, as best as I could tell, was the scent of the gel/soap bars and the color of the razor handle.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s the same razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have not used a Venus razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three main features of a Venus razor versus a standard multi-blade women&#x27;s razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first is the soap/gel bars.  These bars basically provide the glide that you usually get from shave gel or foam.  You can definitely shave without lathering up.  That saves you time and cost.  However, the bars do mean that you have to press a little harder than you might be used to when the razor head is new to get a close shave.  (As the bars wear down from use, you don&#x27;t have to press as hard.)  Until you get used to this, you may notice some unintended stubble.  Also, the bars make it a little tough to clean the razor.  I&#x27;ve found that I have to really get the shower nozzle pointed at the razor to get stray hairs out before I put it away, and it feels like I&#x27;m wasting the soap/gel bars when I do it.  It&#x27;d be nice if Gillette provided a small razor brush to help with cleaning between uses.  For the Spa Breeze razor, the gel/soap bar is scented with a pleasant combination of white tea and tropical flowers.  I really liked the scent on this one, and I&#x27;m not normally a fan of shave gel scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second big feature of the Venus line is the easy-to-change razor head.  When you finish with the razor head, you just click a release at the top, and the head falls off.  Then, you open a sealed replacement head and click the handle into the slot.  It&#x27;s a much safer and easier replacement process than razors I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  Other razors often force you to press directly on the razor head to lock it in, and it&#x27;s very easy to cut your finger while doing it.  Each razor head is individually packaged, so it&#x27;s very easy and safe to take a spare with you somewhere.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself on a spare razor while digging through a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third feature is the hanging rack.  The Venus razor kit comes with a mounting rack for your shower.  The rack sticks to the shower wall using adhesive pads, and it holds 4 replacement blades (not included) and the razor with a blade attached.  I&#x27;ve found this rack to be a complete waste, only because the adhesive will not stay stuck to the shower wall.  Gillette didn&#x27;t improve on this design for the Spa Breeze line.  I was hoping they&#x27;d offer a suction-cup design.  Also, the design is such that you can&#x27;t really use it unless you wall mount it.  The razor needs gravity to stay in place, and because the bottom of the rack is rounded, you can&#x27;t just set it vertically on a shelf.  I usually end up ditching the rack and just using an off-the-shelf razor holder instead.  Since the blade replacements are individually wrapped, I can keep them in my vanity safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shave, this is the best razor out there, in my opinion.  I have very fine hair.  Many razors just aren&#x27;t sharp enough to give me a close shave, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the Venus line.  (For those who are curious, the razor has three blades and is basically the same as the Mach 3, except marketed and packaged for women instead of men.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the Venus line is excellent.  I just wish Gillete would either improve the storage rack or just skip it in favor of other accessories.  I&#x27;d love to see this razor come with a cleaning brush and a nice travel pouch instead.ut cutting yourself on a spare razor while digging through a drawer.

            <li> Admittedly, Venus does have some brilliant marketing to be able to constantly repackage what is essentially the same product over and over again. Clearly, the Personal Touch razor, which this consumer used for many many years, didn&#x27;t have as brilliant a marketing strategy, and thus died a quiet death.   The razor itself is the same as the original Venus razor, same number of blades, and does the job well enough. The reason for the three stars is that the gel bars protrude out a little too much and interfere with the contact made by the razor to the skin. This interference can also lead to nicks because it&#x27;s difficult to gauge how much pressure to apply to get the razor to meet skin. The gel bars, the selling point of this product, are meant to be a substitute for soap or some other shaving gel. But if you tend to use soap anyway, they are superfluous.   That said, this is a decent razor. Far superior to the multipacks of those pink daisy razors.</li>
            <li> I love the venus razors and the Venus Breeze lives up to the others. It give a nice close shave.  It stays sharp longer and does not cause a lot of nicks.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed pilot-testing this razor.  It has little \\&quot;wings\\&quot; of soap on either side of the triple blades that flex to fit the contours of the body.  Its \\&quot;white tea\\&quot; fragrance is pleasing but mild, and I think it would pass muster with most sensitive noses.  The grip is comfortable even in my nondominant hand, and the light pink color is very subtle--not too girlie.  About the only minor gripe that I had with the Sea Breeze is that it comes with a bulky holding case that can be mounted on the wall of a shower.  The case is intended to store the razor and a couple of blade-and-soap cartridges, but it was not too esthetic so I just didn&#x27;t install it.  Otherwise,this item deserves a high recommendation.  (Oh, and did I mention that it gives a great shave?)</li>
            <li> I usually have to use shaving cream in order to not get razor burn on my legs.  I used this razor with only my body wash and didn&#x27;t get burned at all.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this razor. I always hated using shaving cream, because of the mess. Also, I love to shave in the shower, which is difficult with shaving cream. With this razor, I shave in the shower, no problem. I always find that I rarely cut myself (i didn&#x27;t cut myself a lot before, but i don&#x27;t get those little cuts at my ankles and knees). I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> All of the venus products do a good, clean, irritation-free job &amp; this one is no exception. The new scent is pleasant &amp; the color is pretty and girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with these (versus the other brand of 3-blade girl shavers) is that the strip of shaving gel disappears long before the blade wears out, but the extra surface area where the gel was is then irritating, so you can&#x27;t really use it once the gel&#x27;s gone, even though the blade is still perfectly good. The triple blades are usually very long lasting, but with the irritating little pads dragging along your shaving surface, the long-life blades become an unusable waste. If your skin&#x27;s not sensitive, this might not be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it does give a great shave, even on bikini line, and it is very handy to have an all-in one for travel.</li>
            <li> Have been a user of this razor style for years.  Finally my old razor got so yucky looking I needed a new one.  My daughter recently started shaving and she had wanted to try the other razor brand  with built in shave cream.  She loved this one better.  I think there is no comparison.  I rarely get nicks and my shave time is cut in half compared to using regular shaving cream.  I can usually get 5-7 shaving days out of each refill before I need to change the head.  I also get compliment from my family for my super smooth legs.  I buy all my refills at Amazon for a better price than the big box stores.</li>
            <li> Gillette Venus razors are the worst.  They are either not sharp enough, or are made of very cheap metal. Yuck and not worth the money and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Check out the video  So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So this is my opinion comparing years of using the Gillette razors vs Dollar Shave Club mid range 4x razor    [...]  Click Here Check this out video review</li>
            <li> For a woman who wants a quick shave, this seems like a solution.  But I discovered I could get just as quick a shave with some body lotion, and a regular razor.  In either case, the razor cannot be gripped too firmly because your leg IS going to hurt with a dry shave.  The lotion comes out of this razor on the second leg, and never in any quantity to be any help.    For a quick shave, try some body lotion and a regular razor, but only if you have a little hair, and remember to lightly press.      UPDATE:  It seems to work fine as long as you keep the razor totally satured with warm water and make sure you use a light touch.  I also put lotion on my leg before shaving because of the bad stinging that happened once after shaving.      Works for a quick shave if you&#x27;re not looking for perfection.</li>
            <li> These are THE best razors!  They give the closest, smoothest shave with one pass over an area. Even though the &amp;#34;shaving cream&amp;#34; around the razor looks smaller than the ones on the brand I have used forever (big white block around razor), it actually lasts about twice as long!  Great!  Plus it comes with a suction cup that you can hang high in the shower and keep it from getting wet...and the suction never fails like others have for me in the past and sent a razor hurdling at my bare feet...</li>
            <li> This worked better than I thought. It glided smoothly and smelled quote nice. I could barely feel the shave...I had to look twice!</li>
            <li> Brand new and shipped quickly. Best shaver ever.</li>
            <li> Stay away from Venus Spa Breeze products, test it before using on a small area of your skin. My daughter has the worst allergy after using this product, dermatologist visit is unavoidable. Called Gillette, was on hold for 30 minutes. They said they will return the cost of the product to me. The next day my daughter was in agony, couldn&#x27;t sleep at night because her skin was so inflamed and itchy. Went to a dermatologist, after she carefully read the ingredients used in Venus Spa Breeze, she was shocked. She said it&#x27;s outrageous what they put in that product, she said the worst petrochemicals were used in that gel bar. Allergy now turned into infection, and my poor kid is using topical antibiotic with a possibility of starting an internal one if it doesn&#x27;t get better. :((((( The terrible thing was that her best friend also reported similar symptoms and when I tried to shave a small area on my skin, it was inflamed and covered in blisters within 24 hours. Did anyone else have similar reaction?</li>
            <li> These razors are amazing. Love the shave and the smell of soap is really pleasant</li>
            <li> i normally am sensitive to razors but this one was different. this onedid the job well and didn&#x27;t give me razor burn at all. i decided to switch to this brand and have had no problems. glad i tried them.</li>
            <li> I tried using this razor when it was first introduced several years ago and quit using it because the gel bars would dissolve too quickly, making a huge mess, and then fall right off the razor.  I would love to stop buying shaving gel so I decided to give it another try.  I was very impressed!  The gel bars have been improved.  They remain on the razor and they do the job of eliminating the need for a shave gel.  I think a disposable may still give a bit of a closer shave but I like the convenience of this razor and will continue using it.  It&#x27;s especially nice for travelling.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for many years, and have been a fan of the Embrace cartridges.  I tried these new Spa Breeze cartridges and cut myself so badly trying to get a close shave that I now have a scar.  The &#x27;gel&#x27; they have on the cartridge extends so far out that the blades don&#x27;t actually make contact, unless you really push, and I now know that gets you stubble and scars.  Luckily, I had my tween daughter use my extra Embrace cartridges, or she would have been a mess using these.</li>
            <li> Good razor works well</li>
            <li> Horrible. great handle, but the actual blades- are horrible the &#x27;soap&#x27; thing gets in the way and doesn&#x27;t give you a close shave. even after going over an area on my leg many times, i still had stubble. - wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> These are nice overall. The moisture strips feel very nice, but the only issue is that they keep falling off. On every razor, one of the strips would fall after just a few uses. And the strips are the only thing that make this razor different from any other razor. I will just stick to regular razors from now on.</li>
            <li> These are the worst Venus razor blades ever invented. I am 44 so have been shaving a long time and I have not nicked myself shaving in years. EVERY SINGLE time I&#x27;ve used these I have nicked myself at least once if not multiple times. Not just little nicks either, ones that have to be bandaged. Love all the other Venus razor blades but these really are terrible. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I bought a big package for $20+, but that is now money down the drain because I&#x27;m throwing them away!</li>
            <li> Was missing one of the blades. But my money for the whole product was returned.</li>
            <li> the gel part always falls off before the blade has worn out so that&#x27;s annoying but otherwise they do a good job</li>
            <li> Awesome moisture for dry legs and makes shaving a breeze, BUT I can&#x27;t get a close shave because the soapy aloe thing attached is so big! Also, the soapy lotion strip looks like drippy snot after five minutes in water. Feels wasteful to have it all drip away. I&#x27;d recommend this for those &amp;#34;intimate areas&amp;#34; because its a very gentle shaver.</li>
            <li> The moisture parts do fall off after awhile which then makes the razor hard to use.</li>
            <li> Using the Gillette Venus razor compared to my old Schick razor us a no brainier! I used the Venus for one straight week and NO bumps, burn or nicks like the other brands. Even though I have to shave my legs daily because the hair grows do fast, the Gillette Venus shaved smooth and my legs felt silky smooth immediately after shaving. I keep one in my gym bag and one in my home shower. Love it! You will too! I got this item free to try and happy that I did.</li>
            <li> Impossible to get the cartridge off in order to replace it. Tried for so long and ended up just breaking them all in half. Don&#x27;t think I was missing a particular &#x27;right&#x27; way to do it and if there was one then there should have been instructions. Had already bought extra cartridges that I now have nothing to do with unless I get the same razor again. Was this their plan</li>
            <li> I really liked this razor. It gave a close, clean shave and the lotion bar at the top was convenient as I did not have to continually apply soap to my legs. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor that has never cut me, but still leaves my legs with that soft feeling.</li>
            <li> I Love these razors. I was a big fan of the Imtuitiin razor as i&#x27;d figured a less close shave was the price of skipping the regular shaving cream...until Venus Breeze/Spa proved otherwise. It&#x27;s convenient without sacrificing a close shave.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has the pre-gelled part, however the soap on the razor itself does not last very long. This is probably one of my favorite type of razors though because you can switch out the blade part and continue to use the handle part. I don&#x27;t think this razor is a cheaper than the disposable ones, but it makes my legs feel smoother. The blade lasts for about a week for me, but it could last up to a week and a half. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it any longer than that since blades do dull. The blade does last longer than the soap that is attached to it, so if you are still going to continue using it after the soap runs out then I would suggest you use some shower gel or something to go along with the razor. Also, if your skin is sensitive to scented soap then this probably would not be the best type of razor to use. Since, the pre-gelled part is Spa breeze scented. The package comes with a bath tub suction cup to hold the razor in place.</li>
            <li> The head of the razor is just so bulky and doesn&#x27;t give a great shave. Its gets really slimy fast. yuck</li>
