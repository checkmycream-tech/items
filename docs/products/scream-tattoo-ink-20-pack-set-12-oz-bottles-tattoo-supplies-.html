            <li> I would give this ink a no star review but their is no option for that.  This ink is bad and I mean bad.  My wife  got 2 tattoos using scream ink and they beecame so badly infected she had to go to the hospital for them.</li>
            <li> Expired ink ???!!!! I&#x27;m not buying expired ink, hope the expired ink customers got their money back.</li>
            <li> Used this ink for MANY tattoos, most customers took it well, some didn&#x27;t. The arctic blue sucks, it&#x27;s way to thick, I chew up the skin before it takes it in. Green bean also sucks. The pitch black sucks, not dark enough. I can say the tomato red, orange tang &amp; banana Rama were pretty okay.&lt;br /&gt;But in general once I was able to be in legitimate tattoo shop, I had to throw all this crap away! Esp once I got my hands on a reliable brand like Eternal. That&#x27;s when I realized what a tattoo SHOULD look like. Please don&#x27;t purchase this ink. Google it and you&#x27;ll see many lawsuits with this company.</li>
            <li> SUPER fast shipping. AWESOME! Thank you</li>
            <li> Busted ink bottles gave them time to fix problem they didn&#x27;t save your money buy decent set intenze or starbrite not from these clowns. ink is mid level</li>
            <li> great color all came nice everything was bright took well on skin would suggest to friends.....need some new ink this is great</li>
            <li> Is the best ink I ever used</li>
            <li> I bought this ink last weak  and you sent expired as of May of 2013 and  today&#x27;s date is March 2014 so pretty much I bought garbage, I&#x27;m very unhappy! and the purple ink bottle was open in the box was a mess I will never buy from scream tattoo product ever again !</li>
            <li> Received quickly. Item as described.  Manufacturing date on bottles says March and Oct of 2014.  Thanks</li>
            <li> i love the color it stays great.. just oddly enough it burned my skin while i was doing a tattoo on my self. ive never had this happen..</li>
            <li> Read bad reviews trying anyway black &amp;yellow are pretty good haven&#x27;t tried any other colors</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors. I would love for there to be more colors!</li>
            <li> Product arrived before expected! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Great color very bright get this you wont buy any other product.get this product you want be disappointed. Dont think just buy!!!!</li>
            <li> do not buy this ink, i repeat do not buy this ink. they send expired ink and the crap doesnt even go in the skin. it just turns ur tattoo into a giant scab.</li>
            <li> Arrived before stated arrival date. Great colors!</li>
            <li> Dont wastw your time in buying this ink the keep sending expired in and its so watered down</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. All ink is expired. Waste of 50 bucks. It&#x27;s not safe to use any of the ink. As a tattoo apprentice, I needed a cheap set of ink to use in starting, THIS IS NOT WORTH A PENNY. I cannot even use any of it. A big thank you for the seller for taking my money and sending me garbage! I am extremely dissatisfied and will never try to order scream ink again (or from this seller). I would have preferred spending more money to receive a legitimate company&#x27;s product (like external or fusion).</li>
