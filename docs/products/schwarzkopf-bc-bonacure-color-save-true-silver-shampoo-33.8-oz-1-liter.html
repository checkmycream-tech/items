            <li>Also it smells great, not too strong.</li>
            <li>Schwarzkopf here is amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not lying when I say that this products it AMAZING .</li>
            <li>The violet shampoo from Schwarzkopf is the absolute BEST violet shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li>If you remember that fragrance and liked it, well then this will appeal to you.</li>
            <li>It helps to keep your highliths with a beautiful color and if you have gray hair, this shampoo gives to the hair a very pretty color.  </li>
            <li>excellent product and transaction, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>With my white/silver hair, I&#x27;ve been through my fair share of trying numerous purple shampoos to find the one that works best for me.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing bargain, for a top quality purple shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I agree that it works well, but I don&#x27;t know that it works SOOO much better than Shimmer Lights as she claimed (because that stuff is effective too)</li>
            <li>It really gives my hair a beautiful glow.</li>
            <li>but when I received it, the product was perfectly fine!</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s going to work better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>However, I can 100% guarantee that the product I received is authentic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this more than once and have never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li>my hair stylist recommends using this more on the scalp than the ends.</li>
            <li>I may or may not buy more when I finish it.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo for blonde hair!!</li>
            <li>helps your blonde stand out, removes brassy color and leaves your hair smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shampoo</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been easy finding a product that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>I should not I use it every other day and my hair still looks great!</li>
            <li>It keeps the color from yellowing and the hair stays easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>I really like it; it leaves your hair very smooth..!</li>
            <li>This does the trick and also gives my fine hair a lot of bounce and body.  </li>
            <li>Even when I walk out of the salon with the perfect &amp;#34;champagne&amp;#34; blond hair color, it starts looking a little brassy by week 4 or 5.</li>
            <li>After one wash I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I will never buy another violet shampoo because this one is so great... and such an affordable price.</li>
            <li>These are great products and essential if you use peroxide on your hair.</li>
            <li>Works great on my long bob brunette ombre hair.</li>
            <li>I like my hair to feel squeaky clean after I rinse the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Brilliant product, would highly recommend to get rid of brassy tones in blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo.</li>
            <li>so I started using this shampoo and after a few uses it took all that brassy-ness out of my hair and looks beautiful now.</li>
            <li>Seller is easy to work with and very responsive.</li>
            <li>It gets all the yellow and warm hues out of my platinum hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last seven years ever since my hair stylist told me about it as I am a real bearded Santa and have been for 13 years it is a vary good shampoo</li>
            <li>I bought this after hearing rave reviews from my sister who says she wouldn&#x27;t have dyed her hair blonde if she didn&#x27;t have this stuff to effectively take out the brassiness.  </li>
            <li>Great product and literally half the price on amazon compared to buying from the salon!</li>
            <li>It arrived and right away I used it.</li>
            <li>, HOWEVER it does smell MUCH better and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair the way the way that Shimmer Lights does (which is important - my hair is already so dyed and fried).  </li>
            <li>Probably because the ends have been exposed to more toner and blue shampoo over time than the freshly dyed roots.</li>
            <li>If I start looking purple, I&#x27;ll cut back, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>It helped the brassiness the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Schwarzkopf!</li>
            <li>However, I could just notice the difference in my hair color after third time washing; but I guess it is ok.</li>
            <li>i have blonde hair and for me it works fine...</li>
            <li>The scent is very close to the &amp;#34;warm vanilla sugar&amp;#34; products at Bath &amp; Body Works.</li>
            <li>I got highlights done and some of them were really brassy</li>
            <li>I really appreciate this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fragranced, and it does linger.</li>
            <li>really think the label should warn that chemical poisoning may not show up immediately.. but can accumulate.</li>
            <li>even though the price is a little steep at first, I think it ends up being a better value, and I&#x27;m going to keep using it and buying it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is fantastic for grey or greying hair.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product in January and did not realize how strong the chemical were.. over the first few months I started to develop an itchy rash.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone with highlights or full-on blonds to keep your color away from the golden/brassy shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the last year and a half I&#x27;ve been a platinum blond thanks to a few very talented hair stylists.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once and while it didn&#x27;t completely eliminate the brassiness that my blond hair tends to get from our hard well water, it did a pretty great job considering it was only one use.</li>
            <li>Some other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried have turned my hair a light shade of bluish / purple, but not this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dark violet color and will stain your lips temporarily unless you wash them off right away in the shower, but the shampoo is fantastic at neutralizing any yellow tones in your lightened hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and doesn&#x27;t dry your hair.  </li>
            <li>Works better than Matrix, it&#x27;s really deep purple, I like it , i think it takes out the yellow out of my blonde hair .</li>
            <li>Well its still here so far.  </li>
            <li>I use it nearly every day.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this shampoo, and as I said in my review of the conditioner, it smells like the old BB&amp;W fragrance Rice Flower and Shea.</li>
            <li>It keeps my blonde hair cool and makes grey shimmer.</li>
            <li>It also seems more concentrated - a little goes a long way, so</li>
            <li>no more yellow hair, i strongly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Especially compared to Clairol Shimmer Lights which is super stinky and not cheap.</li>
            <li>This shampoo gets rid of those pesky yellow tones that sometime show up if you have any red in your natural hair color.  </li>

            <li> This shampoo gets rid of those pesky yellow tones that sometime show up if you have any red in your natural hair color.  </li>
            <li> I have balayage highlights through the end of my hair and my last visit to the salon left me with some very orange streaks (hard to see in the pic, but they were just about the same color as the 5 stars I&#x27;m giving!</li>
            <li> This shampoo will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I just went from dark brown to bleach blonde in only 2 weeks, so my hair was pulling a lot of brass</li>
            <li> I have long silver/white hair.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I use to keep my hair toned down and removing yellow hues that crop up from time to time.</li>
            <li> That should last me several years since it takes so little.</li>
            <li> Three shampoos with the Schwarzfoph Color Save left my ends toned and ashy blonde and lightened me up a little all over.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash every day as my hair is not at all oily and my scalp is dry as well.</li>
            <li> I tried getting my hair toned and the hairdresser left it a bit too dark</li>
            <li> i usually get a toner after getting the color done but it doesnt last very long, this thing make the hair brighter.</li>
            <li> The price per ounce is insane and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to try some other brands just to see how they are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally dark brown</li>
            <li> It got rid of the ugly yellow from my highlights  after first wash and even thos</li>
            <li> I see reviews on how people think the product is watered down or messed with</li>
            <li> Wanted the gray to be shiny and to tone down the outgrowing color.</li>
            <li> Half the price of a salon and keep my brass at bay.</li>
            <li> By avoiding the ends it prevents them from getting a slight gray tint.</li>

            <li> Keeps my hair in GREAT shape, doesn&#x27;t turn all coppery. I&#x27;m naturally dark brown so it helps with all the coloring and bleaching I&#x27;ve done. I totally recommend it to anyone gone blonde from brunette. Also it smells great, not too strong.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once and while it didn&#x27;t completely eliminate the brassiness that my blond hair tends to get from our hard well water, it did a pretty great job considering it was only one use. I look forward to using it again for the next wash, I think it&#x27;s going to work better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> With my white/silver hair, I&#x27;ve been through my fair share of trying numerous purple shampoos to find the one that works best for me. This is the one! Not only is the color the richest and deepest purple I&#x27;ve come across, but the scent is actually pleasant! Imagine that! I used to swear by Clairol&#x27;s Shimmer Lights, but the smell of it was just killing me- a chemically floral scent. It&#x27;s bearable, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But why deal with it when you don&#x27;t have to?? Schwarzkopf here is amazing and I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Half the price of a salon and keep my brass at bay. Love it..</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! It&#x27;s a dark violet color and will stain your lips temporarily unless you wash them off right away in the shower, but the shampoo is fantastic at neutralizing any yellow tones in your lightened hair.  Smells good, too. Buy it if you have greying or chemically lightened hair and don&#x27;t want any yellow tones in your hair.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for gray hair...love it (and it smells good too!)</li>
            <li> This is an amazing bargain, for a top quality purple shampoo.  I use it exclusively, and it always keeps my hair looking very nicely silver.  Some other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried have turned my hair a light shade of bluish / purple, but not this.  I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
            <li> I just got the shampoo.  Have used it once and I can see 2 to 3 times a week should be enough.  It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful.  It doesn&#x27;t smell and it takes just the smallest dab.  I did have to use some conditioner after the washing as I could tell it was drying to my hair.  No problem I have some great conditioners.  I would recommend this to anyone with silver or gray hair.  Someone on here posted a review of 1 star because he said they are discontinueing this product.  Well its still here so far.  I am going to check into that notion and if so, getting another bottle.  That should last me several years since it takes so little.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to purchase this from and non-salon location due to the possibility of a knock-off or fake product. However, I can 100% guarantee that the product I received is authentic. The violet shampoo from Schwarzkopf is the absolute BEST violet shampoo on the market. It gets all the yellow and warm hues out of my platinum hair. I use it nearly every day. I will never buy another violet shampoo because this one is so great... and such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo. The price per ounce is insane and it smells amazing! Especially compared to Clairol Shimmer Lights which is super stinky and not cheap. The scent is very close to the &amp;#34;warm vanilla sugar&amp;#34; products at Bath &amp; Body Works. I have balayage highlights through the end of my hair and my last visit to the salon left me with some very orange streaks (hard to see in the pic, but they were just about the same color as the 5 stars I&#x27;m giving! Three shampoos with the Schwarzfoph Color Save left my ends toned and ashy blonde and lightened me up a little all over. Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Works better than Matrix, it&#x27;s really deep purple, I like it , i think it takes out the yellow out of my blonde hair . i usually get a toner after getting the color done but it doesnt last very long, this thing make the hair brighter. I like it. Love the price, too!</li>
            <li> Great product and literally half the price on amazon compared to buying from the salon! I&#x27;ll never buy in salon again. I got highlights done and some of them were really brassy looking so I started using this shampoo and after a few uses it took all that brassy-ness out of my hair and looks beautiful now.</li>
            <li> It smells great, it works great. No complaints! This shampoo will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This shampoo saves my hair from the dreaded mellow yellow blonde. But do pair this with a hair mask to keep hair from dryinging</li>
            <li> i have blonde hair and for me it works fine... no more yellow hair, i strongly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have short hair and I bleach it all blonde.  This shampoo gets rid of those pesky yellow tones that sometime show up if you have any red in your natural hair color.  It&#x27;s mild and doesn&#x27;t dry your hair.  I use it everyday along with Bonacure&#x27;s Rescue Repair conditioner.  These are great products and essential if you use peroxide on your hair.</li>
            <li> Great product and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  Keeps the yellow away.</li>
            <li> My brassyness has been decreased.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t. Work . i have a silver platinum. Color an the matrix shampoo. Works great i decided to try this because price but it does not work at all</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing! It helped the brassiness the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;ve ordered this more than once and have never had a problem with it. I see reviews on how people think the product is watered down or messed with so I was scared to buy it..but when I received it, the product was perfectly fine!</li>
            <li> It helps to keep your highliths with a beautiful color and if you have gray hair, this shampoo gives to the hair a very pretty color.  It is great.  I use it for my highlithts.</li>
            <li> For the last year and a half I&#x27;ve been a platinum blond thanks to a few very talented hair stylists. My hair natural hair color is naturally a dirty blond and has a tendency towards a brassy blond when lifted with lightener or alternative non-bleach products. Even when I walk out of the salon with the perfect &amp;#34;champagne&amp;#34; blond hair color, it starts looking a little brassy by week 4 or 5. Enter this product. I use it 1-2 times a week and it totally saves my color. I highly recommend it for anyone with highlights or full-on blonds to keep your color away from the golden/brassy shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI my hair stylist recommends using this more on the scalp than the ends. Probably because the ends have been exposed to more toner and blue shampoo over time than the freshly dyed roots. By avoiding the ends it prevents them from getting a slight gray tint.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate this shampoo.  It&#x27;s just the silver brightener I was looking for.  Very effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last seven years ever since my hair stylist told me about it as I am a real bearded Santa and have been for 13 years it is a vary good shampoo and I do not understand the reason for Schwarzkopf stopping production of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;Santa Daniel</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very good for my pearl strands .... keeps me color</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything better!</li>
            <li> A truly wonderful shampoo! I have long silver/white hair. I got a perm and my hair turned a terrible yellow. After one wash I saw a huge difference. Now that I have used it several times, my hair is back to it&#x27;s beautiful silver/white. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone that has had a chemical reaction. Thanks Schwarzkopf!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic for grey or greying hair.  It keeps the color from yellowing and the hair stays easy to manage.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> I like this purple stuff, and I do feel like it&#x27;s taking the yellow tint out of my bleached blonde hair. I don&#x27;t wash every day as my hair is not at all oily and my scalp is dry as well. I am using this every time I do shampoo, at least for now. If I start looking purple, I&#x27;ll cut back, but so far, so good. I like the smell of this shampoo, and as I said in my review of the conditioner, it smells like the old BB&amp;W fragrance Rice Flower and Shea. If you remember that fragrance and liked it, well then this will appeal to you. If you prefer an unscented shampoo, this one won&#x27;t work for you. It&#x27;s very fragranced, and it does linger. For what it&#x27;s supposed to do, it&#x27;s great. I may or may not buy more when I finish it. I&#x27;d like to try some other brands just to see how they are. John Frieda makes a purple toning shampoo/conditioner product and I&#x27;d like to see how that one is since I do like JF products, too.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for blonde hair!!</li>
            <li> excellent product and transaction, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> since my hair turned white this is the only shampoo I use. It really gives my hair a beautiful glow.</li>
            <li> helps your blonde stand out, removes brassy color and leaves your hair smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo! It got rid of the ugly yellow from my highlights  after first wash and even thos I know I should not I use it every other day and my hair still looks great! No damage! Aaaand it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle for highlighted hair. I hate brassy tones and this eliminates them and brings back a natural blond color. Love</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing rave reviews from my sister who says she wouldn&#x27;t have dyed her hair blonde if she didn&#x27;t have this stuff to effectively take out the brassiness.  I agree that it works well, but I don&#x27;t know that it works SOOO much better than Shimmer Lights as she claimed (because that stuff is effective too), HOWEVER it does smell MUCH better and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair the way the way that Shimmer Lights does (which is important - my hair is already so dyed and fried).  It also seems more concentrated - a little goes a long way, so even though the price is a little steep at first, I think it ends up being a better value, and I&#x27;m going to keep using it and buying it.</li>
            <li> Good product and price. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Thank you. Love this shampoo. Seller is easy to work with and very responsive.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I use to keep my hair toned down and removing yellow hues that crop up from time to time.</li>
            <li> I started using this product in January and did not realize how strong the chemical were.. over the first few months I started to develop an itchy rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took four months and man visits to doctors, blood work, oral steroids, topical steroids and lots of stress to figure it out. Poison!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think the label should warn that chemical poisoning may not show up immediately.. but can accumulate. Expensive product and not able to use.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, thought this was going to be a great product. After using it, there was no difference.</li>
            <li> Brilliant product, would highly recommend to get rid of brassy tones in blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I really like it; it leaves your hair very smooth..! However, I could just notice the difference in my hair color after third time washing; but I guess it is ok. I do recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great for cooling brassiness in blondes!</li>
            <li> I like my hair to feel squeaky clean after I rinse the shampoo. I can&#x27;t get there with this shampoo. Stopped using it. Would be helpful also if it came with a pump.</li>
            <li> oh my goodness. Where to even begin. I&#x27;ve been through a lot with hair products since dying my hair blonde. It hasn&#x27;t been easy finding a product that I absolutely love. I tried John Frieda products but they left my hair greasy. I tried getting my hair toned and the hairdresser left it a bit too dark so I needed to go back to get it re done and then finally I stumbled upon this product after reading about it in an article online. I bless the day that happened. It arrived and right away I used it. I&#x27;m not lying when I say that this products it AMAZING . My search is finally over guys, it&#x27;s such a relief to know I don&#x27;t have to worry about brassy hair again.</li>
            <li> Great price! I&#x27;ve done 2 washes and I feel like it has improved the color of my hair. I just went from dark brown to bleach blonde in only 2 weeks, so my hair was pulling a lot of brass. I love the smell of this shampoo and I definitely feel like it does what it says.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It works!!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! It keeps my blonde hair cool and makes grey shimmer.</li>
            <li> Use this for my growing out gray hair.  Wanted the gray to be shiny and to tone down the outgrowing color. This does the trick and also gives my fine hair a lot of bounce and body.  It is purple color.</li>
            <li> Works great on my long bob brunette ombre hair. But didnt come with a pump?? And of cource the pump is another 10 dollars.</li>
