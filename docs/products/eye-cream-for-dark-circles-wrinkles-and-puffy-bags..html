            <li>Luv it.. Will buy more</li>
            <li>I love this eye gel.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to find this product through a promotional offer for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>This Sano gel works fantastic!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see more results over time.</li>
            <li>, I gave it one more try and happened again</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Love how this makes my eyes feel and look.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>They tend to make my skin look more even in tone</li>
            <li>(fading sun spots and freckles) and my skin seems to exfoliate better.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the way it feels when I put it on.</li>
            <li>Will report more after using it a while.</li>
            <li>: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I looked more awake and well rested.  </li>
            <li>My skin around my eyes felt tighter and more</li>
            <li>and I love these products.</li>
            <li>I would buy again just because it feels so darn refreshing under my eyes</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>Improvement in my wrinkles was noted gradually, and after six weeks, it looked remarkably better.  </li>
            <li>It seems to me that most of the people on here were bribed to give that many stars.</li>
            <li>Also love that it&#x27;s a 1oz glass bottle.</li>
            <li>but I was impressed enough to write here.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes you may have to use more than 1 type of a eye cream and some diet changes to fix the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you have all the variables that may have helped me:))  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see how this works with my crows feet!</li>
            <li>It goes on light, no fragrances, no eye irritation, and gives a great cooling and gentle tightening sensation.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>The gel dabs on easily, absorbs quickly and has a nice cooling effect with a  light cucumber fragrance.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great, firm and bright and its taking years off of my appearance.  </li>
            <li>Such a great product and no nasty chemicals added.</li>
            <li>immediately soaked and easily blended into my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strong cucumber smell, but I like cucumbers.</li>
            <li>This does not cause irritation and seems to hydrate the area pretty amazingly.</li>
            <li>It is amazing the first time i use it.</li>
            <li>It was nice and soothing when first applied but all in all, I wouldn&#x27;t keep using it.</li>
            <li>At first it felt warm to the skin</li>
            <li>Seems to be doing the job, but will need more time to see the full affect.</li>
            <li>It feels both cool and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>love that Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ is quick and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Got the best compliment the other day when a girlfriend of mine who hadn&#x27;t seen me in while asked if i had had my eyes done!</li>
            <li>I can see a bit of a difference in the fine lines after just a week.  </li>
            <li>I used it for a month now and noticed the fine lines around my eyes and forehead are disappearing.</li>
            <li>The gel absorbs into the skin and smooths the fine lines under my eyes and helps reduce puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I do not have as many break-outs and when I do they are quickly gone.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh cucumber scent, absorbs quickly, is non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause my eye-makeup to deposit under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is a HUGE bottle, I will probably be using it for close to six months.</li>
            <li>After a month of usage I see a huge differance.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Vit C believer.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and no irritation.</li>
            <li>I applied the cream and it was so smooth</li>
            <li>but I am loving this product and using sometimes on the whole face.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth with a hint of cucumber in the smell.</li>
            <li>There must be some truth to such products that doesn&#x27;t cost a great deal of money.</li>
            <li>When I stroke the skin around my eyes, it feels smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>Gel+ is also free from parabens, sulfates, and alcohols.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far so good</li>
            <li>I got a free sample, then liked it so much I bought a jar.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the investment which is very economical!</li>
            <li>Very fresh smelling and cooling.</li>
            <li>I just recently started having under eye shadows and tried several products-none worked as effectively and quickly as Sano&#x27;s Eye gel...excellent product and excellent price!</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this gel very much.  </li>
            <li>It feels refreshing and after 2 weeks I have had a slight improvement, but nothing great.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product as a bonus gift with the vitamin C serum and had to purchase a full size, It does the trick of erasing morning puffiness under my eyes and the wake up feeling it creates is fabulous.</li>
            <li>way too tightening and drying for the original intended use--for underyes.</li>
            <li>Originally was a gift and just purchased another container.  </li>
            <li>so I am really excited to see how it works in a month</li>
            <li>This stuff has significantly changed my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about a week now, and have seen significant results in my under eye area.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a excited</li>
            <li>This is my first product from Sano Naturals and am I glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>Gel+ has significantly improved my look as this product has made my skin look brighter, fresher, and healthier.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the gel reduced the puffiness significantly</li>
            <li>This cream feels so cool and comforting - smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this product and glad I did.</li>
            <li>Also, I felt like I was getting a super deal when I saw that they originally posted the price at $40.</li>
            <li>The jar came halfway full, like it had already been used before.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly this product actually works.</li>
            <li>I found that I really had make sure the area around my eyes was moisturized, otherwise the gel stings.</li>
            <li>2/3 full.</li>
            <li>However, it is easily absorbed, light, and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>But using it for 1 day, I have to say out of all the eye creams I&#x27;ve used this one makes your eyes feel awake with a cool feeling.</li>
            <li>*Full disclosure</li>
            <li>I really like this....very refreshing although I can&#x27;t say it does anything for bags under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am one of those lucky females who suffer with under eye circles.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It acts quickly to diminish bags under eyes and crows feet around the eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like giving my skin a drink of water and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Instant refreshing to the eyes :)</li>
            <li>great product, feels nice and not too heavy on the eyes, seeing small differences maybe in more time it will show more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value compared to many of the more expensive skin products in the marketplace.  </li>
            <li>Almost bought something similar at the mall for $150, glad I didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in the smoothness of the skin under my eyes after the first night!</li>
            <li>And in fact, I actually noticed more wrinkles after using it!  </li>
            <li>Unlike many others who have received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, I purchased this a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>Good basic, very lightweight eye gel.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very hydrated and this gel very soothing, I would surely buy this again.</li>
            <li>I opened up this cream, which is more like a clear gel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy and has a fresh smell like cucumbers.</li>
            <li>Gel+ smells like fresh cucumbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with it, but think I need to use it for awhile longer to tell about the results.</li>
            <li>a nice product that I can see myself buying again as soon as I run low on it.</li>
            <li>Gel smells like fresh cucumber.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference worth talking about.</li>
            <li>I have to see if it works on my dark circles and fine lines but am happy with product so far.</li>
            <li>The price is excellent when comparing to other similar products in the market.</li>
            <li>I received the Sano eye cream pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>and I like how it dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Works amazing love it have had dark circles for years and now not so much</li>
            <li>Really did not work for my under eye circles which is what I originally purchases this for.</li>
            <li>this one does right away.</li>
            <li>The gel works well for me twice a day, applying it once in the morning and again right before bed.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing &amp; cool.  </li>
            <li>I waited a little bit to write a review to be able to give a better product review.  </li>
            <li>The cream was working and the more it dried the better my eyes look.</li>
            <li>So far so good, noticed results after the second day!</li>
            <li>I was surprised and delighted to find that it made my fine lines much less noticeable.</li>
            <li>non oily overall a very nice eye gel similar to one I used years ago that I cannot find any longer.</li>
            <li>Very fast service.</li>
            <li>As a consumer who is conscious of what I put in and on my body I am very happy that they use natural and organic ingredients instead of harsh human-made chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more  when i get low</li>
            <li>Received this product free for review, I have puffy eyes and this cream seems to help so far with the puffiness, it tightens the skin you can feel it after you put it on.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>The eye cream is my favorite - You instantly feel and see results within seconds.  </li>
            <li>Thanks SANO makers!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mom of 9 and obviously throughout many years have had a lack of sleep.</li>
            <li>Many things that I have used on my face, only contribute to that</li>
            <li>I did place some on my forhead as well and when I touch my face now, a couple of hours later, there isn&#x27;t an oil feel; more like a hydrated skin feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I would really appreciate a refund!  </li>
            <li>I could&#x27;t believe the first time I applied this gel.</li>
            <li>At first it helped reduce puffiness</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product because I had a discount code to try it and most importantly wanted to try to get rid of my dark</li>
            <li>but this picture was taken about 3 days after I first used the cream</li>
            <li>I used full size product and it felt good to eyes, it was soothing and my eyes didn&#x27;t feel dry at application time or next morning</li>
            <li>, she&#x27;s been putting it under her eyes for some time now and says her skin looks soother, less noticeable lines and feels kind fresh when applying it.</li>
            <li>nice and not too thick, goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I went out and it was raining and pretty soon my whole face was slimy and shiny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything on the market to decrease the inflammation around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is working nicely to correct my dark circles</li>
            <li>First tried it this morning and it instantly made my fine lines disappear and evened out my coloring.</li>
            <li>it does a nice job of calming it down overnight.</li>
            <li>and I had more bulgy dry eyes.</li>
            <li>I am a 58 years, African American woman who has used skincare systems since I was 18 years old, so my skin is in pretty good shape.  </li>
            <li>Comparable to Estes Lauder intense eye.</li>
            <li>this works very week for pimples.</li>
            <li>Really like the gel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed too much difference yet, been using for about 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter how much sleep, hydration..</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>Really like.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it</li>
            <li>Since using the gel, the skin around my eyes is much smoother and the darkness under my eyes is not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li>so, so much.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs well, just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>Top 1/3 empty.</li>
            <li>This eye gel is very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for about two weeks and am really liking the results.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used much of this eye cream</li>
            <li>and I really feel it has help the skin texture too.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize or do anything noticeable.</li>
            <li>Well, the shipment did come fast.</li>
            <li>and  were very puffy.</li>
            <li>This cream really works.</li>
            <li>To my surprise it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Some reviews complained about the smell, but I loved it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products but none compare to this.</li>
            <li>one is like jello (trial size) and other one more like textured gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always excited to review eye creams and facial creams because I have the dreaded  type of &amp;#34;T zone&amp;#34; oily face.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are sensitive and found this stung at first but have not had that happen since that time.  </li>
            <li>Next day I opened my full size jar and to my surprise full size product looked and felt very different than the trial size even though both are gels</li>
            <li>love that this product doesn’t hide my bags or puffiness or dark circles.  </li>
            <li>It causes cream to get in the eye and cuase alerdic reaction and more dark circles.</li>
            <li>It causes cream to get in the eye and cuase alerdic reaction and more dark circles.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and is not irritating to the sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>As I get older, they are getting puffier and darker.  </li>
            <li>Clever of them.</li>
            <li>I tried Sano mainly because I did not want to spend tons of money on another eye cream that is expence and</li>
            <li>I have purchased quite a few different eye products on Amazon and this stuff is hands down wonderful!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>(Other than the amount a nice moisturizer helps aesthetically in the short term).  </li>
            <li>I feel like I have found a product that is going to help with that whole &amp;#34;growing old gracefully&amp;#34; thing and plan to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally allergic to eye creams.</li>
            <li>Will know more in a few weeks</li>
            <li>If you have dark circles or fine lines, I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have found a new use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any new wrinkles since I started, but with that said, none of my established wrinkles have disappeared &amp;#60;&amp;#60;shrug&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  </li>
            <li>Live and learn,  </li>
            <li>Can tell immediate results when placed under my eyes to help with dark circles, puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Unlike Sano Vit C serum, the eye cream actually works well to lightly tighten under and upper eye lids.  </li>
            <li>At first I felt like a little burning sensation but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li>I love this product, dark eye circles have become more subtle.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the SANO EYE GEL to anyone interested in preserving a younger you!&lt;br /&gt;CMS</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 69 years old and have been blessed with very good skin; however I&#x27;m getting crows feet, worry lines above my nose and on my forehead, deep creases from the outside of my nose to my chin, and my neck is starting to look a little like a turkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a week of daily usage I saw positive results.  </li>
            <li>significantly reduced my dark circles and puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I opened trial size first and on first night of use my eyes were swollen and skin around eyes seemed very dry next day</li>
            <li>It feels great to apply to the under eye when the gell is cold.</li>
            <li>Gel+ is a clear, gel like material.  </li>
            <li>It does tingle a bit when you put it on, note for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This Sano is comparable to the results I got from professional treatments.  </li>
            <li>I am assuming because it is all natural and no chemicals added as it is all organic.</li>
            <li>it is no overnight complete cure.</li>
            <li>Been using this for week and my skin feels so soft</li>
            <li>When I developed a blemish under my eye after using this, I gave up.</li>
            <li>It has the same type of consistency, which is why you don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell anything about it fighting wrinkles, but so far it is holding to</li>
            <li>The cream makes my eye area feel moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;be used it once so far</li>
            <li>I have slightly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes at all.</li>
            <li>Gel+ uses organic, vegan, cruelty-free, and natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>But the Sano eye gel really surprised me.</li>
            <li>This cream has a silky consistency , it goes on smooth and drys quickly , unlike other eye creams that leave a greasy paste behind this cream leaves your skin feel right and refreshed , I also pitched the vitamin C serum both of them paired together works wonders .</li>
            <li>Makes eyes feel clean and tight.</li>
            <li>I love how a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m noticing a small difference with some fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products in the past, only to find that I had to stop using them because they made my skin burn or my eyes burn and tear.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have as much puffiness although I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the dark &amp;#34;mommy&amp;#34; under eye circles.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye gel/creams, no name brand to highend brand ones with no good results as advertised.</li>
            <li>the gel is light not greasy and works well on small lines</li>
            <li>I am excited about finally finding something that wasn&#x27;t make-up to get rid of my dark circles.</li>
            <li>I have been battling with dark circles for a while and use many treatments including lazer treatments from Epion Medical Center in LA.</li>
            <li>My under eye skin is less baggy, not as dark and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>My entire eye area feels so soft and I can feel the skin gradually tightening.  </li>
            <li>I developed a reaction very shortly after I started using it,  so I stopped using it and went to see my doctor,  </li>
            <li>I have dark circles and bags under my eyes that are hereditary, so even after a good night&#x27;s rest, I always look tired.</li>
            <li>You can feel the gel tightening everything almost right away, and the firm feeling continues throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I find it works well in the morning if it is put on first thing, and allowed to sit for a half hour before makeup application.</li>
            <li>I am a 23 year old female with no wrinkles, so my main concern is dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t really helped reduce my dark circles.</li>
            <li>This is a nice thick gel, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference, but I use it and will see when the product is empty</li>
            <li>I do have dark circles and slight crowsfeet (deeper than I would prefer, but not bad).</li>
            <li>Wow, I ordered this product with little expectation of results but I was beyond surprised.  </li>
            <li>As with Sano&#x27;s vitamin C serum, it is a gentle lightening of the eye area which I prefer for such a sensitive and delicate area of the face.</li>

            <li> This Sano gel works fantastic!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see more results over time.</li>
            <li> , I gave it one more try and happened again</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Love how this makes my eyes feel and look.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> They tend to make my skin look more even in tone</li>
            <li> (fading sun spots and freckles) and my skin seems to exfoliate better.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it feels when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Will report more after using it a while.</li>
            <li> : I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked more awake and well rested.  </li>
            <li> My skin around my eyes felt tighter and more</li>
            <li> and I love these products.</li>
            <li> I would buy again just because it feels so darn refreshing under my eyes</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> Improvement in my wrinkles was noted gradually, and after six weeks, it looked remarkably better.  </li>
            <li> It seems to me that most of the people on here were bribed to give that many stars.</li>
            <li> Also love that it&#x27;s a 1oz glass bottle.</li>
            <li> but I was impressed enough to write here.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you may have to use more than 1 type of a eye cream and some diet changes to fix the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you have all the variables that may have helped me:))  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see how this works with my crows feet!</li>
            <li> It goes on light, no fragrances, no eye irritation, and gives a great cooling and gentle tightening sensation.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> The gel dabs on easily, absorbs quickly and has a nice cooling effect with a  light cucumber fragrance.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great, firm and bright and its taking years off of my appearance.  </li>
            <li> Such a great product and no nasty chemicals added.</li>
            <li> immediately soaked and easily blended into my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strong cucumber smell, but I like cucumbers.</li>
            <li> This does not cause irritation and seems to hydrate the area pretty amazingly.</li>
            <li> It is amazing the first time i use it.</li>
            <li> It was nice and soothing when first applied but all in all, I wouldn&#x27;t keep using it.</li>
            <li> At first it felt warm to the skin</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing the job, but will need more time to see the full affect.</li>
            <li> It feels both cool and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> love that Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ is quick and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Got the best compliment the other day when a girlfriend of mine who hadn&#x27;t seen me in while asked if i had had my eyes done!</li>
            <li> I can see a bit of a difference in the fine lines after just a week.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a month now and noticed the fine lines around my eyes and forehead are disappearing.</li>
            <li> The gel absorbs into the skin and smooths the fine lines under my eyes and helps reduce puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I do not have as many break-outs and when I do they are quickly gone.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice fresh cucumber scent, absorbs quickly, is non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause my eye-makeup to deposit under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This is a HUGE bottle, I will probably be using it for close to six months.</li>
            <li> After a month of usage I see a huge differance.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Vit C believer.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and no irritation.</li>
            <li> I applied the cream and it was so smooth</li>
            <li> but I am loving this product and using sometimes on the whole face.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth with a hint of cucumber in the smell.</li>
            <li> There must be some truth to such products that doesn&#x27;t cost a great deal of money.</li>
            <li> When I stroke the skin around my eyes, it feels smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> Gel+ is also free from parabens, sulfates, and alcohols.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far so good</li>
            <li> I got a free sample, then liked it so much I bought a jar.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the investment which is very economical!</li>
            <li> Very fresh smelling and cooling.</li>
            <li> I just recently started having under eye shadows and tried several products-none worked as effectively and quickly as Sano&#x27;s Eye gel...excellent product and excellent price!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this gel very much.  </li>
            <li> It feels refreshing and after 2 weeks I have had a slight improvement, but nothing great.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product as a bonus gift with the vitamin C serum and had to purchase a full size, It does the trick of erasing morning puffiness under my eyes and the wake up feeling it creates is fabulous.</li>
            <li> way too tightening and drying for the original intended use--for underyes.</li>
            <li> Originally was a gift and just purchased another container.  </li>
            <li> so I am really excited to see how it works in a month</li>
            <li> This stuff has significantly changed my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about a week now, and have seen significant results in my under eye area.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a excited</li>
            <li> This is my first product from Sano Naturals and am I glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> Gel+ has significantly improved my look as this product has made my skin look brighter, fresher, and healthier.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the gel reduced the puffiness significantly</li>
            <li> This cream feels so cool and comforting - smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product and glad I did.</li>
            <li> Also, I felt like I was getting a super deal when I saw that they originally posted the price at $40.</li>
            <li> The jar came halfway full, like it had already been used before.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this product actually works.</li>
            <li> I found that I really had make sure the area around my eyes was moisturized, otherwise the gel stings.</li>
            <li> 2/3 full.</li>
            <li> However, it is easily absorbed, light, and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> But using it for 1 day, I have to say out of all the eye creams I&#x27;ve used this one makes your eyes feel awake with a cool feeling.</li>
            <li> *Full disclosure</li>
            <li> I really like this....very refreshing although I can&#x27;t say it does anything for bags under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am one of those lucky females who suffer with under eye circles.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It acts quickly to diminish bags under eyes and crows feet around the eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like giving my skin a drink of water and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Instant refreshing to the eyes :)</li>
            <li> great product, feels nice and not too heavy on the eyes, seeing small differences maybe in more time it will show more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value compared to many of the more expensive skin products in the marketplace.  </li>
            <li> Almost bought something similar at the mall for $150, glad I didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in the smoothness of the skin under my eyes after the first night!</li>
            <li> And in fact, I actually noticed more wrinkles after using it!  </li>
            <li> Unlike many others who have received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, I purchased this a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Good basic, very lightweight eye gel.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very hydrated and this gel very soothing, I would surely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I opened up this cream, which is more like a clear gel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy and has a fresh smell like cucumbers.</li>
            <li> Gel+ smells like fresh cucumbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with it, but think I need to use it for awhile longer to tell about the results.</li>
            <li> a nice product that I can see myself buying again as soon as I run low on it.</li>
            <li> Gel smells like fresh cucumber.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed a difference worth talking about.</li>
            <li> I have to see if it works on my dark circles and fine lines but am happy with product so far.</li>
            <li> The price is excellent when comparing to other similar products in the market.</li>
            <li> I received the Sano eye cream pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> and I like how it dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Works amazing love it have had dark circles for years and now not so much</li>
            <li> Really did not work for my under eye circles which is what I originally purchases this for.</li>
            <li> this one does right away.</li>
            <li> The gel works well for me twice a day, applying it once in the morning and again right before bed.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing &amp; cool.  </li>
            <li> I waited a little bit to write a review to be able to give a better product review.  </li>
            <li> The cream was working and the more it dried the better my eyes look.</li>
            <li> So far so good, noticed results after the second day!</li>
            <li> I was surprised and delighted to find that it made my fine lines much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> non oily overall a very nice eye gel similar to one I used years ago that I cannot find any longer.</li>
            <li> Very fast service.</li>
            <li> As a consumer who is conscious of what I put in and on my body I am very happy that they use natural and organic ingredients instead of harsh human-made chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more  when i get low</li>
            <li> Received this product free for review, I have puffy eyes and this cream seems to help so far with the puffiness, it tightens the skin you can feel it after you put it on.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is my favorite - You instantly feel and see results within seconds.  </li>
            <li> Thanks SANO makers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mom of 9 and obviously throughout many years have had a lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> Many things that I have used on my face, only contribute to that</li>
            <li> I did place some on my forhead as well and when I touch my face now, a couple of hours later, there isn&#x27;t an oil feel; more like a hydrated skin feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would really appreciate a refund!  </li>
            <li> I could&#x27;t believe the first time I applied this gel.</li>
            <li> At first it helped reduce puffiness</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because I had a discount code to try it and most importantly wanted to try to get rid of my dark</li>
            <li> but this picture was taken about 3 days after I first used the cream</li>
            <li> I used full size product and it felt good to eyes, it was soothing and my eyes didn&#x27;t feel dry at application time or next morning</li>
            <li> , she&#x27;s been putting it under her eyes for some time now and says her skin looks soother, less noticeable lines and feels kind fresh when applying it.</li>
            <li> nice and not too thick, goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I went out and it was raining and pretty soon my whole face was slimy and shiny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything on the market to decrease the inflammation around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is working nicely to correct my dark circles</li>
            <li> First tried it this morning and it instantly made my fine lines disappear and evened out my coloring.</li>
            <li> it does a nice job of calming it down overnight.</li>
            <li> and I had more bulgy dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I am a 58 years, African American woman who has used skincare systems since I was 18 years old, so my skin is in pretty good shape.  </li>
            <li> Comparable to Estes Lauder intense eye.</li>
            <li> this works very week for pimples.</li>
            <li> Really like the gel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed too much difference yet, been using for about 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter how much sleep, hydration..</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> Really like.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it</li>
            <li> Since using the gel, the skin around my eyes is much smoother and the darkness under my eyes is not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li> so, so much.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs well, just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> Top 1/3 empty.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about two weeks and am really liking the results.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used much of this eye cream</li>
            <li> and I really feel it has help the skin texture too.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize or do anything noticeable.</li>
            <li> Well, the shipment did come fast.</li>
            <li> and  were very puffy.</li>
            <li> This cream really works.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Some reviews complained about the smell, but I loved it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products but none compare to this.</li>
            <li> one is like jello (trial size) and other one more like textured gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always excited to review eye creams and facial creams because I have the dreaded  type of &amp;#34;T zone&amp;#34; oily face.  </li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive and found this stung at first but have not had that happen since that time.  </li>
            <li> Next day I opened my full size jar and to my surprise full size product looked and felt very different than the trial size even though both are gels</li>
            <li> love that this product doesn’t hide my bags or puffiness or dark circles.  </li>
            <li> It causes cream to get in the eye and cuase alerdic reaction and more dark circles.</li>
            <li> It causes cream to get in the eye and cuase alerdic reaction and more dark circles.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and is not irritating to the sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> As I get older, they are getting puffier and darker.  </li>
            <li> Clever of them.</li>
            <li> I tried Sano mainly because I did not want to spend tons of money on another eye cream that is expence and</li>
            <li> I have purchased quite a few different eye products on Amazon and this stuff is hands down wonderful!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> (Other than the amount a nice moisturizer helps aesthetically in the short term).  </li>
            <li> I feel like I have found a product that is going to help with that whole &amp;#34;growing old gracefully&amp;#34; thing and plan to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally allergic to eye creams.</li>
            <li> Will know more in a few weeks</li>
            <li> If you have dark circles or fine lines, I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have found a new use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any new wrinkles since I started, but with that said, none of my established wrinkles have disappeared &amp;#60;&amp;#60;shrug&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  </li>
            <li> Live and learn,  </li>
            <li> Can tell immediate results when placed under my eyes to help with dark circles, puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Unlike Sano Vit C serum, the eye cream actually works well to lightly tighten under and upper eye lids.  </li>
            <li> At first I felt like a little burning sensation but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li> I love this product, dark eye circles have become more subtle.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the SANO EYE GEL to anyone interested in preserving a younger you!&lt;br /&gt;CMS</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 69 years old and have been blessed with very good skin; however I&#x27;m getting crows feet, worry lines above my nose and on my forehead, deep creases from the outside of my nose to my chin, and my neck is starting to look a little like a turkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a week of daily usage I saw positive results.  </li>
            <li> significantly reduced my dark circles and puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I opened trial size first and on first night of use my eyes were swollen and skin around eyes seemed very dry next day</li>
            <li> It feels great to apply to the under eye when the gell is cold.</li>
            <li> Gel+ is a clear, gel like material.  </li>
            <li> It does tingle a bit when you put it on, note for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This Sano is comparable to the results I got from professional treatments.  </li>
            <li> I am assuming because it is all natural and no chemicals added as it is all organic.</li>
            <li> it is no overnight complete cure.</li>
            <li> Been using this for week and my skin feels so soft</li>
            <li> When I developed a blemish under my eye after using this, I gave up.</li>
            <li> It has the same type of consistency, which is why you don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell anything about it fighting wrinkles, but so far it is holding to</li>
            <li> The cream makes my eye area feel moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;be used it once so far</li>
            <li> I have slightly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes at all.</li>
            <li> Gel+ uses organic, vegan, cruelty-free, and natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> But the Sano eye gel really surprised me.</li>
            <li> This cream has a silky consistency , it goes on smooth and drys quickly , unlike other eye creams that leave a greasy paste behind this cream leaves your skin feel right and refreshed , I also pitched the vitamin C serum both of them paired together works wonders .</li>
            <li> Makes eyes feel clean and tight.</li>
            <li> I love how a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m noticing a small difference with some fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products in the past, only to find that I had to stop using them because they made my skin burn or my eyes burn and tear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have as much puffiness although I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the dark &amp;#34;mommy&amp;#34; under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye gel/creams, no name brand to highend brand ones with no good results as advertised.</li>
            <li> the gel is light not greasy and works well on small lines</li>
            <li> I am excited about finally finding something that wasn&#x27;t make-up to get rid of my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have been battling with dark circles for a while and use many treatments including lazer treatments from Epion Medical Center in LA.</li>
            <li> My under eye skin is less baggy, not as dark and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> My entire eye area feels so soft and I can feel the skin gradually tightening.  </li>
            <li> I developed a reaction very shortly after I started using it,  so I stopped using it and went to see my doctor,  </li>
            <li> I have dark circles and bags under my eyes that are hereditary, so even after a good night&#x27;s rest, I always look tired.</li>
            <li> You can feel the gel tightening everything almost right away, and the firm feeling continues throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I find it works well in the morning if it is put on first thing, and allowed to sit for a half hour before makeup application.</li>
            <li> I am a 23 year old female with no wrinkles, so my main concern is dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t really helped reduce my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This is a nice thick gel, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference, but I use it and will see when the product is empty</li>
            <li> I do have dark circles and slight crowsfeet (deeper than I would prefer, but not bad).</li>
            <li> Wow, I ordered this product with little expectation of results but I was beyond surprised.  </li>
            <li> As with Sano&#x27;s vitamin C serum, it is a gentle lightening of the eye area which I prefer for such a sensitive and delicate area of the face.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy, a little goes a long way and has no scent.</li>
            <li> No sure if I like it much</li>
            <li> am a 56 year old Grandma who tends to my granddaughter when her parents are at work, so I have them dark</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully as I finish the container, my dark circles will be completely gone.</li>
            <li> Like the way it feels, don&#x27;t have it long enough to know the results</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment yet on whether it worked for the  bags under my eyes since I just got it and haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference.  </li>
            <li> Application is quick and doesn&#x27;t tug at delicate undereye skin the way other creams do sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product to everyone that suffers from dark circles, puffiness, bags, wrinkles, fine lines, crow’s feet, and signs of aging skin.</li>
            <li> I naturally have dark circles and puffiness under my eyes and as soon as you put this gel on, you can feel your skin start to tighten up in response, my puffiness has gone down so much and makeup is easier to apply with less creasing!</li>
            <li> It feels cold and refreshing when I put</li>
            <li> I have used this so called miracle eye cream for at least 4 weeks and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the reviews I purchased the entire which includes Vitamin C Eye Cream, Vitamin C Serum, and Hydralic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I started to put it around my eyes and noticed that the smallest bit went a long way!  </li>
            <li> Every morning I&#x27;d wake up with a dry flakey rash under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed it helping with dark circles, and I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say whether it helps with crowsfeet.</li>
            <li> This is the third brand I have bought in the eye gels that supposedly claim to help dark circles, wrinkles, and puffiness.  </li>
            <li> No noticeable changes with dark circles though after several weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> Same dark circles.</li>
            <li> I just received it, I dont know what people are saying about a bad smell, its very light smelling an after its on cant smell it at all.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a little under a week</li>
            <li> After one week use I feel like it is making a slow and realistic change in my dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> After one week use I feel like it is making a slow and realistic change in my dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I usually get professional eye mask every 4 weeks from a licensed esthetician because I have dark circles and beginning wrinkles until February of this year.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly 3 months for at least 1 time per day.</li>
            <li> Like the serum though, smells like wet sticks, leaves, earth.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks but the skin around my eyes seems clearer and brighter and firmer.  </li>
            <li> My skin got  rough and with pimple like growths.</li>
            <li> In my picture you can see I have very week skin under my eyes and broken capillaries that is visible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have extremely dark circles, but I have really loose skin under my eyes that forms huge ugly red tinted bags.  </li>
            <li> First of all my dark circles are combination of week skin under my eye, pigmentation, and broken capillaries under the eye possibly due to allergies and liver issues.</li>
            <li> So here is the thing, since the problem of dark circle is complex, use some time to figure out what is the cause of your dark circles, and have a realistic expectation from an eye cream.</li>
            <li> Inmediately I noticed tightened in my eye area, and it didnt pass few days when I noticed the dark circles  all around my eyes starting to improve.</li>
            <li> +, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> And the cost is affordable compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> Like the other two, I have seen not a bit of difference.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed a big difference in the small lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> use this gel &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; as suggested, either before my other creams or mid-day (if at home and not wearing makeup).  </li>
            <li> but it is surely not the same thing</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, and concerned about using any lotions or cremes around my eyes</li>
            <li> It does not get rid of puffiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li> Does nothing for dark circles.</li>
            <li> time I used it for my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes are diminishing as well as crows feet.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my dark circles at all.</li>
            <li> Need this for dark puffy circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that my dark circles have lightened.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dark puffy circles under my eyes always.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s word on helping with dark circles and puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for about four days also, and have noticed that my dark circles are not as dark as they were.</li>
            <li> have used topical vitamin C on and off for at least a year and find that vitamin C products do make a difference over time.</li>
            <li> in the end this cream did nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> However, dark circles have seemed to fade.  </li>
            <li> My eyes tend to be puffy all day/night with dark under eyes.</li>
            <li> I know the pain of being a girl with dark circles around the eye.</li>
            <li> That apply for dark circles as well.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I know the pain of being a girl with dark circles around the eye.</li>
            <li> That apply for dark circles as well.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, It smells like cucumbers, which I&#x27;m not a huge fan of, but it&#x27;s not really off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i get burning sensation then it cools down</li>
            <li> Within a couple of days my eyes started looking less puffy and within a week the dark circles have noticeably faded.  </li>
            <li> I must admit that I was a little skeptical, but this product really does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> It is soothing and seems to make the under eye area less puffy and the wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I feel that when it tightens around my eyes, it tends to make my skin slightly wrinkle.</li>
            <li> my eyes are ALOT less puffy and</li>
            <li> slightly dries the areas--then I apply the moisture.  </li>
            <li> I was on a search for an Eye cream that would not cause my eyes to get irritated and cause me to wake up with puffy eyes and black under my eyes.</li>
            <li> After about 14 days of continuous use I noticed slightly less puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not even a smudge less.</li>
            <li> It tightened my skin and made my lines and wrinkles much less noticeable without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> My eyes are less puffy</li>
            <li> ; the eye and also makes my eyes look brighter because it subtly lifts the upper lid.</li>
            <li> Since using  the gel, I&#x27;ve noticed less lines around my eyes and less puffiness.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;have noticed a slight improvement</li>
            <li> I work crazy hours and the first sign people notice it the Eye.</li>
            <li> It lonely takes a small amount</li>
            <li> When I apply it, I feel a slight cooling sensation and my skin feels a little tighter.</li>
            <li> never did I get a tight feeling like</li>
            <li> tight.</li>
            <li> Even the dark spots which always made me look like I had not slept for days is gone!  </li>
            <li> I can see a little bit of difference under my eyes and eye lids.</li>
            <li> I like the amount they give you in this little jar too.</li>
            <li> I am seeing difference around the eye area where I have little crows feet growing and its been about 5-6 days since I am using it.</li>
            <li> If I use it alone, I have no complaints, but I gave it 4 stars because under makeup it gets a little flaky.</li>
            <li> I feel like I was misled a little bit by the 4  1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> After using everyday it also gave me like a little rash under my eye and it would burn when I put it on and that has happened twice</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps with dark circles</li>
            <li> For me, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not a great scent but since only on eyes, not that noticeable.</li>
            <li> dried out my combo skin to the point of burning and flakiness.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like how it feels after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and sometimes do not have to use moisturizer after applying the serum and gel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and here is what</li>
            <li> Zero stars not available for selection</li>
            <li> , bc I always look tired and this product hasn&#x27;t really helped me and I still look tired.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes looks less dull.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, after all the different eye cream products I have wasted my money on, I found &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to say the least after trying this vitamin C. I recieved this product complimentary for my review.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the product just yet.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this works..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works</li>
            <li> Only after a few days of use I have seen improvement in my dark circles which look really bad at times.</li>
            <li> Not seeing any difference from other products on the market--some of which are less expensive.</li>
            <li> The cooling sensation reminds me a little of when you put cucumbers on your eyelids before a night out--this is not surprising as it contains cucumber extract.</li>
            <li> It is too bad as I had high hopes after reading the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> It feels very stiff.</li>
            <li> They are to the point where I can hardly see them.</li>
            <li> This product caused serious skin reactions.</li>
            <li> Not that big of a deal, I passed it on to my mom, hasn&#x27;t reacted badly to her yet.</li>
            <li> like i&#x27;m talking about those raised, painful, red ones.</li>
            <li> Helps with puffiness, but dries out and not good under makeup</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the protective seal was missing.</li>
            <li> Save your hard earned money!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t removed all puffiness but has definitely decreased the puffiness.</li>
            <li> Has a slight cucumber scent, which isn&#x27;t unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I bought AHAVA eye cream about month ago, and during that time my dark circles got really bad.</li>
            <li> I was using an expensive  nightly eye cream, but it was not doing the job.  </li>
            <li> Useless cream.</li>
            <li> (The one thing I will say is it smells weird</li>
            <li> I have also tried Este Lauder, Lancome, Exuviance, AVAHA, Murad and nameless eye creams.  </li>
            <li> This product made my skin feel moisturized and refreshed, with none of the awful reactions that I had before with other products.</li>
            <li> made concealer look really really bad over this.</li>
            <li> I must have had a bad reaction to this  eye gel and would not buy it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m disappointed bc</li>
            <li> Gel+ felt very cold going on even though it was stored at room temperature.  </li>
            <li> am shocked how well it has worked!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible and doesn&#x27;t have expiration date.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This Vitamin C Eye Gel is awesome! It is very soothing and is not irritating to the sensitive skin around my eyes. I have tried many products in the past, only to find that I had to stop using them because they made my skin burn or my eyes burn and tear. This product made my skin feel moisturized and refreshed, with none of the awful reactions that I had before with other products. I love this stuff and will be reordering!</li>
            <li> It does not get rid of puffiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li> great product, feels nice and not too heavy on the eyes, seeing small differences maybe in more time it will show more</li>
            <li> light and easy absorb !!</li>
            <li> The jar came halfway full, like it had already been used before. What a waste.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and I am prone to milia, so an eye gel is preferred for me. This is a HUGE bottle, I will probably be using it for close to six months. Some reviews complained about the smell, but I loved it. Very fresh smelling and cooling. I have been keeping mine in the fridge. It is working nicely to correct my dark circles and I even apply some to my forehead lines. A+ product Sano!</li>
            <li> Great product, item as described, very useful.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product as a bonus gift with the vitamin C serum and had to purchase a full size, It does the trick of erasing morning puffiness under my eyes and the wake up feeling it creates is fabulous. I would recommend the SANO EYE GEL to anyone interested in preserving a younger you!&lt;br /&gt;CMS</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this eye cream. Only after a few days of use I have seen improvement in my dark circles which look really bad at times. I love using this product. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Not to happy with this product.</li>
            <li> the cool gel fills good around my eyes</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this gel very much.  It is soothing and seems to make the under eye area less puffy and the wrinkles less noticeable.  I have been using it for 10 days or so with a moisturizer over it.  I will let you know if there are any more improvements.</li>
            <li> Very soothing &amp; cool.  Smells like cucumbers.  I have only used the product for a short time, so I’m not noticing any difference in the puffiness below my eyes, but it definitely creates a “tightness” feeling.</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing and after 2 weeks I have had a slight improvement, but nothing great. I will continue to use and update my review.</li>
            <li> After a month of usage I see a huge differance. I must say I&#x27;m impressed with the results. Totally worth the investment which is very economical!</li>
            <li> I have only used for a week and the skin around my eyes feels firmer and lines look diminished.  Well continue to use.</li>
            <li> A miracle product. Comparable to Estes Lauder intense eye. I love it. Creamy and lightweight</li>
            <li> This cream has a silky consistency , it goes on smooth and drys quickly , unlike other eye creams that leave a greasy paste behind this cream leaves your skin feel right and refreshed , I also pitched the vitamin C serum both of them paired together works wonders .</li>
            <li> Not sure of the product just yet. I feel that when it tightens around my eyes, it tends to make my skin slightly wrinkle. Goes on smoothly and no irritation. Not sure if it helps with dark circles but I still have a lot of it left to keep trying. I believe in giving a product a good try before making a judgement on it.</li>
            <li> I use this product just about every day and can tell the&lt;br /&gt;difference when I forget... my eyes are ALOT less puffy and&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t seem to be so droopy. I love the smell too.. a&lt;br /&gt;light cucumber fragrance. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice thick gel, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a little goes a long way.  I can see a bit of a difference in the fine lines after just a week.  It does tingle a bit when you put it on, note for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Like the way it feels, don&#x27;t have it long enough to know the results</li>
            <li> Does nothing for dark circles. Temporary tightening of skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Vit C believer.  My sister recommended this product.  I used it the day it arrived.  I could tell a noticeable difference the&lt;br /&gt;first time I used it for my dark circles.  My entire eye area feels so soft and I can feel the skin gradually tightening.  I use every morning&lt;br /&gt;and evening before bed.  I highly recommend this product. And the cost is affordable compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> Good basic, very lightweight eye gel. Feel good on my skin, smells great.</li>
            <li> This is the third brand I have bought in the eye gels that supposedly claim to help dark circles, wrinkles, and puffiness.  Like the other two, I have seen not a bit of difference.  For me, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I watched this eye cream work in my magnifying mirror.  I love it, I can&#x27;t believe an eye cream that actually works.  I don&#x27;t have extremely dark circles, but I have really loose skin under my eyes that forms huge ugly red tinted bags.  My baggage has tightened and lost its redness. The wrinkles around my eyes and mouth are diminishing.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what this product can do over even more time!</li>
            <li> My under-eyes had an allergic reaction to this product. Every morning I&#x27;d wake up with a dry flakey rash under my eyes. It was nice and soothing when first applied but all in all, I wouldn&#x27;t keep using it. Not that big of a deal, I passed it on to my mom, hasn&#x27;t reacted badly to her yet.</li>
            <li> No sure if I like it much</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks &amp; I must say  I have seen some improvement in the puffiness &amp; darkness under my eyes &amp; it  also cools under my eyes as well ... the scent is pleasant I believe with continued use twice a day it will continue to get better &amp; better. . I will be ordering more  when i get low( however this will lasy me a while ) &amp; the customer service was great fast delivery which I loved:-)</li>
            <li> Almost bought something similar at the mall for $150, glad I didn&#x27;t! First tried it this morning and it instantly made my fine lines disappear and evened out my coloring. Very happy!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  I usually get professional eye mask every 4 weeks from a licensed esthetician because I have dark circles and beginning wrinkles until February of this year.  I am a 58 years, African American woman who has used skincare systems since I was 18 years old, so my skin is in pretty good shape.  I have been using this product for 3 weeks, and I can see results already.  I was using an expensive  nightly eye cream, but it was not doing the job.  This Sano is comparable to the results I got from professional treatments.  It nice to be able to get these results without spending the $100.00 plus each month.</li>
            <li> Unlike Sano Vit C serum, the eye cream actually works well to lightly tighten under and upper eye lids.  No noticeable changes with dark circles though after several weeks of use.  I like the tightening effect, however.  Like the serum though, smells like wet sticks, leaves, earth.  Not a great scent but since only on eyes, not that noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully for 5 weeks and I have noticed a big difference in the small lines around my eyes. Even the dark spots which always made me look like I had not slept for days is gone!  I was a little skeptical at first, and concerned about using any lotions or cremes around my eyes but this did not cause any redness, puffiness, swelling, or skin irritation. I am assuming because it is all natural and no chemicals added as it is all organic. If you have dark circles or fine lines, I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note:  I received this product in exchange for a fair and unbiased honest review.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this works.. Never used it consistently enough. Loved it though</li>
            <li> Really love this product works great</li>
            <li> I work crazy hours and the first sign people notice it the Eye. So using this product make me feel better and refresh. I like the way it feel.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE,LOVE this product.  I use this around my eyes, &amp; my crows feet disappear. If I could dip my whole body in this gel, I would be a happy camper !</li>
            <li> Very refreshing cream. Smells like cucumber and withing 3 minutes you feel your skin to tighten around the applied areas. Especially around the eyes. I put mine in the refrigirator to then put the cream around my eyes nice and cold. Love this product.</li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes are diminishing as well as crows feet. I have tried many other products but none compare to this.</li>
            <li> This give me break outs all around my eyes. Red unattractive rashes.</li>
            <li> i like your product.  It works well.</li>
            <li> dried out my combo skin to the point of burning and flakiness. HOWEVER. i have found a new use. this works very week for pimples. like i&#x27;m talking about those raised, painful, red ones. it does a nice job of calming it down overnight. hoewver it is no overnight complete cure. i decided not to reurn so i could use it on my spots overnight... way too tightening and drying for the original intended use--for underyes. made concealer look really really bad over this.</li>
            <li> Really like the gel. Feels good and improving skin with each use. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Vitamin C Eye Gel. I like the consistency and the smell.  I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Helps with puffiness, but dries out and not good under makeup</li>
            <li> Been using this for week and my skin feels so soft I have to see if it works on my dark circles and fine lines but am happy with product so far.</li>
            <li> Unlike many others who have received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, I purchased this a few weeks ago.  I&#x27;m 69 years old and have been blessed with very good skin; however I&#x27;m getting crows feet, worry lines above my nose and on my forehead, deep creases from the outside of my nose to my chin, and my neck is starting to look a little like a turkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this gel &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; as suggested, either before my other creams or mid-day (if at home and not wearing makeup).  I like to use it before my serum and then cream, because it firms and, as a result, slightly dries the areas--then I apply the moisture.  All my problem areas are firming up with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a moisturizer, but it sure does a great job of firming.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the Vitamin C Eye Gel +, a little goes a long way.  Can tell immediate results when placed under my eyes to help with dark circles, puffiness and fine lines.  Originally was a gift and just purchased another container.  Will recommend to all my friends and family  Plus, great price!</li>
            <li> Cooling and de puffing and feels great! Is smoothing to eye area!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed too much difference yet, been using for about 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 months now. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my dark circles at all. I also don&#x27;t like how it feels after a few minutes. It feels very stiff.</li>
            <li> works the best out of any eye cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Yes works wonderful on the nights I don&#x27;t get sleep</li>
            <li> I like this creme. It does help. Dorothea Smith.</li>
            <li> Received this product free for review, I have puffy eyes and this cream seems to help so far with the puffiness, it tightens the skin you can feel it after you put it on.  non oily overall a very nice eye gel similar to one I used years ago that I cannot find any longer. Works well.  Will order again</li>
            <li> I BEGINING TO USE IT.</li>
            <li> I was on a search for an Eye cream that would not cause my eyes to get irritated and cause me to wake up with puffy eyes and black under my eyes. Ive had this product for about a month and I have been somewhat inconsistent with it. I can see a little bit of difference under my eyes and eye lids. This does not cause irritation and seems to hydrate the area pretty amazingly. I will do a review again in 6mo.</li>
            <li> This came on time.  Unfortunately the protective seal was missing. The cream ended up in the cap and it also seemed used.  I tried to get in touch but the email address had an error.</li>
            <li> I just received it, I dont know what people are saying about a bad smell, its very light smelling an after its on cant smell it at all.&lt;br /&gt;What impressed me is the tightning around my eyes right away, that is why I gave it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I will post again in a month or before to say how it is working, like I said I just got it so I am really excited to see how it works in a month&lt;br /&gt;I am a 56 year old Grandma who tends to my granddaughter when her parents are at work, so I have them dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every face cream you can imagine an never did I get a tight feeling like this one does right away.</li>
            <li> No results. Stings skin!</li>
            <li> I seem to always have circles under my eyes. Doesn&#x27;t matter how much sleep, hydration.. nothing. I&#x27;ve been using a bit of this cream daily, and under my eyes, it is starting to look a bit brighter. Will continue to use and hope for great results.</li>
            <li> Smells like cucumbers. Very soothing. Really like.</li>
            <li> I have tried every thing for eye puffiness. I like the way this product feels. I store the gell in the frige. It feels great to apply to the under eye when the gell is cold. I have using product approx 3 months. It hasn&#x27;t removed all puffiness but has definitely decreased the puffiness.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any appreciable difference in undereye circles or puffiness. When I developed a blemish under my eye after using this, I gave up.</li>
            <li> I gave this eye cream to my mom and she absolutely loves it, she&#x27;s been putting it under her eyes for some time now and says her skin looks soother, less noticeable lines and feels kind fresh when applying it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok didn&#x27;t see its working</li>
            <li> Since using the gel, the skin around my eyes is much smoother and the darkness under my eyes is not as noticeable.  Seems to be doing what it claims.</li>
            <li> This product helped with the puffiness underneath my eyes. I applied at night before bed. After about 14 days of continuous use I noticed slightly less puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works probably it&#x27;s my skin, when i apply it i get burning sensation then it cools down</li>
            <li> Only eye gel that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel has definitely reduced wrinkles on my face and improved the overall look of my skin.  It has improved, but not eliminated, the bags under my eyes.  It&#x27;s a great value compared to many of the more expensive skin products in the marketplace.  Overall, I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this product actually works. I have bags under my eyes (hereditary) and have seen a noticeable difference. Pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t make my face &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; tight.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all. Cooling and refreshing when applied, and nothing more. Same dark circles. Not even a smudge less. Useless cream.Think I should get my money back.</li>
            <li> This stuff has significantly changed my skin.  I do not have as many break-outs and when I do they are quickly gone.  My eyes are sensitive and found this stung at first but have not had that happen since that time.  The serum is my favorite and use it all over.  Now being 30 I was worried about starting to see my skin age.  I use this everyday and sometimes do not have to use moisturizer after applying the serum and gel.  I have started not wearing make-up and owe it to this product.</li>
            <li> I am a 23 year old female with no wrinkles, so my main concern is dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, It smells like cucumbers, which I&#x27;m not a huge fan of, but it&#x27;s not really off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product, but it took me a while. I found that I really had make sure the area around my eyes was moisturized, otherwise the gel stings. However, once I figured that out, I had no problem with stinging. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about a week now, and have seen significant results in my under eye area. The skin under my eyes looks tighter and the color is somewhat lighter. I&#x27;ll definitely use up the rest of the jar. I&#x27;m undecided yet whether I will purchase again, but it is definitely a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully refreshing and soothing gel. I find it works well in the morning if it is put on first thing, and allowed to sit for a half hour before makeup application. At night, I apply it twice, once after the skin is cleansed, and once again before bedtime. As with Sano&#x27;s vitamin C serum, it is a gentle lightening of the eye area which I prefer for such a sensitive and delicate area of the face.</li>
            <li> Need this for dark puffy circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My eye area looks so much better now</li>
            <li> I love the Sano Vit C Eye Gel !!  The cucumber scent is lovely and the gel itself is soothing to the eye tissue.  It is not oily or sticky.  My skin just soaks it in.  I have only been using it for a few weeks but the skin around my eyes seems clearer and brighter and firmer.  I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love how this product is cooling, and that it is not greasy. I can feel it working because of the tightness I feel around my eyes. I love how a little bit goes a long way. I can not wait to purchase more items from Sano Naturals.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyes feel revived.  Firms the skin under my eye wonderfully.</li>
            <li> We are ordering more. Anyway to get a larger size jar?</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the reviews I purchased the entire which includes Vitamin C Eye Cream, Vitamin C Serum, and Hydralic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptic but wanted to give it a try as the price range was more in line with what I wanted to spend.  ALL I can say is Amazing! I&#x27;ve only been&lt;br /&gt;using the products for 1 week to date and notice a difference in the puffy eye issue I&#x27;ve been dealing with since I turned 40.  The eye cream is my favorite - You instantly feel and see results within seconds.  I use this product 2 times a day, morning and night, it&#x27;s been a week and I&#x27;m a excited&lt;br /&gt;that I&#x27;ve finally found the product that works for me and my wallet! Thanks SANO makers!</li>
            <li> Wow, I ordered this product with little expectation of results but I was beyond surprised.  You can feel the gel tightening everything almost right away, and the firm feeling continues throughout the day.  I have only used this product for a little under a week but I am also noticing a more hydrated look to my aging skin.  I feel like I have found a product that is going to help with that whole &amp;#34;growing old gracefully&amp;#34; thing and plan to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Luv it.. Will buy more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and I have noticed that my dark circles have lightened.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully as I finish the container, my dark circles will be completely gone.</li>
            <li> This product caused serious skin reactions.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I noticed a difference in the smoothness of the skin under my eyes after the first night! I don&#x27;t have as much puffiness although I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in the dark &amp;#34;mommy&amp;#34; under eye circles. Will wait to see what happens by the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Not seeing any difference from other products on the market--some of which are less expensive.</li>
            <li> Recommended. Have used this for a couple months and it has worked well.</li>
            <li> I received the Sano eye cream pretty quickly. I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve tried so many different products. I applied the cream and it was so smooth and it smells so good. But, I&#x27;m waiting to feel the tightening around the eyes to reduce the puffiness. I could not believe it. The cream was working and the more it dried the better my eyes look. The next test was would it hold up after applying my makeup. It did. Needless to say, after all the different eye cream products I have wasted my money on, I found &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;. I feel so good about myself. The puffiness is gone, my skin is bright, and I thank you Sano so, so much. Margaret Smith Ohio</li>
            <li> Feels good but no visible results</li>
            <li> so far so good I like the over all feel to my face and make my under eyes look good. I want awesome but maybe need to wear for a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I am one of those lucky females who suffer with under eye circles.  As I get older, they are getting puffier and darker.  I have been searching for the perfect eye cream and hadn&#x27;t had much luck, then I was given the chance to review this product.  I am so happy with the results.  Within a couple of days my eyes started looking less puffy and within a week the dark circles have noticeably faded.  My skin looks great, firm and bright and its taking years off of my appearance.  Such a great product and no nasty chemicals added.</li>
            <li> This product work well on my eyes. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing! I love this eye gel. You don&#x27;t need much at all. A little goes a long ways. It feels cold and refreshing when I put I apply it around my eyes. Seems to moisturize well, too. I like how it feels. It is almost like putting cucumber slices on my eyes. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs well, just don&#x27;t use too much. It sort of feels like petroleum jelly but without the greasiness. It has the same type of consistency, which is why you don&#x27;t need much at all. I like the amount they give you in this little jar too. It should last me quite a while. I was fortunate to find this product through a promotional offer for an honest and unbiased review. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mom of 9 and obviously throughout many years have had a lack of sleep. My eyes show it. I have dark puffy circles under my eyes always. I am always on the search for an under eye cream THAT WORKS! Eureka! I found it! This Sano gel works fantastic! Ive been using it about 2 weeks now and it is marvelous! My under eye skin is less baggy, not as dark and more moisturized. My eye make up goes on smoother and the over all appearance is great. I contribute all of this to this product! Will def be purchasing in the future! I tested this product for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Came without box. 2/3 full. Top 1/3 empty. Smells terrible and doesn&#x27;t have expiration date. Possibly out of date item.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to say the least after trying this vitamin C. I recieved this product complimentary for my review. It is very creamy, a little goes a long way and has no scent. It went on my skin very smooth. At first it felt warm to the skin but then BAM! Instant face lift in a jar! It tightened my skin and made my lines and wrinkles much less noticeable without drying out my skin. I recommend this product! It would make anyone happy and would make a great stocking stuffer. I&#x27;d be very happy to find this gem in my stocking.</li>
            <li> I waited a little bit to write a review to be able to give a better product review.  This eye gel is very pleasing.  It goes on light, no fragrances, no eye irritation, and gives a great cooling and gentle tightening sensation.  It&#x27;s too early to tell anything about it fighting wrinkles, but so far it is holding to it&#x27;s word on helping with dark circles and puffiness.  As a consumer who is conscious of what I put in and on my body I am very happy that they use natural and organic ingredients instead of harsh human-made chemicals.  Over-all this product in a WIN for me.  I can&#x27;t wait to see more results over time.</li>
            <li> Have seen some improvement</li>
            <li> I bought this product with Sano Vitamin C Serum which also came with a trial size of this eye gel. I opened trial size first and on first night of use my eyes were swollen and skin around eyes seemed very dry next day, I gave it one more try and happened again and I had more bulgy dry eyes. Next day I opened my full size jar and to my surprise full size product looked and felt very different than the trial size even though both are gels one is like jello (trial size) and other one more like textured gel. I used full size product and it felt good to eyes, it was soothing and my eyes didn&#x27;t feel dry at application time or next morning and they did not swell. I am seeing difference around the eye area where I have little crows feet growing and its been about 5-6 days since I am using it. I don&#x27;t know what is in the trial size but it is surely not the same thing and I would never use that again but I am loving this product and using sometimes on the whole face. My skin feels very hydrated and this gel very soothing, I would surely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I like this product enough to say I will buy it again when I&#x27;m close to running out. :)  Application is quick and doesn&#x27;t tug at delicate undereye skin the way other creams do sometimes.  It has a nice fresh cucumber scent, absorbs quickly, is non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause my eye-makeup to deposit under my eyes.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any new wrinkles since I started, but with that said, none of my established wrinkles have disappeared &amp;#60;&amp;#60;shrug&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  Thank you Sano Naturals for this nice and affordable eye gel.</li>
            <li> I have purchased quite a few different eye products on Amazon and this stuff is hands down wonderful! It goes on smooth with a hint of cucumber in the smell. The skin around my eyes looks less dull. It&#x27;s so wonderful that I just purchased the serum for my face.</li>
            <li> this is a really good product! I naturally have dark circles and puffiness under my eyes and as soon as you put this gel on, you can feel your skin start to tighten up in response, my puffiness has gone down so much and makeup is easier to apply with less creasing! definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my eyes feel and look.</li>
            <li> I have used this so called miracle eye cream for at least 4 weeks and it did absolutely nothing. It did not remove one wrinkle and is probably like vasoline.  I have to think that the manufacturers or sellers themselves write all these glowing reviews.  Live and learn,  Save your hard earned money!</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference, but I use it and will see when the product is empty</li>
            <li> This is a superior product with no downside.  It is moisturizing without leaving an oily sheen or interfering with eye makeup.  I have also used it on my entire face when I have run out of the Vitamin C Serum.  I was surprised and delighted to find that it made my fine lines much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is my first product from Sano Naturals and am I glad I tried it.  The cream makes my eye area feel moisturized and soft.  It absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;ve been using for about two weeks and am really liking the results.  My eyes are less puffy and I&#x27;m noticing a small difference with some fine lines.  I will continue to use this cream and would recommend.</li>
            <li> WOW! It does the job.  I will continue to order</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always excited to review eye creams and facial creams because I have the dreaded  type of &amp;#34;T zone&amp;#34; oily face.  Many things that I have used on my face, only contribute to that and I find myself washing my face in the middle of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened up this cream, which is more like a clear gel, I started to put it around my eyes and noticed that the smallest bit went a long way!  The amount I intended to put around my one eye, ended up going on to one cheek as well.  This does not go on greasy at all and blended in well.  I did place some on my forhead as well and when I touch my face now, a couple of hours later, there isn&#x27;t an oil feel; more like a hydrated skin feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see how this works with my crows feet!</li>
            <li> I love this product, dark eye circles have become more subtle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;be used it once so far and I like how it dries pretty quickly. It&#x27;s non greasy and has a fresh smell like cucumbers. It also feels cooling. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love it. I use it every night before bed.</li>
            <li> This eye gel stings and makes the skin red!  And in fact, I actually noticed more wrinkles after using it!  I would really appreciate a refund!  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> reduced some of the darkness~but not the results I was hoping to receive~</li>
            <li> I have used this for about four days also, and have noticed that my dark circles are not as dark as they were. They are to the point where I can hardly see them. I am excited about finally finding something that wasn&#x27;t make-up to get rid of my dark circles. Thank you Sano!</li>
            <li> love this gel! am shocked how well it has worked!  Puffy eyes and wrinkles dramatically diminished after a month of use! put on am and pm.  Got the best compliment the other day when a girlfriend of mine who hadn&#x27;t seen me in while asked if i had had my eyes done!</li>
            <li> It is amazing the first time i use it. There must be some truth to such products that doesn&#x27;t cost a great deal of money. I am so happy to have found the Sano products. They seem to be really good. I have started using it for only a week and my skin has already changed.</li>
            <li> This product DID NOT work for me. I developed a reaction very shortly after I started using it,  so I stopped using it and went to see my doctor,  and now we are doing acid exfoliation. My skin got  rough and with pimple like growths.</li>
            <li> This is an eye gel containing Vitamin C, silk peptides and a number of ingredients. The title says \\&quot;eye cream\\&quot; but my jar says gel and it is in fact a gel (just thought I would mention as some may specifically prefer a cream).  I have been using it for about a week after receiving it for review. When I apply it, I feel a slight cooling sensation and my skin feels a little tighter. The cooling sensation reminds me a little of when you put cucumbers on your eyelids before a night out--this is not surprising as it contains cucumber extract. When I stroke the skin around my eyes, it feels smooth to the touch. I admit I do not notice a big difference aesthetically in the short term. I have slightly sensitive skin so so skin products do irritate my skin. I haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation with Sano Naturals Vitamin C eye gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used topical vitamin C on and off for at least a year and find that vitamin C products do make a difference over time. They tend to make my skin look more even in tone (fading sun spots and freckles) and my skin seems to exfoliate better. I do not have puffy bags, so cannot comment on how well it works with \\&quot;bags\\&quot;. I do have dark circles and slight crowsfeet (deeper than I would prefer, but not bad). I haven&#x27;t noticed it helping with dark circles, and I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say whether it helps with crowsfeet. (Other than the amount a nice moisturizer helps aesthetically in the short term).  However, it is easily absorbed, light, and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This definitely &amp;#34;depuffs&amp;#34; the eye and also makes my eyes look brighter because it subtly lifts the upper lid. I apply it all over the my eyes. If I use it alone, I have no complaints, but I gave it 4 stars because under makeup it gets a little flaky. I have sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes at all.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product. Love the smell and the way it feels when I put it on. Will report more after using it a while.</li>
            <li> Really did not work for my under eye circles which is what I originally purchases this for. It does help with puffiness but that was not my concern</li>
            <li> The actual eye cream was about halfway gone when I received it. I don&#x27;t know if it comes like that for everyone but in the end this cream did nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used much of this eye cream but it seems to be non-irratating and cremy.</li>
            <li> Feels great, i use it at night and the nect morning my eyes feel really smooth</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing the job, but will need more time to see the full affect.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it worked or not... I couldn&#x27;t handle the slimy feeling. I went out and it was raining and pretty soon my whole face was slimy and shiny so I quit using it.</li>
            <li> Just received this so I will update as I use it to let you know what I think. But using it for 1 day, I have to say out of all the eye creams I&#x27;ve used this one makes your eyes feel awake with a cool feeling. Makes your eyes feel refreshed. I will update soon.</li>
            <li> ***Full disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I absolutely love the scent of this product!  Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ smells like fresh cucumbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product doesn’t hide my bags or puffiness or dark circles.  Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ addresses those skincare problems and dramatically decreases them.  Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ hydrates my skin and prevents signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ is quick and easy to apply.  I dabbed Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ around my eyes, forehead, and cheek areas twice daily for three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ is a clear, gel like material.  Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ felt very cold going on even though it was stored at room temperature.  This product, Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ immediately soaked and easily blended into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really liked that this product, Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ uses organic, vegan, cruelty-free, and natural ingredients.  Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ is also free from parabens, sulfates, and alcohols.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of daily usage I saw positive results.  Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ significantly reduced my dark circles and puffiness.  I looked more awake and well rested.  My skin around my eyes felt tighter and more refined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks of using this product I continued to see beneficial results.  Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ has significantly improved my look as this product has made my skin look brighter, fresher, and healthier.  I will continue to use this product, Sano Naturals Vitamin C Eye Gel+ on a daily basis.  I would absolutely recommend this product to everyone that suffers from dark circles, puffiness, bags, wrinkles, fine lines, crow’s feet, and signs of aging skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment yet on whether it worked for the  bags under my eyes since I just got it and haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference.  However, it has a great cooling effect and feels like it is working! I&#x27;m hoping for the best as I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing has worked. I&#x27;ll post another review after a month or so of using this product. Keeping my fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> excellent - noticed a difference after a week.</li>
            <li> This was a surprisingly great product.  I used it for a month now and noticed the fine lines around my eyes and forehead are disappearing.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was a little skeptical, but this product really does what it says it does. It acts quickly to diminish bags under eyes and crows feet around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I purchased the SANO Vitamin C Eye Gel+, Hyaluronic Acid Serum+, and Vitamin C Serum+ all at the same time and I love these products. This product feels good to me after putting it on. It seems to tighten my skin. (The one thing I will say is it smells weird but I am used to that now so it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore.) It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Works amazing love it have had dark circles for years and now not so much</li>
            <li> I just recently started having under eye shadows and tried several products-none worked as effectively and quickly as Sano&#x27;s Eye gel...excellent product and excellent price!</li>
            <li> I really like this....very refreshing although I can&#x27;t say it does anything for bags under the eyes.  However, dark circles have seemed to fade.  I would buy again just because it feels so darn refreshing under my eyes and I really feel it has help the skin texture too.</li>
            <li> eye cream works great!</li>
            <li> This eye gel is beyond my expectation. I have tried many eye gel/creams, no name brand to highend brand ones with no good results as advertised. But the Sano eye gel really surprised me. It hydrates and tighten the skin under my eyes. My eyes tend to be puffy all day/night with dark under eyes. I noticed that the gel reduced the puffiness significantly and I can tell the difference if I forgot to put it on. I&#x27;m already going to order it again. Thank you Sano!</li>
            <li> I could&#x27;t believe the first time I applied this gel. Inmediately I noticed tightened in my eye area, and it didnt pass few days when I noticed the dark circles  all around my eyes starting to improve. Will definitely buy again. Thank you</li>
            <li> Has a slight cucumber scent, which isn&#x27;t unpleasant.  Goes on nicely and feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> I just received this eye gel, and it seems to work immediately!  Tightened &amp; smoothed my baggy eyes like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried, and the effects seem fairly long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product a week or so ago. So far I am pleased with it, but think I need to use it for awhile longer to tell about the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now and it hasn&#x27;t really helped reduce my dark circles. At first it helped reduce puffiness but now I feel like it doesn&#x27;t even do that. After using everyday it also gave me like a little rash under my eye and it would burn when I put it on and that has happened twice and I&#x27;be had to wait til the rash went away to use it again. I&#x27;m gonna keep using it in hopes that it will do something but I&#x27;m disappointed bc I was hoping it would help me, bc I always look tired and this product hasn&#x27;t really helped me and I still look tired. It does give a cooling sensation under the eyes though.</li>
            <li> Helps with my eyes after a night out!</li>
            <li> I started using this product the day I received the shipment and I really love it. I have dark circles and bags under my eyes that are hereditary, so even after a good night&#x27;s rest, I always look tired. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything on the market to decrease the inflammation around my eyes. The product is very light weight and not greasy at all. It&#x27;s almost like giving my skin a drink of water and it absorbs quickly. Since using  the gel, I&#x27;ve noticed less lines around my eyes and less puffiness. I keep it in my fridge to give my eyes an extra dose of inflammatory effect. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize or do anything noticeable. sorry, i was hoping for more.</li>
            <li> This cream feels so cool and comforting - smooth.  I got a free sample, then liked it so much I bought a jar.  My skin feels smoother. It lonely takes a small amount, so good value, too.</li>
            <li> nice and not too thick, goes on easily. makes my eyes feel refreshed!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because I had a discount code to try it and most importantly wanted to try to get rid of my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and here is what i found:&lt;br /&gt;nice consistency and texture to the product&lt;br /&gt;nice smell (not to strong)&lt;br /&gt;large size and good value&lt;br /&gt;easy application&lt;br /&gt;have noticed a slight improvement&lt;br /&gt;overall a nice product that I can see myself buying again as soon as I run low on it.</li>
            <li> So far so good, noticed results after the second day!</li>
            <li> The gel works well for me twice a day, applying it once in the morning and again right before bed.  It feels both cool and refreshing.  In the morning, it&#x27;s perfect under my foundation.  The gel absorbs into the skin and smooths the fine lines under my eyes and helps reduce puffiness.  Improvement in my wrinkles was noted gradually, and after six weeks, it looked remarkably better.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer and I&#x27;m normally allergic to eye creams. Not this one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer, great scent but has done absolutely nothing at all for circles or bags under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference even after 2 months and the smell was just too disagreeable. Threw the rest away.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product and glad I did. The gel dabs on easily, absorbs quickly and has a nice cooling effect with a  light cucumber fragrance. Will continue using. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Arrived and the lid was broke. Very fast service. Seems to be working, smells like cucumber which i don&#x27;t mind. Will know more in a few weeks</li>
            <li> Gel smells like fresh cucumber.  Noticed some firming, but nothing to brag about. My under eye bags are still the same as they&#x27;ve always been. Sigh. I feel like I was misled a little bit by the 4  1/2 stars. It seems to me that most of the people on here were bribed to give that many stars. Seemed fishy to me. I wished I would have figured this out before I bought it. Also, I felt like I was getting a super deal when I saw that they originally posted the price at $40. I paid 12. Clever of them. Well, the shipment did come fast.</li>
            <li> Makes eyes feel clean and tight. Also love that it&#x27;s a 1oz glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I must have had a bad reaction to this  eye gel and would not buy it. It came as a bonus with the Vit C Serum I had purchased. I put it on before bed under my eyes and it burned. Also, I awoke to find my eyes had BAGS under them and  were very puffy. I have NEVER had bags under my eyes before! I will toss this in the trash. It is too bad as I had high hopes after reading the rave reviews. Zero stars not available for selection, so I gave a 1.</li>
            <li> the gel is light not greasy and works well on small lines</li>
            <li> This eye gel works great and feels really nice on my skin.  Strong cucumber smell, but I like cucumbers.</li>
            <li> Instant refreshing to the eyes :)</li>
            <li> Seems like it does it&#x27;s job. The price is excellent when comparing to other similar products in the market. At first I felt like a little burning sensation but it quickly went away. The color of my skin seems to be improving and the spots on my cheeks are going away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly 3 months for at least 1 time per day. I just purchased my second eye cream. This is a great product and I intend to continue using it.</li>
            <li> This cream really works. I have been battling with dark circles for a while and use many treatments including lazer treatments from Epion Medical Center in LA. I don&#x27;t like writing reviews but I was impressed enough to write here.  First of all my dark circles are combination of week skin under my eye, pigmentation, and broken capillaries under the eye possibly due to allergies and liver issues. I have also tried Este Lauder, Lancome, Exuviance, AVAHA, Murad and nameless eye creams.  Apart from Sano I have seen Exuviance Age Reverse Eye Contour works well. So here is the thing, since the problem of dark circle is complex, use some time to figure out what is the cause of your dark circles, and have a realistic expectation from an eye cream. Sometimes you may have to use more than 1 type of a eye cream and some diet changes to fix the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all this, this is a very good eye cream. I bought AHAVA eye cream about month ago, and during that time my dark circles got really bad. I could have been allergic to it. I tried Sano mainly because I did not want to spend tons of money on another eye cream that is expence and this was on sale. I also prayed before my purchase (which I should add so you have all the variables that may have helped me:))  To my surprise it worked very well. It specifically worked by tightening the skin under my eye. In my picture you can see I have very week skin under my eyes and broken capillaries that is visible. I wish I took a before picture but this picture was taken about 3 days after I first used the cream and I noticed a difference worth talking about. 1st picture was taken immediately after applying the cream, 2nd after 5 minutes later, and 3rd one 15 minutes later. You can visibly see the purple capillary disheartening.. I have to say I am impressed. I got a 5 dollar coupon for product review after the review of the product (which I did not know about). However the reason why I am taking time to write this is becuase I know the pain of being a girl with dark circles around the eye. I am also praying for companies to come up with good technology to fix this issue since I believe God has all the answers embedded in the universe, and it&#x27;s a matter of finding them. That apply for dark circles as well.&lt;br /&gt;When you apply the cream don&#x27;t go too close to the eye lid. It causes cream to get in the eye and cuase alerdic reaction and more dark circles. Also, wait about 5 minutes before wearing make up. Cream also feels cooling and good. It definitely tighten the skin under eye. After one week use I feel like it is making a slow and realistic change in my dark circles and wrinkles.I know the pain of being a girl with dark circles around the eye.
