            <li>and I can find use for most of these brushes.</li>
            <li>My cousin is gonna love it coz</li>
            <li>i recieved this product free for my honest review and opinion</li>
            <li>Most of the powder brushes were misshaped from the plastic protector they put on the fibers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They all perform very well and I am quite happy with them.  </li>
            <li>Okay..</li>

            <li>Pretty good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>The brushes are full and nicely shaped which makes them a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty good</li>
            <li>: They are very soft along with the fact that they are very cute!</li>
            <li>; I think this would be a good set for a young teenager who is just getting into makeup, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice set of brushes.</li>
            <li>Every time my friends see them, they love them too, and they&#x27;re even more excited when I tell them the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good set for those just starting out in makeup application with a brush.</li>
            <li>I loved them so much I&#x27;m going to do a blog post about these.</li>
            <li>they are a excellent quality for little price and im ion love with te color</li>
            <li>They are pretty cute!</li>
            <li>It did have the strong smell others talk about</li>
            <li>and dear lord is it strong.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Maybe I got lucky. :)</li>
            <li>Now if you are looking to buy some starter brushes for your children to play with then these brushes are a little too pricey in my opinion for that option but would work great for them to learn how to use brushes!</li>
            <li>Cheap the brushes don&#x27;t pick up makeup well.</li>
            <li>You get a ton of brushes for $12 (and for me free shipping on orders over $35 because it was fulfilled by Amazon).</li>
            <li>and they are easy to clean</li>
            <li>: These brushes do have a light plastic smell</li>
            <li>They work well and are quality pieces...not cheaply made...</li>
            <li>great product comes with numerous brushes</li>
            <li>Very well put together!!!</li>
            <li>Having bought low end and high end brushes I would say these are very good quality brushes and affordable!</li>
            <li>Most of the brushes were of fair, but not professional, quality.</li>
            <li>Exactly how it&#x27;s desrcibed lovely</li>
            <li>Beautiful color Pink</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean - was able to get foundation out of the big brushes even after it had been sitting for a couple weeks without being cleaned.  </li>
            <li>Wow these brushes are amazing....</li>
            <li>Love them so much...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good, solid buy.</li>
            <li>you practically get 5 of the same eyeshadow brushes which are mainly good for packing on pigments 3)</li>
            <li>but the brushes are nice and soft</li>
            <li>But overall I think if you at looking for a good brush set at an affordable price, go to BH Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Check out the video to see the full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for brushes that are good quality and will actually work then these are not the brushes for you!  </li>
            <li>Most of the brushes are fairly decent considering the price.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes besides the fact that most of the are the same just diffrent sizes.</li>
            <li>All the brushes work super well and are made super well.</li>
            <li>brushes come in a beautiful pink brush roll, seems pretty sturdy, with the company name imprinted on it.</li>
            <li>They are not extremely soft which is good.</li>
            <li>Love My New Brush sets..</li>
            <li>Hope you all enjoy these as much as I have.</li>
            <li>This set of brushes is really soft and doesn&#x27;t shed like many others.</li>
            <li>Worth the money spend.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and I honestly thought they would be a lot smaller .</li>
            <li>Im giving this a 5/5 because the entire honestly cheaper than one mac brush.</li>
            <li>and They came Super fast!</li>
            <li>She loves it, she says it&#x27;s super soft but still strong.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and fine.</li>
            <li>but I would rather pay a little more and get better brushes.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t spend that much on them and they came quickly.</li>
            <li>The barrels are longer than standard brush barrels, but very comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>sure if this is a con or pro: The brushes are SUPER long!</li>
            <li>They are super soft and sturdy.. and very pretty hah.</li>
            <li>Nice Pink Case</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that it comes with small eyeshadow brushes which can be put to good use.</li>
            <li>Yes they&#x27;re super soft and afordable</li>
            <li>Quick Delivery Soft Brushes</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pick up and powders, shadows or blushes very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m torn on this kit, I really am.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cute pink brushes that come in a cute pink</li>
            <li>Gotta love the pink tips and handle.</li>
            <li>I bought these and really did not like them.</li>
            <li>(the handles are certainly long enough for it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Very satisfied with these brushes.  </li>
            <li>When I opened them, I didn&#x27;t notice a strong odor as I&#x27;ve ready in some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li>The brittles were so soft and I love the pink color.</li>
            <li>They were decent.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and fluffy and they look nice.</li>
            <li>I mostly bought this for the case to store my current brushes in, and I figured if I could get a cuter set of brushes in the same swoop, hey cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t know whether to hassle with returning them, or trying to clean them so they don&#x27;t reek of chemicals and maybe passing them along to a friend of mine&#x27;s 13-year old who would likely be stoked to have them.</li>
            <li>I just received these this morning, I really the brushes they are soft</li>
            <li>The only thing I found  them useful for was applying my children&#x27;s halloween makeup.</li>
            <li>Most of these brushes are super soft on the skin, a few are sturdier, but only because some brushes need to have some backbone.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>They do smell alittle but that is every brand new item.</li>
            <li>i absolutly love the  pink color case with the handles on the brushe the same color as well as the tips of these brushes again</li>
            <li>the same cute pink.</li>
            <li>However, with a quick wash and dry (and maybe a spritz of perfume)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, and if you&#x27;re worried about them being poor quality or something, don&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li>you also get 5 more brushed really similar to each other mainly used for concealer and eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>There are clearly duplicate brushes.</li>
            <li>Color is fantastic, the brushes look larger than they do online, minimal to no shedding.&lt;br /&gt;Not as soft as Id like them to be&lt;br /&gt;Case</li>
            <li>The synthetic fibers are surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised with the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>the brushes them selves are really soft and have not shed</li>
            <li>they are so soft on ur face...</li>
            <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li>I am in the process of returning these and have found a different set of brushes that are better quality and cost less than these!  </li>
            <li>The flat stippling brush is not dense enough to be useful.</li>
            <li>carrying case had a slight smell but it faded quickly.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest adding this kit to your collection, especially if you are a cheap-o like me who loves makeup but has a budget to maintain.</li>
            <li>The case is durable and the entire set is presented very professionally, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The brushes have white bristles, and the tips are a pretty pink color.</li>
            <li>For me, what knocks it down to a 2-star from a 3-star is the fact that it&#x27;s labeled as a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brush set when it&#x27;s clear no professional makeup artist in their right mind would break these out in front of clients, and because they smelled so heavily of chemicals, which is a shame, because 90% of why I bought them was for the pretty pink pearl</li>
            <li>Ok the first thing thats hits you is the smell of these bad boys..</li>
            <li>Shining was fast and they showed up in less than 5 days after ordering.</li>
            <li>The con i do have is if ii use a heavily pigmented eye shadow it does take some time to clean out the brush but other than that no complaints.</li>
            <li>Both of the angled shadow brushes (there is a regular size one and a slightly smaller one) had severe shedding problems and the fibers were clearly not cut well, as there are some which stick out far above the rest, but aren&#x27;t falling out as they don&#x27;t budge when tugged on.</li>

            <li> Very well put together!!!</li>
            <li> Having bought low end and high end brushes I would say these are very good quality brushes and affordable!</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes were of fair, but not professional, quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly how it&#x27;s desrcibed lovely</li>
            <li> Beautiful color Pink</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean - was able to get foundation out of the big brushes even after it had been sitting for a couple weeks without being cleaned.  </li>
            <li> Wow these brushes are amazing....</li>
            <li> Love them so much...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good, solid buy.</li>
            <li> you practically get 5 of the same eyeshadow brushes which are mainly good for packing on pigments 3)</li>
            <li> but the brushes are nice and soft</li>
            <li> But overall I think if you at looking for a good brush set at an affordable price, go to BH Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Check out the video to see the full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for brushes that are good quality and will actually work then these are not the brushes for you!  </li>
            <li> Most of the brushes are fairly decent considering the price.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes besides the fact that most of the are the same just diffrent sizes.</li>
            <li> All the brushes work super well and are made super well.</li>
            <li> brushes come in a beautiful pink brush roll, seems pretty sturdy, with the company name imprinted on it.</li>
            <li> They are not extremely soft which is good.</li>
            <li> Love My New Brush sets..</li>
            <li> Hope you all enjoy these as much as I have.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes is really soft and doesn&#x27;t shed like many others.</li>
            <li> Worth the money spend.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and I honestly thought they would be a lot smaller .</li>
            <li> Im giving this a 5/5 because the entire honestly cheaper than one mac brush.</li>
            <li> and They came Super fast!</li>
            <li> She loves it, she says it&#x27;s super soft but still strong.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and fine.</li>
            <li> but I would rather pay a little more and get better brushes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t spend that much on them and they came quickly.</li>
            <li> The barrels are longer than standard brush barrels, but very comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> sure if this is a con or pro: The brushes are SUPER long!</li>
            <li> They are super soft and sturdy.. and very pretty hah.</li>
            <li> Nice Pink Case</li>
            <li> Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that it comes with small eyeshadow brushes which can be put to good use.</li>
            <li> Yes they&#x27;re super soft and afordable</li>
            <li> Quick Delivery Soft Brushes</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pick up and powders, shadows or blushes very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn on this kit, I really am.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cute pink brushes that come in a cute pink</li>
            <li> Gotta love the pink tips and handle.</li>
            <li> I bought these and really did not like them.</li>
            <li> (the handles are certainly long enough for it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Very satisfied with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> When I opened them, I didn&#x27;t notice a strong odor as I&#x27;ve ready in some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> The brittles were so soft and I love the pink color.</li>
            <li> They were decent.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and fluffy and they look nice.</li>
            <li> I mostly bought this for the case to store my current brushes in, and I figured if I could get a cuter set of brushes in the same swoop, hey cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know whether to hassle with returning them, or trying to clean them so they don&#x27;t reek of chemicals and maybe passing them along to a friend of mine&#x27;s 13-year old who would likely be stoked to have them.</li>
            <li> I just received these this morning, I really the brushes they are soft</li>
            <li> The only thing I found  them useful for was applying my children&#x27;s halloween makeup.</li>
            <li> Most of these brushes are super soft on the skin, a few are sturdier, but only because some brushes need to have some backbone.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> They do smell alittle but that is every brand new item.</li>
            <li> i absolutly love the  pink color case with the handles on the brushe the same color as well as the tips of these brushes again</li>
            <li> the same cute pink.</li>
            <li> However, with a quick wash and dry (and maybe a spritz of perfume)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, and if you&#x27;re worried about them being poor quality or something, don&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li> you also get 5 more brushed really similar to each other mainly used for concealer and eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> There are clearly duplicate brushes.</li>
            <li> Color is fantastic, the brushes look larger than they do online, minimal to no shedding.&lt;br /&gt;Not as soft as Id like them to be&lt;br /&gt;Case</li>
            <li> The synthetic fibers are surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised with the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> the brushes them selves are really soft and have not shed</li>
            <li> they are so soft on ur face...</li>
            <li> I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of returning these and have found a different set of brushes that are better quality and cost less than these!  </li>
            <li> The flat stippling brush is not dense enough to be useful.</li>
            <li> carrying case had a slight smell but it faded quickly.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest adding this kit to your collection, especially if you are a cheap-o like me who loves makeup but has a budget to maintain.</li>
            <li> The case is durable and the entire set is presented very professionally, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The brushes have white bristles, and the tips are a pretty pink color.</li>
            <li> For me, what knocks it down to a 2-star from a 3-star is the fact that it&#x27;s labeled as a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brush set when it&#x27;s clear no professional makeup artist in their right mind would break these out in front of clients, and because they smelled so heavily of chemicals, which is a shame, because 90% of why I bought them was for the pretty pink pearl</li>
            <li> Ok the first thing thats hits you is the smell of these bad boys..</li>
            <li> Shining was fast and they showed up in less than 5 days after ordering.</li>
            <li> The con i do have is if ii use a heavily pigmented eye shadow it does take some time to clean out the brush but other than that no complaints.</li>
            <li> Both of the angled shadow brushes (there is a regular size one and a slightly smaller one) had severe shedding problems and the fibers were clearly not cut well, as there are some which stick out far above the rest, but aren&#x27;t falling out as they don&#x27;t budge when tugged on.</li>
            <li> Nice colouring, I mean I&#x27;m not a huge fan of pink but these aren&#x27;t so obnoxious as to make me dislike them.  </li>
            <li> Also there is no eye blending brush only flat brushes.</li>
            <li> The fibers the brushes are made with are very stiff and do not pick up the product very well.</li>
            <li> Brushes are long.</li>
            <li> That large fan brush is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about two weeks now and have had no problems with bristles falling out or being difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problems with shedding as yet and have used the brushes multiple times over the course of a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Not really what I expected.</li>
            <li> Oh, and they are pink.</li>
            <li> In other reveiws people were saying it smelled like plastic</li>
            <li> (I read other reviews saying that they smelled horrible.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way longer than any of my other brushes I owned before these.</li>
            <li> The pink dye on the tips has bled down some of the brushes, making them look streaky</li>
            <li> Poor quality, the fibers come out constantly and is of a low grade.</li>
            <li> not worth it in my opinion</li>
            <li> quite a few of them were misshapen due to how they were packaged.  </li>
            <li> and, I received them less then</li>
            <li> You can still slightly smell the chemicals</li>
            <li> On all but a few brushes, I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the fibers coming out.</li>
            <li> I know what they look like I have a few n</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t labeled and the average person isn&#x27;t going to know what to do with half of these, at least.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very hard and that makes it much harder to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> but when I received the package there was a weird chemical-like odor and after several washes it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> but I think I will buy another brush set because the some of the brushes that come with this set are not suitable for their purpose.</li>
            <li> The pretty pink leather case had a nasty brown sticky stain on it.  </li>
            <li> the brushes are a Lil hard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to tell..</li>
            <li> For example the contouring brush is not dense at all, making it hard to contour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really that bad at all</li>
            <li> They were extremely thin and</li>
            <li> And to make matters worse</li>
            <li> The brushes that I received were very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Sadly they weren&#x27;t even close!  </li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> The case smells of plasticy chemicals and that awful scent seeping to the brushes.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Cheap the brushes don&#x27;t pick up makeup well.</li>
            <li> Exactly how it&#x27;s desrcibed lovely</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pick up and powders, shadows or blushes very well.</li>
            <li> I love it, yeah the brushes are a Lil hard but they do what you pay for.  The more you use them though they get softer. The case smells though.</li>
            <li> Love My New Brush sets.. They&#x27;re very soft. Nice Pink Case and They came Super fast!</li>
            <li> Very well put together!!! Love them so much... They look way better in person!</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality for the price. They look great and I can find use for most of these brushes. In other reveiws people were saying it smelled like plastic I personally didn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> The brittles were so soft and I love the pink color. I&#x27;ve not used them though but I know it&#x27;s of good quality. My cousin is gonna love it coz I bought for her as a gift .</li>
            <li> They were decent. Great mothers day gift for wife. She was pleased and loved the color. Only wished that were labeled.</li>
            <li> Looooooove these brushes</li>
            <li> good buy and very fast shipping</li>
            <li> This set of brushes is really soft and doesn&#x27;t shed like many others. The brushes are full and nicely shaped which makes them a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> Color is fantastic, the brushes look larger than they do online, minimal to no shedding.&lt;br /&gt;Not as soft as Id like them to be&lt;br /&gt;Case it comes in is nice but smells like chemicals</li>
            <li> these brushes are amazing brushes i would definatly recommend them to any makeupartistb or just and averge woman or teen that loves m[akeup they are a excellent quality for little price and im ion love with te color i absolutly love the  pink color case with the handles on the brushe the same color as well as the tips of these brushes again the same cute pink. disclaimer i recieved this product free for my honest review and opinion i am by no means being told to say anthing by this company for my review these are my own opinions andb thoughts on this product</li>
            <li> I was worried about the quality of the brush. The brushes exceeded my expectations. The bristles are very soft and fine. Worth the money spend.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and sturdy.. and very pretty hah. The case is durable and the entire set is presented very professionally, in my opinion. Each piece fits in the case perfectly. And to those that say they smelled.... I disagree.. I never found any issues with a smell or anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn on this kit, I really am. Most of the brushes are fairly decent considering the price. They&#x27;re soft and fluffy and they look nice. They&#x27;re much larger than the pictures would lead you to believe. That large fan brush is ridiculous. I can&#x27;t imagine what I would use it for. I mostly bought this for the case to store my current brushes in, and I figured if I could get a cuter set of brushes in the same swoop, hey cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The price. You can&#x27;t beat it with a stick. You get a ton of brushes for $12 (and for me free shipping on orders over $35 because it was fulfilled by Amazon). Most of the brushes were of fair, but not professional, quality. The synthetic fibers are surprisingly soft. On all but a few brushes, I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the fibers coming out. They&#x27;re cute pink brushes that come in a cute pink case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The smell! The case smells of plasticy chemicals and that awful scent seeping to the brushes. They will need a thorough cleaning if I ever decide to use them. The pink dye on the tips has bled down some of the brushes, making them look streaky (this is just an aesthetic issue and doesn&#x27;t affect the usability). There are clearly duplicate brushes. Both of the angled shadow brushes (there is a regular size one and a slightly smaller one) had severe shedding problems and the fibers were clearly not cut well, as there are some which stick out far above the rest, but aren&#x27;t falling out as they don&#x27;t budge when tugged on. One is virtually unusable because of the shedding. They aren&#x27;t labeled and the average person isn&#x27;t going to know what to do with half of these, at least. The flat stippling brush is not dense enough to be useful. Most of the powder brushes were misshaped from the plastic protector they put on the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the cons vastly outweigh the pros, but I&#x27;m also of the camp that &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34; I think this would be a good set for a young teenager who is just getting into makeup, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice set of brushes. For me, what knocks it down to a 2-star from a 3-star is the fact that it&#x27;s labeled as a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; brush set when it&#x27;s clear no professional makeup artist in their right mind would break these out in front of clients, and because they smelled so heavily of chemicals, which is a shame, because 90% of why I bought them was for the pretty pink pearl case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just don&#x27;t know whether to hassle with returning them, or trying to clean them so they don&#x27;t reek of chemicals and maybe passing them along to a friend of mine&#x27;s 13-year old who would likely be stoked to have them.</li>
            <li> Really happy with theses the bristles feel great and they are easy to clean</li>
            <li> Just received these today. I was really surprised with the quality for the price. These are great brushes and they came in a really nice travel . I would recommend these. Having bought low end and high end brushes I would say these are very good quality brushes and affordable!</li>
            <li> The Good: Very nice brushes.  I am very satisfied with them.  Nice colouring, I mean I&#x27;m not a huge fan of pink but these aren&#x27;t so obnoxious as to make me dislike them.  Very easy to clean - was able to get foundation out of the big brushes even after it had been sitting for a couple weeks without being cleaned.  I have had no problems with shedding as yet and have used the brushes multiple times over the course of a few weeks.  Pick up and distribute color nicely.  Every time my friends see them, they love them too, and they&#x27;re even more excited when I tell them the price.&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: There was indeed a very strong (but tolerable) smell to the case and brushes.  I washed the brushes with baby shampoo as soon as I unwrapped them, there is still some lingering smell but it is not a problem.  I did the same with the case with dish washing soap, and received the same result.  Also, I would have liked the brushes to be labelled (the handles are certainly long enough for it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Very satisfied with these brushes.  Quite an extensive kit for the price.  They all perform very well and I am quite happy with them.  Definitely worth the purchase.  Wish they could be labelled because that&#x27;s helpful to anyone, but that probably would have raised the price.  Very satisfied, and if you&#x27;re worried about them being poor quality or something, don&#x27;t be.  It&#x27;s a good, solid buy.</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes and perfectly matches my bathroom theme! ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> I LOVE the texture and style of these brushes! Perfect Perfect Perfect! I will continue to order from this seller!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes besides the fact that most of the are the same just diffrent sizes. Also there is no eye blending brush only flat brushes. They are soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Okay..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: These brushes do have a light plastic smell but I can over look that. It&#x27;s not really that bad at all plus I knew that before I bought them. (I read other reviews saying that they smelled horrible.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this is a con or pro: The brushes are SUPER long! Way longer than any of my other brushes I owned before these. Which makes me feel like I&#x27;m using a paint brush on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: They are very soft along with the fact that they are very cute! Gotta love the pink tips and handle. Shining was fast and they showed up in less than 5 days after ordering. I would buy them again if I had too.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t spend that much on them and they came quickly. All the brushes work super well and are made super well. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> the brushes them selves are really soft and have not shed (I have washed them once with baby shampoo) I definitely think there are some essentials in here but 1) you don&#x27;t get an eyeshadow blending brush!!!!! 2) you practically get 5 of the same eyeshadow brushes which are mainly good for packing on pigments 3) you also get 5 more brushed really similar to each other mainly used for concealer and eyeshadow. not worth it in my opinion</li>
            <li> Bought for a Christmas gift for a friend. She digs them.</li>
            <li> Wow these brushes are amazing.... they are so much bigger than you think... and, I received them less then a week after I ordered them...  they are so soft on ur face... the only issue I have is I have no clue where the crippling brush is. It&#x27;s so hard to tell.. I know what they look like I have a few n some Brussels are longer than others but with these brushes there are no difference...</li>
            <li> i like them there is still glue of the handles and it would be nice if they was labeled. but the brushes are nice and soft</li>
            <li> bought a set for my daughter and myself. We both are happy with our brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these and really did not like them. The fibers the brushes are made with are very stiff and do not pick up the product very well.The price is pretty good but I would rather pay a little more and get better brushes. The only thing I found  them useful for was applying my children&#x27;s halloween makeup.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, i love it , nice color, its so beautiful  and cute, so great.and soft (Hermoso bolso, , el color es exacto al de la foto lo recomiendo)</li>
            <li> These brushes are okay. Yes they&#x27;re super soft and afordable but I think I will buy another brush set because the some of the brushes that come with this set are not suitable for their purpose. For example the contouring brush is not dense at all, making it hard to contour. I do like the fact that it comes with small eyeshadow brushes which can be put to good use. But overall I think if you at looking for a good brush set at an affordable price, go to BH Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> These are some of the softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased and they&#x27;re pretty good quality given their price, which was actually surprising. I&#x27;m definitely pleased and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, the fibers come out constantly and is of a low grade. Will not purchase anything from this line again!</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected. The brushes are very hard and that makes it much harder to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> They are pretty cute! I love it!</li>
            <li> They work well and are quality pieces...not cheaply made...</li>
            <li> So far so good!!! Quick Delivery Soft Brushes Beautiful color Pink &amp; they&#x27;re a nice length</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:9fcd8ba4c4e6469c1877bbeeb55a6aed]] They are soft and feel wonderful on your skin!! I love these brushes! Oh, and they are pink.

            <li> I just received these this morning, I really the brushes they are soft and I honestly thought they would be a lot smaller . They do smell alittle but that is every brand new item. These are a must buy!!!</li>
            <li> great product comes with numerous brushes</li>
            <li> I absolutely am in love with this brush set. These brushes are really good quality brushes. Very good set for those just starting out in makeup application with a brush. When I opened them, I didn&#x27;t notice a strong odor as I&#x27;ve ready in some of the other reviews. Maybe I got lucky. :)&lt;br /&gt;  There are 22 brushes in this set. They&#x27;re well constructed, none of the barrels were lose, all the bristles were intact and there has been no shedding as of yet. I washed  them once already to see if they stood up to a vigorous cleaning, they held up beautifully. The barrels are longer than standard brush barrels, but very comfortable in the hand. They pick up shadows easily, and applying makeup is pretty flawless with this set. For the price, it&#x27;s almost a steal. Most of these brushes are super soft on the skin, a few are sturdier, but only because some brushes need to have some backbone.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes come in a beautiful pink brush roll, seems pretty sturdy, with the company name imprinted on it. It&#x27;s quite beautiful to look at, and feels good in the hands. The brushes have white bristles, and the tips are a pretty pink color. These would be perfect for a gift, or for yourself. I loved them so much I&#x27;m going to do a blog post about these. I received this set to review for my honest opinions per Amazon&#x27;s rules and regulations.</li>
            <li> I have been on the lookout for some brushes that I can purchase that would be good quality but that I didn&#x27;t have to pay a fortune on and I thought these brushes were it but they were not.  Sadly they weren&#x27;t even close!  The brushes that I received were very poor quality.  They were extremely thin and quite a few of them were misshapen due to how they were packaged.  The pretty pink leather case had a nasty brown sticky stain on it.  And to make matters worse they had upped the price from $11.50 to $13.50!  I could see upping the price if they were quality brushes but honestly I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $5 for these brushes!  ELF brushes are better quality than these and you can get them for just $1.00 a piece!  I am in the process of returning these and have found a different set of brushes that are better quality and cost less than these!  If you are looking for brushes that are good quality and will actually work then these are not the brushes for you!  Now if you are looking to buy some starter brushes for your children to play with then these brushes are a little too pricey in my opinion for that option but would work great for them to learn how to use brushes!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Very soft. It did have the strong smell others talk about but I left it open to air out for a couple hours and it&#x27;s fine. Brushes are long.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girl friend. She loves it, she says it&#x27;s super soft but still strong. None of the burshes were falling apart and she said she liked the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carrying case had a slight smell but it faded quickly.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes. They are not extremely soft which is good. They dont irritate my face either. No shedding. The con i do have is if ii use a heavily pigmented eye shadow it does take some time to clean out the brush but other than that no complaints.</li>
            <li> Great brush collection but when I received the package there was a weird chemical-like odor and after several washes it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about two weeks now and have had no problems with bristles falling out or being difficult to clean.  I think they&#x27;re definitely a good value for what was paid.</li>
            <li> Ok the first thing thats hits you is the smell of these bad boys..and dear lord is it strong. However, with a quick wash and dry (and maybe a spritz of perfume) I tamed the beast. You can still slightly smell the chemicals but oh well. On to the product. Im giving this a 5/5 because the entire honestly cheaper than one mac brush. And they are good quality for the price. I would highly suggest adding this kit to your collection, especially if you are a cheap-o like me who loves makeup but has a budget to maintain. Hope you all enjoy these as much as I have.</li>
