            <li>LOVE e.l.f.!</li>

            <li>Some colors are like matte, some have glitter (Which I love!)</li>
            <li>Nice colors.</li>
            <li>so I thought this would be a nice beginner/practice for her.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>AT YOUR OWN PERIL.</li>
            <li>/&gt;just make sure u have a really good eye shadow primer underneath&lt;</li>
            <li>It is not that easy to apply and you cannot expect bright colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a great, fun set.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li>This thing is by far the best eye shadow pallet I have ever purchased!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge!</li>
            <li>It has every color you would use and more.  </li>
            <li>I, also, noticed that the longer it&#x27;s on the better</li>
            <li>If you are looking for somethin cheap to get you by, then by all means knock yourself out!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>i love</li>
            <li>This has so many colors &amp;</li>
            <li>I recommend this to the world! :)</li>
            <li>Not to mention, the component makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve try several beautiful.</li>
            <li>It came just fine.</li>
            <li>, this is the best palette for me, I have other high priced palettes but this one does the job better then the others!</li>
            <li>even their neutrals look fabulous i am now hooked</li>
            <li>This item came right on time, I love the colors it brings</li>
            <li>Very fun to blend and play with these colors.</li>
            <li>The colors go on perfectly smooth and all of the colors are true to their color..</li>
            <li>it was a present and she loved it.</li>
            <li>My little sister loved it, so I guess I love it too.</li>
            <li>But it is cheap and you can certainly use it for fun or practice.</li>
            <li>Saturated colors, a whole lot of them, for cheap is all I can say.</li>
            <li>Not the best for dark skin tones as the shadows barely show up.</li>
            <li>Wish there was more brown tones that actually worked with my skin!</li>
            <li>The colors are very light and not vivid on the eye.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;i don&#x27;t really think its a must have ..</li>
            <li>They are vibrant but not too shimmery or shiny.  </li>
            <li>The colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as the picture</li>
            <li>It has the potential to last a long time because there are so many options, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not something that I would expect to last without a touch up for a super long day and into the night, but what do you expect for $12?</li>
            <li>dark skin n findin vibrant colors is always a challenge</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The colors are long lasting, I can apply and literally wear all day without retouching.</li>
            <li> stay on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Also it looks as though someone took the pink and purple marble color out and replaced it with a different color before sending.  </li>
            <li> I recently brought this product from a local beauty store a while ago, due to someone who was an awipe, they not only broke it but also stole the broken pieces</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews on this product I still went ahead and bought this item....</li>
            <li> The package on the eye shadow itself was a little rough looking.</li>
            <li> I was thinking about returning it but probably not worth the hassle</li>
            <li> A FEW COLOURS MESSED UP.</li>
            <li> I had an expensive palette before that was seven times the price of this, and I now realize I wasted my money because this works just the same.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed because the colors werent as vibrant or dark as they look in the pallet :/</li>
            <li> and some have 2 colors in one little cube!!!</li>
            <li> saying it was broken is an understatement......</li>
            <li> Not great quality, but</li>
            <li> so I was a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Weird!</li>
            <li> my bad.....</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s huge! And a great price. Nice colors.</li>
            <li> it was a present and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Good for beginners and those who do not like a lot of pigmentation. The colors are very light and not vivid on the eye. You will have to mix and match to get a deeper look on the eye. I also like this product because the powder stays in place all day with or without concealer.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how big this thing is!  It has every color you would use and more.  The price is incredible and the cosmetics are good (like all elf products). They colors go on as shown.  They are vibrant but not too shimmery or shiny.  It&#x27;s not something that I would expect to last without a touch up for a super long day and into the night, but what do you expect for $12? It&#x27;s just a great, fun set.</li>
            <li> My little sister loved it, so I guess I love it too. She just started wearing makeup so I thought this would be a nice beginner/practice for her.</li>
            <li> I adore this palette. It&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve had so far. I had an expensive palette before that was seven times the price of this, and I now realize I wasted my money because this works just the same. The colors are long lasting, I can apply and literally wear all day without retouching. I, also, noticed that the longer it&#x27;s on the better it begins to look. This is great. A variety of colors and a bargain. It has the potential to last a long time because there are so many options, too.</li>
            <li> Very fun to blend and play with these colors. Use an elf brush for application...</li>
            <li> This is very good! I use it all the time! This is a MUST BUY item. It&#x27;s really awesome and color is great. You can&#x27;t beat the price! Not to mention, the component makes it easy to apply. LOVE e.l.f.!</li>
            <li> This item came right on time, I love the colors it brings I&#x27;ve try several beautiful. Thanks</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Not the best for dark skin tones as the shadows barely show up. If you are looking for somethin cheap to get you by, then by all means knock yourself out!</li>
            <li> Great colors! stay on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Saturated colors, a whole lot of them, for cheap is all I can say. Don&#x27;t expect MAC quality (soooo unrealistic) and you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> I recently brought this product from a local beauty store a while ago, due to someone who was an awipe, they not only broke it but also stole the broken pieces, this is the best palette for me, I have other high priced palettes but this one does the job better then the others! Great product!</li>
            <li> Love thievery shadow!  Love the variety of colors, they look great on! They last all day! Great product! Love it</li>
            <li> Nice. Wish there was more brown tones that actually worked with my skin!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed because the colors werent as vibrant or dark as they look in the pallet :/</li>
            <li> im dark skin n findin vibrant colors is always a challenge so im always buyin different brand  palettes ,,,,my search is over i love e.l.f!!!! even their neutrals look fabulous i am now hooked</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews on this product I still went ahead and bought this item....my bad.....saying it was broken is an understatement......it was annihilated...I wanted to give it a zero star rating...but it won&#x27;t allow this.....BEWARE BUY AT YOUR OWN PERIL.</li>
            <li> Best. Eyeshadow. Ever. That is all you need to know, this is a must have for anyone who does makeup, gives you lots of options!</li>
            <li> This has so many colors &amp;&amp; I absolutely love it!! The colors go on perfectly smooth and all of the colors are true to their color.. I love that it has neutral colors and bright colors, so you have day wear and evening wear all in one thing!! Some colors are like matte, some have glitter (Which I love!) and some have 2 colors in one little cube!!! This thing is by far the best eye shadow pallet I have ever purchased!! I recommend this to the world! :)</li>
            <li> RECEIVE IT DAMAGE. A FEW COLOURS MESSED UP. BUT I CAN STILL USE IT.</li>
            <li> It came just fine. The package on the eye shadow itself was a little rough looking. The colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as the picture so I was a little disappointed.  But I&#x27;ll still use it. I was thinking about returning it but probably not worth the hassle i didn&#x27;t even receive a receipt. Also it looks as though someone took the pink and purple marble color out and replaced it with a different color before sending.  Weird!</li>
            <li> Not great quality, but it was only $10, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> the colors are so chalky .. the variety of colors is amazing&lt;br /&gt;its a good pallet for beginners&lt;br /&gt;just make sure u have a really good eye shadow primer underneath&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t really think its a must have ..</li>
            <li> The color is not what you see when you apply on the skin. It is not that easy to apply and you cannot expect bright colors. But it is cheap and you can certainly use it for fun or practice.</li>
