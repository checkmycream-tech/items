            <li>Great products my hairdresser uses them on me &amp; had to get my own set for home !</li>
            <li>My hair stylist applied the Protective Gel and I was impressed -- my hair had more body and the curls were well defined.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have no idea what good this product does.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Smells spectacular, but do wish the ingredients were better!</li>
            <li>It is probably perfect alone on someone with coarser texture, but my hair is straight, fine and aging, so I do find that I enjoy the product best when combined with another.</li>

            <li>Love this brazilian protective serum.</li>
            <li>My hair stays healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I thought it was OK  -</li>
            <li>After spending a LOT on many brands of styling, glossing, de-frizzing, conditioning, etc., products, I found this</li>
            <li>I love the product,</li>
            <li>This is great if you have kinky curly hair and want it straight.  </li>
            <li>Not the sleek/straight hair I would prefer, but much better than the frizz I would have without it.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that frizzes easily.  </li>
            <li>This works great on short curly hair.</li>
            <li>This is great when mixed with Unite Blow &amp; Set Sculpting Lotion!</li>
            <li>It is really fabulous.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get rid of all of my frizz, but did a significant job.</li>
            <li>If it was a ripoff and the original is not supposed to be like this...</li>
            <li>Amazon.com wins another one!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and frizz free!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love how this makes my hair easy to straighten and so soft!</li>
            <li>It would be a great option for someone planning to wear their hair in a secure updo, but not for someone who wants to wear their hair down and flowing.</li>
            <li>Works great in my hair, doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy or feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount, as instructed, for best results.</li>
            <li>I also use the shampoo &amp; conditioner ;))))</li>
            <li>Helps to smooth out my frizzy curly hair and keeps it so soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I live in a warm country and have very short curly hair.</li>
            <li>Great to use when wet or before flat ironing.</li>
            <li>Small bottles for the price but a good product</li>
            <li>Creates lovely shine, and the high Midwest humidity does not affect my hair the entire day.</li>
            <li>My hair was super soft</li>
            <li>Does not stay straight.</li>
            <li>I received my order in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li>REALLY LIKE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>Too much curl for a Caucasian girl.</li>
            <li>works really well.  </li>
            <li>I do not use this product to keep my hair straight in the humidity here  -</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t stick straight.</li>
            <li>Gets my kinjy curly hair bone straight in no time and reverts back to it&#x27;s original state</li>
            <li>I DIDN&#x27;T USE ALOT THE FIRST TIME, BC MY HAIR IS FINE &amp; WILL WEIGH DOWN EASILY.&lt;br /&gt;DIDN&#x27;T</li>
            <li>I tried using it several times and it actually makes my hair more frizzy and wavy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product it makes my hair so soft &amp; straight when blown out with a round brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this will be part of my regular routine because of its weightiness, but it is an okay option for dry hair.</li>
            <li>but i still use it as i am hoping it will protect my hair from my daily use of the hot iron.</li>
            <li>HAVE ANY PROBLEMS, USED MORE THE SECOND TIME &amp; STILL NOT WEIGHING DOWN MY HAIR.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy-to-curly hair that is a bit longer than shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>I do not use a blow dryer because I want to retain the natural look, but my hair puffs out and frizzes after brushing it.</li>
            <li>and it was completely USELESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After losing my hair after chemo treatments,  my hair came back VERY  curly.</li>
            <li>so I really need this to make it last.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone who has frizzy or not easy to straighten hair :)</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and straightens it without frizz for the entire day!</li>
            <li>So on my second try, I used a small amount mixed with the Brazilian Blowout Daily a Smoothing Serum, and the results were much better.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky, shiny, put in wet hair, comb thru with fingers, let dry naturally or blow dryer, either way leaves hair soft &amp; silky to the touch.</li>

            <li> Did not keep my hair pressed long.</li>
            <li> This hair serum is very watered down and runny, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I put this product in my hair after my shower and then I let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida - land of suffocating humidity.  </li>
            <li> NOT SMELLY, STICKY HEAVY.</li>
            <li> feels heavy on my hair</li>
            <li> gives it shine and makes it seem less course and dull.</li>
            <li> : I do get the brazilian blowout, so not sure what it would do for non treated</li>
            <li> You have to use a small amount or else</li>
            <li> It made my hair OILY, GREASY and DULL</li>
            <li> It made my hair OILY, GREASY and DULL...</li>
            <li> this time too my hair were oily, greasy, DRY and felt DIRTY.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Use before blowout, adds moisture and protection.</li>
            <li> I love all Brazilian products!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and love it! It makes my hair soft and frizz free!!</li>
            <li> Love this brazilian protective serum. My hair stays healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> Prevents frizz when I&#x27;m blow-drying my hair!</li>
            <li> I thought it was OK  - didn&#x27;t knock my socks off!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Gets my kinjy curly hair bone straight in no time and reverts back to it&#x27;s original state once I wash it without damage.</li>
            <li> Love it! Product works well!</li>
            <li> Did not keep my hair pressed long. I had to use another product to help after doing the press over</li>
            <li> Fantastic products!!!! I would definetly purchase this again!!!!</li>
            <li> I am now a Brazilian Blowout product fan.  I have naturally wavy-to-curly hair that is a bit longer than shoulder length.  I do not use a blow dryer because I want to retain the natural look, but my hair puffs out and frizzes after brushing it. After spending a LOT on many brands of styling, glossing, de-frizzing, conditioning, etc., products, I found this and it works!  My hair stylist applied the Protective Gel and I was impressed -- my hair had more body and the curls were well defined. The shine spray actually makes my hair shiny without any droop.  You only need a small amount, as instructed, for best results.</li>
            <li> Combined with the shampoo and conditioner from this line, it leaves my hair feeling like butter!&lt;br /&gt;Note: I do get the brazilian blowout, so not sure what it would do for non treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is the bomb for my nappy hair though.</li>
            <li> It has shine. In humidity my hair still gets curly. Does not stay straight. You have to use a small amount or else hair gets sticky.</li>
            <li> perfect for ends before blow drying</li>
            <li> Love this! It makes my hair so soft and straightens it without frizz for the entire day!</li>
            <li> Great to use when wet or before flat ironing. Makes my Brazillian Blowout last longer</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product it makes my hair so soft &amp; straight when blown out with a round brush. I also use the shampoo &amp; conditioner ;))))</li>
            <li> This hair serum is very watered down and runny, a waste of money. Will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I received my order in a very timely manner.  I love the product,</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and exactly as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Helps to smooth out my frizzy curly hair and keeps it so soft.</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered the conditioner, but was mistaken and ordered this instead.  It&#x27;s good, but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I tried using it several times and it actually makes my hair more frizzy and wavy. It also has a sticky texture to it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My stylist used it on my hair after I got it colored. My hair was super soft so I had to get some for at home. I use this plus the smoothing serum, dry and the style my hair with either a flat iron or curling iron. You should always use heat protection and this one is A++++</li>
            <li> If you have the Brazilian Blowout done, this stuff should be a requirement. Makes your hair even softer and smoother. Makes styling a breeze.</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE THIS STUFF. NOT SMELLY, STICKY HEAVY. I DIDN&#x27;T USE ALOT THE FIRST TIME, BC MY HAIR IS FINE &amp; WILL WEIGH DOWN EASILY.&lt;br /&gt;DIDN&#x27;T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS, USED MORE THE SECOND TIME &amp; STILL NOT WEIGHING DOWN MY HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;REALLY LIKE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product. It didn&#x27;t get rid of all of my frizz, but did a significant job.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; seller!!!!</li>
            <li> I get complement every day all day on my hair and I swim 3 days a wk</li>
            <li> I have no idea what good this product does. It made my hair OILY, GREASY and DULL - lifeless!&lt;br /&gt;When i washed my hair and applied this as per directions... on drying my hair felt like they were frizzier than ever. My Brazilian Blowout seemed to have vanished I felt that washing had made my hair dirtier than they were before washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take two - I washed my hair and forgot to apply this (maybe I wanted to forget) and discovered that my hair were shiny and manageable - just as I&#x27;d expect from the blowout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take three - I gave it another try.. this time too my hair were oily, greasy, DRY and felt DIRTY. I missed the texture I felt on my second wash.&lt;br /&gt;Now this bottle lies on the corner of my dressing table... mocking me. I lost ~$20 on it and it was completely USELESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only speak for the product I received. If it was a ripoff and the original is not supposed to be like this...even then it is a risk to buy it from here. Never again.</li>
            <li> This is great if you have kinky curly hair and want it straight.  After losing my hair after chemo treatments,  my hair came back VERY  curly. Too much curl for a Caucasian girl. This works great on short curly hair.</li>
            <li> works really well.  Great price on Amazon.  My hair stylist recommended it for gray hair- gives it shine and makes it seem less course and dull.</li>
            <li> This is great when mixed with Unite Blow &amp; Set Sculpting Lotion! It is probably perfect alone on someone with coarser texture, but my hair is straight, fine and aging, so I do find that I enjoy the product best when combined with another. Smells spectacular, but do wish the ingredients were better!</li>
            <li> Works great in my hair, doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy or feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> feels heavy on my hair but i still use it as i am hoping it will protect my hair from my daily use of the hot iron.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to grow your hair out and use styling tools, you need this product!  It will protect your hair and make it look great.</li>
            <li> It made my hair OILY, GREASY and DULL...</li>
            <li> Use this product daily before blow drying my hair.  Controls frizz and helps hold style for my short curly hair.</li>
            <li> Works brilliantly! Creates lovely shine, and the high Midwest humidity does not affect my hair the entire day. WILL PURCHASE AGAIN!</li>
            <li> It is really fabulous. Leaves hair silky, shiny, put in wet hair, comb thru with fingers, let dry naturally or blow dryer, either way leaves hair soft &amp; silky to the touch.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for protect from frizz! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great products my hairdresser uses them on me &amp; had to get my own set for home !</li>
            <li> I live in Florida - land of suffocating humidity.  I do not use this product to keep my hair straight in the humidity here  - I don&#x27;t think such a product exists!  I have curly hair that frizzes easily.  I put this product in my hair after my shower and then I let it air dry.  I get curls/waves with no frizz.  Not the sleek/straight hair I would prefer, but much better than the frizz I would have without it.</li>
            <li> This balm isn&#x27;t a horrible product if you don&#x27;t follow the directions as stated on the tube. The first time I used it, I applied it to my wet hair &amp;#34;generously&amp;#34; as stated on the tube and after blow drying, my hair was shiny but also very heavy with no movement or body. So on my second try, I used a small amount mixed with the Brazilian Blowout Daily a Smoothing Serum, and the results were much better. I don&#x27;t think this will be part of my regular routine because of its weightiness, but it is an okay option for dry hair. It would be a great option for someone planning to wear their hair in a secure updo, but not for someone who wants to wear their hair down and flowing. The best thing about the balm was the price: I paid $16.99 for it on Amazon.com, but it is $28.00 on BrazilianBlowout.com! Amazon.com wins another one!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love how this makes my hair easy to straighten and so soft! Would definitely recommend to anyone who has frizzy or not easy to straighten hair :)</li>
            <li> So far, so good. It smells just like what I purchase in the salon. It also seems to work the same. It&#x27;s cheaper here so I&#x27;ll probably buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I have the brazillian blowout so I really need this to make it last.</li>
            <li> Small bottles for the price but a good product</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I live in a warm country and have very short curly hair. This being humidity resistant worked almost perfectly for me. Wasn&#x27;t stick straight. But didn&#x27;t frizz out or get wavy/curly. Five stars.</li>
