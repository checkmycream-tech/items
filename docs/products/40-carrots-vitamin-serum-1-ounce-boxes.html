            <li>OMG, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>There is something about the lovely feel it gives my face after I have used it and the ingredients are very good.  </li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I also ordered organic rose hips oil</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and is perfect under moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Nice for the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>this product didnt irritate my skin, smells nice, seems to tighten &amp; brighten...worth the $$</li>
            <li>After reading so many great reviews on this product, i just knew it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very easy to evenly apply all over.</li>
            <li>Grab it when you see it, and enjoy the effectiveness of a good moisture.</li>
            <li>It is very light in consistency, and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>it feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li>It works great and sells for a more than reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This tightening effect is what I like most about the product.  </li>
            <li>It sure feels like it does though.      </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t moisturize well for me as the description indicated, so i have to use a separate moisturizers over top of it</li>
            <li>This serum smells lovely without being overpowering</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky like many serums can be.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I bought this.</li>
            <li>Like it, don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend, you do more research before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>I do know people that love this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products ranging from $5 to $150.</li>
            <li>The texture is not creamy and goes on with more</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product, it smells like carrot and orange juice mixed together, it has a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Did nothing, did some irritation though, but not as much as the Boots Protect &amp; perfect Intense Beauty Serum.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This would have to be the BEST value for money I have EVER spent on my skin....and trust me...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying it that way since (1 to 2 pumps, immediately after stepping out of the shower while my face is still wet) and my skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been after about 3 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;Almost</li>
            <li>I want to try other 40 Carrots products now, as the eye gel is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>However, the bottle I received is not serum, but a watery liquid that can&#x27;t easily be applied without spillage.  </li>
            <li>- it makes my skin look beautiful and glowing, and it is definitely smoother.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT for my normal type 65 year old skin.</li>
            <li>But works just fine for the cost.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I go to see if there are any bottles of this product available</li>
            <li>and I will buy ALL of this product that is available.  </li>
            <li>cause my skin looked so smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is really amazing, it has made my skin very clear and youthful.</li>
            <li>I run out and cannot get them on special from one of the department stores</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, fine lines are smoother, skin is firmer, and i have a more youthful glow!</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be buying more :)</li>
            <li>My order came quickly.</li>
            <li>I now feel much more confident leaving the house without makeup than I would&#x27;ve thought possible before.</li>
            <li>I am prone to breakouts and have some sun spots that I&#x27;m trying to tackle and on top of it all I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Really fab!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied, to actually find a product that does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t yet gotten used to the initial &#x27;sticky&#x27; feeling of the serum or tried to wear makeup over it, so I considered just skipping that step but loved the glow my skin was developing and didn&#x27;t want to derail any positive results.</li>
            <li>Nice very lightweight, but boy oh boy is it effective in firming and filling those starting to sag areas on my 60 year old combination skin!</li>
            <li>I hope the review will help you determine its worth to you.  </li>
            <li>Worth it</li>
            <li>Bought it originally because it was on sale but went out and bought the whole 40 Carrots line bacuse this product worked so well.  </li>
            <li>every morning (I applied it right before bed)</li>
            <li>I put it on right after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice until I took a super close look at my skin.</li>
            <li>I know I would like to continue using it and am interested in the rest of the line.</li>
            <li>No weird smell or taste.</li>
            <li>First off, I found this product at another discount department store for $5.99.</li>
            <li>In my haste to get ready, I rubbed the serum onto my freshly showered and still dripping face and let it dry/soak in while I went about brushing my teeth, etc.</li>
            <li>Went back to TJ&#x27;s and bought 3 more bottles and 4 bottles of the face wash.</li>
            <li>Tone, texture and balance have all noticeably improved and I&#x27;m being complimented on my skin for pretty much the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>Use the whole skin care line, cleanser and moisturizer and you&#x27;ll see a difference the first time you use them together.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s cheap enough.  </li>
            <li>so my skin isn&#x27;t very wrinkled</li>
            <li>Has never broken me out or made me red.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am of african origin with light skin,if this is any help to anyone.</li>
            <li>Within a week it starts to really get to work.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot(two pumps) to cover your face, it absorbs really well</li>
            <li>Apparently that was the secret because the serum soaked in beautifully with no stickiness or extra redness, just glowing healthy skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product as a moisturizer because it mattifies my skin</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this serum from the reviews I read.  </li>
            <li>Did not notice any feeling of tightening or really any notice of it at all.  </li>
            <li>I have tried sooo many other products for the results I had gotten and for an over the counter treatment</li>
            <li>Better than any other serum I have used .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad especially if you want to use it alone before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>Although not purchased from amazon directly, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Not as high a persentage of C as in the high potency-</li>
            <li>high price products.</li>
            <li>It is hard to believe you can get this kind of value.</li>
            <li>am 55 years old and am VERY fussy about what goes on my skin.  </li>
            <li>With other products, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After about a week of daily use, I had plans arise unexpectedly and needed to be out the door quickly.</li>
            <li>40 CARROTS is incredible!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a favorite and not easy to find.  </li>
            <li>and it was a little harsh but would be great as an additional antioxidant ingredient.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it and ordering a new one.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I now apply once every other day, and will continue to do so for the forsee able future.</li>
            <li>But when I first put it on, I could actually feel it working:</li>
            <li>You can buy 4 of these or more for the cost of other serums, and get the same results for spots and glow as this.</li>
            <li>I love this serum, and it not only seems to help fade dark spots (over time) but tightens up the skin a bit after you put it on.  </li>
            <li>plus is that it is not chalked full of silicones or the other nasties that find their way into products like this.</li>
            <li>I am getting  a few wrinkles and my pores are getting huge</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t so far reduced any wrinkles I might have</li>
            <li>So far it has made my skin feel moist and soft and seems to be filling in.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and looks firmer.</li>
            <li>I bought this product on sale at our local store and did not think much about it...</li>
            <li>Smaller pores, much smoother skin.</li>
            <li>My bf let me go a little crazy on Amazon for my birthday, and I decided that I really wanted to start investing in better skincare during one of those annual panics when you realize how many candles are going to be on your cake this year but in no way want to look like you had earned them all.</li>
            <li>I feel a little sting right after I put it on, but it goes away in about 5 seconds.</li>
            <li>but this particular product I use EVERY single day after toning and before moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>pretty disappointed after reading all of the other great reviews.</li>
            <li>but I would absolutely buy this product from any other source if I couldn&#x27;t get it from a store.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and my skin has improved so much!</li>
            <li>The first few days of use were iffy..</li>
            <li>every product I&#x27;ve ever tried has caused dry itchy patches and/or made me breakout (some more manageably than others), but this stuff doesn&#x27;t - in fact, it seems to actually be clearing up in record time the clogged pores and blemishes caused by an unfortunate reaction to a new foundation I tried.</li>
            <li>When I smile, I see the same or even more lines.  :(  </li>
            <li>Strangely enough, I do not like the other products in the line as I have very sensitive skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> After reading so many great reviews on this product, i just knew it was too good to be true.</li>

            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This tightening effect is what I like most about the product.  </li>
            <li> It sure feels like it does though.      </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturize well for me as the description indicated, so i have to use a separate moisturizers over top of it</li>
            <li> This serum smells lovely without being overpowering</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky like many serums can be.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I bought this.</li>
            <li> Like it, don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> I recommend, you do more research before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I do know people that love this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products ranging from $5 to $150.</li>
            <li> The texture is not creamy and goes on with more</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product, it smells like carrot and orange juice mixed together, it has a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Did nothing, did some irritation though, but not as much as the Boots Protect &amp; perfect Intense Beauty Serum.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This would have to be the BEST value for money I have EVER spent on my skin....and trust me...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying it that way since (1 to 2 pumps, immediately after stepping out of the shower while my face is still wet) and my skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been after about 3 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;Almost</li>
            <li> I want to try other 40 Carrots products now, as the eye gel is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> However, the bottle I received is not serum, but a watery liquid that can&#x27;t easily be applied without spillage.  </li>
            <li> - it makes my skin look beautiful and glowing, and it is definitely smoother.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT for my normal type 65 year old skin.</li>
            <li> But works just fine for the cost.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I go to see if there are any bottles of this product available</li>
            <li> and I will buy ALL of this product that is available.  </li>
            <li> cause my skin looked so smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is really amazing, it has made my skin very clear and youthful.</li>
            <li> I run out and cannot get them on special from one of the department stores</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, fine lines are smoother, skin is firmer, and i have a more youthful glow!</li>
            <li> and I will definitely be buying more :)</li>
            <li> My order came quickly.</li>
            <li> I now feel much more confident leaving the house without makeup than I would&#x27;ve thought possible before.</li>
            <li> I am prone to breakouts and have some sun spots that I&#x27;m trying to tackle and on top of it all I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Really fab!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied, to actually find a product that does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t yet gotten used to the initial &#x27;sticky&#x27; feeling of the serum or tried to wear makeup over it, so I considered just skipping that step but loved the glow my skin was developing and didn&#x27;t want to derail any positive results.</li>
            <li> Nice very lightweight, but boy oh boy is it effective in firming and filling those starting to sag areas on my 60 year old combination skin!</li>
            <li> I hope the review will help you determine its worth to you.  </li>
            <li> Worth it</li>
            <li> Bought it originally because it was on sale but went out and bought the whole 40 Carrots line bacuse this product worked so well.  </li>
            <li> every morning (I applied it right before bed)</li>
            <li> I put it on right after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice until I took a super close look at my skin.</li>
            <li> I know I would like to continue using it and am interested in the rest of the line.</li>
            <li> No weird smell or taste.</li>
            <li> First off, I found this product at another discount department store for $5.99.</li>
            <li> In my haste to get ready, I rubbed the serum onto my freshly showered and still dripping face and let it dry/soak in while I went about brushing my teeth, etc.</li>
            <li> Went back to TJ&#x27;s and bought 3 more bottles and 4 bottles of the face wash.</li>
            <li> Tone, texture and balance have all noticeably improved and I&#x27;m being complimented on my skin for pretty much the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> Use the whole skin care line, cleanser and moisturizer and you&#x27;ll see a difference the first time you use them together.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s cheap enough.  </li>
            <li> so my skin isn&#x27;t very wrinkled</li>
            <li> Has never broken me out or made me red.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am of african origin with light skin,if this is any help to anyone.</li>
            <li> Within a week it starts to really get to work.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot(two pumps) to cover your face, it absorbs really well</li>
            <li> Apparently that was the secret because the serum soaked in beautifully with no stickiness or extra redness, just glowing healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product as a moisturizer because it mattifies my skin</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this serum from the reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> Did not notice any feeling of tightening or really any notice of it at all.  </li>
            <li> I have tried sooo many other products for the results I had gotten and for an over the counter treatment</li>
            <li> Better than any other serum I have used .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad especially if you want to use it alone before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> Although not purchased from amazon directly, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Not as high a persentage of C as in the high potency-</li>
            <li> high price products.</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe you can get this kind of value.</li>
            <li> am 55 years old and am VERY fussy about what goes on my skin.  </li>
            <li> With other products, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After about a week of daily use, I had plans arise unexpectedly and needed to be out the door quickly.</li>
            <li> 40 CARROTS is incredible!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a favorite and not easy to find.  </li>
            <li> and it was a little harsh but would be great as an additional antioxidant ingredient.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it and ordering a new one.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I now apply once every other day, and will continue to do so for the forsee able future.</li>
            <li> But when I first put it on, I could actually feel it working:</li>
            <li> You can buy 4 of these or more for the cost of other serums, and get the same results for spots and glow as this.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, and it not only seems to help fade dark spots (over time) but tightens up the skin a bit after you put it on.  </li>
            <li> plus is that it is not chalked full of silicones or the other nasties that find their way into products like this.</li>
            <li> I am getting  a few wrinkles and my pores are getting huge</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t so far reduced any wrinkles I might have</li>
            <li> So far it has made my skin feel moist and soft and seems to be filling in.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and looks firmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on sale at our local store and did not think much about it...</li>
            <li> Smaller pores, much smoother skin.</li>
            <li> My bf let me go a little crazy on Amazon for my birthday, and I decided that I really wanted to start investing in better skincare during one of those annual panics when you realize how many candles are going to be on your cake this year but in no way want to look like you had earned them all.</li>
            <li> I feel a little sting right after I put it on, but it goes away in about 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> but this particular product I use EVERY single day after toning and before moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> pretty disappointed after reading all of the other great reviews.</li>
            <li> but I would absolutely buy this product from any other source if I couldn&#x27;t get it from a store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my skin has improved so much!</li>
            <li> The first few days of use were iffy..</li>
            <li> every product I&#x27;ve ever tried has caused dry itchy patches and/or made me breakout (some more manageably than others), but this stuff doesn&#x27;t - in fact, it seems to actually be clearing up in record time the clogged pores and blemishes caused by an unfortunate reaction to a new foundation I tried.</li>
            <li> When I smile, I see the same or even more lines.  :(  </li>
            <li> Strangely enough, I do not like the other products in the line as I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> By the third or fourth day, my skin looked brighter and smoother and the dry appearance was normalizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had heard about this being a good vitamin/retinol serum for 20- and 30-something skin, so I was really excited to try it out (if skeptical because my skin is nearly impossible to please).</li>
            <li> the serum went on sticky in addition to making my skin look a bit dry and pink - though this extra color faded away within a few hours of each application and was not &#x27;angry&#x27; irritation.</li>
            <li> It also helped to clear the dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the usual Vit C serums that are very watery and runny in texture.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps keep my skin clear ( I don&#x27;t have problems with breakouts or pimples and such) or wrinkles as I don&#x27;t have those yet.</li>
            <li> The serum is in a clear bottle, that already indicates that it&#x27;s not a pure form of abscorbic acid since Vitamin C has to be stored in the dark to not oxidize.</li>
            <li> Been using this daily for 3 weeks under my eyes and on the side of my face to combat dark circles and spots.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see long term benefits but after a few weeks with this product</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this effect is actually tightening the wrinkles or is actually \\&quot;doing\\&quot; anything beneficial.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I just half pump and it is enough to cover my face.</li>
            <li> Bottle last a long while as the pump is small.</li>
            <li> Spent money on both of these for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I use it alone, not much difference in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I was recommended this product from a few different people.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be repurchasing in a few months when the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I do see some slight lightening of the dark spots on the side of my face, so i plan to continue to use the entire bottle</li>
            <li> and he is extremely fussy about what i use on my skin....</li>
            <li> I continued washing and moisturizing my face as usual with the serum being the only change in my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because of the price</li>
            <li> My face was oily in 2 hours, something that I never notice with that other product until 40 Carrots came along.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;dark mark&amp;#34; is nearly gone in 4 months, the same amount of time it would take with a really expensive</li>
            <li> I had a dark spot on my forehead because I got burnt without realizing it</li>
            <li> puffiness under eyes goes down, and the eyes brighten up.</li>
            <li> so I end up using less.</li>
            <li> I have less breakouts,</li>
            <li> In addition, it&#x27;s a little oily.  </li>
            <li> The bottle even lasted me a few months</li>
            <li> But my skin is really sensitive and products are expensive.</li>
            <li> This is too heavy for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break me out and had a very slight &amp;#34;orangy&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> You will waste a lot of product since it is hard to control the pump.    </li>
            <li> I was not sure</li>
            <li> A small amount after i wash my face goes all day.  </li>
            <li> , my face is an oil slick on</li>
            <li> The only reason I took off one star and possibly won&#x27;t repurchase is because the pump came broken and it was very difficult to use it.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed at the whole thing and is using argan oil now.  </li>
            <li> The verdict is still out, but so far, it hasn&#x27;t broken me out or anything bad.</li>
            <li> The smell is not good.</li>
            <li> The pump is poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> I have used all the expensive brands and none come close to the results i get from 40 carrots vitamin serum.  </li>
            <li> Seeings how this is an impossible task, trial and error will have to suffice!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This serum is perfect added to creams and lotions to give them a boost. I tried it alone and it was a little harsh but would be great as an additional antioxidant ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and bought this on mega sale at Marshalls, thinking for the price I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose.WOW! I have tried sooo many other products for the results I had gotten and for an over the counter treatment this one is amazing!!! No break outs and literally glowing skin every morning (I applied it right before bed) The mega plus is that it is not chalked full of silicones or the other nasties that find their way into products like this.The bottle even lasted me a few months and I will definitely be buying more :)</li>
            <li> I used this on my face and jawline for wrinkles and noticed no difference.  However, I had redness from a sunburn (2 yrs ago) on my jawline, neck &amp; chest.  I notice it clearing up on the jawline after using this product so I am now using on my neck and chest.  The redness from the burn is also clearing up.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a recommendation on an over 50s website.  It hasn&#x27;t so far reduced any wrinkles I might have but I have only been using it for 2 weeks. So far it has made my skin feel moist and soft and seems to be filling in. I will give it a bit longer but think it would be a product that I would definitely recommend purchasing expecially for such a reaosnable price!  Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I had all the 40 carrots products but this one so I purchased this one online because they didn&#x27;t have it at TJMax. In all fairness I never used it because 1 week into using the wash and moisturizer my face had tiny bumps everywhere and was itchy. I didn&#x27;t really notice until I took a super close look at my skin. I sent this product back. My husband uses it and has had no issues with it. I guess it&#x27;s not for everybody.</li>
            <li> Sounded so good so I gave it 6+ weeks try.  Did nothing, did some irritation though, but not as much as the Boots Protect &amp; perfect Intense Beauty Serum.  When I smile, I see the same or even more lines.  :(  Spent money on both of these for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 40 Carrots eye serum and it didn&#x27;t irritate, but not close to the rave reviews from Allure magazine.  I am disappointed at the whole thing and is using argan oil now.  I also ordered organic rose hips oil cuz of great reviews...who knows if it&#x27;ll help...</li>
            <li> I really like this product - it makes my skin look beautiful and glowing, and it is definitely smoother. It is very lightweight and is perfect under moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Every Time I put this serum on my face it feels so refreshing. It works great and sells for a more than reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Put it on before you moisturizer and eye cream</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this.  Bought it originally because it was on sale but went out and bought the whole 40 Carrots line bacuse this product worked so well.  It really makes my skin glow.  Combined with the facial wash its like a daily facial. Really fab!!</li>
            <li> love this stuff. This was a reorder</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. It has cleared up my skin and my pores are smaller. My skin looks brighter. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help with the overall texture of my skin.  I have been using it for about a month now.  I use it underneath my regular moisturizer.    Pros are:  I have noticed that it does help with minimizing my facial oil throughout the day.  It seems to tighten the face as soon as it dries.  This tightening effect is what I like most about the product.  I am not sure if this effect is actually tightening the wrinkles or is actually \\&quot;doing\\&quot; anything beneficial.  It sure feels like it does though.      Cons are:  No sunblock benefits in it.  You will have to use a moisturizer with spf over it.  The pump is poorly designed.  You will waste a lot of product since it is hard to control the pump.    I hope the review will help you determine its worth to you.  I think it&#x27;s cheap enough.  You should give it a try.</li>
            <li> Been using this daily for 3 weeks under my eyes and on the side of my face to combat dark circles and spots.  It doesn&#x27;t moisturize well for me as the description indicated, so i have to use a separate moisturizers over top of it but that&#x27;s not a problem at all.  I do see some slight lightening of the dark spots on the side of my face, so i plan to continue to use the entire bottle</li>
            <li> Nice very lightweight, but boy oh boy is it effective in firming and filling those starting to sag areas on my 60 year old combination skin!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin from this serum...pretty disappointed after reading all of the other great reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale wanting to try it for my oily, 40+ skin.  I am prone to breakouts and have some sun spots that I&#x27;m trying to tackle and on top of it all I have VERY sensitive skin. This serum smells lovely without being overpowering I often wear it in place of a regular moisturizing lotion during the day.  It&#x27;s not sticky like many serums can be.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see long term benefits but after a few weeks with this product I know I would like to continue using it and am interested in the rest of the line.</li>
            <li> My skin loves it!  Use the whole skin care line, cleanser and moisturizer and you&#x27;ll see a difference the first time you use them together.</li>
            <li> I like it and use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of beauty serums, lotions, creams etc... I was not sure bc I had never used one like this before.  After night 2 I swore to never go without it.  My pores are smaller, my skin is brighter and smoother!  I am so glad that I bought this. I am 43 and part japanese so my skin isn&#x27;t very wrinkled but this makes my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li> I use it with my &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; products.  Like it, don&#x27;t love it.  If I use it alone, not much difference in my skin tone.  With other products, it&#x27;s fine.  Therefore, I think it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; products that make the difference in my skin tone.  It&#x27;s not bad especially if you want to use it alone before going to bed.  Sleep on that!</li>
            <li> Have used it for over three years. Makes my skin radiate, softer, texture smoother,and smooths pores. Not sure if it helps keep my skin clear ( I don&#x27;t have problems with breakouts or pimples and such) or wrinkles as I don&#x27;t have those yet. No weird smell or taste. Bottle last a long while as the pump is small. Sometimes I just half pump and it is enough to cover my face. I can apply it day or night with no irritation. Doesn&#x27;t change the lay of my makeup when I wear it during the day. Has never broken me out or made me red.&lt;br /&gt;On par with Lancôme skin care products ( which I use also). I ran out of my Lancôme, found this, and this,40 carrots, did it&#x27;s jobs for a year.  Worth it</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s just say I ordered two bottles at a time, and the 2nd bottle has just been sitting in my bathroom cabinet. Not too happy about un-natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product from a few different people. First off, I found this product at another discount department store for $5.99. I found this, after the fact. To my dismay, this product was not beneficial to my skin type. In a perfect world, it would be nice to be informed of ALL the side effects, for every skin type. Seeings how this is an impossible task, trial and error will have to suffice! If you have sensitive skin, this product is not for you. I recommend, you do more research before purchasing this product. I do know people that love this product. Again, it is not for everybody!</li>
            <li> I also bought this product at T J Max for $5.99 a couple of years ago.  I have NEVER looked back.  EVERY time I go to Marshals, Ross or T J Max I go to see if there are any bottles of this product available and I will buy ALL of this product that is available.  Strangely enough, I do not like the other products in the line as I have very sensitive skin and I have issues with them but this particular product I use EVERY single day after toning and before moisturizing.  There is something about the lovely feel it gives my face after I have used it and the ingredients are very good.  My husband who is always googling everything!!! checked out the list of ingredients and he is extremely fussy about what i use on my skin....this product was given the thumbs up by him and I have never looked back!&lt;br /&gt;I always have 2 or 3 bottles hanging around just in case I run out and cannot get them on special from one of the department stores but I would absolutely buy this product from any other source if I couldn&#x27;t get it from a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 55 years old and am VERY fussy about what goes on my skin.  This is the ONLY product I have EVER written a review on....so I guess that tells you how impressed I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would have to be the BEST value for money I have EVER spent on my skin....and trust me...I have tried many products ranging from $5 to $150.</li>
            <li> Great as always!!!!  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I use this before I apply my moisturizer since it doesnt have spf as well as at night before I go to bed. This product is really amazing, it has made my skin very clear and youthful. It also helped to clear the dark circles around my eyes. I am of african origin with light skin,if this is any help to anyone.</li>
            <li> Although not purchased from amazon directly, I highly recommend this product.  I work a stressful job and have watched as my skin ages 10 fold.  I found this product a year ago.. suffice to say, I wish I had a before and after picture. Within a week it starts to really get to work.  I now apply once every other day, and will continue to do so for the forsee able future.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I would  definitely  recommend this to anyone wanting a smoother appearance. After 3 days you can tell a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My skin is so soft and looks firmer. My order came quickly. I will order this again!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on sale at our local store and did not think much about it... But when I first put it on, I could actually feel it working: puffiness under eyes goes down, and the eyes brighten up. It is very light in consistency, and non-greasy. I feel a little sting right after I put it on, but it goes away in about 5 seconds. I want to try other 40 Carrots products now, as the eye gel is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Best serum on the market. Truly shrinks pores and works well under lotion.</li>
            <li> 40 CARROTS is incredible!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a favorite and not easy to find.  Grab it when you see it, and enjoy the effectiveness of a good moisture.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30s and worship the sun.  My skin tends to be more oily so its difficult to find skin care that doesnt leave me looking like a grease pan by the end of the day.  I am getting  a few wrinkles and my pores are getting huge so i needed something for that. This product is so awesome.  It gives my skin such a glow. A small amount after i wash my face goes all day.  I have used all the expensive brands and none come close to the results i get from 40 carrots vitamin serum.  I used it for awhile then I ran out and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I looked on amazon my shopping addiction enabler and here it was.  Buy it you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> Better than any other serum I have used . It is hard to believe you can get this kind of value. Do not be deterred because of the low cost. EXCELLENT for my normal type 65 year old skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I had a dark spot on my forehead because I got burnt without realizing it (the ONE day I didn&#x27;t wear sunscreen!) and I have been using this religousily in the morning and before bed. I put it on right after I get out of the shower so I end up using less. My &amp;#34;dark mark&amp;#34; is nearly gone in 4 months, the same amount of time it would take with a really expensive serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know about retinols and antioxidants, having worked in a high-end cosmetic store. But my skin is really sensitive and products are expensive. You can buy 4 of these or more for the cost of other serums, and get the same results for spots and glow as this. It smells SO good, like oranges and happiness, and my husband always complements how good I smell after I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it because it works well and is affordable.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Vit C serum and bought this because it had the highest rating on Amazon. The serum is gel like and not watery so it&#x27;s very easy to evenly apply all over. I don&#x27;t like the usual Vit C serums that are very watery and runny in texture. It didn&#x27;t break me out and had a very slight &amp;#34;orangy&amp;#34; smell. The only reason I took off one star and possibly won&#x27;t repurchase is because the pump came broken and it was very difficult to use it. I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it and ordering a new one.</li>
            <li> After reading so many great reviews on this product, i just knew it was too good to be true. I finally tried this serum, and now i tell everyone i know about it. It is amazing! I saw results after 5days, i couldn&#x27;t believe how well it works. I use it everyday and my skin has improved so much! I&#x27;ve never seen something that repairs, restores and heals your skin in damaged areas like this serum. My pores are smaller, fine lines are smoother, skin is firmer, and i have a more youthful glow! I could see my pores before i started using this product, i don&#x27;t even notice them now. I have less breakouts, even when i do have one or two they heal faster. You don&#x27;t need a lot(two pumps) to cover your face, it absorbs really well, it&#x27;s not greasy. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied, to actually find a product that does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Nice for the price. Not as high a persentage of C as in the high potency- high price products. But works just fine for the cost.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best skin products I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t use foundation anymore because there is no need. My skin is luminous! I&#x27;ve been using the serum with an aloe Vera gel instead of moisturizer....an amazing combo!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice any difference. The serum is in a clear bottle, that already indicates that it&#x27;s not a pure form of abscorbic acid since Vitamin C has to be stored in the dark to not oxidize.</li>
            <li> My bf let me go a little crazy on Amazon for my birthday, and I decided that I really wanted to start investing in better skincare during one of those annual panics when you realize how many candles are going to be on your cake this year but in no way want to look like you had earned them all. I had heard about this being a good vitamin/retinol serum for 20- and 30-something skin, so I was really excited to try it out (if skeptical because my skin is nearly impossible to please). The first few days of use were iffy.. the serum went on sticky in addition to making my skin look a bit dry and pink - though this extra color faded away within a few hours of each application and was not &#x27;angry&#x27; irritation. I continued washing and moisturizing my face as usual with the serum being the only change in my skincare regimen. By the third or fourth day, my skin looked brighter and smoother and the dry appearance was normalizing.&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of daily use, I had plans arise unexpectedly and needed to be out the door quickly. I hadn&#x27;t yet gotten used to the initial &#x27;sticky&#x27; feeling of the serum or tried to wear makeup over it, so I considered just skipping that step but loved the glow my skin was developing and didn&#x27;t want to derail any positive results. In my haste to get ready, I rubbed the serum onto my freshly showered and still dripping face and let it dry/soak in while I went about brushing my teeth, etc. Apparently that was the secret because the serum soaked in beautifully with no stickiness or extra redness, just glowing healthy skin. I&#x27;ve been applying it that way since (1 to 2 pumps, immediately after stepping out of the shower while my face is still wet) and my skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been after about 3 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;Almost every product I&#x27;ve ever tried has caused dry itchy patches and/or made me breakout (some more manageably than others), but this stuff doesn&#x27;t - in fact, it seems to actually be clearing up in record time the clogged pores and blemishes caused by an unfortunate reaction to a new foundation I tried. Tone, texture and balance have all noticeably improved and I&#x27;m being complimented on my skin for pretty much the first time in my life. I now feel much more confident leaving the house without makeup than I would&#x27;ve thought possible before. Will definitely be repurchasing in a few months when the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, and it not only seems to help fade dark spots (over time) but tightens up the skin a bit after you put it on.  I notice my skin does not look as good on the days I&#x27;ve skipped it.  I checked out the list of ingredients and they are all very good.  Great service all the way around from seller.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for two days.  The verdict is still out, but so far, it hasn&#x27;t broken me out or anything bad.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product, it smells like carrot and orange juice mixed together, it has a very pleasant scent. I really like this product as a moisturizer because it mattifies my skin, my face is an oil slick on it&#x27;s own. At first I was skeptical because of the price so I tried another product that claimed to mattify my skin. My face was oily in 2 hours, something that I never notice with that other product until 40 Carrots came along. I wake up to glowing skin and I have used it in the daytime with spf and my face is still not shiny, I&#x27;m def hooked for life!</li>
            <li> This is not greasy at all.  It smells good and it feels good.  I&#x27;ve tried several different brands recently and I like 40 Carrots and Acure best.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this serum from the reviews I read.  However, the bottle I received is not serum, but a watery liquid that can&#x27;t easily be applied without spillage.  I expect a serum to have some substance for application and to stay in place.  In addition, it&#x27;s a little oily.  I tried it three days in a row.  Did not notice any feeling of tightening or really any notice of it at all.  Maybe I got a bum bottle, but I will go back to my Olay Regenerist.</li>
            <li> The smell is not good. The texture is not creamy and goes on with more difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;It does sort of tighten but nothing great. It is just Okay!</li>
            <li> Really a great serum for the price. Im 42 &amp; a reformed tanner...lots of repair to do...this product didnt irritate my skin, smells nice, seems to tighten &amp; brighten...worth the $$</li>
            <li> This is too heavy for my oily skin. I cut it with distilled water and vitamin C powder, or add it to my oil-free moisturizer. Will not re-order.</li>
            <li> Found this product at TJ Maxx for $5.99 and thought, \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot;. OMG, it&#x27;s amazing! Smaller pores, much smoother skin. Thought maybe it was wishful thinking on my part until a friend asked me if I had gotten a micro-derm processes or something cause my skin looked so smooth. Went back to TJ&#x27;s and bought 3 more bottles and 4 bottles of the face wash. (I gave my friend a bottle of the serum and she&#x27;s now a big fan, too.)</li>
