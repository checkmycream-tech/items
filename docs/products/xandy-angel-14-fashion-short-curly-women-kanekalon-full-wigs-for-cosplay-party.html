            <li>/&gt;You could probably make it look good if you style it correctly or use a hat.</li>

            <li>Still looks awesome and does not shed much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say for the price, it is nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful but wig cap inside is super</li>

            <li>Well worth the wait!!!</li>
            <li>This is my first wig, as ive been buying and selling hair extensions for years I decided to buy this, very good even for beginners.</li>
            <li>The wig arrived very quickly and is good quality.</li>
            <li>Very Beautiful and Soft!</li>
            <li>All in all, very great quality for a cheap price and super cute caramel brown colour.</li>
            <li>Awesome wig loved it looks super real</li>
            <li>I loved the color and the texture and the length was just my fit.</li>
            <li>the way: a beanie looks amazing with it :3</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to wear it out here and there.&lt;br /&gt;Comes like shown so this item is not a waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;The item also arrives before the date as well. :D</li>
            <li>The top scalp part looks really nice.</li>
            <li>No trace of warm healthy brown.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best quality wig I&#x27;ve gotten so far.</li>
            <li>I actually love the color and the texture is amazing</li>

            <li>I liked this wig for the most part..</li>

            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice and soft, easy to brush and fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily the wig was fine, wrapped in plastic and netting, X&amp;Y tag of authentication was there too!</li>
            <li>The wig is beautiful and soft, however, the light brown doesn&#x27;t look good with my skin tone (I&#x27;m more of an olive skin tone)</li>
            <li>It is so comfortable!</li>
            <li>My wig was shipped on October 19 and arrived on November 1 which was great and fast.</li>
            <li>I think it looks better if u wear a beanie</li>
            <li>i love</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the wig I received.</li>
            <li>This was a cheap wig so you can&#x27;t expect something amazing bur</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a costume wig.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite wigs.</li>
            <li>This wig was great, packaged very well.</li>
            <li>and I am glad to have bought it.</li>
            <li>it is better quality than wigs that I spend about 100 dollars on.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>, now just gotta figure out how to lighten it. :)</li>
            <li>Since there is no &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; part, you won&#x27;t be able to part it however</li>
            <li>The wig is not as shiny as most.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cute, and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments.  </li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>The colors were like the picture but the brown on the top was off .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with this wig.</li>
            <li>I think it is so cute anyways</li>
            <li>Love the wig for the price though.</li>
            <li>Really cute rocknroll look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the wig is incredible soft.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the wig.</li>
            <li>Cute to wear for cosplay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I look at customer photos, and the look nothing like what I received, they look better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not TERRIBLE, but it&#x27;s not the quality I was looking for.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s going to be ok  for halloween</li>
            <li>Cute Wig</li>
            <li>better quality</li>
            <li>I think it was ok.</li>
            <li>The top is kinda purple.&lt;br /&gt;Bad.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and the colors... arrived on time..getting lots of compliments...</li>
            <li>I got soo many compliments</li>
            <li>That I really love and appreciate.</li>
            <li>Just make sure if youre in photos, the flash is off</li>
            <li>You can see the wig lace on top...</li>
            <li>But I plan to wear with my beanie cap so it will be ok.</li>
            <li>The color on top wasn&#x27;t brown</li>
            <li>I still love the wig.</li>
            <li>I bought better wigs for 10 dollars than this.</li>
            <li>its cute for pictures but could not wear it out.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wig.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>all together then you can get matching extensions to wear under the wig and it will be fuller except at the top.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the hair &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>It is a much more drastic look.</li>
            <li>The top beige color is more pink-ish than the picture shows though.</li>
            <li>Still, 10/10 cute wig.</li>
            <li>Would buy more.</li>
            <li>better with a Hat.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this wig.</li>
            <li>Much better than I had anticipated for the price.</li>
            <li>It looks better with a beanie anyways.</li>
            <li>but it is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Company responded quick to an issue and I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>Wig fits very well, and looks very nice.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and it is very soft.</li>
            <li>looks a tad different from the picture color wise but beyond that its really nice!</li>
            <li>Super soft and cute, perfect colors</li>
            <li>I think it looks super cute!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m ok with it because I found it was easy to make a lovely side-part/side-sweep bang</li>
            <li>And for this price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty good wig.</li>
            <li>all in all a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I am in love with it and it is easy to work with.</li>
            <li>love its hair style, but the hair comes too easily.</li>
            <li>come in way earlier than suggest arrival, feels secure around the head, color is just like the picture very pleased with purchase!!!</li>
            <li>Still is beautiful quality; soft and easy to style</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a very nice wig and for the price and amazing reviews and pictures</li>
            <li>and I am super excited!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the wig would have been beautiful if I had only received it.</li>
            <li>Although it does have a habit of becoming tangled if it comes in contact with any type of cloth.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE that it has an attachment for around your head to secure it on...</li>
            <li>It is a cheap wig after all!a cheap wig after all!  </li>
            <li>i will say it is ok for $9 bucks and free shipping.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t really look good without a beanie fyi.</li>
            <li>I was SO looking forward to this wig, the wig pictures above is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Not bad for a starter wig, however!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the color I was expecting and it tangled easily</li>
            <li>You can easily cut them to suit your face, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li>but you easily fix that with a hat.</li>
            <li>Falls out soooooo easily..</li>
            <li>tangles easy and falls apart after brushing</li>
            <li>I love how it looks kind of real</li>
            <li>Tangles easily, sheds a lot, and the bangs are In need of styling.</li>
            <li>All of the wigs I get from them are gorgeous and high</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>other than that, I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually an amazing wig first time I buy one and was amaze.</li>
            <li>Soft to touch and looks nice with hat !</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t Shed and its soft and really nice!</li>
            <li>I have a fairly chubby face and kind of a big head, so I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>but hey, what else is fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute</li>
            <li>Super cute wig.</li>
            <li>Super cute wig.</li>
            <li>I look super duper cute like an anime character.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still super cute.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous, and very very soft.  </li>
            <li>and whats even better is that it is super soft even better then my own hair</li>
            <li>Very pretty!</li>
            <li>but it never fails to have another one! :)</li>
            <li>I was just lucky enough to get a good one!</li>
            <li>but it was cheap</li>
            <li>This wig is so smooth and not a hassle to style at all.</li>
            <li>It fit my head, even though there is a adjustable strap band.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>It looks like a cheap halloween wig.</li>
            <li>I had to cut the bangs some because it just didnt fit my head well, also without a hat on or some band you can see bald spots.</li>
            <li>And I can&#x27;t bother with returns on cheap items.</li>
            <li>Then you should be happy with the price and quality because you only plan to wear it a time or</li>
            <li>It is light pink.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Outside so hair don&#x27;t fly away an get tangled</li>
            <li>Definetly trick of light.</li>
            <li>too comfortable</li>
            <li>and it looks even more real than before:)</li>
            <li>To be honest, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I love it anyway</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wig color and design is completely right</li>
            <li>Just brush it right, and you won&#x27;t be able to move the hair around without the cap showing.</li>
            <li>thanks will order again!!!</li>
            <li>Fit was comfortable and looked real! :)</li>
            <li>Bangs Are Gorgeous, Easily Stylish, And Long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft, and is a good amount of hair.</li>
            <li>the colors were pretty accurate!</li>
            <li>I still wish it were exactly like the photo, but I love the wig and wear it often.</li>
            <li>I completely LOVE this wig, it&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever boughten.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I love this wigs sooo much!</li>
            <li>Low price is nice, though!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging could be better because the boxing it came in was pretty mashed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly more pink on top than pictured but it&#x27;s still really amazing.</li>
            <li>so I could use it when my original wears out.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is a really fun wig!</li>
            <li>Fun!</li>
            <li>but i ended up purchasing the wig because it seemed like there was more positive feedback.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a honey brown color than a dark brown color, and the ombré looks a biiiit tacky, but it&#x27;s nice and lovely for the price.</li>
            <li>I am a frequent X&amp;Y Angel buyer, their wigs are amazing, they fit my head, arrive quickly, and come in a box.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just the right length!</li>
            <li>, the wigs sold at the dollar store look way more decent!  </li>
            <li>Although, the wig is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I personally just don&#x27;t look good in brown hair</li>
            <li>The top of it isn&#x27;t really brown</li>
            <li>The color is true to the picture.</li>
            <li>Someone did suggest that this listing may be a knock-off of the true X&amp;Y Angel wig.</li>
            <li>but I thought that was cool.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>The wig cap it came with is really crappy and ripped on a bobby pin ;A; I will be buying better wig caps.</li>
            <li>The top part is more pink than pictured, but I&#x27;m more than content about that.</li>
            <li>however not styled (since it isn&#x27;t straight at the top but rather wavy?)</li>
            <li>Over all its not bad.</li>
            <li>Such a lovely wig and so easy to maintain!</li>
            <li>I love love and recommend to everyone who wants a realistic wig.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the colour is vibrant which is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Other then that the hair looks great.</li>
            <li>Great for your model to wear for photography or any other occasion</li>
            <li>He wasn&#x27;t convinced until he had to lift up &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; hair to see that it really wasn&#x27;t my own haha &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I found the blonde had a bit more strawberry in it and looked more of a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I look super kawaii in it.</li>
            <li>Great for Halloween and maybe daily wear, if you fix the intense shine.</li>
            <li>I received a lot of compliments for how realistic this wig looked!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.  </li>
            <li>It was my very first wig EVER</li>
            <li>The wig is very pretty</li>
            <li>I think the wig sheds a bit too much, more than normal wigs.</li>
            <li>The bangs are extremely long which is good because you can cut them how you like</li>
            <li>Otherwise the quality is great and the length allowed me to trim it down to the correct style I wanted.</li>
            <li>After I washed it and sprayed with dry shampoo, looked so natural that many of my friends said they liked how I dyed my hair!</li>
            <li>Super cute and feels so soft!</li>
            <li>I am not sure how many times I could wear it, but good quality as comparing to its price</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li>Overall, stunning wig!</li>
            <li>It is a very good deal for the price and overall is a very soft wig and feels pretty good compared to some other cheaper wigs.</li>
            <li>It looks great in pictures and at night I&#x27;m sure it would be fine to go out in, but in the daytime I think it would look a bit too thin (though it&#x27;s not the thinnest out there, still has plenty of volume but could definitely use more).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>This wig isn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But this wig just makes me smile.</li>
            <li>So I say be careful, as not everyone would look good in this wig.</li>
            <li>and it came very quickly overall its a nice product for anyone who likes to cosplay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun costume wig but</li>
            <li>For under $10 it is a nice enough wig that you&#x27;d expect for the price</li>
            <li>Mine was pretty true to the color on here.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and not too shiny but the netting shows through at the top.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s definitely worth it...</li>
            <li>Worth the wait.</li>
            <li>The colors are definitely darker than in the picture, but it was a nice color still, so I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li>All in all, completely worth the price</li>
            <li>It sheds quite a bit (totally normal for this price range) and tangles fairly easily</li>
            <li>Originally, I bought this wig on September 3rd, and it was supposed to be here by October 16th at the latest.</li>
            <li>That color was actually quick pretty</li>
            <li>Fits well and looks realistic, also the shipping was really quick!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t style it just right the wig cap will show.</li>
            <li>not shiny, not fake looking, smooth, and looks real.</li>
            <li>The net shows a bit in the back, but the hair itself is beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is my first wig and came in 20 days which is pretty quick</li>
            <li>It is very full and soft.</li>
            <li>Very very soft wig, natural shine, fits nicely (On the biggest, and smallest heads)</li>
            <li>But the pink was like a brownish pink at the top, i&#x27;m still happy with the way it looks.</li>
            <li>Its more pink than brown at the top unlike the picture wheresvits really brown</li>
            <li>It looks pretty but the gradient effect isn&#x27;t very prominent because the colors don&#x27;t really look that different.</li>
            <li>Wear the bangs swept to the side because they&#x27;re pretty long but good if you want to trim them/make them straight across.</li>
            <li>Other than all of that, it&#x27;s a pretty good wig.</li>
            <li>Looks very realistic and not too shiny!</li>
            <li>Love love love it especially because its so easy to style and doesn&#x27;t tangle to much :) I want one with blue ot green tips now</li>
            <li>This wig is my least favorite wig I own now.</li>
            <li>but hair does fall out quickly and tangles fast.</li>
            <li>The top color is a nice brownish blonde but the pink is a bright almost-neon pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and it feels the most realistic of all my wigs.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>First of all this wig came in super fast.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look anything like picture very very displeased</li>
            <li>The wig is a bit thin but for 12$ and free shipping it was an amazing deal for such a good quality, lower end wig.</li>
            <li>The picture is very, very deceiving.  </li>
            <li>(and how it doesn&#x27;t wash out my complexion *too much*)!</li>
            <li>It feels very soft, is comfortable to wear, and overall pretty cute.</li>
            <li>Hair Wigs Pink MJ051-1) is amazing .</li>
            <li>I received my order on time, and the wig is pretty, but doesn&#x27;t look like what I thought it would look like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I brushed the wig with a brush not meant for the wig, the hairs started falling out, but otherwise it&#x27;s a cute wig.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li>Pretty colors.</li>
            <li>Even though it didn&#x27;t look exactly like it in the picture, I was still quite</li>
            <li>HOW REAL IT LOOKS!</li>
            <li>had they added some more hair to the back.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see it in my mail box 3 weeks early!  </li>
            <li>I still highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>The pink on the bottom is nice.</li>
            <li>Pretty disappinted.</li>
            <li>the only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars is because I had some problems the first time I ordered and after more than a month of waiting I hadn&#x27;t recieved my wig.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just so cute, would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li>Thanks for this wig!</li>
            <li>Totally cute wig though color is different.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>This wig is not blonde at the top as shown.</li>
            <li>The pink is nicely blended into the brown.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>one of my favorites, if only it could stay on better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute if you&#x27;re looking for a strawberry blonde wig</li>
            <li>Color not blonde but still way adorable.</li>
            <li>It looks cute without a hat but definitely cuter with one.</li>
            <li>The gradient isn&#x27;t reallly that much of a gradient, it&#x27;s a pretty distinct color change.</li>
            <li>A lot of people complimented me thinking this was my real hair!</li>
            <li>YOu&#x27;d have to have someone check the back of it just to make sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing it out for the first time tomorrow</li>
            <li>and I got exactly what I thought I would.</li>
            <li>The blond and pink are both more bold which caught me by surprise, but it grew on me.</li>
            <li>u can actually see the camp underneath in certain parts on the top.</li>
            <li>I own 8 other wigs from having a shaved head for years, and can&#x27;t wait to get them off.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had as lot of experience shedding which is good (because my last one was around the same price</li>
            <li>the wig loses hair easily and the hair net isn&#x27;t very nice at all.</li>
            <li>The hair net can be seen pretty easily.</li>
            <li>So this wig had a lot of positive reviews</li>
            <li>, If you brush it you will have a few hairs fall out, but it&#x27;s still very cute and for the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay length, not too long or too</li>
            <li>but other than that this wig is amazing and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I notified the company and they promptly sent me another wig (their costumer service is awesome, they&#x27;re really fast) but the replacement wig turned out to be exactly the same, so I&#x27;m a bit confused, maybe I do have the right wig?</li>
            <li>The top is more of a dusty rose color, fading gradually to a bubblegum pastel pink at the bottom.</li>
            <li>A fun change for a costume or temporary trial of new hair.  </li>
            <li>I will still use this wig, but it doesn&#x27;t look very realistic.</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a shine towards the top that dry shampoo took care of.</li>
            <li>It was thick an full which was nice and didn&#x27;t really shed much.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it looks pretty cute.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting, it&#x27;s still a decent wig.</li>
            <li>Came on time and very high quality</li>
            <li>It is a little more pink than I thought but still looks nice.</li>
            <li>Either way it&#x27;s an awesome wig, the fade is really natural looking with lots of multicolored streaks in it to keep it from looking really fake.</li>
            <li>I honestly feel like the bad out ways the good.</li>
            <li>Very close to the texture of my real hair.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t look like the picture-</li>
            <li>I really lije it</li>
            <li>and people always think it&#x27;s my real hair.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t expect much based on the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a lot of work just to maintain the wig, you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>If you really /really/ want it for the color</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really tangle or anything.</li>
            <li>Looks absolute NOTHING like the picture and the wigs worn in reviews.</li>
            <li>Much darker than pictured.</li>
            <li>The only thing I could criticize this wig, the colors, the image it shows much light brown color.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Hahaha....</li>
            <li>I like it much more than expected.</li>
            <li>but it didnt help much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s straight quality.</li>
            <li>Just like real hair.</li>
            <li>You cant really tell from the pictures on here</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTE LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;I made a video on this wig.</li>
            <li>and I really made a god decision.</li>
            <li>really well I put the extension on before I put the wig cap on and then the wig itself.</li>
            <li>but i comb mine very often.</li>
            <li>I am throwing it straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>The wig was much thinner than I was hoping.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really look like the images.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Its to pink on top</li>
            <li>At the price paid I was not expecting much, and should&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li>The color is a bit off from the photos, the brown color doesn&#x27;t show much, but I don&#x27;t have any issues with that.</li>
            <li>I gave this four stars because I still really like the style and the color despite it not being what it looks like in the image.</li>
            <li>I like the colors and it looks so real</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s says it is or looks like it is its wayyyy more pink</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;real scalp\\&quot; section of the wig cap does look like a scalp.    </li>
            <li>Delivered faster than expected, quality is OK</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a cheap wig) but the look is the same as pictures.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually one of my favorite wigs (from amazon) so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this model X&amp;Y Angel pink and brown wig a couple years ago for $25 or $30 and it is one of my absolute favorite wigs ever.</li>
            <li>I own a lot of wigs, and as a heavy cosplayer I know my wigs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pro</li>
            <li>Good quality and shipped earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>It very nice, the only thing is that it sheds a little bit.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this wig because it got gross pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I will attach pictures of my original real wig side by side with the one I just recieved, the X&amp;Y is on the left.</li>
            <li>I love the wig though it is not exactly as it described.</li>
            <li>but not consistent and some are better than others.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more orange-y to a normal pink.</li>
            <li>I really like this wig except that it&#x27;s not thick but not thin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, easy to untangle and heat resistant so you can style it different ways.</li>
            <li>Also this isnt a huge problem but the bangs were long, so I had to trim it a bit.</li>
            <li>** pink on top and light pink on bottom.</li>
            <li>The original was thick enough that no wefts were showing and nicely blended (it even has pink hair blended into the brown hair) and transitioned very nicely from brown to pink, this one is just shorter light brown hair with longer pink hair underneath.</li>
            <li>but the brown came in as a more pale brown with more pink scattered around.</li>
            <li>usually love X&amp;Y Angels wigs, but this was a let down.</li>
            <li>The wig came really early, aboub 2 or 3 weeks earlier than listed, the colors are super pretty</li>
            <li>The bottom wAs a bright pink not cotton candy pink.</li>
            <li>but I love the wig none the less.</li>
            <li>looks realistic</li>
            <li>It looks so realistic</li>
            <li>It fits decently.</li>
            <li>The brown up top is highlighted with the pink so the ombre blends seamlessly.</li>
            <li>The pink is a VERY bright pink, not a soft pastel color at all.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Its very soft, and no one can really tell its a wig.</li>
            <li>wig fits my head comfortably, and is very long!</li>
            <li>for those wondering about HEAT RESISTANCE - in my attempt to blend the strawberry whatever color to the pink by curling (as you can see in my photo), curls just fine</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not very thin.</li>
            <li>It came to me as a faded purple and the light pink on the tips.</li>
            <li>but it is true to ots color its really long on me witch</li>
            <li>I recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something fun occasionally.</li>
            <li>The shipping was kind of slow</li>
            <li>My wig came on November 30th which was fast because estimated arrival was the 10th-20th December.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a wig to wear with a hat the top is thin so if not styled right</li>
            <li>Thirdly, the wig is super soft and does not tangle for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft And easily brushed.</li>
            <li>I bought the other color and liked it so much I had to try the pink.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal for new wigs.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this item, and when i open the package it was so smooth and soft, but after a day of wearing it, it got very frizzy, tangle, and snarled.</li>
            <li>It ended up looking like a light pink wig rather than the two shades described in the picture or description (its not two toned!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not X&amp;Y but it&#x27;s not a  bad wig, it&#x27;s kind of thin, but the net doesn&#x27;t show through the hair.</li>
            <li>I have to buy a new one because of it..</li>
            <li>They id respond and apologized, saying they would send a new one.</li>
            <li>Bought this on New Years, just got it yesterday.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s kind of ridiculous)</li>
            <li>Blonde on top and pink on bottom</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and not too shiny (meaning, could be made more matte with dry shampoo or such if desired, should be no problem).</li>
            <li>It is simply a cheaper wig with pink on the bottom and brown on the top.</li>
            <li>but if you are expecting a real quality wig do not waste your money on this one, unless you are buying directly from the manufacture (as it states in the description.).</li>
            <li>I wanted to order a light colored wig to see how well it went with my completion, might order a blond or a red wig next to see.</li>
            <li>It is confortable and it looks very natural, it also moves so natural!</li>
            <li>I was hoping the color would match what was advertised but not worth the hassle of returning, since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>First the hair are shorter, second there is two purple strand in the front.</li>
            <li>I have recently developed an obsession to wigs and want to play around wih them!</li>
            <li>The wig itself is small fitting around the head.</li>
            <li>It was cheap, so i will keep, not worth the return.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ombre pink, Light pink on top then darker pink as it descends.</li>
            <li>I contacted them and they quickly fixed the problem and mailed me a new one.</li>
            <li>The bangs r long enough to trim to fit my face.</li>
            <li>it turns from light pink to hot pink.</li>
            <li>Sheds easily, so must be brushed carefully from bottom-</li>
            <li>The cap fits pretty well, is a little tiny, but not much, and i have to make sure to keep all my hair covered which just means i need to put a little bit more effort in.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that I was hoping for the paler pink, but ended up with more of a hot pink.</li>
            <li>but mine is dark pink on top and light pink on the bottom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very realistic shade (especially since it&#x27;s not TOO SHINY!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me sweat or itch:) It does shed a little but not enough to care.</li>
            <li>Although on the thin side its amazing .</li>
            <li>It turned out to be an obnoxious pink which I&#x27;m ok with since I like pink and don&#x27;t mind unnatural hair colors, but THE BROWNNN WHERE ART THOU??</li>
            <li>the top looks about 30% brown and 70% pink, and the bottom is neon pink.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of my skin color or the lighting, but most of my photos came out as an all pink wig rather than a brown into pink.</li>
            <li>Also, the light brown/dark blonde in the picture almost looks completely pink and it looks like it&#x27;s just one color.</li>
            <li>Strawberry blonde doesn&#x27;t flatter my complexion and really feel it should be advertised</li>
            <li>Its so soft feeling even after a year.</li>
            <li>It looks really natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay - fun for short use, but really thin, and looks &#x27;wig-like&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural thinness.</li>
            <li>It arrived so early, I had a surprise moment for myself because I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when I received it in the mail, the hair colors were actually much darker and varied in different lighting.</li>
            <li>Came early.</li>
            <li>I had been getting some of my orders early and was hoping one of the wigs I ordered would come today</li>
            <li>Soft and the colors match the description.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li>So I was happily surprised when I got home from school.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was more pink than anything and the blonde and pink on the top are mixed making it look like and pink shaded ombre.</li>
            <li>arrived far faster</li>
            <li>But It&#x27;s Soft,</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m turning 27! haha</li>
            <li>(but I skip the talc step cus it makes the wig look kind of weird in my opinion) but really any of the tutorials that use fabric softener are good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is exciting and fun and thick.</li>
            <li>wig is thin but it has some good coverage, especially at the bangs.</li>
            <li>but it IS kind of thin, so if that is like a thing for you...</li>
            <li>Bangs are super long, which is par for the course with wigs (you can see just how far back I had to position the wig in one of the pics).</li>
            <li>This wig (X&amp;Y ANGEL New Two Tone Long Straight Highlights</li>
            <li>I DID go with one of the *slightly more expensive* purchase options because you get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li>The hair is pretty thin and falls off when I lightly brush it, but I still like it</li>
            <li>When I recieved this I was shocked with how beautiful and soft it was.</li>
            <li>i was expecting blonde with a light pink ombre the whole wig is pink with some blond in the bangs.</li>
            <li>A bit different from the picture, as the pink is actually a separate layer, and the blond is more yellow.</li>
            <li>thought it would have less pink at the top like in picture, but like it.</li>
            <li>The wig is pretty, but the hair is very thin on top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too long to look unnatural or too much for my body.</li>
            <li>pink is exactly like the pic.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s quite nice with very few sparse areas.</li>
            <li>Also from other reviews and pictures that I&#x27;ve seen, the actual coloring of the wig varies tremendously</li>
            <li>But the top looks completely pink outside and in other rooms.  </li>
            <li>much more pink all over, does not fit well</li>
            <li>I applied heat, using my curling wand on setting number 10, it curled a few pieces, handled the heat very well, much easier to straighten.</li>
            <li>The color was more of a weird blonde pink on top and not just blonde.</li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t budge &amp;#60;3 Definitely love that it looks SO real in person too and doesn&#x27;t have a weird glare to it</li>
            <li>Not perfect, but good enough.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the color isn&#x27;t exactly as it is in the picture; the pink is accurate, but there&#x27;s not really a lot of brown/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticking out of the lacing of the wig, although hard to hide, brushing the hair over works just fine.</li>
            <li>First off this wig came faster than expected!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light dirty blonde that fades into a nice pastel pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super thick, and the hairs fall out pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Either way, the wig is also very thin and can be seen easily that its a wig since its so thin (maybe it good to wear it with hats?).</li>
            <li>and then it even felt really smooth but the only thing that bothers me is that when I tried brushing it shreds soo much and the bangs were too thin that u can see the wig cap</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;re little girl playing dress up might really enjoy this--but know you&#x27;ll have long strands of hair all over your house!</li>
            <li>(Pics were taken with different natural lighting)</li>
            <li>It was much shorted than I expected.</li>
            <li>my whole wig is pink.</li>
            <li>This was supposed to arrive on November 3rd, although I had gotten it about a week early.</li>
            <li>The brown on this wig is much darker, and it does not fade into the pink like in the picture.</li>
            <li>This wig looks cute but it&#x27;s extemely poor quality and you can see the mesh through the hair.</li>
            <li>It does shine a little more than normal hair would, but dulling it down with dry shampoo helps.</li>
            <li>Bangs were SUPER long, I had to trim it down so it can stay out of my face.</li>
            <li>(I noticed some of the reviews said it was fairly thin in back, but it was just fine on mine!</li>
            <li>The dark blonde doesn&#x27;t really blend with the pink well, but it does look pretty realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I happen to have very long and thick hair naturally, so fitting all of my hair under the wig is always a bit of a challenge and does make it sit a little funny on my head.</li>
            <li>The color doesn&#x27;t exactly match the picture, I initially thought it would be a dirty/strawberry blonde to a pastel pink</li>
            <li>The bangs were a bit long as I have a small small head, But I just cut them til they looked good</li>
            <li>The brown is hardly brown, more pink than anything</li>
            <li>Its very soft and long!</li>
            <li>My only problems are that the wig is a bit thin and you can see the lace on top</li>
            <li>(theres pink hair that go all the way to the top to help with the fading into pink) and the pink section isn&#x27;t as long as the picture shows.</li>
            <li>So just be in mind when buying this product that there&#x27;s a high chance it will come to you all pink.</li>
            <li>It was pink on the top and a little darker pink at the bottom.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still recommend their brand in general over others of the same price range.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why I expected a decent quality wig for ten bucks.</li>
            <li>The netting is very small and the wig just looks like a blonde top layer then a pink under layer instead of ombre.</li>
            <li>But dry shampoo fixed that problem.</li>
            <li>The fade into pink is more subtle than this pic where is just kinda starts suddenly</li>
            <li>This product is okayish - not good not bad for my first wig, but I&#x27;m a bittt disappointed because I was really looking forward to the light brown --&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great wig and I would recommend it for just casual wear or cosplay!</li>
            <li>I also think the wig was slightly small, pretty thin, and you can see your hair on the front, but it can easily be covered with a beanie or something.</li>
            <li>This wig sheds way too much, is way too tight, arrived weeks later than my others, and was is a bag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s already shedding and the fringe was cut in a choppy way, had to brush it a certain way.</li>

            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You could probably make it look good if you style it correctly or use a hat.</li>

            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily the wig was fine, wrapped in plastic and netting, X&amp;Y tag of authentication was there too!</li>
            <li> The wig is beautiful and soft, however, the light brown doesn&#x27;t look good with my skin tone (I&#x27;m more of an olive skin tone)</li>
            <li> It is so comfortable!</li>
            <li> My wig was shipped on October 19 and arrived on November 1 which was great and fast.</li>
            <li> I think it looks better if u wear a beanie</li>
            <li> i love</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the wig I received.</li>
            <li> This was a cheap wig so you can&#x27;t expect something amazing bur</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a costume wig.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite wigs.</li>
            <li> This wig was great, packaged very well.</li>
            <li> and I am glad to have bought it.</li>
            <li> it is better quality than wigs that I spend about 100 dollars on.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> , now just gotta figure out how to lighten it. :)</li>
            <li> Since there is no &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; part, you won&#x27;t be able to part it however</li>
            <li> The wig is not as shiny as most.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute, and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments.  </li>

            <li> Cute to wear for cosplay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I look at customer photos, and the look nothing like what I received, they look better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not TERRIBLE, but it&#x27;s not the quality I was looking for.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to be ok  for halloween</li>
            <li> Cute Wig</li>
            <li> better quality</li>

            <li> Love the feel and the colors... arrived on time..getting lots of compliments...</li>
            <li> I got soo many compliments</li>
            <li> That I really love and appreciate.</li>
            <li> Just make sure if youre in photos, the flash is off</li>
            <li> You can see the wig lace on top...</li>
            <li> But I plan to wear with my beanie cap so it will be ok.</li>
            <li> The color on top wasn&#x27;t brown</li>
            <li> I still love the wig.</li>
            <li> I bought better wigs for 10 dollars than this.</li>
            <li> its cute for pictures but could not wear it out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love the color.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> all together then you can get matching extensions to wear under the wig and it will be fuller except at the top.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love the hair &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It is a much more drastic look.</li>
            <li> The top beige color is more pink-ish than the picture shows though.</li>
            <li> Still, 10/10 cute wig.</li>
            <li> Would buy more.</li>
            <li> better with a Hat.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this wig.</li>
            <li> Much better than I had anticipated for the price.</li>
            <li> It looks better with a beanie anyways.</li>
            <li> but it is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Company responded quick to an issue and I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> Wig fits very well, and looks very nice.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful and it is very soft.</li>
            <li> looks a tad different from the picture color wise but beyond that its really nice!</li>
            <li> Super soft and cute, perfect colors</li>
            <li> I think it looks super cute!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m ok with it because I found it was easy to make a lovely side-part/side-sweep bang</li>
            <li> And for this price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty good wig.</li>
            <li> all in all a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I am in love with it and it is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> love its hair style, but the hair comes too easily.</li>
            <li> come in way earlier than suggest arrival, feels secure around the head, color is just like the picture very pleased with purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Still is beautiful quality; soft and easy to style</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a very nice wig and for the price and amazing reviews and pictures</li>
            <li> and I am super excited!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the wig would have been beautiful if I had only received it.</li>
            <li> Although it does have a habit of becoming tangled if it comes in contact with any type of cloth.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE that it has an attachment for around your head to secure it on...</li>
            <li> It is a cheap wig after all!a cheap wig after all!  </li>
            <li> i will say it is ok for $9 bucks and free shipping.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t really look good without a beanie fyi.</li>
            <li> I was SO looking forward to this wig, the wig pictures above is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Not bad for a starter wig, however!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the color I was expecting and it tangled easily</li>
            <li> You can easily cut them to suit your face, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li> but you easily fix that with a hat.</li>
            <li> Falls out soooooo easily..</li>
            <li> tangles easy and falls apart after brushing</li>
            <li> I love how it looks kind of real</li>
            <li> Tangles easily, sheds a lot, and the bangs are In need of styling.</li>
            <li> All of the wigs I get from them are gorgeous and high</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> other than that, I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually an amazing wig first time I buy one and was amaze.</li>
            <li> Soft to touch and looks nice with hat !</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t Shed and its soft and really nice!</li>
            <li> I have a fairly chubby face and kind of a big head, so I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> but hey, what else is fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cute</li>
            <li> Super cute wig.</li>
            <li> Super cute wig.</li>
            <li> I look super duper cute like an anime character.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still super cute.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous, and very very soft.  </li>
            <li> and whats even better is that it is super soft even better then my own hair</li>
            <li> Very pretty!</li>
            <li> but it never fails to have another one! :)</li>
            <li> I was just lucky enough to get a good one!</li>
            <li> but it was cheap</li>
            <li> This wig is so smooth and not a hassle to style at all.</li>
            <li> It fit my head, even though there is a adjustable strap band.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> It looks like a cheap halloween wig.</li>
            <li> I had to cut the bangs some because it just didnt fit my head well, also without a hat on or some band you can see bald spots.</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t bother with returns on cheap items.</li>
            <li> Then you should be happy with the price and quality because you only plan to wear it a time or</li>
            <li> It is light pink.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Outside so hair don&#x27;t fly away an get tangled</li>
            <li> Definetly trick of light.</li>
            <li> too comfortable</li>
            <li> and it looks even more real than before:)</li>
            <li> To be honest, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I love it anyway</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig color and design is completely right</li>
            <li> Just brush it right, and you won&#x27;t be able to move the hair around without the cap showing.</li>
            <li> thanks will order again!!!</li>
            <li> Fit was comfortable and looked real! :)</li>
            <li> Bangs Are Gorgeous, Easily Stylish, And Long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft, and is a good amount of hair.</li>
            <li> the colors were pretty accurate!</li>
            <li> I still wish it were exactly like the photo, but I love the wig and wear it often.</li>
            <li> I completely LOVE this wig, it&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever boughten.</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I love this wigs sooo much!</li>
            <li> Low price is nice, though!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging could be better because the boxing it came in was pretty mashed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly more pink on top than pictured but it&#x27;s still really amazing.</li>
            <li> so I could use it when my original wears out.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is a really fun wig!</li>
            <li> Fun!</li>
            <li> but i ended up purchasing the wig because it seemed like there was more positive feedback.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a honey brown color than a dark brown color, and the ombré looks a biiiit tacky, but it&#x27;s nice and lovely for the price.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent X&amp;Y Angel buyer, their wigs are amazing, they fit my head, arrive quickly, and come in a box.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just the right length!</li>
            <li> , the wigs sold at the dollar store look way more decent!  </li>
            <li> Although, the wig is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I personally just don&#x27;t look good in brown hair</li>
            <li> The top of it isn&#x27;t really brown</li>
            <li> The color is true to the picture.</li>
            <li> Someone did suggest that this listing may be a knock-off of the true X&amp;Y Angel wig.</li>
            <li> but I thought that was cool.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> The wig cap it came with is really crappy and ripped on a bobby pin ;A; I will be buying better wig caps.</li>
            <li> The top part is more pink than pictured, but I&#x27;m more than content about that.</li>
            <li> however not styled (since it isn&#x27;t straight at the top but rather wavy?)</li>
            <li> Over all its not bad.</li>
            <li> Such a lovely wig and so easy to maintain!</li>
            <li> I love love and recommend to everyone who wants a realistic wig.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the colour is vibrant which is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Other then that the hair looks great.</li>
            <li> Great for your model to wear for photography or any other occasion</li>
            <li> He wasn&#x27;t convinced until he had to lift up &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; hair to see that it really wasn&#x27;t my own haha &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I found the blonde had a bit more strawberry in it and looked more of a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I look super kawaii in it.</li>
            <li> Great for Halloween and maybe daily wear, if you fix the intense shine.</li>
            <li> I received a lot of compliments for how realistic this wig looked!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li> Very pretty color.  </li>
            <li> It was my very first wig EVER</li>
            <li> The wig is very pretty</li>
            <li> I think the wig sheds a bit too much, more than normal wigs.</li>
            <li> The bangs are extremely long which is good because you can cut them how you like</li>
            <li> Otherwise the quality is great and the length allowed me to trim it down to the correct style I wanted.</li>
            <li> After I washed it and sprayed with dry shampoo, looked so natural that many of my friends said they liked how I dyed my hair!</li>
            <li> Super cute and feels so soft!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how many times I could wear it, but good quality as comparing to its price</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li> Overall, stunning wig!</li>
            <li> It is a very good deal for the price and overall is a very soft wig and feels pretty good compared to some other cheaper wigs.</li>
            <li> It looks great in pictures and at night I&#x27;m sure it would be fine to go out in, but in the daytime I think it would look a bit too thin (though it&#x27;s not the thinnest out there, still has plenty of volume but could definitely use more).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> This wig isn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But this wig just makes me smile.</li>
            <li> So I say be careful, as not everyone would look good in this wig.</li>
            <li> and it came very quickly overall its a nice product for anyone who likes to cosplay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fun costume wig but</li>
            <li> For under $10 it is a nice enough wig that you&#x27;d expect for the price</li>
            <li> Mine was pretty true to the color on here.</li>
            <li> The hair is soft and not too shiny but the netting shows through at the top.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s definitely worth it...</li>
            <li> Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> The colors are definitely darker than in the picture, but it was a nice color still, so I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> All in all, completely worth the price</li>
            <li> It sheds quite a bit (totally normal for this price range) and tangles fairly easily</li>
            <li> Originally, I bought this wig on September 3rd, and it was supposed to be here by October 16th at the latest.</li>
            <li> That color was actually quick pretty</li>
            <li> Fits well and looks realistic, also the shipping was really quick!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t style it just right the wig cap will show.</li>
            <li> not shiny, not fake looking, smooth, and looks real.</li>
            <li> The net shows a bit in the back, but the hair itself is beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is my first wig and came in 20 days which is pretty quick</li>
            <li> It is very full and soft.</li>
            <li> Very very soft wig, natural shine, fits nicely (On the biggest, and smallest heads)</li>
            <li> But the pink was like a brownish pink at the top, i&#x27;m still happy with the way it looks.</li>
            <li> Its more pink than brown at the top unlike the picture wheresvits really brown</li>
            <li> It looks pretty but the gradient effect isn&#x27;t very prominent because the colors don&#x27;t really look that different.</li>
            <li> Wear the bangs swept to the side because they&#x27;re pretty long but good if you want to trim them/make them straight across.</li>
            <li> Other than all of that, it&#x27;s a pretty good wig.</li>
            <li> Looks very realistic and not too shiny!</li>
            <li> Love love love it especially because its so easy to style and doesn&#x27;t tangle to much :) I want one with blue ot green tips now</li>
            <li> This wig is my least favorite wig I own now.</li>
            <li> but hair does fall out quickly and tangles fast.</li>
            <li> The top color is a nice brownish blonde but the pink is a bright almost-neon pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and it feels the most realistic of all my wigs.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> First of all this wig came in super fast.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look anything like picture very very displeased</li>
            <li> The wig is a bit thin but for 12$ and free shipping it was an amazing deal for such a good quality, lower end wig.</li>
            <li> The picture is very, very deceiving.  </li>
            <li> (and how it doesn&#x27;t wash out my complexion *too much*)!</li>
            <li> It feels very soft, is comfortable to wear, and overall pretty cute.</li>
            <li> Hair Wigs Pink MJ051-1) is amazing .</li>
            <li> I received my order on time, and the wig is pretty, but doesn&#x27;t look like what I thought it would look like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I brushed the wig with a brush not meant for the wig, the hairs started falling out, but otherwise it&#x27;s a cute wig.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> Pretty colors.</li>
            <li> Even though it didn&#x27;t look exactly like it in the picture, I was still quite</li>
            <li> HOW REAL IT LOOKS!</li>
            <li> had they added some more hair to the back.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see it in my mail box 3 weeks early!  </li>
            <li> I still highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> The pink on the bottom is nice.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappinted.</li>
            <li> the only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars is because I had some problems the first time I ordered and after more than a month of waiting I hadn&#x27;t recieved my wig.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just so cute, would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for this wig!</li>
            <li> Totally cute wig though color is different.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> This wig is not blonde at the top as shown.</li>
            <li> The pink is nicely blended into the brown.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> one of my favorites, if only it could stay on better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute if you&#x27;re looking for a strawberry blonde wig</li>
            <li> Color not blonde but still way adorable.</li>
            <li> It looks cute without a hat but definitely cuter with one.</li>
            <li> The gradient isn&#x27;t reallly that much of a gradient, it&#x27;s a pretty distinct color change.</li>
            <li> A lot of people complimented me thinking this was my real hair!</li>
            <li> YOu&#x27;d have to have someone check the back of it just to make sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing it out for the first time tomorrow</li>
            <li> and I got exactly what I thought I would.</li>
            <li> The blond and pink are both more bold which caught me by surprise, but it grew on me.</li>
            <li> u can actually see the camp underneath in certain parts on the top.</li>
            <li> I own 8 other wigs from having a shaved head for years, and can&#x27;t wait to get them off.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had as lot of experience shedding which is good (because my last one was around the same price</li>
            <li> the wig loses hair easily and the hair net isn&#x27;t very nice at all.</li>
            <li> The hair net can be seen pretty easily.</li>
            <li> So this wig had a lot of positive reviews</li>
            <li> , If you brush it you will have a few hairs fall out, but it&#x27;s still very cute and for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay length, not too long or too</li>
            <li> but other than that this wig is amazing and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I notified the company and they promptly sent me another wig (their costumer service is awesome, they&#x27;re really fast) but the replacement wig turned out to be exactly the same, so I&#x27;m a bit confused, maybe I do have the right wig?</li>
            <li> The top is more of a dusty rose color, fading gradually to a bubblegum pastel pink at the bottom.</li>
            <li> A fun change for a costume or temporary trial of new hair.  </li>
            <li> I will still use this wig, but it doesn&#x27;t look very realistic.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a shine towards the top that dry shampoo took care of.</li>
            <li> It was thick an full which was nice and didn&#x27;t really shed much.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it looks pretty cute.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting, it&#x27;s still a decent wig.</li>
            <li> Came on time and very high quality</li>
            <li> It is a little more pink than I thought but still looks nice.</li>
            <li> Either way it&#x27;s an awesome wig, the fade is really natural looking with lots of multicolored streaks in it to keep it from looking really fake.</li>
            <li> I honestly feel like the bad out ways the good.</li>
            <li> Very close to the texture of my real hair.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t look like the picture-</li>
            <li> I really lije it</li>
            <li> and people always think it&#x27;s my real hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t expect much based on the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a lot of work just to maintain the wig, you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> If you really /really/ want it for the color</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really tangle or anything.</li>
            <li> Looks absolute NOTHING like the picture and the wigs worn in reviews.</li>
            <li> Much darker than pictured.</li>
            <li> The only thing I could criticize this wig, the colors, the image it shows much light brown color.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Hahaha....</li>
            <li> I like it much more than expected.</li>
            <li> but it didnt help much.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s straight quality.</li>
            <li> Just like real hair.</li>
            <li> You cant really tell from the pictures on here</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTE LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;I made a video on this wig.</li>
            <li> and I really made a god decision.</li>
            <li> really well I put the extension on before I put the wig cap on and then the wig itself.</li>
            <li> but i comb mine very often.</li>
            <li> I am throwing it straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> The wig was much thinner than I was hoping.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really look like the images.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Its to pink on top</li>
            <li> At the price paid I was not expecting much, and should&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> The color is a bit off from the photos, the brown color doesn&#x27;t show much, but I don&#x27;t have any issues with that.</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars because I still really like the style and the color despite it not being what it looks like in the image.</li>
            <li> I like the colors and it looks so real</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s says it is or looks like it is its wayyyy more pink</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;real scalp\\&quot; section of the wig cap does look like a scalp.    </li>
            <li> Delivered faster than expected, quality is OK</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a cheap wig) but the look is the same as pictures.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually one of my favorite wigs (from amazon) so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this model X&amp;Y Angel pink and brown wig a couple years ago for $25 or $30 and it is one of my absolute favorite wigs ever.</li>
            <li> I own a lot of wigs, and as a heavy cosplayer I know my wigs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pro</li>
            <li> Good quality and shipped earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It very nice, the only thing is that it sheds a little bit.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this wig because it got gross pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I will attach pictures of my original real wig side by side with the one I just recieved, the X&amp;Y is on the left.</li>
            <li> I love the wig though it is not exactly as it described.</li>
            <li> but not consistent and some are better than others.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more orange-y to a normal pink.</li>
            <li> I really like this wig except that it&#x27;s not thick but not thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, easy to untangle and heat resistant so you can style it different ways.</li>
            <li> Also this isnt a huge problem but the bangs were long, so I had to trim it a bit.</li>
            <li> ** pink on top and light pink on bottom.</li>
            <li> The original was thick enough that no wefts were showing and nicely blended (it even has pink hair blended into the brown hair) and transitioned very nicely from brown to pink, this one is just shorter light brown hair with longer pink hair underneath.</li>
            <li> but the brown came in as a more pale brown with more pink scattered around.</li>
            <li> usually love X&amp;Y Angels wigs, but this was a let down.</li>
            <li> The wig came really early, aboub 2 or 3 weeks earlier than listed, the colors are super pretty</li>
            <li> The bottom wAs a bright pink not cotton candy pink.</li>
            <li> but I love the wig none the less.</li>
            <li> looks realistic</li>
            <li> It looks so realistic</li>
            <li> It fits decently.</li>
            <li> The brown up top is highlighted with the pink so the ombre blends seamlessly.</li>
            <li> The pink is a VERY bright pink, not a soft pastel color at all.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Its very soft, and no one can really tell its a wig.</li>
            <li> wig fits my head comfortably, and is very long!</li>
            <li> for those wondering about HEAT RESISTANCE - in my attempt to blend the strawberry whatever color to the pink by curling (as you can see in my photo), curls just fine</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not very thin.</li>
            <li> It came to me as a faded purple and the light pink on the tips.</li>
            <li> but it is true to ots color its really long on me witch</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something fun occasionally.</li>
            <li> The shipping was kind of slow</li>
            <li> My wig came on November 30th which was fast because estimated arrival was the 10th-20th December.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a wig to wear with a hat the top is thin so if not styled right</li>
            <li> Thirdly, the wig is super soft and does not tangle for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft And easily brushed.</li>
            <li> I bought the other color and liked it so much I had to try the pink.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal for new wigs.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item, and when i open the package it was so smooth and soft, but after a day of wearing it, it got very frizzy, tangle, and snarled.</li>
            <li> It ended up looking like a light pink wig rather than the two shades described in the picture or description (its not two toned!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not X&amp;Y but it&#x27;s not a  bad wig, it&#x27;s kind of thin, but the net doesn&#x27;t show through the hair.</li>
            <li> I have to buy a new one because of it..</li>
            <li> They id respond and apologized, saying they would send a new one.</li>
            <li> Bought this on New Years, just got it yesterday.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s kind of ridiculous)</li>
            <li> Blonde on top and pink on bottom</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and not too shiny (meaning, could be made more matte with dry shampoo or such if desired, should be no problem).</li>
            <li> It is simply a cheaper wig with pink on the bottom and brown on the top.</li>
            <li> but if you are expecting a real quality wig do not waste your money on this one, unless you are buying directly from the manufacture (as it states in the description.).</li>
            <li> I wanted to order a light colored wig to see how well it went with my completion, might order a blond or a red wig next to see.</li>
            <li> It is confortable and it looks very natural, it also moves so natural!</li>
            <li> I was hoping the color would match what was advertised but not worth the hassle of returning, since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> First the hair are shorter, second there is two purple strand in the front.</li>
            <li> I have recently developed an obsession to wigs and want to play around wih them!</li>
            <li> The wig itself is small fitting around the head.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, so i will keep, not worth the return.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ombre pink, Light pink on top then darker pink as it descends.</li>
            <li> I contacted them and they quickly fixed the problem and mailed me a new one.</li>
            <li> The bangs r long enough to trim to fit my face.</li>
            <li> it turns from light pink to hot pink.</li>
            <li> Sheds easily, so must be brushed carefully from bottom-</li>
            <li> The cap fits pretty well, is a little tiny, but not much, and i have to make sure to keep all my hair covered which just means i need to put a little bit more effort in.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that I was hoping for the paler pink, but ended up with more of a hot pink.</li>
            <li> but mine is dark pink on top and light pink on the bottom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very realistic shade (especially since it&#x27;s not TOO SHINY!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me sweat or itch:) It does shed a little but not enough to care.</li>
            <li> Although on the thin side its amazing .</li>
            <li> It turned out to be an obnoxious pink which I&#x27;m ok with since I like pink and don&#x27;t mind unnatural hair colors, but THE BROWNNN WHERE ART THOU??</li>
            <li> the top looks about 30% brown and 70% pink, and the bottom is neon pink.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of my skin color or the lighting, but most of my photos came out as an all pink wig rather than a brown into pink.</li>
            <li> Also, the light brown/dark blonde in the picture almost looks completely pink and it looks like it&#x27;s just one color.</li>
            <li> Strawberry blonde doesn&#x27;t flatter my complexion and really feel it should be advertised</li>
            <li> Its so soft feeling even after a year.</li>
            <li> It looks really natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay - fun for short use, but really thin, and looks &#x27;wig-like&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural thinness.</li>
            <li> It arrived so early, I had a surprise moment for myself because I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I received it in the mail, the hair colors were actually much darker and varied in different lighting.</li>
            <li> Came early.</li>
            <li> I had been getting some of my orders early and was hoping one of the wigs I ordered would come today</li>
            <li> Soft and the colors match the description.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li> So I was happily surprised when I got home from school.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was more pink than anything and the blonde and pink on the top are mixed making it look like and pink shaded ombre.</li>
            <li> arrived far faster</li>
            <li> But It&#x27;s Soft,</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m turning 27! haha</li>
            <li> (but I skip the talc step cus it makes the wig look kind of weird in my opinion) but really any of the tutorials that use fabric softener are good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is exciting and fun and thick.</li>
            <li> wig is thin but it has some good coverage, especially at the bangs.</li>
            <li> but it IS kind of thin, so if that is like a thing for you...</li>
            <li> Bangs are super long, which is par for the course with wigs (you can see just how far back I had to position the wig in one of the pics).</li>
            <li> This wig (X&amp;Y ANGEL New Two Tone Long Straight Highlights</li>
            <li> I DID go with one of the *slightly more expensive* purchase options because you get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li> The hair is pretty thin and falls off when I lightly brush it, but I still like it</li>
            <li> When I recieved this I was shocked with how beautiful and soft it was.</li>
            <li> i was expecting blonde with a light pink ombre the whole wig is pink with some blond in the bangs.</li>
            <li> A bit different from the picture, as the pink is actually a separate layer, and the blond is more yellow.</li>
            <li> thought it would have less pink at the top like in picture, but like it.</li>
            <li> The wig is pretty, but the hair is very thin on top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too long to look unnatural or too much for my body.</li>
            <li> pink is exactly like the pic.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s quite nice with very few sparse areas.</li>
            <li> Also from other reviews and pictures that I&#x27;ve seen, the actual coloring of the wig varies tremendously</li>
            <li> But the top looks completely pink outside and in other rooms.  </li>
            <li> much more pink all over, does not fit well</li>
            <li> I applied heat, using my curling wand on setting number 10, it curled a few pieces, handled the heat very well, much easier to straighten.</li>
            <li> The color was more of a weird blonde pink on top and not just blonde.</li>
            <li> and it wouldn&#x27;t budge &amp;#60;3 Definitely love that it looks SO real in person too and doesn&#x27;t have a weird glare to it</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but good enough.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the color isn&#x27;t exactly as it is in the picture; the pink is accurate, but there&#x27;s not really a lot of brown/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticking out of the lacing of the wig, although hard to hide, brushing the hair over works just fine.</li>
            <li> First off this wig came faster than expected!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light dirty blonde that fades into a nice pastel pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super thick, and the hairs fall out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Either way, the wig is also very thin and can be seen easily that its a wig since its so thin (maybe it good to wear it with hats?).</li>
            <li> and then it even felt really smooth but the only thing that bothers me is that when I tried brushing it shreds soo much and the bangs were too thin that u can see the wig cap</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;re little girl playing dress up might really enjoy this--but know you&#x27;ll have long strands of hair all over your house!</li>
            <li> (Pics were taken with different natural lighting)</li>
            <li> It was much shorted than I expected.</li>
            <li> my whole wig is pink.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to arrive on November 3rd, although I had gotten it about a week early.</li>
            <li> The brown on this wig is much darker, and it does not fade into the pink like in the picture.</li>
            <li> This wig looks cute but it&#x27;s extemely poor quality and you can see the mesh through the hair.</li>
            <li> It does shine a little more than normal hair would, but dulling it down with dry shampoo helps.</li>
            <li> Bangs were SUPER long, I had to trim it down so it can stay out of my face.</li>
            <li> (I noticed some of the reviews said it was fairly thin in back, but it was just fine on mine!</li>
            <li> The dark blonde doesn&#x27;t really blend with the pink well, but it does look pretty realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I happen to have very long and thick hair naturally, so fitting all of my hair under the wig is always a bit of a challenge and does make it sit a little funny on my head.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t exactly match the picture, I initially thought it would be a dirty/strawberry blonde to a pastel pink</li>
            <li> The bangs were a bit long as I have a small small head, But I just cut them til they looked good</li>
            <li> The brown is hardly brown, more pink than anything</li>
            <li> Its very soft and long!</li>
            <li> My only problems are that the wig is a bit thin and you can see the lace on top</li>
            <li> (theres pink hair that go all the way to the top to help with the fading into pink) and the pink section isn&#x27;t as long as the picture shows.</li>
            <li> So just be in mind when buying this product that there&#x27;s a high chance it will come to you all pink.</li>
            <li> It was pink on the top and a little darker pink at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still recommend their brand in general over others of the same price range.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I expected a decent quality wig for ten bucks.</li>
            <li> The netting is very small and the wig just looks like a blonde top layer then a pink under layer instead of ombre.</li>
            <li> But dry shampoo fixed that problem.</li>
            <li> The fade into pink is more subtle than this pic where is just kinda starts suddenly</li>
            <li> This product is okayish - not good not bad for my first wig, but I&#x27;m a bittt disappointed because I was really looking forward to the light brown --&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a great wig and I would recommend it for just casual wear or cosplay!</li>
            <li> I also think the wig was slightly small, pretty thin, and you can see your hair on the front, but it can easily be covered with a beanie or something.</li>
            <li> This wig sheds way too much, is way too tight, arrived weeks later than my others, and was is a bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already shedding and the fringe was cut in a choppy way, had to brush it a certain way.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a nice wig, just really sad about it being 100% pink...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even wear this wif because it just doesn&#x27;t look right, also, the blonde color is a little more dirty blond than it appears in the picture.</li>
            <li> High quality and luckily for me, I didn&#x27;t have an issue with it being thin!</li>
            <li> The bangs are really awkward too, not short enough to be straight bangs, also not long enough to pin to the side for side bangs, so that would most likely require a little trimming/styling as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been drawn to colorful cosplay wigs (I get tired of my curly dark blah hair, haha).</li>
            <li> Use a hair curling wand or flat iron on low setting~</li>
            <li> It was very nice to wear out, and didn&#x27;t tangle up badly like some of my other wigs do.</li>
            <li> Has a weird plastic/synthetic smell on it and is very shiny at first</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just about worth the price, maybe even a little less.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend it for everyday use maybe not</li>
            <li> the only thing is, it is very thin and easy to see through in the back.</li>
            <li> Only slightly shiny in some lighting, but closer to a natural shine.</li>
            <li> Super thin have to wear a hag or even my blonde hair</li>
            <li> I need to mess with the bangs quite a bit to make them look as natural as possible.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this wig was really from X&amp;Y Angel.</li>
            <li> with a long torso so, maybe longer on those opposite of me?</li>
            <li> last too long before it got way too</li>
            <li> but the wig is extremely thin and sheds a lot, I&#x27;d have to do quite a few tricks that includes buying a second wig to give it more volume.</li>
            <li> The hair on the wig itself is pretty thick</li>
            <li> I decided to wear it with my black bandana to hide any gaps between the hair as it is not very thick and you can see the cap through the hair.</li>
            <li> Dried up pretty fast and just turned so dull and rough.</li>
            <li> IT WON&#x27;T last long!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about other people&#x27;s wig but the one I received had the exact same color as the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> I expected it to have cheap quality and to be thin</li>
            <li> The pink is much more flashy than in the picture as well.</li>
            <li> The real bummer was with the wig being so thin you could clearly see the netting of both the wig and caps.</li>
            <li> It was not a brown/blonde overtone but instead the pink lowlights were mixed in with the upper color.</li>
            <li> &#x27; Only Downside Is That It&#x27;s Not Blonde ; It&#x27;s Like A Pastel Pink .</li>
            <li> I saw positive feedback, and some negative feedback</li>
            <li> the picture I provided all the hair is pulled to the front, normally wigs are thick enough to leave some in the back when you do this so it just goes to show)</li>
            <li> Its definitely not two tone.. solid pink!</li>
            <li> and I understand that maybe I just got a bad copy, but I&#x27;m still going to give my honest review of what I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the bangs were a bit too long and it looks better with a beanie and sheds like crazy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious as to what happened to the first one, but whatever, at least they dealt with it.</li>
            <li> not really an issue so to say because I put extensions in between the rows of hair of different colors.</li>
            <li> My wig was not, then again the wig I received looked NOTHING like the picture above, it was not brown and pink</li>
            <li> It was definitely not brown/blonde at all.. Totally pink.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> that shade of brown just looked strange.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bangs were a bit long</li>
            <li> I like the long length.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really blonde and pink.</li>
            <li> 4stars for the color, length, and long bangs to trim.</li>
            <li> Came way earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> not natural looking at all.</li>
            <li> It was not a blonde to pink ombre like displayed.</li>
            <li> The style is correct- long length and bangs.</li>
            <li> My wig came earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> Got it earlier then I expected it to get here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Bangs are long so you can style them as you please</li>
            <li> Two Tone One Piece Straight Synthetic Thick Hair Extension Clip-on Hairpieces to go under the wig and thickens it up</li>
            <li> I had some thin spots showing, but if you brush it right, it won&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> For $9, this wig is stunning, probably a little on the thin side, but for me the wig tracks don&#x27;t show, so having it be slightly thin isn&#x27;t much of a problem.</li>
            <li> The wefts are spaced wide apart and the wig is not very full, so the wig cap will be visible if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Bought this and several other wigs for Vida Joven in Nicaragua to use in skits.</li>
            <li> I am wondering if possibly I purchased this through an off-brand seller somehow because the wig I received doesn&#x27;t look like the wig other people received.</li>
            <li> more expensive cause the hair on this one falls !</li>
            <li> I put hair spray on it and let it dry</li>
            <li> I tried dry shampoo and baby powder to lower the shine</li>
            <li> I had expected the blonde and pink colors to be as depicted in the photo</li>
            <li> This came and didn&#x27;t look like this at all, it is not two tone, it is all light pink and very Thin, you can see my hair underneath it.</li>
            <li> Sheds, is pretty thin, and snug.</li>
            <li> it was full baby pink thin tangled not worth it at all</li>
            <li> Only down side is.</li>
            <li> And its not high quality material (of course).</li>
            <li> While it can shed like crazy, it&#x27;s easy to brush and doesn&#x27;t tangle that</li>
            <li> I suggest wearing a beige nylon cap instead of the black net that&#x27;s provided.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say I don&#x27;t like, is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come with a wig cap, and that you&#x27;ll either have to trim the bangs slightly, or use a hair clip to get them out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> But definetly not realistic.</li>
            <li> It just came a whole two weeks late!</li>
            <li> The color of the pink is very dull and you can&#x27;t really see it.</li>
            <li> It does tangle a lot more than expected, but they aren&#x27;t bad tangles, and it&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m throwing my backpack on and off all day.</li>
            <li> the ends are pink, yes, but the pink blends in a lot with the rest of the wig as well</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t give the effect that I expected it to have from what the picture looks like.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t turn out brown and pink, it all kinda was pink.</li>
            <li> However, it is a bit thin and is very shiny.</li>
            <li> It is fully pink.</li>
            <li> pink ombre D:</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s,more of a brownish pink.</li>
            <li> It looks real, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too thin.  </li>
            <li> and I just added pink extensions.  </li>
            <li> I bought this wig regardless of all the people who said the wig was all pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all all pink.</li>
            <li> My wig well it&#x27;s all pink</li>
            <li> Arrived on the date as expected.</li>
            <li> All pink sheds and is ill-fitting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it a few times already and have only had fallout of about 3 strands or so.</li>
            <li> and there is no real change in color throughout the wig.</li>
            <li> The pink on the wig is a bit brighter than I expected, I wish there were a way to lighten it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 was because the bangs were much longer than expected and is so shiny you can tell it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> The beige kinda blends with the pink, so its mostly pink.</li>
            <li> I plan on wearing it with a hat, the pink I can work with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like pink and lighter pink.</li>
            <li> I have a small head and it barely fits.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all pink</li>
            <li> Mine is shorter and instead of fading from blond to pink</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a layer of brown over a layer of pink.</li>
            <li> But the brown is shorter than the pink</li>
            <li> it blends into the pink a lot</li>
            <li> then i expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really two</li>
            <li> but it was like a grayish pink.</li>
            <li> It sheds, but not to the point of being unwearable and you might want to air it out before you wear it, unless you&#x27;re curious about what the inside of a warehouse smells like.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really pink.</li>
            <li> like really pink.</li>
            <li> I do wear from time to time when I am just at home and want to wear it but definetly not for everyday wear or public use.</li>
            <li> My other X&amp;Y ANGEL wig is way better than this, so I&#x27;ll just carefully check bad reviews before buying their products again.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark hair so using nude hair nets only helped a little.</li>
            <li> its not same :/ its all pink</li>
            <li> but all I do to get rid of that is spray a little dry hair shampoo onto it and comb it through it with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> very little hair, red wig looks</li>
            <li> i would recommend this wig to other people</li>
            <li> In Cameron or video it&#x27;s extremely shinny.</li>
            <li> in all, if you&#x27;re wanting to get what&#x27;s in the product image, expect to be disappointed or fall in love with whatever you get.</li>
            <li> Other then that.</li>
            <li> Before I start, I have to say that I HAVE noticed the other reviews</li>
            <li> it came a week before it was expected to, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> overall it isnt horrible but its more for a halloween costume rather than something wearable daily.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful because other customer photos were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am extremely upset about this purchase.</li>
            <li> Meh....I should have listened to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have an average sized head for females in America and even on the loosest setting this wig is a bit to tight to wear for too long.</li>
            <li> Is a little shiny but nothing some dry shampoo can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> only complaint is it sheds for a little while, and then you have long pink hairs everywhere</li>
            <li> but, it sheads like really really bad if your only useing it for photography its fine, but after one use its not very effective</li>
            <li> Short length and can hardly see any pink in it.</li>
            <li> The wig is poor quality, SUPER shiny and fake looking, and very thin, you can easily see the webbing beneath the hair when it&#x27;s worn.</li>
            <li> The wig is a bit thin, and the wig cap is pretty small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this three stars because I&#x27;ve always had good dealings with this seller, but they&#x27;re being very difficult about replacing the item that I was shipped incorrectly, and I&#x27;m a little annoyed by that.</li>
            <li> pink is a little darker than in the picture but not that dark.</li>
            <li> ITS SO UGLY FIRST OF ALL ITS NOT EVEN BLONDE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin in a way that makes it look natural.</li>
            <li> The wig looks almost completely pale pink.</li>
            <li> I could jump up and down if I wanted too</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine doing things to this wig like the description describes- perming it--because just running my fingers down the length made hair come out in like 7-10 strand clumps.  </li>
            <li> It shed a little when it came but nothing extreme.</li>
            <li> The bad part about this wig is that the bangs are ridiculously long, covering over my eyes completely, but pinned back</li>
            <li> The wig is a little thin (amount 1/4 the thickness of my natural hair).</li>
            <li> The bangs are outrageously long, and fairly hard to cut down.</li>
            <li> The color was slightly off</li>
            <li> (I even paid less) and I cannot believe the difference in quality compared to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the wig 4/5 stars because i waited a month and a half for my wig to get here.</li>
            <li> Took about a month and a half to arrive too.</li>
            <li> Its all a pale pink there isn&#x27;t any blonde/brown!</li>
            <li> A little to shiny, but can be dulled down.</li>
            <li> Not true to color in picture</li>
            <li> I like to mess the bangs up a bit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to mess with pinning and re-pinning the hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the wig but was very disappointed to find the upper brownish color is barely even noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair and even though it came with a wig cap, it looked bumpy and weird.</li>
            <li> The wig I received is about shoulder length and all a very pale pink.</li>
            <li> Goes a little below my boob area.</li>
            <li> So it took a little over a month to arrive.</li>
            <li> I did touch the color up[ a little with Crayola skin tone markers</li>
            <li> The sides was so little hair that I got to come the side hair to my checks.</li>
            <li> Instead of being a gradient from brown to pink it looked all pink unless you looked very hard at the wig.</li>
            <li> , it was a faded pink all over, with a lighter thin layer of pink underneath that..</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it is a thin wig.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend you get it unless you know a few tricks to improve</li>
            <li> Once again, the hair is extremely thin (you can actually see the cap).</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is thin, but I probba think that because I&#x27;m use to my extremely thick natural hair.</li>
            <li> The only think that is a little disappointing is the pink.  </li>
            <li> bangs needed very little trimmings, also, a few hairs stick out from being cut??</li>
            <li> its not as long as it is in the picture and is clings to everything and its really thin</li>
            <li> as sdisplayed.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed to get a full blend of an ugly pink blonde blend..</li>
            <li> Thuss the unfortunate end to my first experience with a wig TT^TT sadly.</li>
            <li> My husband told me he thought it looked as real as my incredibly expensive human hair wig (I cringed a bit)</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have a rather small head, but the wig is quite small.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if I&#x27;d buy another wig.    </li>
            <li> The subtle gradation from brown/blonde to pink in the image is not so subtle in person.</li>
            <li> I never have trouble with wig sizes for my head, but this one is very small even without tightening.</li>
            <li> The wig is really thin as other reviews have said.</li>
            <li> But other than false advertisement, the wig is ohhhh-kay.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality.</li>
            <li> very soft and silky, doesnt tangle to bad.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> but it is a little on the thin side.</li>
            <li> , the pink weird layer underneath would not curl no matter what I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I thought there would be at least some of the color as pictured.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not to thick that it looks unnatural</li>
            <li> But for volume, I am not sure!</li>
            <li> but this is a warning that it runs really small!</li>
            <li> fake looking than other wigs</li>
            <li> - A little thin, but nothing too noticeable!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too thick or thin, and it even came with a wig cap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thin my daughters hair to thick for this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to thick or not  too thin.</li>
            <li> It was a little thin for my taste and quite quickt it started to look fake looking</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed in it since I can still see my hair poking out the back despite the fact that I am wearing the head cap it came with.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because I wanted it to look good so badly!</li>
            <li> but it was also really thin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s thin</li>
            <li> This wig came to me way to thin and not longer like everyone elses.</li>
            <li> This wig was a bit too thin.</li>
            <li> The wig is so thin you can see the tracks.</li>
            <li> Shiny, thin, etc.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t even care at all that it is thin.</li>
            <li> WORSE THING</li>
            <li> Thin strands, but</li>
            <li> It was thin and the hair kept falling out.</li>
            <li> do you get your hair that color?&amp;#34; it is not too thin, and does not tangle.</li>
            <li> It is thin, and sheds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also thin and sheds a lot.</li>
            <li> but since it is thin, sometimes the tracks/ wig netting will show.</li>
            <li> Also, if you do believe the hair is too thin</li>
            <li> Its a weeeee bit thin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like thin wigs too much.&lt;br /&gt;-Sheds</li>
            <li> the brightness, gets to be something false</li>
            <li> It has very little hair n thin fibers tho;thus, tangle like crazy.</li>
            <li> Also, the cap of the wig is crazy small</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not so thin that you look completely ill.</li>
            <li> Btw it&#x27;s small!!!</li>
            <li> My advice for people who want to minimize the shine (gives away that the hair is fake) and get rid of the smell,</li>
            <li> The back is the worst part.</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong item when I ordered this one, which resulted in me having two of the gray&amp;purple wigs instead of one of those, and this one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it also sheds profusely.</li>
            <li> I would return it but it would be as expensive as the wig itself</li>
            <li> small smfh disappointed</li>
            <li> Extremely fake looking.</li>
            <li> cause it shows that weird shine.</li>
            <li> Everything else is wrong.</li>
            <li> even in pics WITH a FILTER you can tell it is fake.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t look fake~</li>
            <li> And also fake looking.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This wig is so cute! I love everything about it! It&#x27;s not too shiny and it&#x27;s just the right length! It is so comfortable! It doesn&#x27;t make me sweat or itch:) It does shed a little but not enough to care. I put hair spray on it and let it dry and it looks even more real than before:)</li>
            <li> I received my order on time, and the wig is pretty, but doesn&#x27;t look like what I thought it would look like.</li>
            <li> Great feeling hair. Very close to the texture of my real hair. My only issue is that it is a thin wig. not really an issue so to say because I put extensions in between the rows of hair of different colors.</li>
            <li> My wig was shipped on October 19 and arrived on November 1 which was great and fast. When I got it today and opened the package it came with a wig cap and then it even felt really smooth but the only thing that bothers me is that when I tried brushing it shreds soo much and the bangs were too thin that u can see the wig cap I think it looks better if u wear a beanie</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I expected a decent quality wig for ten bucks. I thought the colour would be like the pictures instead this is what I got. It&#x27;s already shedding and the fringe was cut in a choppy way, had to brush it a certain way. I would not recommend buying this product. It is also very thin.</li>
            <li> the wig loses hair easily and the hair net isn&#x27;t very nice at all.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t look like the picture- the ends are pink, yes, but the pink blends in a lot with the rest of the wig as well and it doesn&#x27;t give the effect that I expected it to have from what the picture looks like. It&#x27;s not super thick, and the hairs fall out pretty easily. The wefts may be visible, depending on how big your head is.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do still like the wig. It feels very soft, is comfortable to wear, and overall pretty cute. And for this price, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty good wig.</li>
            <li> I really lije it i just got it today it sheds a lot witch i realky dont like but it was cheap but it is true to ots color its really long on me witch i love i would recommend this wig to other people</li>
            <li> The color was slightly off but it still looks amazing, and I would give it five stars but it was also really thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the wig would have been beautiful if I had only received it. Ordered back in September.</li>
            <li> I was SO looking forward to this wig, the wig pictures above is gorgeous! My wig was not, then again the wig I received looked NOTHING like the picture above, it was not brown and pink, it was a faded pink all over, with a lighter thin layer of pink underneath that.. The wig is poor quality, SUPER shiny and fake looking, and very thin, you can easily see the webbing beneath the hair when it&#x27;s worn.</li>
            <li> This wig (X&amp;Y ANGEL New Two Tone Long Straight Highlights Hair Wigs Pink MJ051-1) is amazing . Got it a week ahead of schedule ! I love it. Although on the thin side its amazing .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty but it&#x27;s thin, If you brush it you will have a few hairs fall out, but it&#x27;s still very cute and for the price it&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the color I was expecting and it tangled easily</li>
            <li> My wig came on November 30th which was fast because estimated arrival was the 10th-20th December.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a wig to wear with a hat the top is thin so if not styled right you can see the cap. Still is beautiful quality; soft and easy to style looks realistic my blonde was actually blonde and does give an ombré into the pink.&lt;br /&gt;Mine came in a bag, packaging very simple.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the wig I received. It&#x27;s super cute and I get tons of compliments whenever I wear it and people always think it&#x27;s my real hair. I happen to have very long and thick hair naturally, so fitting all of my hair under the wig is always a bit of a challenge and does make it sit a little funny on my head. So I always wear a hat with it. Also from other reviews and pictures that I&#x27;ve seen, the actual coloring of the wig varies tremendously (it&#x27;s kind of ridiculous) so it&#x27;s basically a crapshoot if you order one. I was just lucky enough to get a good one! It was definitely not brown/blonde at all.. Totally pink. 😂</li>
            <li> I really love this! It didn&#x27;t turn out brown and pink, it all kinda was pink. But the pink was like a brownish pink at the top, i&#x27;m still happy with the way it looks. It looks so realistic, it&#x27;s nice and soft, easy to brush and fits perfectly. The shipping was kind of slow but i&#x27;m in the usa and it was being shipped from china. Well worth the wait!!! Buy this!!</li>
            <li> I love this wig! It&#x27;s just as it was described and I wear it a lot!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for Halloween and it looked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I brushed the wig with a brush not meant for the wig, the hairs started falling out, but otherwise it&#x27;s a cute wig. I would recommend this for cosplay/ dressing up or for Halloween.</li>
            <li> When I received the wig It was beautiful. I loved the color and the texture and the length was just my fit. It was a little thin for my taste and quite quickt it started to look fake looking but otherwise a good purchase</li>
            <li> Company responded quick to an issue and I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig! However, it is a bit thin and is very shiny. Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> Super cute wig. Good quality for the price. In my opinion it is thin, but I probba think that because I&#x27;m use to my extremely thick natural hair. Pretty colors. Goes a little below my boob area. Super cute wig. I ordered on December 8th and it arrived on January 9th. So it took a little over a month to arrive. It&#x27;s a bit shinny. In Cameron or video it&#x27;s extremely shinny. But dry shampoo fixed that problem.</li>
            <li> I saw positive feedback, and some negative feedback but i ended up purchasing the wig because it seemed like there was more positive feedback. It&#x27;s not X&amp;Y but it&#x27;s not a  bad wig, it&#x27;s kind of thin, but the net doesn&#x27;t show through the hair. It&#x27;s actually one of my favorite wigs (from amazon) so far. I think it looks super cute!</li>
            <li> This wig came to me way to thin and not longer like everyone elses. Also, there was no color selection option but I ordered it hoping it just came to me as is in the image.  It came to me as a faded purple and the light pink on the tips. That color was actually quick pretty but it&#x27;s not what I ordered. This was a cheap wig so you can&#x27;t expect something amazing bur it&#x27;s worth the money. It&#x27;s more of a costume wig.</li>
            <li> The wig i received is nothing like the wig in the picture. Although, the wig is nice and soft. But it sheds and is not like the one in the picture. It is fully pink.</li>
            <li> Such a lovely wig and so easy to maintain! Great length, great color and exactly as pictures. Looks very realistic and not too shiny!</li>
            <li> Even though it didn&#x27;t look exactly like it in the picture, I was still quite pleased.&lt;br /&gt;By the way: a beanie looks amazing with it :3</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t expect much based on the price. This wig is my least favorite wig I own now. (Out of almost 20 wigs.) I was hoping the color would match what was advertised but not worth the hassle of returning, since it was so cheap. But other than false advertisement, the wig is ohhhh-kay. Strawberry blonde doesn&#x27;t flatter my complexion and really feel it should be advertised properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for those wondering about HEAT RESISTANCE - in my attempt to blend the strawberry whatever color to the pink by curling (as you can see in my photo), curls just fine, the pink weird layer underneath would not curl no matter what I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the colors of this wig, buy it!!! It is a very good deal for the price and overall is a very soft wig and feels pretty good compared to some other cheaper wigs.</li>
            <li> Awesome wig, so pretty and fits well. Beautiful color with a awesome cut...Love it.</li>
            <li> The tightening straps on the inside of the wig were not functional and I had to cut them out :(</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t quite as pastel as the product photo. The blond and pink are both more bold which caught me by surprise, but it grew on me. I still wish it were exactly like the photo, but I love the wig and wear it often.</li>
            <li> The wig came really early, aboub 2 or 3 weeks earlier than listed, the colors are super pretty but the wig is extremely thin and sheds a lot, I&#x27;d have to do quite a few tricks that includes buying a second wig to give it more volume. The bangs are really awkward too, not short enough to be straight bangs, also not long enough to pin to the side for side bangs, so that would most likely require a little trimming/styling as well. The color doesn&#x27;t exactly match the picture, I initially thought it would be a dirty/strawberry blonde to a pastel pink but it&#x27;s more orange-y to a normal pink. I personally don&#x27;t mind at all, just a side note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a lot of work just to maintain the wig, you really do get what you pay for. If you really /really/ want it for the color I don&#x27;t recommend you get it unless you know a few tricks to improve it.&lt;br /&gt;(in the picture I provided all the hair is pulled to the front, normally wigs are thick enough to leave some in the back when you do this so it just goes to show)</li>
            <li> Super thin have to wear a hag or even my blonde hair would show through so disapointed</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair and even though it came with a wig cap, it looked bumpy and weird. The hair on the wig itself is pretty thick but there is not a lot of hair. I can&#x27;t even wear this wif because it just doesn&#x27;t look right, also, the blonde color is a little more dirty blond than it appears in the picture. I would recommend to those girls or boys, that have very thin hair</li>
            <li> Very pretty! One of my favorite wigs. Its so soft feeling even after a year.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item, and when i open the package it was so smooth and soft, but after a day of wearing it, it got very frizzy, tangle, and snarled. I do love the wig, though, it is very beautiful.</li>
            <li> It was too short, extremely Short! Almost like a Bobby hair cut!  4 times shorter  than my hair., the wigs sold at the dollar store look way more decent!  It looks nothing like the pictures from the reviews!</li>
            <li> This product is okayish - not good not bad for my first wig, but I&#x27;m a bittt disappointed because I was really looking forward to the light brown --&amp;#62; pink ombre D: It turned out to be an obnoxious pink which I&#x27;m ok with since I like pink and don&#x27;t mind unnatural hair colors, but THE BROWNNN WHERE ART THOU?? Thuss the unfortunate end to my first experience with a wig TT^TT sadly. **And it doesn&#x27;t really look good without a beanie fyi.</li>
            <li> I love the wig though it is not exactly as it described. Instead of being a gradient from brown to pink it looked all pink unless you looked very hard at the wig. Other than that it&#x27;s quite nice with very few sparse areas. Although it does have a habit of becoming tangled if it comes in contact with any type of cloth.</li>
            <li> This wig was great, packaged very well. Has a weird plastic/synthetic smell on it and is very shiny at first but that&#x27;s normal for new wigs. My advice for people who want to minimize the shine (gives away that the hair is fake) and get rid of the smell, google &amp;#34;wig shine tutorial&amp;#34;. I use this one by alexamadden on deviantart http://alexamadden.deviantart.com/art/Removing-the-shine-to-your-wig-353751870 (but I skip the talc step cus it makes the wig look kind of weird in my opinion) but really any of the tutorials that use fabric softener are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pink is a little darker than in the picture but not that dark. The fade into pink is more subtle than this pic where is just kinda starts suddenly (theres pink hair that go all the way to the top to help with the fading into pink) and the pink section isn&#x27;t as long as the picture shows. But otherwise it&#x27;s a great wig and I am glad to have bought it.</li>
            <li> I completely LOVE this wig, it&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever boughten. It looks great in pictures and at night I&#x27;m sure it would be fine to go out in, but in the daytime I think it would look a bit too thin (though it&#x27;s not the thinnest out there, still has plenty of volume but could definitely use more). ALSO, It comes with a net and I LOVE that it has an attachment for around your head to secure it on...I could jump up and down if I wanted too and it wouldn&#x27;t budge &amp;#60;3 Definitely love that it looks SO real in person too and doesn&#x27;t have a weird glare to it...my husband came home and actually thought I just got my hair done THAT HOW REAL IT LOOKS! He wasn&#x27;t convinced until he had to lift up &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; hair to see that it really wasn&#x27;t my own haha &amp;#60;3 thank you X&amp;Y love your product!</li>
            <li> This wig is perfect.  it is better quality than wigs that I spend about 100 dollars on. It&#x27;s thin in a way that makes it look natural. I personally just don&#x27;t look good in brown hair but this was a gift. The top of it isn&#x27;t really brown it&#x27;s,more of a brownish pink. It doesn&#x27;t really tangle or anything. I love it. It looks really natural.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture! Fits well and looks realistic, also the shipping was really quick! Love it</li>
            <li> I love this wig~! I can&#x27;t wait to wear it out here and there.&lt;br /&gt;Comes like shown so this item is not a waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;The item also arrives before the date as well. :D</li>
            <li> It is confortable and it looks very natural, it also moves so natural! I highly recomend it for everyday use maybe not but it still looks awesome.</li>
            <li> love it! the only thing is, it is very thin and easy to see through in the back.</li>
            <li> This wig was a bit too thin. The back is the worst part. I really liked the color and texture, though. I think it would&#x27;ve been a great wig had they added some more hair to the back. My other X&amp;Y ANGEL wig is way better than this, so I&#x27;ll just carefully check bad reviews before buying their products again. I&#x27;d still recommend their brand in general over others of the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could probably make it look good if you style it correctly or use a hat.</li>
            <li> In love with this wig its so cute!!</li>
            <li> Looks absolute NOTHING like the picture and the wigs worn in reviews. Short length and can hardly see any pink in it. Very disappointing .</li>
            <li> This wig is so smooth and not a hassle to style at all. The color is true to the picture. I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Much darker than pictured. This would be a nicer wig if it were a bit thicker. If you don&#x27;t style it just right the wig cap will show.</li>
            <li> The wig is just like the picture. I was amazed how awesome it looks! Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The wig arrived very quickly and is good quality. My only issue is that I was hoping for the paler pink, but ended up with more of a hot pink. I understand that colors can vary and I do still like the item, now just gotta figure out how to lighten it. :)</li>
            <li> Very nice! Arrived earlier than expected. Its very soft, and no one can really tell its a wig. It fit my head, even though there is a adjustable strap band. Its very good.</li>
            <li> The color of the pink is very dull and you can&#x27;t really see it.</li>
            <li> Not true to color in picture</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look anything like picture very very displeased</li>
            <li> Very thin it kinda shows the cap and the bangs were a bit too long and it looks better with a beanie and sheds like crazy😂😂</li>
            <li> The only thing I could criticize this wig, the colors, the image it shows much light brown color.&lt;br /&gt;And the brightness, gets to be something false but hey, what else is fine.</li>
            <li> CONS&lt;br /&gt;1. The subtle gradation from brown/blonde to pink in the image is not so subtle in person. Basically it&#x27;s like a Cruella De Ville wig. There is no ombre going on at all. The pink is a VERY bright pink, not a soft pastel color at all.&lt;br /&gt;2. The wefts are spaced wide apart and the wig is not very full, so the wig cap will be visible if you&#x27;re not careful. I suggest wearing a beige nylon cap instead of the black net that&#x27;s provided.&lt;br /&gt;3. Since there is no &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; part, you won&#x27;t be able to part it however you want.&lt;br /&gt;4. Sheds easily, so must be brushed carefully from bottom-up.&lt;br /&gt;5. Bangs are super long, which is par for the course with wigs (you can see just how far back I had to position the wig in one of the pics). You can easily cut them to suit your face, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;1. The wig is not as shiny as most. It&#x27;s very soft and it feels the most realistic of all my wigs.&lt;br /&gt;2. While it can shed like crazy, it&#x27;s easy to brush and doesn&#x27;t tangle that much.&lt;br /&gt;3. I LOVED the blonde/brown color on top. It&#x27;s a very realistic shade (especially since it&#x27;s not TOO SHINY! :D). The pink is a very in-your-face cotton candy pink, but I can deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s an okay length, not too long or too short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been drawn to colorful cosplay wigs (I get tired of my curly dark blah hair, haha). I read up on almost every review and knew this was going to be a crapshoot purchase. To be honest, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I love it anyway (and how it doesn&#x27;t wash out my complexion *too much*)! Someone did suggest that this listing may be a knock-off of the true X&amp;Y Angel wig. I DID go with one of the *slightly more expensive* purchase options because you get what you pay for, right? Hahaha.... no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you&#x27;re wanting to get what&#x27;s in the product image, expect to be disappointed or fall in love with whatever you get. It is a cheap wig after all!a cheap wig after all!  (Pics were taken with different natural lighting)</li>
            <li> Mine had no blonde in it. It was pink on the top and a little darker pink at the bottom. I expected it to have cheap quality and to be thin but I thought there would be at least some of the color as pictured.</li>
            <li> The hair is pretty thin and falls off when I lightly brush it, but I still like it</li>
            <li> It is a very nice wig. I love it. It is a little more pink than I thought but still looks nice.</li>
            <li> the hair comes just like the image and whats even better is that it is super soft even better then my own hair, this wig deserves a 5.</li>
            <li> I love this wigs sooo much! It&#x27;s so cute, and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments.  It looks real, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too thin.  I was supposed to get it between November 22 and December 10 but I got it November 8! I was so excited to see it in my mail box 3 weeks early!  The only think that is a little disappointing is the pink.  It doesn&#x27;t look all that blended into the hair.  It looks kinda like I have short hair and I just added pink extensions.  I still highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Second time ordering and I got a different wig.  My friend got a different one from both of mine.&lt;br /&gt;Cute but not consistent and some are better than others.</li>
            <li> I bought the other color and liked it so much I had to try the pink. Stinks that it is made of plastic, wish they could have used rubber, but it looks just like the picture. It is exciting and fun and thick.</li>
            <li> much more pink all over, does not fit well</li>
            <li> Just like the picture! Worth the money</li>
            <li> One of my favorites of my wig collection. I like it much more than expected. I did touch the color up[ a little with Crayola skin tone markers but I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig regardless of all the people who said the wig was all pink. I was hoping it would be like in the pictures! Blonde on top and pink on bottom but mine is dark pink on top and light pink on the bottom. Still looks awesome and does not shed much but I would have rather had the blonde color. So just be in mind when buying this product that there&#x27;s a high chance it will come to you all pink.</li>
            <li> Based off of the description, the wig I received is not the pictured product. I am extremely disappointed and upset. Its not even the same color! Its all a pale pink there isn&#x27;t any blonde/brown! The wig is so thin you can see the tracks. This wig isn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a different wig from Orino Beauty  (I even paid less) and I cannot believe the difference in quality compared to this one. Take your money elsewhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you somehow get a legitimate X&amp;Y Angel wig you should post who the seller was. Mine was from FutureTrend</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would be!!! But it&#x27;s still awesome and beautiful</li>
            <li> I love it its beautiful</li>
            <li> So this wig had a lot of positive reviews and I got it. I&#x27;ve gotten wigs from x&amp;y before and have been very pleased. The colors were like the picture but the brown on the top was off . I&#x27;m fair skinned and that shade of brown just looked strange. I tried dry shampoo and baby powder to lower the shine but it didnt help much. The pink on the bottom is nice. Like the picture, the only way I&#x27;d pull this wig off is with a beanie.</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong item when I ordered this one, which resulted in me having two of the gray&amp;purple wigs instead of one of those, and this one. The rest of the items I ordered, I am happy with. All of the wigs I get from them are gorgeous and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this three stars because I&#x27;ve always had good dealings with this seller, but they&#x27;re being very difficult about replacing the item that I was shipped incorrectly, and I&#x27;m a little annoyed by that.</li>
            <li> I got a different wig than the one shown. It&#x27;s all all pink. This wig looks cute but it&#x27;s extemely poor quality and you can see the mesh through the hair. There just isn&#x27;t enough hair on this wig. Pretty disappinted. But it&#x27;s cheap so you only get what you pay for. Would not recomend!</li>
            <li> the only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars is because I had some problems the first time I ordered and after more than a month of waiting I hadn&#x27;t recieved my wig. I contacted them and they quickly fixed the problem and mailed me a new one. almost a month from that day I recieved my wig today and I am so in love it with it!! it&#x27;s almost exactly like the picture and it&#x27;s just so cute, would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Sheds, is pretty thin, and snug. But I love it! I haven&#x27;t taken it off since I opened the package. I own 8 other wigs from having a shaved head for years, and can&#x27;t wait to get them off. But this wig just makes me smile. For the price, this is yet another amazon gem!</li>
            <li> My wig well it&#x27;s all pink it has no blonde in it at all...  But it&#x27;s a nice wig, just really sad about it being 100% pink... I have to buy a new one because of it..</li>
            <li> Arrived on the date as expected. Opened up and extremely disappointed with this wig. All pink sheds and is ill-fitting. Total poop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this wig. It fits perfectly, has a beautiful fade from one color to another, looks so real, feels amazing, and is just so much fun to wear. nobody ever believes it&#x27;s a wig!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay - fun for short use, but really thin, and looks &#x27;wig-like&#x27;.  Shiny, thin, etc.  A fun change for a costume or temporary trial of new hair.  Low price is nice, though!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig on June 22, it arrived July 5th. Only took 12 days to arrive after it had shipped. Very very soft wig, natural shine, fits nicely (On the biggest, and smallest heads) Detangles well, gorgeous wig! I applied heat, using my curling wand on setting number 10, it curled a few pieces, handled the heat very well, much easier to straighten. This is my first wig, as ive been buying and selling hair extensions for years I decided to buy this, very good even for beginners. This seller has AMAZING quality wigs.</li>
            <li> Trust the reviews, this isn&#x27;t X&amp;Y. It looks like two different wigs put together with no layering to even hide the separation.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this wig! I&#x27;ve worn it a few times already and have only had fallout of about 3 strands or so. It&#x27;s soft and not too shiny (meaning, could be made more matte with dry shampoo or such if desired, should be no problem). The top scalp part looks really nice. Very happy with this wig for the price.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent X&amp;Y Angel buyer, their wigs are amazing, they fit my head, arrive quickly, and come in a box. This wig sheds way too much, is way too tight, arrived weeks later than my others, and was is a bag. There is no X&amp;Y Angel tag on the wig. It did not come with a wig cap. It looks like a cheap halloween wig. I don&#x27;t know where the X&amp;Y Angel seller link went, and I hope they come back soon because I have not found any wigs like theirs.</li>
            <li> I find it with these wigs they could be thicker. Other then that the hair looks great.</li>
            <li> Totally cute wig though color is different. The top is more of a dusty rose color, fading gradually to a bubblegum pastel pink at the bottom. It is totally beautiful. The wig is a bit thin but for 12$ and free shipping it was an amazing deal for such a good quality, lower end wig. I look super duper cute like an anime character. The bangs were a bit long as I have a small small head, But I just cut them til they looked good and now it is perfect. I decided to wear it with my black bandana to hide any gaps between the hair as it is not very thick and you can see the cap through the hair. I think it is so cute anyways so I don&#x27;t even care at all that it is thin. I have no hair anyways because I have a shaved head so it&#x27;s perfect for days that I want to be more girly than boyish :3</li>
            <li> Wig fits very well, and looks very nice. The brown is hardly brown, more pink than anything and there is no real change in color throughout the wig. I will still use this wig, but it doesn&#x27;t look very realistic. Love the wig for the price though.</li>
            <li> I bought this wiggy for a show coming up, and it got here a week before thankfully! It said it was going to get here the day of, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging could be better because the boxing it came in was pretty mashed up.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily the wig was fine, wrapped in plastic and netting, X&amp;Y tag of authentication was there too! Came with a wig net for your hair, works well but it is best to buy a higher quality for longer use of a wig netting.&lt;br /&gt;Wig bangs needed very little trimmings, also, a few hairs stick out from being cut?? I didn&#x27;t do that so I have no clue. It&#x27;s sticking out of the lacing of the wig, although hard to hide, brushing the hair over works just fine. The pink on the wig is a bit brighter than I expected, I wish there were a way to lighten it!&lt;br /&gt;This wig fits my head comfortably, and is very long! It goes to my mid-back. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; with a long torso so, maybe longer on those opposite of me? After I washed it and sprayed with dry shampoo, looked so natural that many of my friends said they liked how I dyed my hair! So good quality indeed! Can be heat styled, and when I brush it out, it flows back to it&#x27;s straight quality. Best not to use a hot comb, blow dryer or hair curling iron because it will damage kanekalon fibres! Use a hair curling wand or flat iron on low setting~ All in all, very great quality for a cheap price and super cute caramel brown colour. Could be thicker but it&#x27;s not very thin. It&#x27;s a natural thinness. But for volume, I am not sure! Possibly extensions on wig? I will be buying wigs more from X&amp;Y Angel!</li>
            <li> The wig arrived two weeks before it was estimated to arrive. The color is beautiful and it is very soft. This was a great buy! I do recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> The color is great on it...how it feels is amazing. Just like real hair. It arrived quickly. Only down side is. You cant really tell from the pictures on here but it is a little on the thin side. Other then that. Great buy for the price.http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review/</li>
            <li> Awesome wig loved it looks super real</li>
            <li> Cute wig and great for the price. My husband told me he thought it looked as real as my incredibly expensive human hair wig (I cringed a bit) but I thought that was cool. I like to mess the bangs up a bit. Really cute rocknroll look. I recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something fun occasionally. It sheds quite a bit (totally normal for this price range) and tangles fairly easily but I adore the colors. I like this wig. I think I&#x27;ll go put it on now.</li>
            <li> very little hair, red wig looks</li>
            <li> Before I start, I have to say that I HAVE noticed the other reviews and I understand that maybe I just got a bad copy, but I&#x27;m still going to give my honest review of what I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the wig is incredible soft. Unfortunately, it also sheds profusely. The dark blonde doesn&#x27;t really blend with the pink well, but it does look pretty realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting, it&#x27;s still a decent wig.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. WORSE THING IVE EVER BOUGHTEN I HATE IT ITS SO UGLY FIRST OF ALL ITS NOT EVEN BLONDE ITS A NASTY RATCHET PINK BANGS ARE RETARDED ANS SUPER THIN AND FAKE FEELING TERRIBLE ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE</li>
            <li> It was a great wig and my friend can&#x27;t wait to wear it to Youmacon</li>
            <li> (I would have given it a 5 but I have yet to go out in public with it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I was expecting this to arrive at my doorstep a month from now. It arrived so early, I had a surprise moment for myself because I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I love it! It&#x27;s not too long to look unnatural or too much for my body. It has a bit of a shine towards the top that dry shampoo took care of. It wasn&#x27;t too thick or thin, and it even came with a wig cap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pink is exactly like the pic. I found the blonde had a bit more strawberry in it and looked more of a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; color.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs were a bit long but I&#x27;m ok with it because I found it was easy to make a lovely side-part/side-sweep bang&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I can&#x27;t wait to wear it out in public!!</li>
            <li> Soft to touch and looks nice with hat !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thin my daughters hair to thick for this can I return it</li>
            <li> I had expected the blonde and pink colors to be as depicted in the photo but when I received it in the mail, the hair colors were actually much darker and varied in different lighting. Otherwise the quality is great and the length allowed me to trim it down to the correct style I wanted.</li>
            <li> i looked like iggy azalea and looked nothing like it did on the computer</li>
            <li> When I recieved this I was shocked with how beautiful and soft it was. I am in love with it and it is easy to work with. It is heat resistant. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because the bangs were much longer than expected and is so shiny you can tell it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the wig. It&#x27;s super soft and beautiful. It&#x27;s slightly more pink on top than pictured but it&#x27;s still really amazing. I&#x27;ve gotten nothing but compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color.  Thin strands, but I like the long length.  Cute to wear for cosplay. I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> First of all this wig came in super fast. It was supposed arrive the 19th and it arrived today. Secondly, the colour is vibrant which is beautiful. Thirdly, the wig is super soft and does not tangle for me. My only problems are that the wig is a bit thin and you can see the lace on top but you easily fix that with a hat. Also this isnt a huge problem but the bangs were long, so I had to trim it a bit. but other than that this wig is amazing and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have had this wig in my wish list for quite some time now &amp; I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. I have a rather small head, but the wig is quite small. I look at customer photos, and the look nothing like what I received, they look better. It arrived rather tangled &amp; I could see the tracks once I put it on...It&#x27;s not TERRIBLE, but it&#x27;s not the quality I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The wig I got does not look like the picture. First the hair are shorter, second there is two purple strand in the front. The pink is much more flashy than in the picture as well. I am very disappointed because I wanted it to look good so badly! I would return it but it would be as expensive as the wig itself so I&#x27;ll probably just give it away.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to be ok  for halloween</li>
            <li> looks great . takes forever to get to the U.S. if you don&#x27;t mind waiting .</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTE LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;I made a video on this wig. It was my very first wig EVER and I really made a god decision. Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;zBf-p1RRHhI</li>
            <li> My order was to be delivered some where between Oct 10-29 it is now Sept 25 and I received it today. The wig its self is absolutely beautiful it&#x27;s not to thick that it looks unnatural but it&#x27;s not so thin that you look completely ill. How ever just like any synthetic wig it does have that shine but all I do to get rid of that is spray a little dry hair shampoo onto it and comb it through it with a wide tooth comb. I love it so much. I will definitely order from them again!! Also if you want to thicken it up I got one of the X&amp;Y ANGEL 2013 Two Tone One Piece Straight Synthetic Thick Hair Extension Clip-on Hairpieces to go under the wig and thickens it up really well I put the extension on before I put the wig cap on and then the wig itself.</li>
            <li> It was thin and the hair kept falling out. I ended up throwing it away and wasting my money.</li>
            <li> I love it! people have came up to me multiple times and asked &amp;#34;how do you get your hair that color?&amp;#34; it is not too thin, and does not tangle. but i comb mine very often. I&#x27;m giving the wig 4/5 stars because i waited a month and a half for my wig to get here. other than that, I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Cute Wig better quality then I was hoping for, for the price!  Works well with my steampunk costume.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful but wig cap inside is super small smfh disappointed</li>
            <li> Its so adorable! Came early. It is thin, and sheds. The wig cap it came with is really crappy and ripped on a bobby pin ;A; I will be buying better wig caps. The beige kinda blends with the pink, so its mostly pink. But its still adorable! I had been getting some of my orders early and was hoping one of the wigs I ordered would come today and it did! :D I kept checking at the door for it ^w^ Will likely purchase from X&amp;Y ANGEL again!</li>
            <li> First off this wig came faster than expected! it came a week before it was expected to, which is a plus! the price is amazing. The wig is beautiful and soft, however, the light brown doesn&#x27;t look good with my skin tone (I&#x27;m more of an olive skin tone) So I say be careful, as not everyone would look good in this wig. I plan on wearing it with a hat, the pink I can work with. Overall I&#x27;m highly satisfied. No issues with the seller.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig! Soft and the colors match the description. It just came a whole two weeks late!</li>
            <li> I think it was ok. I had to cut the bangs some because it just didnt fit my head well, also without a hat on or some band you can see bald spots. overall it isnt horrible but its more for a halloween costume rather than something wearable daily.</li>
            <li> Its more pink than brown at the top unlike the picture wheresvits really brown but I love the wig none the less.</li>
            <li> I was supposed to get a dip die wig. Brown /pink as sdisplayed.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed to get a full blend of an ugly pink blonde blend.. And I can&#x27;t bother with returns on cheap items. The top is kinda purple.&lt;br /&gt;Bad. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Falls out soooooo easily.. It&#x27;s not really blonde and pink. It&#x27;s like pink and lighter pink. You can see the net through the cap, so I have to wear a hat with it. It&#x27;s pretty yeah, but a pain to brush because it keeps falling out. I notice the girl in the ad is also wearing a hat. Took about a month and a half to arrive too.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful because other customer photos were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wig was extremely thin, shiny, and a disgusting sick pink color. No trace of warm healthy brown. I am throwing it straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> The color is very nice on my azn skin. The bangs r long enough to trim to fit my face. It has very little hair n thin fibers tho;thus, tangle like crazy. I got to bring a comb with me. Btw it&#x27;s small!!! There was like 2in gap on my forehead so buy a blonde wig cap!! The sides was so little hair that I got to come the side hair to my checks. 4stars for the color, length, and long bangs to trim.</li>
            <li> Bought this and several other wigs for Vida Joven in Nicaragua to use in skits. They loved them.</li>
            <li> Came way earlier than expected. It&#x27;s super soft And easily brushed. The top part is more pink than pictured, but I&#x27;m more than content about that.</li>
            <li> The wig was much thinner than I was hoping. I have naturally dark hair so using nude hair nets only helped a little. The real bummer was with the wig being so thin you could clearly see the netting of both the wig and caps.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.  I have a small head and it barely fits.  I can&#x27;t imagine doing things to this wig like the description describes- perming it--because just running my fingers down the length made hair come out in like 7-10 strand clumps.  IT WON&#x27;T last long!  The cheap price doesn&#x27;t make up for the poor quality unless you are ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A COSTUME WIG.  Then you should be happy with the price and quality because you only plan to wear it a time or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some rooms of my home the top looks about 30% brown and 70% pink, and the bottom is neon pink.  But the top looks completely pink outside and in other rooms.  The picture is very, very deceiving.  I think you&#x27;re little girl playing dress up might really enjoy this--but know you&#x27;ll have long strands of hair all over your house!</li>
            <li> Its the wrong color :( it&#x27;s all pink</li>
            <li> beautiful! totally can use straightener on it! it&#x27;s a head turner. only complaint is it sheds for a little while, and then you have long pink hairs everywhere ha ha</li>
            <li> I just got it and I do see some differences from the picture, but the quality is amazing and it fits my head perfectly, which most wigs don&#x27;t and it&#x27;s so soft. It&#x27;s the best quality wig I&#x27;ve gotten so far.</li>
            <li> Lovely, but be wary- it&#x27;s a bit lighter than shown in the image. It&#x27;s more of a honey brown color than a dark brown color, and the ombré looks a biiiit tacky, but it&#x27;s nice and lovely for the price.</li>
            <li> This wig is not blonde at the top as shown. It is light pink.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed, it looks fake and the fibers are very thin and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I usually love X&amp;Y Angels wigs, but this was a let down.</li>
            <li> Its very soft and long! The bangs are extremely long which is good because you can cut them how you like but hair does fall out quickly and tangles fast. Also if you don&#x27;t have a wig cap order one because it doesn&#x27;t come with one</li>
            <li> I am wondering if possibly I purchased this through an off-brand seller somehow because the wig I received doesn&#x27;t look like the wig other people received. Mine is shorter and instead of fading from blond to pink it turns from light pink to hot pink. I notified the company and they promptly sent me another wig (their costumer service is awesome, they&#x27;re really fast) but the replacement wig turned out to be exactly the same, so I&#x27;m a bit confused, maybe I do have the right wig? Either way it&#x27;s an awesome wig, the fade is really natural looking with lots of multicolored streaks in it to keep it from looking really fake. It&#x27;s soft, easy to untangle and heat resistant so you can style it different ways.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s a very nice wig! But.... The reason I left out a star is because the hair isnt like its dip dyed. It&#x27;s like a layer of brown over a layer of pink. But the brown is shorter than the pink so that&#x27;s how it shows... But anyways. It doesn&#x27;t Shed and its soft and really nice!</li>
            <li> I got this wig and it looks absoulutly nothing like the picture!! I was waiting to cosplay for the up coming con but now i have to cosplay as a different character  my advice is to buy a wig more expensive cause the hair on this one falls !</li>
            <li> Its Great Its Beautiful and it came very quickly overall its a nice product for anyone who likes to cosplay❤❤❤</li>
            <li> Great for your model to wear for photography or any other occasion</li>
            <li> Love the feel and the colors... arrived on time..getting lots of compliments...thanks will order again!!!</li>
            <li> Extremely fake looking. It&#x27;s a fun costume wig but not natural looking at all. The hair net can be seen pretty easily. The color was more of a weird blonde pink on top and not just blonde. The bottom wAs a bright pink not cotton candy pink.</li>
            <li> This wig was a big letdown. I bought this model X&amp;Y Angel pink and brown wig a couple years ago for $25 or $30 and it is one of my absolute favorite wigs ever. The pink is nicely blended into the brown. When I saw the same wig being offered for under $10, I jumped at the chance to get a second one so I could use it when my original wears out. Well let me tell you, this is not the same wig at all. It is simply a cheaper wig with pink on the bottom and brown on the top. The original was thick enough that no wefts were showing and nicely blended (it even has pink hair blended into the brown hair) and transitioned very nicely from brown to pink, this one is just shorter light brown hair with longer pink hair underneath. The wefts show, and it is not at all the same quality as the one I already have. It is definitely not an X&amp;Y Angel wig. For under $10 it is a nice enough wig that you&#x27;d expect for the price but if you are expecting a real quality wig do not waste your money on this one, unless you are buying directly from the manufacture (as it states in the description.). I will attach pictures of my original real wig side by side with the one I just recieved, the X&amp;Y is on the left.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig color and design is completely right but there&#x27;s one problem. It&#x27;s too thin u can actually see the camp underneath in certain parts on the top. I&#x27;m still gonna rock it but I&#x27;ll have to cover up the holes with a bow or a beanie.</li>
            <li> My wig just came today in the mail two days ago. Originally, I bought this wig on September 3rd, and it was supposed to be here by October 16th at the latest. October 16th rolled around and it still wasn&#x27;t here so I emailed the seller asking where it was. They id respond and apologized, saying they would send a new one. I&#x27;m curious as to what happened to the first one, but whatever, at least they dealt with it. That&#x27;s one of the only reasons I can&#x27;t give this five stars. Other than that, the color isn&#x27;t exactly as it is in the picture; the pink is accurate, but there&#x27;s not really a lot of brown/it blends into the pink a lot so there&#x27;s that. But it&#x27;s still super cute. Wear the bangs swept to the side because they&#x27;re pretty long but good if you want to trim them/make them straight across. Haven&#x27;t had as lot of experience shedding which is good (because my last one was around the same price and it was terrible. from a different seller. The cap fits pretty well, is a little tiny, but not much, and i have to make sure to keep all my hair covered which just means i need to put a little bit more effort in. all in all a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this wig! I wanted to order a light colored wig to see how well it went with my completion, might order a blond or a red wig next to see. I have recently developed an obsession to wigs and want to play around wih them! Don&#x27;t judge me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this wig on March 7. Though there wasn&#x27;t anyway to keep track on where the order was, I got here on March 26. So I was happily surprised when I got home from school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is thin but it has some good coverage, especially at the bangs. The color for me I would say it does not look like the picture but the brown came in as a more pale brown with more pink scattered around. I&#x27;d recommend this wig it&#x27;s absolutely stunning!</li>
            <li> Loved it and loooove this company! Will deff order again!</li>
            <li> BEST WIG EVER not too shiny. Looks great even bangs. Best with beany. Outside so hair don&#x27;t fly away an get tangled I got soo many compliments I love love and recommend to everyone who wants a realistic wig. Best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought off amazon and I bought over 70 items!!</li>
            <li> I really like this wig except that it&#x27;s not thick but not thin. Also its so big on me it folds in the back so I will only wear it with a beanie.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is small fitting around the head. I have an average sized head for females in America and even on the loosest setting this wig is a bit to tight to wear for too long. I&#x27;m going to give it time to stretch a bit but this is a warning that it runs really small! It&#x27;s a thinner wig but with some brushing you can&#x27;t see the net underneath. Mine was pretty true to the color on here. I need to mess with the bangs quite a bit to make them look as natural as possible. It also arrived before the estimated date and was NOT tangled! That I really love and appreciate.</li>
            <li> This is my first wig and came in 20 days which is pretty quick but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in the wig. The netting is very small and the wig just looks like a blonde top layer then a pink under layer instead of ombre. The top color is a nice brownish blonde but the pink is a bright almost-neon pink. The hair is soft and not too shiny but the netting shows through at the top. Did not come with a wig cap and was delivered in a plastic bag with not tag. Not sure if this wig was really from X&amp;Y Angel.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture. Got lots of compliments, no one could tell it was a wig. Just make sure if youre in photos, the flash is off cause it shows that weird shine.</li>
            <li> The wig is pretty, but the hair is very thin on top. You can see the wig lace on top... But I plan to wear with my beanie cap so it will be ok.</li>
            <li> Very nice. It was much shorted than I expected. It rested just below my shoulders but above my breasts. It doesn&#x27;t really look like the images. It was more pink than anything and the blonde and pink on the top are mixed making it look like and pink shaded ombre. It was not a blonde to pink ombre like displayed. It was thick an full which was nice and didn&#x27;t really shed much. Over all its not bad.</li>
            <li> The wig is a bit thin, and the wig cap is pretty small. Otherwise it is a really fun wig! one of my favorites, if only it could stay on better.</li>
            <li> arrived far faster then i expected. very soft and silky, doesnt tangle to bad. looks a tad different from the picture color wise but beyond that its really nice!</li>
            <li> The style is correct- long length and bangs. Everything else is wrong. It&#x27;s not really two tone- my whole wig is pink. It&#x27;s also thin and sheds a lot. It&#x27;s cute if you&#x27;re looking for a strawberry blonde wig and it&#x27;s just about worth the price, maybe even a little less.</li>
            <li> Love love love it especially because its so easy to style and doesn&#x27;t tangle to much :) I want one with blue ot green tips now haha</li>
            <li> One of the better wigs that I own and for a great price! Super cute and feels so soft!</li>
            <li> My wig came earlier then expected. The color on top wasn&#x27;t brown but it was like a grayish pink. Oh well. I still love the wig.</li>
            <li> its not same :/ its all pink</li>
            <li> GREAT WIG FOR A GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this wig because it got gross pretty quickly. Dried up pretty fast and just turned so dull and rough. I bought better wigs for 10 dollars than this. Not something I would recommend, unless you&#x27;re just looking for a one time use.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to arrive on November 3rd, although I had gotten it about a week early. For $9, this wig is stunning, probably a little on the thin side, but for me the wig tracks don&#x27;t show, so having it be slightly thin isn&#x27;t much of a problem. The only thing I would say I don&#x27;t like, is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come with a wig cap, and that you&#x27;ll either have to trim the bangs slightly, or use a hair clip to get them out of your eyes. Overall, stunning wig!</li>
            <li> Its to pink on top but i still like it.   Update: I still have this wig and i wear it alot. its been a year now that ive had it and im still inlove. I put it up alot aswell.</li>
            <li> come in way earlier than suggest arrival, feels secure around the head, color is just like the picture very pleased with purchase!!!</li>
            <li> this looks NOTHING like the picture. i was expecting blonde with a light pink ombre the whole wig is pink with some blond in the bangs. very thin and you can tell it is a wig. the wig cap and your hair shows if you don&#x27;t wear a beanie. very disappointed. also sheds like crazy. its cute for pictures but could not wear it out. even in pics WITH a FILTER you can tell it is fake.</li>
            <li> I like the wig its a good length and came on time. It looks pretty but the gradient effect isn&#x27;t very prominent because the colors don&#x27;t really look that different. Other than that it is a great wig and I would recommend it for just casual wear or cosplay!</li>
            <li> Its definitely not two tone.. solid pink!</li>
            <li> its not as long as it is in the picture and is clings to everything and its really thin</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig. It&#x27;s a light dirty blonde that fades into a nice pastel pink. Great quality and it arrived before estimated.</li>
            <li> Love love love! Color not blonde but still way adorable.</li>
            <li> Came on time and very high quality</li>
            <li> Bought this on New Years, just got it yesterday. The net shows a bit in the back, but the hair itself is beautiful. It does shine a little more than normal hair would, but dulling it down with dry shampoo helps. It does tangle a lot more than expected, but they aren&#x27;t bad tangles, and it&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m throwing my backpack on and off all day. I like this wig, for the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it... if you wear a hat.</li>
            <li> At the price paid I was not expecting much, and should&#x27;t be. I got the wig and let me say very different from the picture? It was not a brown/blonde overtone but instead the pink lowlights were mixed in with the upper color. It ended up looking like a light pink wig rather than the two shades described in the picture or description (its not two toned!) Also the wig tangles easily! And its not high quality material (of course). The wig is actually pretty small sized for heads. I never have trouble with wig sizes for my head, but this one is very small even without tightening. My head is not even big nor do I have a lot of hair (I have short hair). Either way, the wig is also very thin and can be seen easily that its a wig since its so thin (maybe it good to wear it with hats?). I did like that it was cut (?) however not styled (since it isn&#x27;t straight at the top but rather wavy?) and that the packaging brought a wig cap! I have a couple but it never fails to have another one! :)</li>
            <li> I received this wig yesterday after 2-3 weeks of waiting. It&#x27;s super soft, and is a good amount of hair. I have a fairly chubby face and kind of a big head, so I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t fit. It fits decently. Not perfect, but good enough. It looks cute without a hat but definitely cuter with one. The bad part about this wig is that the bangs are ridiculously long, covering over my eyes completely, but pinned back it&#x27;s okay. I will probably end up cutting off some length eventually, though, so I don&#x27;t have to mess with pinning and re-pinning the hair. The color is a bit off from the photos, the brown color doesn&#x27;t show much, but I don&#x27;t have any issues with that. I love the color. I would recommend this wig if you like a soft pink color. Worth the wait. (:</li>
            <li> This hair sux...waist of time dnt buy</li>
            <li> Beautifulllllllll wig! High quality and luckily for me, I didn&#x27;t have an issue with it being thin! (I noticed some of the reviews said it was fairly thin in back, but it was just fine on mine! Love, love, love it! The colors are definitely darker than in the picture, but it was a nice color still, so I don&#x27;t mind at all. The gradient isn&#x27;t reallly that much of a gradient, it&#x27;s a pretty distinct color change. It was very nice to wear out, and didn&#x27;t tangle up badly like some of my other wigs do.</li>
            <li> thought it would have less pink at the top like in picture, but like it. came in good time</li>
            <li> My wig just arrived today, on time. The wig is very pretty and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it. It shed a little when it came but nothing extreme. A good buy!</li>
            <li> I actually love the color and the texture is amazing and so is the length. The bang length and regular length. The wig is really thin as other reviews have said. I don&#x27;t mind the thinness at the bottom but since it is thin, sometimes the tracks/ wig netting will show. So a hat may be necessary if you cannot style it so the netting stays covered. Also, if you do believe the hair is too thin all together then you can get matching extensions to wear under the wig and it will be fuller except at the top. I love it and I&#x27;d recommend it especially because of the time it was delivered in.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the wig I ordered isn&#x27;t blended at all and isn&#x27;t even the same color.</li>
            <li> I like the color and the touch to it.&lt;br /&gt;even though the tracks are like showing, I&#x27;d wear a beanie.&lt;br /&gt;but I love the hair &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I really like the wig but was very disappointed to find the upper brownish color is barely even noticeable. The wig looks almost completely pale pink. I gave this four stars because I still really like the style and the color despite it not being what it looks like in the image.</li>
            <li> The brown on this wig is much darker, and it does not fade into the pink like in the picture. It is a much more drastic look.</li>
            <li> tangles easy and falls apart after brushing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about other people&#x27;s wig but the one I received had the exact same color as the one in the picture. Only thing off was the bangs but it&#x27;s really no big deal. I received a lot of compliments for how realistic this wig looked!!!</li>
            <li> Omg this wig is perfect!! I love how it looks kind of real but it IS kind of thin, so if that is like a thing for you... maybe not? I love it though! The top beige color is more pink-ish than the picture shows though. Still, 10/10 cute wig. I look super kawaii in it.</li>
            <li> This wig is beautiful. I like the colors and it looks so real</li>
            <li> I loved this wig! I had some thin spots showing, but if you brush it right, it won&#x27;t show. A lot of people complimented me thinking this was my real hair! I own a lot of wigs, and as a heavy cosplayer I know my wigs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pro - BEAUTIFUL! not shiny, not fake looking, smooth, and looks real. what else is there to say about that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con - A little thin, but nothing too noticeable! Just brush it right, and you won&#x27;t be able to move the hair around without the cap showing. YOu&#x27;d have to have someone check the back of it just to make sure.</li>
            <li> A bit different from the picture, as the pink is actually a separate layer, and the blond is more yellow. Not bad for a starter wig, however! It sheds, but not to the point of being unwearable and you might want to air it out before you wear it, unless you&#x27;re curious about what the inside of a warehouse smells like.</li>
            <li> The wig came within a week of my purchase.  it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous, and very very soft.  it sheds a bit, but not to the point where I would worry.  I&#x27;m wearing it out for the first time tomorrow and I am super excited!! doesn&#x27;t look fake~ the colors were pretty accurate!</li>
            <li> Not very good quality. I ordered this and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much and I got exactly what I thought I would. Tangles easily, sheds a lot, and the bangs are In need of styling.</li>
            <li> Again awful nothing like in the picture!! There was no brown it was full baby pink thin tangled not worth it at all</li>
            <li> the wig itself was beautiful but, it sheads like really really bad if your only useing it for photography its fine, but after one use its not very effective</li>
            <li> I like it but it&#x27;s not the color it&#x27;s says it is or looks like it is its wayyyy more pink</li>
            <li> I would give this no stars if I could. I am extremely upset about this purchase. The wig I received is about shoulder length and all a very pale pink. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product; unreliable source.</li>
            <li> &#x27; Only Downside Is That It&#x27;s Not Blonde ; It&#x27;s Like A Pastel Pink . But It&#x27;s Soft, Bangs Are Gorgeous, Easily Stylish, And Long.</li>
            <li> Its a weeeee bit thin.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL! Love it! Very Beautiful and Soft! I love it! It fits Perfect on my head. Thank You!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really pink. like really pink. but i dont hate it</li>
            <li> Love it! More quality for the price!</li>
            <li> I deff recommend this wig. It&#x27;s not to thick or not  too thin. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This came and didn&#x27;t look like this at all, it is not two tone, it is all light pink and very Thin, you can see my hair underneath it. Very unhappy with it, but I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this and actually got it I noticed it looks nothing like the one in the picture. Definetly trick of light. And also fake looking. You can see the wig cap while wearing it. I do wear from time to time when I am just at home and want to wear it but definetly not for everyday wear or public use. Good for maybe a costume wig or something. But definetly not realistic.</li>
            <li> Got it earlier then I expected it to get here. It&#x27;s actually an amazing wig first time I buy one and was amaze. Would buy more.</li>
            <li> Meh....I should have listened to the other reviews. VERY VERY VERY thin. It was cheap, so i will keep, not worth the return. BUT if I wear it (probably wont) it will have to be worn with a hat. I can see the wig cap no matter how i try to hide it.&lt;br /&gt;Colors were quiet different as well.</li>
            <li> Should have Listened....It is very Thin i will agree, Wig cap shows. better with a Hat. Thank goodness i have plenty of those.....-sigh- i will say it is ok for $9 bucks and free shipping. Also note this thing Shed like crazy upon arrival....wow.</li>
            <li> Cons--  The wig is a little thin (amount 1/4 the thickness of my natural hair). Without a hat on, you can definitely see the cap of the wig. Also, the cap of the wig is crazy small (then again, I have a larger head). A little to shiny, but can be dulled down. Does not curl for s***. The bangs are outrageously long, and fairly hard to cut down. The shipping also takes awhile (ordered mine November 16 received November 29th).    Pros-- The wig itself is around $7 to $8 USD. You do get what you paid for. Great for Halloween and maybe daily wear, if you fix the intense shine. The \\&quot;real scalp\\&quot; section of the wig cap does look like a scalp.    Overall--  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR. Once again, the hair is extremely thin (you can actually see the cap). I honestly feel like the bad out ways the good. Not really sure if I&#x27;d buy another wig.    3.5/5</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig &amp;#60;3 I love it. Hair doesn&#x27;t fall out, doesn&#x27;t tangle, the cap doesn&#x27;t show,  its just beautiful. The brown was curled tho so I took my straightner to it and it was perfect then. I love this wig.</li>
            <li> love its hair style, but the hair comes too easily. I am not sure how many times I could wear it, but good quality as comparing to its price</li>
            <li> Good quality and shipped earlier than expected. Fit was comfortable and looked real! :)</li>
            <li> Super soft and cute, perfect colors</li>
            <li> Looks great. Much better than I had anticipated for the price. The brown up top is highlighted with the pink so the ombre blends seamlessly. Is a little shiny but nothing some dry shampoo can&#x27;t fix. All in all, completely worth the price and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Delivered faster than expected, quality is OK (it&#x27;s a cheap wig) but the look is the same as pictures. Fun!</li>
            <li> fits nice love it comes with wig cap. awsome</li>
            <li> So I recieved this wig yesterday. It is very full and soft. Only slightly shiny in some lighting, but closer to a natural shine. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of my skin color or the lighting, but most of my photos came out as an all pink wig rather than a brown into pink. Overall it&#x27;s a very nice wig and for the price and amazing reviews and pictures it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Doesnt look the picture or anyone else&#x27;s picture it&#x27;s the ugliest wig I have ever bought. It&#x27;s s*** pink on top and light pink on bottom. Wtf?</li>
            <li> I think the wig sheds a bit too much, more than normal wigs. Also, the light brown/dark blonde in the picture almost looks completely pink and it looks like it&#x27;s just one color. I also think the wig was slightly small, pretty thin, and you can see your hair on the front, but it can easily be covered with a beanie or something. It looks better with a beanie anyways. Other than all of that, it&#x27;s a pretty good wig.</li>
            <li> It very nice, the only thing is that it sheds a little bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ombre pink, Light pink on top then darker pink as it descends. A bit disappointed in it since I can still see my hair poking out the back despite the fact that I am wearing the head cap it came with. Bangs were SUPER long, I had to trim it down so it can stay out of my face. Other than that, it looks pretty cute. I definitely don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m turning 27! haha</li>
            <li> I liked this wig for the most part.. but it is not my favorite. Here are some pros and cons to this wig:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Color matched the description for mine. I heard people were having issues with color but this is basically spot on what I ordered&lt;br /&gt;-Bangs are long so you can style them as you please [this is a pro to me, may be a con for others]&lt;br /&gt;-Prompt shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-THIN. I don&#x27;t like thin wigs too much.&lt;br /&gt;-Sheds a lot&lt;br /&gt;-Tangles a lot too&lt;br /&gt;-More fake looking than other wigs I&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br /&gt;-Didn&#x27;t last too long before it got way too tangled.&lt;br /&gt;-Not too comfortable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take good care of it and try to fix the shininess, i think this would be a good wig. I&#x27;d say for the price, it is nice.</li>
