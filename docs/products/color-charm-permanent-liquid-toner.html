            <li>I love the ashy color it gives my hair!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Have used for a year, with amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my very light blond hair.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>My favorite toner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I also use the Wella T14, which is a gray toner, to help take out more orangish tints.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stand it any more, and decided to give this a shot.</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for better for the price.</li>
            <li>but I wanted better results.</li>
            <li>If ur going for more of the white/purple hair get T18 .if</li>
            <li>u want more grey/silver hair get T14</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s as light as they were going to go!</li>
            <li>This makes my blonde the perfect white-blonde</li>
            <li>Please, Lady Wella, I thought to myself, I hope there is magic in your Color</li>
            <li>The #T18 Lightest Ash Blonde is perfect for removing brassy roots!</li>
            <li>just be sure to follow the directions.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;d have to keep this and some 10 or 20 volume developer on hand to regularly tone your hair if you want to keep it looking perfect.</li>
            <li>I have bleached my hair several times and am trying to get it healthy again, so this stuff isn&#x27;t the most ideal for me on a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; basis yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it the right way before and it tones really nicely.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I have finally found a cheap, easy alternative to getting salon highlights all the time!</li>
            <li>It has a goopy  texture not unlike egg whites that spread easily through my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the cool tones I get after using it.</li>
            <li>It gave me such beautiful platinum results.</li>
            <li>The t18 turned it into a beautiful light blonde.</li>
            <li>The best toner a girl wanting pure white hair could ask for!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and worth it!</li>
            <li>This plus the John Frieda spray is such a great discovery.</li>
            <li>Beware for people with light hair.</li>
            <li>I originally was trying to tone with purple shampoo and conditioner but that did nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It was a nice golden blonde, but needed more.</li>
            <li>I also think this will brought my hair to a good level for my next color: cotton candy.</li>
            <li>try the T14 to cool orange.</li>
            <li>I had read so many places that YOU MUST TONE AFTER BLEACHING, but I didn&#x27;t think too much of it.</li>
            <li>the PERFECT toner color, t18 alone turned my hair gray but mixed with t11 toned out all the brass and left it a nice beautifuly shiny light light almost platinum blonde.</li>
            <li>As long as your hair is light enough, this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>Perfect white blonde</li>
            <li>Well, they quickly turned orange.</li>
            <li>but to get my freshly bleached roots to match my ends</li>
            <li>Like most bottle blondes, I&#x27;ve experienced brassiness that was worse at some times than others.</li>
            <li>Left it on for 15-20 minutes as described and my hair came out a beautiful golden ash blonde.</li>
            <li>Works great if your blonde hair is brassy; tones it down and makes it more ashy or neutral.</li>
            <li>Cheap, easy, and did the job in 30 minutes ONLY!</li>
            <li>You really do need to make sure your hair is light enough for this to take.</li>
            <li>and I really couldn&#x27;t monitor what my color was looking like, so I washed it out as quickly as I could and jumped out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair lighten up so much!</li>
            <li>I plan to get more for regular touchups.</li>
            <li>This product, however, has given me exactly the color</li>
            <li>;D</li>
            <li>Nervously I left it on about 25 more minutes to &#x27;cook&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After flat ironing I could not get over how much better it looked.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to cool orange, this won&#x27;t help, it will cool yellow.</li>
            <li>Took the orange tone right out of my recently bleached hair :) Was a lovely blonde color, as hoped for with the #T18 Lightest Ash Blonde shade</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally light brown/dark blonde and gets some very blond streaks in the sun, which is the look I prefer</li>
            <li>Also you have to work fast with</li>
            <li>it cause it works fast and watch it very closely.</li>
            <li>It really gets the brassy out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I  have very long,curly hair</li>
            <li>my hair wouldnt absorb too much color.</li>
            <li>so I imagine if you shampoo your hair often you will lose the toner entirely so fast.</li>
            <li>I always use a light ash blonde dye, but some brands just don&#x27;t come out ashy on me at all.</li>
            <li>As they say, you must be light enough.</li>
            <li>you really want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really bleached my hair in months and have just toned it.</li>
            <li>With this toner, the brassy tones were minimized and my overall color was much more natural.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ever been, there is also a very prevalent grey tone to it, which I suspect should wash out rather easily.</li>
            <li>ash blonde, as the areas of my hair that were really light did darken more than other toners have darkened them.</li>
            <li>Perfect for toning from yellow to ash blonde, but won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot easier than mixing your own toner, and there&#x27;s far less chance for error.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic, I&#x27;ve tried tons of other toners to counteract yellow/orange in bleached blonde hair and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to have any hair left.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to leave it on for too long with my first trial, and I think the timing was just about right.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t want to take my already light blonde to a white state, so I went for 10 volume developer.</li>
            <li>This month when I dyed my hair with a brand that is not what I usually use, my roots were bright yellow.</li>
            <li>The hair itself felt pretty damaged after that, even more damaged than it did after bleaching for me at least.</li>
            <li>In short, if you have brassy tones in your hair, use this with a developer to remove them and get an overall more natural look.</li>
            <li>but T14 took the orange right out after bleaching from brown and red.</li>
            <li>I had light yellow (like lemon yellow) hair.</li>
            <li>so the silver did fade out and the color remaining is still pretty ashy and the yellow is neutralized</li>
            <li>Other toners I used achieved a dramatically different color right after use and washed out quickly, so I&#x27;d end up with brassy tones again.</li>
            <li>After numerous rounds of bleach on my fine wavy blonde hair (which I had been dying red for over a year), I was ready to try this</li>
            <li>I will give the (slight) problem spots another light bleaching when I need to touch up my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, I mixed up one full bottle of this toner with double the amount of developer and smooshed it into my roots.</li>
            <li>Did my research and took my hair from a dark brown with natural red highlights to a healthy platinum.</li>
            <li>Dont go near the 30 minutes at all.</li>
            <li>i take a lot of pride in my hair , i have always been known for my hair color , but this product completely ruined my hair , it looks horrid.</li>
            <li>Product got here fast, but turned my hair blue cause</li>
            <li>always gone to a salon until I moved to michigan and cant find one that makes my hair platinum like my old salon could.  </li>
            <li>So I used some John Frieda lightening spray to create some highlights maybe 2 shades lighter than my natural color.</li>
            <li>I know they say get it done by a professional..</li>
            <li>The brass was completely gone.</li>
            <li>, I use it with T11 o T12 and the results are really natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d bought two packs to be safe because no way in blessed Hades am I leaving the house until I have my hair a shade that at least looks like it was intentional.</li>
            <li>This toner first turned my hair a super dark grey and purple color.</li>
            <li>My roots were pretty much white but the lengths were nearly the same shade, and drastically closer than they had been before the toner.</li>
            <li>After leaving in for some twenty minutes, the product itself was a pretty shade of violet, and upon rinsing, it left the hair an ashy blonde with spots of silvery purple.</li>
            <li>only criticism is that it is a little strong on odor, but I don&#x27;t consider that a flaw.</li>
            <li>My natural hair was blonde as a child, but turned a pretty dark brown as I got older.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading some reviews, I was nervous about leaving it on too long, so I first only did 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have been dyeing my hair light blonde for about 13 years, and have never loved my color as much as when I tried this toner on it.</li>
            <li>I only left this on for 15 minutes, and it brought my pale yellow hair to a perfect dusty white color.</li>
            <li>It will make it like a blue old lady.  </li>
            <li>, my hair was almost white blonde before using this, I just wanted to remove some remaining yellow tones, well this darkened my hair and its purple and silver and just so much darker than I had intended</li>
            <li>Luckily once I mixed it with 20-volume developer I only needed about half of it.</li>
            <li>Completely takes out yellow, copper, red, orange, tones.</li>
            <li>But when I rinsed and dried my hair, I had a very natural looking light blonde the same level as it was before just minus all of the yellow.</li>
            <li>I did still have a little bit of orange left, but this toner didn&#x27;t wash out right away.</li>
            <li>I was extremely nervous to use this since I have never done any kind of at-home hair dye, but I did it anyway because I figured it couldn&#x27;t be worse than the brassy tone I already had.</li>
            <li>Be careful to not let it sit on porous or dry ends as it can darken hair to a very unflattering ashy shade.</li>

            <li> I was lucky to have any hair left.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to leave it on for too long with my first trial, and I think the timing was just about right.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t want to take my already light blonde to a white state, so I went for 10 volume developer.</li>
            <li> This month when I dyed my hair with a brand that is not what I usually use, my roots were bright yellow.</li>
            <li> The hair itself felt pretty damaged after that, even more damaged than it did after bleaching for me at least.</li>
            <li> In short, if you have brassy tones in your hair, use this with a developer to remove them and get an overall more natural look.</li>
            <li> but T14 took the orange right out after bleaching from brown and red.</li>
            <li> I had light yellow (like lemon yellow) hair.</li>
            <li> so the silver did fade out and the color remaining is still pretty ashy and the yellow is neutralized</li>
            <li> Other toners I used achieved a dramatically different color right after use and washed out quickly, so I&#x27;d end up with brassy tones again.</li>
            <li> After numerous rounds of bleach on my fine wavy blonde hair (which I had been dying red for over a year), I was ready to try this</li>
            <li> I will give the (slight) problem spots another light bleaching when I need to touch up my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, I mixed up one full bottle of this toner with double the amount of developer and smooshed it into my roots.</li>
            <li> Did my research and took my hair from a dark brown with natural red highlights to a healthy platinum.</li>
            <li> Dont go near the 30 minutes at all.</li>
            <li> i take a lot of pride in my hair , i have always been known for my hair color , but this product completely ruined my hair , it looks horrid.</li>
            <li> Product got here fast, but turned my hair blue cause</li>
            <li> always gone to a salon until I moved to michigan and cant find one that makes my hair platinum like my old salon could.  </li>
            <li> So I used some John Frieda lightening spray to create some highlights maybe 2 shades lighter than my natural color.</li>
            <li> I know they say get it done by a professional..</li>
            <li> The brass was completely gone.</li>
            <li> , I use it with T11 o T12 and the results are really natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d bought two packs to be safe because no way in blessed Hades am I leaving the house until I have my hair a shade that at least looks like it was intentional.</li>
            <li> This toner first turned my hair a super dark grey and purple color.</li>
            <li> My roots were pretty much white but the lengths were nearly the same shade, and drastically closer than they had been before the toner.</li>
            <li> After leaving in for some twenty minutes, the product itself was a pretty shade of violet, and upon rinsing, it left the hair an ashy blonde with spots of silvery purple.</li>
            <li> only criticism is that it is a little strong on odor, but I don&#x27;t consider that a flaw.</li>
            <li> My natural hair was blonde as a child, but turned a pretty dark brown as I got older.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading some reviews, I was nervous about leaving it on too long, so I first only did 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been dyeing my hair light blonde for about 13 years, and have never loved my color as much as when I tried this toner on it.</li>
            <li> I only left this on for 15 minutes, and it brought my pale yellow hair to a perfect dusty white color.</li>
            <li> It will make it like a blue old lady.  </li>
            <li> , my hair was almost white blonde before using this, I just wanted to remove some remaining yellow tones, well this darkened my hair and its purple and silver and just so much darker than I had intended</li>
            <li> Luckily once I mixed it with 20-volume developer I only needed about half of it.</li>
            <li> Completely takes out yellow, copper, red, orange, tones.</li>
            <li> But when I rinsed and dried my hair, I had a very natural looking light blonde the same level as it was before just minus all of the yellow.</li>
            <li> I did still have a little bit of orange left, but this toner didn&#x27;t wash out right away.</li>
            <li> I was extremely nervous to use this since I have never done any kind of at-home hair dye, but I did it anyway because I figured it couldn&#x27;t be worse than the brassy tone I already had.</li>
            <li> Be careful to not let it sit on porous or dry ends as it can darken hair to a very unflattering ashy shade.</li>
            <li> Left it on for about 45 minutes because I wanted it to leave my hair a bit grey but for anyone just trying to counteract yellow leave it on for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I left it on too long...</li>
            <li> The box says it can be left on for UP to 30 minutes, but that&#x27;s way too long for my needs.</li>
            <li> After bleaching my dark brown hair to a dark blonde, I had a lot of brassy tones near my roots.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you have gray hair and just want to take away the yellow.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t happen naturally year round.</li>
            <li> It did tone down the yellow tones, but it did not help achieve white.</li>
            <li> The end result was not exactly white, and I think I&#x27;ll move on to sampling other toners.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue using this product, and  don&#x27;t ever think about buying any of that other junk again.</li>
            <li> I tried other toners, but they didn&#x27;t have enough oomph.</li>
            <li> I had to use a hair mask after and another conditioner and my hair still feels a bit dry</li>
            <li> I rinsed it and waited to blow dry.</li>
            <li> I recommend a 1:4 ratio for a less grey result(keep in mind, thoroughly lightened or bleached hair prior to application is still a must).</li>
            <li> They took my hair from dark brown to blonde.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time to tone down brassiness from highlighting my hair blonde.</li>
            <li> I also only bleached my hair once 3 weeks ago because my base color was already light enough that my hair turned almost white after one bleaching so my hair isnt damaged or that porous either.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little darker blonde but no brassy, orange color.</li>
            <li> The blue went away after a few days of a lot of shampooing</li>
            <li> I used it on Soaking wet hair hair as well in hopes</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> I was scared to death to use it because a week before I used the t14 pale ash blonde</li>
            <li> I did a bleach bath to get a pale yellow before using this.</li>
            <li> it started to dry, I calmed down.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the only thing (and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING) that tones down my brassy blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Yea, so in theory where all those products should have worked, they failed, and wella T18, which I did buy at a beauty supply store at first, came out victorious.</li>
            <li> no more brassy blonde</li>
            <li> my bleaching did not really get toned down.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> I used an entire bottle of this with 10 volume developer for my medium length thick hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t tone down the bronze tint.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm to remove yellow or brassy blonde gone wrong.</li>
            <li> Out of everything out there I&#x27;ve tried first, like an idiot, this is the product that got my hair closest to being white.</li>
            <li> but I am too lazy to bleach, I will use this only and it really lightens up my roots and they dont look bad anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also a little runny.</li>
            <li> This little bottle was the finishing touch.</li>
            <li> I could see it was working, but it was still a little brassy</li>
            <li> The loreal brass banisher helped a little</li>
            <li> this completely dried my hair out,</li>
            <li> After a few days it got brassy.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what the result would be since there are very few reviews on this product with a 10 volume developer.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t do as much if your hair is seriously orange, like from a bad bleach job that didn&#x27;t lift enough color from your hair, leaving it that weird orange color.</li>
            <li> And I mean I&#x27;ve tried just about everything</li>
            <li> Seriously a life saver.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toner about 6 months ago, and was afraid to try it due to all of the varying reviews.</li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way!</li>
            <li> i am not sure if i use the ration wrong.</li>
            <li> Worse than any dye I&#x27;ve ever used, I had to hold my breath.</li>
            <li> my hair wasnt even this damaged after bleaching it but for some reason this dried my hair out so bad.</li>
            <li> pre-bleaching is the scary part.</li>
            <li> : it smells HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> It looked terrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trust me when I say I am horrible when it comes to doing hair.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t tone down the bronze tint.</li>
            <li> I tried the roner today and it turned to be amazing! Cheap, easy, and did the job in 30 minutes ONLY! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Easy to use and worth it!</li>
            <li> Pros: it works. I had light yellow (like lemon yellow) hair. The t18 turned it into a beautiful light blonde. I was scared to death to use it because a week before I used the t14 pale ash blonde and it turned my blonde hair brown with red roots (I left it on for about 25 minutes without checking it.)  I left the t18 on for about 5-7 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it smells HORRIBLE. Use in a ventilated room! Worse than any dye I&#x27;ve ever used, I had to hold my breath. Also you have to work fast with it cause it works fast and watch it very closely. Checking every 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li> My favorite toner I&#x27;ve used. It makes my hair lighten up so much! Perfect white blonde</li>
            <li> The best toner a girl wanting pure white hair could ask for!  Tones evenly and perfectly.  I use it with 20vol developer.</li>
            <li> I tried virgin snow by manic panic and still had discussing Brassy orange hair ,&lt;br /&gt;Wella is the way to go . Works every time no hassle</li>
            <li> Perfect for toning from yellow to ash blonde, but won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Works great if your blonde hair is brassy; tones it down and makes it more ashy or neutral. It won&#x27;t do as much if your hair is seriously orange, like from a bad bleach job that didn&#x27;t lift enough color from your hair, leaving it that weird orange color. It&#x27;s now something I&#x27;m just keeping in stock at home.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the only thing (and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING) that tones down my brassy blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you have gray hair and just want to take away the yellow.  It will make it like a blue old lady.  Dont go near the 30 minutes at all.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I use this all the time to tone down brassiness from highlighting my hair blonde. I use with a 10 developer.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!!!! I recommend this to everyone with brassy hair! This is fantastic, I&#x27;ve tried tons of other toners to counteract yellow/orange in bleached blonde hair and this is by far my favorite. Left it on for about 45 minutes because I wanted it to leave my hair a bit grey but for anyone just trying to counteract yellow leave it on for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> If you want white or silver hair this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> Worked great. T18 takes the yellow out but T14 took the orange right out after bleaching from brown and red.</li>
            <li> I love the ashy color it gives my hair! Def. would buy again. It really gets the brassy out of my hair.</li>
            <li> i take a lot of pride in my hair , i have always been known for my hair color , but this product completely ruined my hair , it looks horrid. i do not recommend this product and i am deeply saddened that my hair looks like this now , will not be buying this product again</li>
            <li> I use this after bleaching my hair. I love the cool tones I get after using it.I use with a 30 developer for 15 mins. I  have very long,curly hair and this is great.</li>
            <li> It did tone down the yellow tones, but it did not help achieve white. After leaving in for some twenty minutes, the product itself was a pretty shade of violet, and upon rinsing, it left the hair an ashy blonde with spots of silvery purple. The hair itself felt pretty damaged after that, even more damaged than it did after bleaching for me at least. The end result was not exactly white, and I think I&#x27;ll move on to sampling other toners. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Product got here fast, but turned my hair blue cause I left it on too long... The blue went away after a few days of a lot of shampooing</li>
            <li> Definately needed when toning your hair!</li>
            <li> This is the purple toner.  Have used for a year, with amazing results.  Takes the yellow out of blonde hair,  and even if my roots need to be done but I am too lazy to bleach, I will use this only and it really lightens up my roots and they dont look bad anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive always gone to a salon until I moved to michigan and cant find one that makes my hair platinum like my old salon could.  I have dark brown hair.  I use a 30 volume developer with bleach.  Then I use this toner with 20 volume developer.&lt;br /&gt;Then I also use the Wella T14, which is a gray toner, to help take out more orangish tints.  And BAM my hair is white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> recommended  by youtuber. worked perfectly with my bleached hair</li>
            <li> *update* updating my review from 2 stars to 4 stars! I used wella toner again t18 1 oz mixed with 1 oz t11 and omg the PERFECT toner color, t18 alone turned my hair gray but mixed with t11 toned out all the brass and left it a nice beautifuly shiny light light almost platinum blonde. I do have to say though the reason its only 4 stars instead of 5 is that its so damaging I had to use a hair mask after and another conditioner and my hair still feels a bit dry, I cant imagine using this monthly. but to get my freshly bleached roots to match my ends it was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product works to take out the yellow tones that is forsure, my hair was almost white blonde before using this, I just wanted to remove some remaining yellow tones, well this darkened my hair and its purple and silver and just so much darker than I had intended, Im going to update this review in a week or so to update if It washes out or not. I used it on Soaking wet hair hair as well in hopes my hair wouldnt absorb too much color. I also only bleached my hair once 3 weeks ago because my base color was already light enough that my hair turned almost white after one bleaching so my hair isnt damaged or that porous either. Lets just hope the color washes out and I dont have to bleach again. I originally was trying to tone with purple shampoo and conditioner but that did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update** so the silver did fade out and the color remaining is still pretty ashy and the yellow is neutralized so thats great, however it isnt as bright and shiny as it was and this completely dried my hair out, my hair wasnt even this damaged after bleaching it but for some reason this dried my hair out so bad. Also I managed to wash the remaining silver out with just cleansing conditioner so I imagine if you shampoo your hair often you will lose the toner entirely so fast.</li>
            <li> I have been dyeing my hair light blonde for about 13 years, and have never loved my color as much as when I tried this toner on it. My natural hair was blonde as a child, but turned a pretty dark brown as I got older. Like most bottle blondes, I&#x27;ve experienced brassiness that was worse at some times than others. I always use a light ash blonde dye, but some brands just don&#x27;t come out ashy on me at all. I purchased this toner about 6 months ago, and was afraid to try it due to all of the varying reviews. This month when I dyed my hair with a brand that is not what I usually use, my roots were bright yellow. I couldn&#x27;t stand it any more, and decided to give this a shot. Boy am I glad I did. I just wish I would have used it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept reading that this toner must be used with a 20 volume developer. It even says so on the box. But because I have done quite a bit of research, I read that 20 volume developer will also \\&quot;lift\\&quot; or lighten your hair as it tones. I had read that 10 volume developer would just tone without lightening. I certainly didn&#x27;t want to take my already light blonde to a white state, so I went for 10 volume developer. This was part of my hesitation- I had no idea what the result would be since there are very few reviews on this product with a 10 volume developer. Anyway, I mixed up one full bottle of this toner with double the amount of developer and smooshed it into my roots. I left it on for about 8 minutes, and then ran some of the mixture through my ends for 2 minutes before washing it out. I didn&#x27;t want to leave it on for too long with my first trial, and I think the timing was just about right. While the toner was on my hair, it appeared to be turning my hair darker. But when I rinsed and dried my hair, I had a very natural looking light blonde the same level as it was before just minus all of the yellow. I was thrilled! I think next time I may try leaving it on for a bit longer, maybe 15 minutes total. But I will definitely be stocking my cabinets with truckloads of this!ing my cabinets with truckloads of this!</li>
            <li> Not much to say. I used this on my very light blond hair. I applied it immediately after mixing it while it was still white. After 15 minutes, it went to a darkish, ashy lavender color. The box says it can be left on for UP to 30 minutes, but that&#x27;s way too long for my needs. I only left this on for 15 minutes, and it brought my pale yellow hair to a perfect dusty white color. As long as your hair is light enough, this product is perfect. I&#x27;ve washed my hair twice since using it, and the tone hasn&#x27;t washed out yet at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is that it is a little strong on odor, but I don&#x27;t consider that a flaw. Just keep the door open and turn on you bathroom vent if you&#x27;re someone bothered by this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a little runny. I found myself having to wipe my forehead off ever couple of minutes. But again, not quite a flaw. I actually like the consistency because I think it makes it easier to distribute into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, yes I would 100% recommend this product. It&#x27;s a lot easier than mixing your own toner, and there&#x27;s far less chance for error.</li>
            <li> Did my research and took my hair from a dark brown with natural red highlights to a healthy platinum. This little bottle was the finishing touch. You really do need to make sure your hair is light enough for this to take. I bleached a month ago with Clairol Born Blonde Hair Color Maxi. It was a nice golden blonde, but needed more. I did a bleach bath to get a pale yellow before using this. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with stinging, but I had coated my hair with coconut oil prior to my bleach bath. This is supposed to help protect the follicle and scalp. I plan to get more for regular touchups. I also think this will brought my hair to a good level for my next color: cotton candy.</li>
            <li> Out of everything out there I&#x27;ve tried first, like an idiot, this is the product that got my hair closest to being white. And I mean I&#x27;ve tried just about everything, Splat bleach, manic panic virgin snow(didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair even after bleaching, took out absokutely 0 yellow), and the white out kit(40/40 bleach and toner). Oh and did I mention that my hair was lightest blonde to begin with(been dying it bleach blonde for about 13 years)? Yea, so in theory where all those products should have worked, they failed, and wella T18, which I did buy at a beauty supply store at first, came out victorious. Now while it did get my hair closest to white it&#x27;s ever been, there is also a very prevalent grey tone to it, which I suspect should wash out rather easily. But in order to prevent that, I suggest *gasp* not following the directions on the box, which say to use a 1:2 ration with a volume 20 toner. I recommend a 1:4 ratio for a less grey result(keep in mind, thoroughly lightened or bleached hair prior to application is still a must). I will definitely continue using this product, and  don&#x27;t ever think about buying any of that other junk again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome just awesome take out all the  brasiness in my hair..woot,woot im realy happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was extremely nervous to use this since I have never done any kind of at-home hair dye, but I did it anyway because I figured it couldn&#x27;t be worse than the brassy tone I already had. My hair is naturally light brown/dark blonde and gets some very blond streaks in the sun, which is the look I prefer but it doesn&#x27;t happen naturally year round. So I used some John Frieda lightening spray to create some highlights maybe 2 shades lighter than my natural color. Well, they quickly turned orange. The purple shampoo helped some, but not enough. This product, however, has given me exactly the color I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading some reviews, I was nervous about leaving it on too long, so I first only did 10 minutes. I could see it was working, but it was still a little brassy so I did it again for 10 more minutes, and it was perfect. I just applied with a squeeze bottle to my roots and then spread it through my hair with my fingers. This plus the John Frieda spray is such a great discovery. I am so happy I have finally found a cheap, easy alternative to getting salon highlights all the time! Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair not once but twice in one day. I was lucky to have any hair left. I was left with white roots and yellow/ orange hair. It looked terrible. I thought I had once again ruined my hair. I bought this after research. I was nervous putting it on because it was purple. I mixed with 20 volume developer and left it on for 25 minutes and said a prayer. I washed my hair and it was like a miracle. The yellow was gone and everything was blended. I bought an extra bottle for when it fades. If you find that you make the same mistake I did this will fix it. I know they say get it done by a professional..but I dont have $100 to blow on my hair.</li>
            <li> After leaving the salon with yellow/orange hair. I was horrified and immediately purchased the wella t18 off amazon. Seriously a life saver. Left it on for 15-20 minutes as described and my hair came out a beautiful golden ash blonde. Couldn&#x27;t ask for better for the price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every penny! I had recently gotten my hair done in the salon. They took my hair from dark brown to blonde. After a few days it got brassy. The loreal brass banisher helped a little but I wanted better results. After watching videos and reading reviews I decided to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me when I say I am horrible when it comes to doing hair. I applied product and left it on for 20 minutes. I rinsed it and waited to blow dry. After flat ironing I could not get over how much better it looked. The brass was completely gone. My hair is a little darker blonde but no brassy, orange color. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Good stuff no more brassy blonde</li>
            <li> White white hair! Finally! I tried other toners, but they didn&#x27;t have enough oomph.</li>
            <li> If ur going for more of the white/purple hair get T18 .if u want more grey/silver hair get T14</li>
            <li> This product is best used right after bleaching and with a peroxide. I tried to use it a couple of weeks after bleaching and with a conditioner instead of a 20-30 level product. I&#x27;ve used it the right way before and it tones really nicely. Don&#x27;t worry when your hair turns purple. It won&#x27;t stay that way and will pull up the yellow tones from bleached blonde hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to cool orange, this won&#x27;t help, it will cool yellow. try the T14 to cool orange. I learned this the hard way!</li>
            <li> I bought this to give me the whitest hair I could get as I&#x27;ve always ended up with brassy toned hair. Best toner I&#x27;ve used yet. I have bleached my hair several times and am trying to get it healthy again, so this stuff isn&#x27;t the most ideal for me on a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; basis yet. I did use it with a 20 developer by Wella although I could&#x27;ve used a 10. You can use either/or. It gave me such beautiful platinum results. Definitely gets rid of any yellow or brassy tones. As they say, you must be light enough. If someone says this doesn&#x27;t work for them than it&#x27;s probably because they&#x27;re attempting to use it on hair that isn&#x27;t lightened enough. I hear your hair should resemble the color of an inside of a banana peel! My ends remained a beige blonde as that&#x27;s all they could be, being the furthest from virgin hair, &amp; after the numerous bleaches- that&#x27;s as light as they were going to go! Thinking of giving myself a reverse ombr&amp;eacute; with pastel colors to work with this situation!! ;D</li>
            <li> This toner first turned my hair a super dark grey and purple color. I left it on for 15 minutes only. I can&#x27;t imagine what it would do for 30 minutes. My hair was yellow so I decided to use this and it ruined my hair, I should&#x27;ve just kept it like it was. Never using this again. Beware for people with light hair. I&#x27;ve heard it happened even after 5 minutes.I bought it at sally Hanson.</li>
            <li> I had read so many places that YOU MUST TONE AFTER BLEACHING, but I didn&#x27;t think too much of it. I thought that purple shampoo would be enough to give me a cool-toned look. But I&#x27;ve used this once now, and I know I&#x27;m hooked for life! This makes my blonde the perfect white-blonde I&#x27;ve been looking for. It TOTALLY surpasses any purple shampooing or conditioning, or anything else you can think of to make your hair the color you really want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST BUY IT ALREADY!</li>
            <li> i am not sure if i use the ration wrong. it was a bit runny after i mixed it and after i applied it on my hair it irritates my scalp. it wasn&#x27;t unbearable but i still  rinsed it off.  my bleaching did not really get toned down. I will still try this again next time i bleached my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this, I use it with T11 o T12 and the results are really natural.</li>
            <li> Took the orange tone right out of my recently bleached hair :) Was a lovely blonde color, as hoped for with the #T18 Lightest Ash Blonde shade</li>
            <li> After doing tons of research about getting back to platinum blonde, I noticed a lot of mentions of this product so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pre-bleaching is the scary part. After numerous rounds of bleach on my fine wavy blonde hair (which I had been dying red for over a year), I was ready to try this toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I. Was. Petrified. Bleaching left me with alien-white roots and a fretful lemon-to-brassy spectrum on the lengths of my hair. Please, Lady Wella, I thought to myself, I hope there is magic in your Color Charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d bought two packs to be safe because no way in blessed Hades am I leaving the house until I have my hair a shade that at least looks like it was intentional. Luckily once I mixed it with 20-volume developer I only needed about half of it. It has a goopy  texture not unlike egg whites that spread easily through my hair. Nervously I left it on about 25 more minutes to &#x27;cook&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By then my head was purple and I really couldn&#x27;t monitor what my color was looking like, so I washed it out as quickly as I could and jumped out of the shower. Seeing my foggy reflection in the mirror, I let out an auditory &amp;@$############### and ran to the bedroom to inspect it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it started to dry, I calmed down. My roots were pretty much white but the lengths were nearly the same shade, and drastically closer than they had been before the toner. I will give the (slight) problem spots another light bleaching when I need to touch up my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until then, I need to get back to cleaning my bathroom in my towel, thinking to myself, &#x27;I am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, the Unburnt, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Loved this toner. It gave me a beautiful color and I will probably purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Great toner to get rid of the grassiness sometimes associated with bleaching hair. It&#x27;s a purple toner.</li>
            <li> The #T18 Lightest Ash Blonde is perfect for removing brassy roots! Be careful to not let it sit on porous or dry ends as it can darken hair to a very unflattering ashy shade. Next time I will ONLY use this on the roots, with a Volume 10 Developer (like D. Elle suggests) for about 12 minutes.</li>
            <li> it took the gross yellow tones out of my platinum blonde hair. it also lightened my hair and its perfect! just be sure to follow the directions. and i used the wella 20 volume creme developer. :) it&#x27;s great, im buying another for when my hair decides to let itself go again.</li>
            <li> Wella toner is a blondes best friend. I haven&#x27;t really bleached my hair in months and have just toned it. It works! Completely takes out yellow, copper, red, orange, tones.</li>
            <li> After bleaching my dark brown hair to a dark blonde, I had a lot of brassy tones near my roots. Other toners I used achieved a dramatically different color right after use and washed out quickly, so I&#x27;d end up with brassy tones again. With this toner, the brassy tones were minimized and my overall color was much more natural. I did still have a little bit of orange left, but this toner didn&#x27;t wash out right away. I don&#x27;t know about it being &amp;#34;lightest&amp;#34; ash blonde, as the areas of my hair that were really light did darken more than other toners have darkened them. I&#x27;ve heard from friends that this eventually washes out. I think you&#x27;d have to keep this and some 10 or 20 volume developer on hand to regularly tone your hair if you want to keep it looking perfect. I used an entire bottle of this with 10 volume developer for my medium length thick hair. In short, if you have brassy tones in your hair, use this with a developer to remove them and get an overall more natural look. Just plan on the look you achieve with this not being permanent, and plan on redoing it ever so often.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm to remove yellow or brassy blonde gone wrong.</li>
