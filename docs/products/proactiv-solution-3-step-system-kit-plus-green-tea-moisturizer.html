            <li>Good stuff to be honest,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve Ben using proactiv for more than 10 years!  </li>
            <li>Nice products.</li>
            <li>So far excellent results.</li>
            <li>have more scaring from acne now.  </li>
            <li>Great product, gently heals breakouts.</li>
            <li>So glad they are here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is good and I am liking it very much.</li>
            <li>I did notice it helps smooth out the redness on my eyelids</li>
            <li>The green tea moisturizer is wonderfully soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love the whole system!</li>
            <li>I have never had a facial cleaning system work so good.</li>
            <li>I like the older kits of proactiv and it works better than the proactiv</li>
            <li>This Formula is actually better than New Proactive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare for me though.</li>
            <li>After the first time I figured I should try again and see if the effects would decrease because I thought it was because my skin was just getting use to the product</li>
            <li>The 2 month supply is exactly what is pictured.</li>
            <li>I have actual breakouts with maybe 10 or more zits.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with the old and it worked well for me in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dnt really have much acne</li>
            <li>I guess it really depends on how your skin reacts.</li>
            <li>Better than ordering direct from manufacturer as you can order when you want and not direct shipped!</li>
            <li>I was kind of surprised that a 1 oz bottle of Green Tea Moisturizer is considered a 2 month supply.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and would not like to see what might happen if the product expires while I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
            <li>Two weeks in and their acne was clearing up and its not harsh on their face!</li>
            <li>but I use proactive to smooth the skin and get rid of dark spots and visible wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Bought  Proactiv w/ green tea moisturizer for my daughter; didn&#x27;t clear up her acne completely, but her skin does look better.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I read reviews that said the new formula for Proactiv does not work as well as the old.</li>
            <li>Does it clear acne scars and relieve razor bumps?</li>
            <li>Hoping this will clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>Keeps the face clear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 56 years old and experience breakout again.  </li>
            <li>and maybe next time I&#x27;ll purchase it in my own country because I get at least a year to play with.</li>
            <li>My skin started to get very dry and flaky and right after I finish doing their &amp;#34;3 steps&amp;#34; my face had this burning sensation.</li>
            <li>By breakouts, I don&#x27;t mean the kind you see in the commercials where the camera zooms in on a celebrities&#x27; face to show the two tiny zits on their chin.</li>
            <li>AND DOES NOT MEAN ANYONE ELSE WILL HAVE THE SAME RESULTS.</li>
            <li>t the salon with my son last week, sans make-up a complete stranger complimented me on my skin..</li>
            <li>spent good money for products that not only DIDN&#x27;T improve my face...but they seemed to make it worse.  </li>
            <li>(Not sure if it&#x27;s 2 months worth if you use it daily though).</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t really complain because it&#x27;s not expiring before and it is meant to use within 2 months but an expiry date for just a little later would not have hurt.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> spent good money for products that not only DIDN&#x27;T improve my face...but they seemed to make it worse.  </li>

            <li> I believe the cause of these &amp;#34;side effects&amp;#34; is due to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So I spent about $200+ total with their system because I think I tried it 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how long.</li>
            <li> but I have NEVER used ANYTHING that led to such extreme effects as when I was using Proactiv</li>
            <li> My acne (from my face to my back) have slowly gone away, although I do still have some and the occasional pimples/zits that form.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried this product before, but a little does go a long way</li>
            <li> and I use very little twice daily.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say that it would be this extreme for anyone else</li>
            <li> I do have struggle with small blackheads and occasional break outs.</li>
            <li> Unlike other skin cleansers I can use this without making my hypersensitive.</li>
            <li> and now I use it once a day or even every other day.  </li>
            <li> At least give me something within the same year.</li>
            <li> I occasionally will get a large bump that never surfaces but is painful.</li>
            <li> It is a lot less noticeable though.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with pro active to clear your skin!</li>
            <li> A 4 oz bottle of Renewing Cleaner, 4 oz bottle of Revitalizing Toner, 2 oz bottle of Repairing Treatment, and a 1 oz bottle of the Green Tea Moisturizer.</li>

            <li> NOT HAPPY w/this item.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Loved this product. Kids had issues with acne for three years now and put off buying for them thinking wouldn&#x27;t work. Two weeks in and their acne was clearing up and its not harsh on their face! Kids are so happy with complection and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I dnt really have much acne but I use proactive to smooth the skin and get rid of dark spots and visible wrinkles. Good stuff to be honest,  but u dnt wanna use it all the time since ur skin gets used to it and dries it out too</li>
            <li> I have tried the Proactiv system multiple times and it has never worked for me. Instead it made my face very red and itchy. My skin started to get very dry and flaky and right after I finish doing their &amp;#34;3 steps&amp;#34; my face had this burning sensation. Of course this is just me personally so I can&#x27;t say that it would be this extreme for anyone else but this is what happened to me. I believe the cause of these &amp;#34;side effects&amp;#34; is due to my sensitive skin but I have NEVER used ANYTHING that led to such extreme effects as when I was using Proactiv and I use a lot of masks, acne creams, and cleansers. So I spent about $200+ total with their system because I think I tried it 2 or 3 times. I would use it... feel the bad effects...then stop because of the effects, and since I didn&#x27;t use it regularly my acne stayed. After the first time I figured I should try again and see if the effects would decrease because I thought it was because my skin was just getting use to the product but UNFORTUNATELY the bad side effects continued. So I stopped using the system permanently.&lt;br /&gt;What I found that did work somewhat well for me was the Proactiv Body Wash. It can also be used on your face and neck as well so I use it every night in the shower and I&#x27;ve been noticing that my face is a lot softer as I come out of the shower and it&#x27;s gotten a lot smoother as well. My acne (from my face to my back) have slowly gone away, although I do still have some and the occasional pimples/zits that form. It is a lot less noticeable though. I&#x27;m still using the body wash and I hope ONE DAY it works well enough to get rid of all the acne...I hope this was helpful and didn&#x27;t scare anyone into not trying the system. REMEMBER EVERYTHING I HAVE SAID WAS JUST ME PERSONALLY AND DOES NOT MEAN ANYONE ELSE WILL HAVE THE SAME RESULTS.</li>
            <li> It is good and I am liking it very much. I would recommend this to everyone and I would order this again.</li>
            <li> The 2 month supply is exactly what is pictured. A 4 oz bottle of Renewing Cleaner, 4 oz bottle of Revitalizing Toner, 2 oz bottle of Repairing Treatment, and a 1 oz bottle of the Green Tea Moisturizer. I was kind of surprised that a 1 oz bottle of Green Tea Moisturizer is considered a 2 month supply. I hadn&#x27;t tried this product before, but a little does go a long way (Not sure if it&#x27;s 2 months worth if you use it daily though). I did notice it helps smooth out the redness on my eyelids (I&#x27;m very fair skinned). I bought this because I read reviews that said the new formula for Proactiv does not work as well as the old. I am familiar with the old and it worked well for me in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t have cystic acne. I occasionally will get a large bump that never surfaces but is painful. It&#x27;s rare for me though. I do have struggle with small blackheads and occasional break outs. By breakouts, I don&#x27;t mean the kind you see in the commercials where the camera zooms in on a celebrities&#x27; face to show the two tiny zits on their chin. I have actual breakouts with maybe 10 or more zits. Proactiv does work well to take care of that as well as the blackheads.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for any age. I started suffering from cystic acne as I approached my forties and after using this for 2 weeks my skin already started to  heal. t the salon with my son last week, sans make-up a complete stranger complimented me on my skin..Woot-Woot! Finally!!</li>
            <li> Good and will continue with the products.  I&#x27;m 56 years old and experience breakout again.  Unlike other skin cleansers I can use this without making my hypersensitive.</li>
            <li> Does it clear acne scars and relieve razor bumps?</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with pro active to clear your skin!</li>
            <li> This Formula is actually better than New Proactive +. So far excellent results. Do not buy Proactive + It will break your skin.</li>
            <li> Hoping this will clear up my acne. Nice products.</li>
            <li> spent good money for products that not only DIDN&#x27;T improve my face...but they seemed to make it worse.  Wasted time, money and I have more scaring from acne now.  NOT HAPPY w/this item.</li>
            <li> Best products I&#x27;ve ever found to control my acne. The green tea moisturizer is wonderfully soothing and moisturizing. I love the whole system!</li>
            <li> Had cleared my face!  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Very good value and the products seemed great until I saw the expiration date on one. April of 2013? C&#x27;mon. At least give me something within the same year. Not good</li>
            <li> Great product, gently heals breakouts.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and I haven&#x27;t had an actual pimple in I don&#x27;t know how long. I stopped using for a week after getting a sunburn and I definitely noticed a difference in one week. I&#x27;ll never not use Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Ben using proactiv for more than 10 years!  My dermatologist told me yesterday, I have great skin!</li>
            <li> Totally works.  I used it 2x a day until I cleared up and now I use it once a day or even every other day.  Keeps the face clear.  I would highly recommend it.  And a dab will do ya!  Don&#x27;t over apply.</li>
            <li> I have been on proactiv for years. It&#x27;s a great product, gives great results and I&#x27;ll never stop using it. That said, I get 4 months use out of a 2 month kit. I have a small face and I use very little twice daily. After I received my kit and start using it, at the end of 4 months, this kit will expire. I shouldn&#x27;t really complain because it&#x27;s not expiring before and it is meant to use within 2 months but an expiry date for just a little later would not have hurt. I have very sensitive skin and would not like to see what might happen if the product expires while I&#x27;m still using it. I&#x27;m hoping nothing happens though and maybe next time I&#x27;ll purchase it in my own country because I get at least a year to play with.</li>
            <li> product worked as promised and was priced great. Better than ordering direct from manufacturer as you can order when you want and not direct shipped!</li>
            <li> Bought  Proactiv w/ green tea moisturizer for my daughter; didn&#x27;t clear up her acne completely, but her skin does look better.</li>
            <li> Have seen the infomercials for awhile but didnt want to commit to they autodelivery. So glad they are here on Amazon. Just like the commercial says, I saw immediate results. I have never had a facial cleaning system work so good. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like the older kits of proactiv and it works better than the proactiv plus.. I guess it really depends on how your skin reacts.</li>
