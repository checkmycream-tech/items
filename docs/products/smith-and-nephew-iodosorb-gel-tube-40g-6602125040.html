            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> This worked to dry up a wound that wouldn&#x27;t heal.  </li>

            <li> If you need this and use it, you know how great it is. And believe me, this was a GREAT price on Amazon compared to the local pharmacy. Like, a third of the price.</li>
            <li> Great stuff helps to heal foot ulcers</li>
            <li> Healing husband&#x27;s leg very good. thank you</li>
            <li> It was great, it worked well and healed up the wound.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Right on time delivery.  Use this for my husbands wound care. Keeps bandages on with out having to worry about them coming off.</li>
            <li> I first learned of this product in 2012 while fighting post operative MRSN and Pseudomonas infections while in wound care.  Hyperbaric treatment and extensive use of iodasorb saved my life and leg. It&#x27;s not available in Walgreens or CVS so I&#x27;ve been getting it from Amazon. I continue to use it for cuts and diabetic skin irritations and have not had any reoccurrence since 11/15/2012. After 10 months on IV vancomycin and other antibiotics, I&#x27;m a firm believer this product was a key factor in my recovery.</li>

            <li> WOW! VERY FAST DELIVERY VERY HAPPY WITH MY ORDER:)</li>
            <li> It works, my father had an open wound on his foot that had finally stopped bleeding and weeping once we started applying this item you literally could see the skin begin to close around it and move into the center. IT also provided a cushion over the spot while healing. After years of the podiatrist working to keep this from opening up it has completely closed and now he makes sure he wears something on his feet all the time even around the house and we have had no repeat problems and we used very little of the tube to accomplish what I consider a miracle.</li>
            <li> The Item isodosorb is exactly as advertised. Very satisfied with results. Isodosorb did its job and aided with the healing of my wound.</li>
            <li> Well priced, good packaging and shipped/delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find item in stores.  Most drug stores can get it for you but it takes them 7-10 days.  Ordering it through Amazon, I got it the next day.</li>
            <li> This is medication for wound care.</li>
            <li> Beats Rite-Aid and every penny helps...Thank you, Ron Adcock</li>
