    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect adjustable length for both my wife and me.  </li>
            <li>This item is great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>but the quality seemed to be good.</li>
            <li>Now, I find it a great way to enjoy the sun and soak up vitamin D.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, and very effective for picking up magnolia leaves.</li>
            <li>It is a good length of around three feet and is light weight.</li>
            <li>I got this to be able to pick up lots of leaves without raking, which damages the kind of grass we have.  </li>
            <li>I really love having this to use around the yard.  </li>
            <li>Better than the homemade one we put together.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and handy.</li>
            <li>It works fine.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and easy to use</li>
            <li>Just the right length, very light</li>
            <li>With the EZ Litter Stick, I enjoy a chore that I have always loathed.  </li>
            <li>Product works as described, light yet well-built, picks up garbage well.</li>
            <li>Great packaging, but one of the tips is loose!  </li>
            <li>ring on the top of the handle, making storage a real problem</li>
            <li>but it is a very useful tool for just the right price.</li>
            <li>This is a great help in picking up the magnolia tree leaves that clutter my front lawn year round.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how useful I find it to be.</li>
            <li>Works just fine - my young &amp;#34;yard</li>
            <li>This works exactly as I had hoped it would.  </li>
            <li>My first job at 15 was picking up trash at a race track.  </li>
            <li>The first thing you are going to need, is a cork from a wine bottle to protect the tip.  </li>
            <li>Doing charity events like park clean ups or around the town or lawn clean ups, this stops all that back breaking bending over.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty close to a Walmart, so it was really needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>basically it&#x27;s just a stick with a pointy end, but it works well and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>The tip is long enough to hold more than one leaf which makes the pickup easier and quicker.</li>
            <li>It is thick enough to fit comfortably in one of the mop and broom handle storage racks when not in use.</li>
            <li>and this helps my task of removing the ungodly leaves on pretty red mulch.</li>
            <li>this is wonderful to pick up large leaves that land on my red mulch, I have a bad back</li>
            <li>My back is really grateful for this stick.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this so much she is buying one for every single one of her friends.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little loose feeling at the tip, but it works fine.</li>

            <li> This is a great help in picking up the magnolia tree leaves that clutter my front lawn year round. It is a good length of around three feet and is light weight. The tip is long enough to hold more than one leaf which makes the pickup easier and quicker. It is thick enough to fit comfortably in one of the mop and broom handle storage racks when not in use. My back is really grateful for this stick. Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This works exactly as I had hoped it would.  Just the right length, very light so you don&#x27;t get tired carrying it.  Could use a strap off the handle but it is a very useful tool for just the right price.</li>
            <li> This item is great. It is used all the time to pick up litter on our ball fields. There is one thing I noticed to be missing. What happens when the tip needs to be replaced? Where do we get the replacement parts? This information should be included with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for someone. Not sure if they used it or not but the quality seemed to be good. Not sure how it held up though as it was a gift.</li>
            <li> What can you say...basically it&#x27;s just a stick with a pointy end, but it works well and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My first job at 15 was picking up trash at a race track.  I bought this, now 62, because I have lost flexibility in my knees.  It works fine.  The first thing you are going to need, is a cork from a wine bottle to protect the tip.  The one thing you will notice in a second is, that they forgot to put a &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; ring on the top of the handle, making storage a real problem</li>
            <li> Doing charity events like park clean ups or around the town or lawn clean ups, this stops all that back breaking bending over.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I took an Environmental Science class this past semester, and during the course of the class we had a clean-up project for a mile of road nearby.  I purchased the litter stick to aid in that process, and it worked like a dream.  White Rd. in Austell, GA is now cleaner and all of the trash we picked up was sorted and recycled.</li>
            <li> He uses it for his job of mowing and cleaning up trash at a local business.  It is pretty close to a Walmart, so it was really needed.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little loose feeling at the tip, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> I use this tool to pick up litter and debris in my yard.  With the EZ Litter Stick, I enjoy a chore that I have always loathed.  Now, I find it a great way to enjoy the sun and soak up vitamin D.</li>
            <li> The point isn&#x27;t as sharp as I want it to be.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to pick up those hard to pick up Magnolia leaves.</li>
            <li> Just what we were looking for!  Great packaging, but one of the tips is loose!  Would like to know if they sell replacement tips?&lt;br /&gt;Came within the scheduled time slot!</li>
            <li> this is wonderful to pick up large leaves that land on my red mulch, I have a bad back and this helps my task of removing the ungodly leaves on pretty red mulch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, and very effective for picking up magnolia leaves. Yay!</li>
            <li> This exceeded my expectations.  I was prepared to &amp;#34;make&amp;#34; one, but found the EZ Litter Stick online.  Perfect adjustable length for both my wife and me.  Weight is non-taxing as well (we are retired Seniors).  We use to pick up leaves this fall and trash wind-blown on our lawns.</li>
            <li> Product works as described, light yet well-built, picks up garbage well. I have used this product on multiple occasions with no issues.</li>
            <li> I really love having this to use around the yard.  It has helped me to keep from bending over to pick up stuff around the yard.  Every home needs one!</li>
            <li> I like this litter stick it&#x27;s light and easy to use</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this so much she is buying one for every single one of her friends.</li>
            <li> Saves bending to collect leaves from my magnolia tree. I wish the handle were a little longer.</li>
            <li> Works just fine - my young &amp;#34;yard boy &amp;#34; said so.  Better than the homemade one we put together.  Worth the few dollars we spent for it.</li>
            <li> Light weight and handy.</li>
            <li> I got this to be able to pick up lots of leaves without raking, which damages the kind of grass we have.  It works very well.  It works particularly well at picking up this small, sticky, crunchy type of leaves from my neighbor&#x27;s tree.  Plus it makes life a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it yesterday and I would like to know where they sell the replacement tip.  That&#x27;s how useful I find it to be.</li>
