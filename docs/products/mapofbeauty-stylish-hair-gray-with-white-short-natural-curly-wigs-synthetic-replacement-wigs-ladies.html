            <li>styled and love the fit</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have expected this quality for the price - this was an excellent buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very well made construction and that is why it still gets a good rating.  </li>
            <li>It is surprisingly easy to get used to wearing.</li>
            <li>Very quick.</li>
            <li>I really love this wig, it fits great and actually makes me look</li>
            <li>Slightly more grey than what is pictired, but the make and price of the wig is a great value</li>
            <li>Very pretty!</li>
            <li>It was a huge hit at the con</li>
            <li>So the short gray wig is a bit of a bust but the customer service was great.</li>
            <li>This wig is worth every penny I paid for it and more.  </li>
            <li>but it is too cheap to return it.  </li>
            <li>The wig was styled very nice in the back.  </li>
            <li>Its just elegant, and looks very real.</li>
            <li>I love the quality of this wig - it looks genuinely real!</li>
            <li>This is by far, my favorite!</li>
            <li>It looks so real, just like my grand mom - mom.</li>
            <li>Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li>For the money, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>And for the price... not bad.</li>
            <li>Color mix is nice, fibre is thick, but what good is that</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Love it 4 my granny days, easy 2 wear, fits fine, uncomplicated over my long hair.</li>
            <li>Really crappy and cheap construction...wasted my money and will not be a repeat customer nor will I recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>I know I will have fun wearing it.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft, elegant, and looks so damn pretty on her.</li>
            <li>Unlike many people, I found it entirely too big for me, but the stlye is exactly as pictured and the color is almost an exact match for my own.</li>
            <li>Also it is large enough to fit easily on the head.  </li>
            <li>I like this wig very much.  </li>
            <li>The cost is so little it is good to take a chance.</li>
            <li>The first picture is what I thought I was ordering.  </li>
            <li>Most of the gray was in the back.  </li>
            <li>It sits on the top of my head (which is not big)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never wear it, but my whole family is having fun with it.  </li>
            <li>while this wig was cute enough, it was very smelly</li>
            <li>Looks as good as a more expensive purchase we made.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, it looks real.  </li>
            <li>The front hair is a little to long but is easily controlled by a quick sweep of the hand until I am able to get around to curling it.</li>
            <li>Really fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>For $10 I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li>Looked and felt like real hair</li>
            <li>not the color I expected, but OK</li>
            <li>The wig was very inexpensive, and I think I got a real bargain.  </li>
            <li>I really needed this.</li>
            <li>After gluing the mask and the wig to the mannequin, I sprayed it all with a spray stone finish and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>It would look fantastic on young and old alike.</li>
            <li>Should have paid more attention to the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>This wig was too small for my head but the coloring was nice.  </li>
            <li>I have been playing with this wig and styling it every way, but, I keep looking older.</li>
            <li>My head isn&#x27;t super larger either.</li>
            <li>Due to the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a nice wig.</li>
            <li>I got the grey because it was the only color it came in, but even that would have been OK if it looked like the picture.  </li>
            <li>its ok  thanks  a litle to small</li>
            <li>It looks natural enough to wear in public &amp; the color matches my own well enough that even my husband gave me a compliment.</li>
            <li>I expected it to look like a feminine style like it does in the picture, but it is more like a male news reporter look.  </li>
            <li>The color and style look very natural.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>My first order disappeared, and after a month I asked them what to do next.  </li>
            <li>not sure I&#x27;ll be able to wear it - will have to wait and see if smell goes away.  </li>
            <li>It was more blonde and black than gray.  </li>
            <li>The hair is a little&lt;br /&gt;thin, but not real noticeable but for such a cheap price, I am not complaining.</li>
            <li>She is 70 years young.</li>
            <li>If you are young and are questioning this, I suggest you get it.</li>
            <li>This wig said adult.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how well made it is.  </li>
            <li>Nowhere near as pictured.</li>
            <li>I guess the mannequin&#x27;s head is smaller than a normal head.  </li>
            <li>Fits better than my other wigs that I paid at least twice or three times as much for.</li>
            <li>I ordered this...&amp;#34;gray with white short natural curly&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Too bad as the quality was quite good especially for the price, well made inside too, with net and adjustable strap at the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Too bad as the quality was quite good especially for the price, well made inside too, with net and adjustable strap at the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have a normal sized head or larger, don&#x27;t buy this one, it&#x27;s a waste of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty blend of white and silver, and it is thick, not skimpy.  </li>
            <li> for bad hair days  very satisfied</li>
            <li> It was only $10, so are expectations were not very high</li>
            <li> The seller ought to mention the shade of grey that the wig is, this is a steely gray.</li>
            <li> They sent another one within a week with a long blond wavy hair wig as a &amp;#34;sorry&amp;#34; gift.  </li>
            <li> If you want to look ridiculous wearing it for real life, go ahead and be my guest, and be prepared to wait about a month, as this is certainly coming to you via slow boat.</li>
            <li> The wig is smaller than the average wig.</li>
            <li> Photo shows hair down over ears and back of mannequin&#x27;s skull, but in reality, it does not even cover my ears or cover the hairline at the nape of my neck.  </li>
            <li> Not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s shown on a headstand and not a real person.</li>
            <li> I got Dark brown long curly.  </li>
            <li> I had a Halloween Weeping Angel mask and a partial mannequin to put it on.</li>
            <li> ..does not look man made...just brush to fluff up..</li>
            <li> The white shade was mostly in the front which made her complexion look very pale as if she was sick.</li>
            <li> I suggest it to other who want to buy it.</li>
            <li> But the problem is, the head in the photo is very small, so the wig looks long at the back.</li>
            <li> It is however, jet black with gray curls.  </li>
            <li> Anyone in the market for for black and gray, this will probably do.  </li>
            <li> but that was not a true problem for us.  </li>
            <li> It does make my head a little itchy which is not a plus.</li>
            <li> if it does not fit?  </li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s quite short and comes just behind my ears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably order a few more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> Waste of money, but at least not a lot of it.</li>
            <li> This wig runs small; doesn&#x27;t cover my hairline.  </li>
            <li> It is small, small, small!  </li>
            <li> This wig should be advertised for a SMALL head or for a child as a costume wig, it is VERY SMALL.</li>
            <li> I myself find it hard to decide</li>
            <li> At least it had netting and not just lace.</li>
            <li> At least I think I want to hear what &amp;#34;They&amp;#34; have to say.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is too small for my head so if you are petite framed it will work well for you.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Arrived via really slow boat from China and not too ugly -- just too ugly on me!  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!  </li>

            <li> This wig was too small for my head but the coloring was nice.  At least it had netting and not just lace.</li>
            <li> The style is cute, but does not look good on me.  The cost is so little it is good to take a chance.</li>
            <li> Too gray.  Sent it back.</li>
            <li> Really fast delivery.  Quality is excellent!</li>
            <li> Just throw it on brush and you are out the door looking great</li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s not bad. Like the color.</li>
            <li> I have been playing with this wig and styling it every way, but, I keep looking older. So, I will stick to the bob. Maybe, can you donate wigs? I will check</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great buy! Love it.</li>
            <li> What a hoot. It&#x27;s a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> Ok. It has arrived and it does not look anything like the picture, perhaps if I were a mannequin it would look the same as the picture. Well, I&#x27;m okay with it. I look in the mirror and  ask myself does it look like a wig? I myself find it hard to decide so I guess that is good. Am waiting to hear from others on what they think. At least I think I want to hear what &amp;#34;They&amp;#34; have to say. The seller ought to mention the shade of grey that the wig is, this is a steely gray. For the money that I paid I can not complain. It is not curly. But it has no odor either, which is a plus. It does make my head a little itchy which is not a plus. The front hair is a little to long but is easily controlled by a quick sweep of the hand until I am able to get around to curling it. It is surprisingly easy to get used to wearing. Hope this helps anyone who is considering buying this wig. Well, enough said about the head!</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! nothing like the picture! NOT EVEN CLOSE. I checked the package after I opened it to make sure its my order!!!</li>
            <li> Very quick. I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS SO GOOD AND WEARS WELL, THAT I HAD TO ORDER TWO MORE&lt;br /&gt;IT IS FAST, LIGHT, JUST GREAT,  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> The picture you see is not what you get. The wig is very short, not the same color and you cannot style it to look like this.</li>
            <li> For $10 I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  The description says gray with white curls.  The first picture is what I thought I was ordering.  It is however, jet black with gray curls.  Anyone in the market for for black and gray, this will probably do.  Just beware that it takes anywhere from  a month to two to arrive.  Mine came after about 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is an awesome wig! Fits better than my other wigs that I paid at least twice or three times as much for. The hair is a little&lt;br /&gt;thin, but not real noticeable but for such a cheap price, I am not complaining. I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mother who is losing her hair rapidly. She is 70 years young. It took almost 30 days to get, which I knew it would from ordering it. The hair is soft, elegant, and looks so damn pretty on her. I plan on buying her 5 more of these! If you are young and are questioning this, I suggest you get it. It would look fantastic on young and old alike. Its just elegant, and looks very real. Of all the wigs My Mom has, (she has a lot) This is by far, my favorite!</li>
            <li> not at all like what is pictured...unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> Very good wig for a costume.</li>
            <li> Gray with white short wig.  I purchased this wig for my mother, and she did not like it.  The wig was styled very nice in the back.  Most of the gray was in the back.  The white shade was mostly in the front which made her complexion look very pale as if she was sick.</li>
            <li> It looks so real, just like my grand mom - mom. We look like twins. Im so happy with it.</li>
            <li> This wig said adult.  It&#x27;s so small I don&#x27;t see how it would even fit a child!  Useless. My head isn&#x27;t super larger either.</li>
            <li> Good for Halloween and that is all I can say about it. If you want to look ridiculous wearing it for real life, go ahead and be my guest, and be prepared to wait about a month, as this is certainly coming to you via slow boat.</li>
            <li> I got the grey because it was the only color it came in, but even that would have been OK if it looked like the picture.  Mine was straighter and shorter in the back. Maybe I could try to curl it, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet. Mine looks lighter than the picture too.</li>
            <li> i am fully satisfied with purchases. Everything was as described. I suggest it to other who want to buy it.</li>
            <li> Looked and felt like real hair the lady I bought it for was very great full was a very great price as well would buy from again took a little while to receive it but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Love it 4 my granny days, easy 2 wear, fits fine, uncomplicated over my long hair. Makes me feel like baking cookies, ha. Xcellent Quality, love this company. ThankU&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!  It is small, small, small!  Photo shows hair down over ears and back of mannequin&#x27;s skull, but in reality, it does not even cover my ears or cover the hairline at the nape of my neck.  Color mix is nice, fibre is thick, but what good is that if it does not fit?  It sits on the top of my head (which is not big) as though it&#x27;s a comical beret.  Should have paid more attention to the other reviews.  Waste of money, but at least not a lot of it.</li>
            <li> not the color I expected, but OK</li>
            <li> I like this wig very much.  It&#x27;s a pretty blend of white and silver, and it is thick, not skimpy.  Also it is large enough to fit easily on the head.  The wig was very inexpensive, and I think I got a real bargain.  I know I will have fun wearing it.</li>
            <li> Not really what I was looking for. Looks way better in pic.</li>
            <li> This wig should be advertised for a SMALL head or for a child as a costume wig, it is VERY SMALL. I think that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s shown on a headstand and not a real person. Too bad as the quality was quite good especially for the price, well made inside too, with net and adjustable strap at the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you have a normal sized head or larger, don&#x27;t buy this one, it&#x27;s a waste of time. It also took weeks to get here.</li>
            <li> For the price it is a nice wig.  It has a good feel to the hair and the style is flattering.  Unfortunately, it is too small for my head so if you are petite framed it will work well for you.</li>
            <li> I make themed hats for women, so this gal is a perfect model for my creations.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this wig - it looks genuinely real! But the problem is, the head in the photo is very small, so the wig looks long at the back. In fact, it&#x27;s quite short and comes just behind my ears.</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> This wig runs small; doesn&#x27;t cover my hairline.  Color is good, though.  My first order disappeared, and after a month I asked them what to do next.  They sent another one within a week with a long blond wavy hair wig as a &amp;#34;sorry&amp;#34; gift.  I&#x27;ll never wear it, but my whole family is having fun with it.  So the short gray wig is a bit of a bust but the customer service was great.</li>
            <li> Great style, color and quality</li>
            <li> I ordered this...&amp;#34;gray with white short natural curly&amp;#34;.  I got Dark brown long curly.  So dissapointed.  I really needed this.</li>
            <li> Arrived via really slow boat from China and not too ugly -- just too ugly on me!  I only paid $10 and I was pleasantly surprised by how well made it is.  Buying a wig online, however means you take your chances.</li>
            <li> Slightly more grey than what is pictired, but the make and price of the wig is a great value</li>
            <li> I really love this wig, it fits great and actually makes me look younger!&lt;br /&gt;great for bad hair days  very satisfied</li>
            <li> Comfortable fit, great price, looks real! Very pretty!</li>
            <li> Due to the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a nice wig. I had many, many comments from people on how great I looked! so of course I&#x27;ve worn it a lot.</li>
            <li> After my chemo for BC, only about 1/3 of my hair grew back after 5 years, so I dealt with it by wearing a cap when I went out in public. But sometimes a cap just won&#x27;t do...like when you want a picture for your passport or driver&#x27;s license. So I ordered this elcheapo wig, thinking to use it only for the aforementioned situations. Surprise! It looks natural enough to wear in public &amp; the color matches my own well enough that even my husband gave me a compliment.</li>
            <li> I guess the mannequin&#x27;s head is smaller than a normal head.  I expected it to look like a feminine style like it does in the picture, but it is more like a male news reporter look.  It&#x27;s a very well made construction and that is why it still gets a good rating.  And for the price... not bad.</li>
            <li> Unlike many people, I found it entirely too big for me, but the stlye is exactly as pictured and the color is almost an exact match for my own. The texture is perfect and for the price I&#x27;ll probably order a few more.&lt;br /&gt;It took a month to recieve, so I&#x27;ll probably pay for shipping next time.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered it since chemo therapy caused her hair loss.  She has gray hair.  The photo looked good, but the wig didn&#x27;t-- for her.  It was more blonde and black than gray.  Also, it was covered with a web netting… and she did not like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also took a longer time to delivery (3 weeks)  … did not know why… but possibly the wigs are made based on orders placed?  Don&#x27;t know, but that was not a true problem for us.  It was only $10, so are expectations were not very high</li>
            <li> its ok  thanks  a litle to small</li>
            <li> Nowhere near as pictured. Really crappy and cheap construction...wasted my money and will not be a repeat customer nor will I recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> There is no curl to this wig. The colors are pretty, it looks real.  The wig is smaller than the average wig.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect! Soft manageable styles beautifully. .stays styled and love the fit feel and look..at this price I may buy 10 more!! Ty!</li>
            <li> while this wig was cute enough, it was very smelly even I washed it with a fragrant shampoo...not sure I&#x27;ll be able to wear it - will have to wait and see if smell goes away.  It was very cheap and an experiment buying from this company.</li>
            <li> I and my husband love the wigs we bought &amp;#34;two&amp;#34; the price was so good! Looks as good as a more expensive purchase we made. Would recommend product everyone.</li>
            <li> This wig was GREAT for what I needed it for.  I had a convention to attend in June. ANGLICON 2015 is a British Media convention with focus on Doctor Who. I use a mobility scooter and I make costumes for it according to what convention I attend. For ANGLICON 2015, I needed a Doctor Who theme costume and came up with the idea of attaching a Weeping Angel to my scooter. I had a Halloween Weeping Angel mask and a partial mannequin to put it on. I ordered this wig and it worked PERFECTLY for what I needed. After gluing the mask and the wig to the mannequin, I sprayed it all with a spray stone finish and it worked very well. I&#x27;m including a photo of what it looked like. It was a huge hit at the con and I couldn&#x27;t have done it without this wig. If you need a nice wig for a costume, this is the place to get it. It was shipped quickly. I recommend this product and the company that sells it.</li>
            <li> This wig is worth every penny I paid for it and more.  I love it more than the 100 dollar wig I bought.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have expected this quality for the price - this was an excellent buy. The color and style look very natural.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig and then cancelled the order.  After about a month it arrived.  I don&#x27;t want it but it is too cheap to return it.  I will just throw it away.</li>
            <li> awesome..fits perfect..looks great..great price..good color..does not look man made...just brush to fluff up..love it!</li>
