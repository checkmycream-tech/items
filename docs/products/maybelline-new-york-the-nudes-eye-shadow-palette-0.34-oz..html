            <li>Having read the great reviews for Maybelline&#x27;s The Nudes palette, I decided to head to the drugstore and pick one up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the pigment is great, can&#x27;t wait till I get the blushed nudes.</li>

            <li>I realllllly loved this kit!!!!&lt;br /&gt;the colors are really pigmented and they&#x27;re just amazing!!</li>
            <li>They have a large array of matte shades on their website and I am building a wonderful collection.  </li>
            <li>This Palette is AMAZING, everyone&#x27;s been complementing me on my eyes</li>
            <li>Great, cheap nude pallet.</li>
            <li>I have olive skin, and when I try to go for a nude color, often they are too light, but this compact has a great variety of colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are all amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a great &#x27;grown up&#x27; palatte, with some mattes and some lightly shimmery tones.  </li>
            <li>It is so amazing.</li>
            <li>Nicely pigmented, nice shades.</li>
            <li>So its nice</li>
            <li>I was expecting so much more from Maybelline because they make really good makeup.</li>
            <li>The colors are great perfect for many different looks, and it&#x27;s a good size</li>
            <li>colors are nice, and it blends well.</li>
            <li>But it can be also an adventage: you can use your own brush or applicator.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Kind of looks like children&#x27;s makeup</li>
            <li>Nice set for a store brand.</li>
            <li>Use your own brushes.</li>
            <li>Nice colors.</li>
            <li>Well the colors are nice, but why does it look like it was used or</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend using your own brushes to apply tho.</li>
            <li>Nice colors.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the applicator, I use my own makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>The shadows seem nice swatched.</li>
            <li>Even came in its own box.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because it was featured in a makeup tutorial  that I liked.  </li>
            <li>Nice and slim, travels well</li>
            <li>A nice variety</li>
            <li>Has a nice range of colors, though, and I like how it&#x27;s set up to be used as duo, trio, and quads.</li>
            <li>wouldnt&#x27; recommend this if you want a nice blend and stay-ability.  </li>
            <li>comes in a nice closable case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was enthusiastic to try the colors.</li>
            <li>Really nice selection of colors.</li>
            <li>But its great to have the option for more colors if I ever feel adventurous.</li>
            <li>Covers nicely.</li>
            <li>Wonderful range of colors, lasts me through the whole day.</li>
            <li>Really nice eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I believe every one who uses eyeshadow should own this product.</li>
            <li>The Gold is my FAV nice and shimmery.</li>
            <li>Nice smokey eye looks and Glam Gal eyes as well.  </li>
            <li>These colors blend nicely and are applied very easily too.</li>
            <li>Great shades and the price is right!</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors for an economical price.</li>
            <li>This is a great palette, the colors are so beautiful and goes on very well and are easy to blend.</li>
            <li>I am surprised, the quality is very good,  no fallouts, really good blend of Mattes and shimmers, will have to purchase backups.</li>
            <li>Awesome colors, my new go to makeup item.</li>
            <li>The Maybelline New York Nudes Eyeshadow Palette is beautiful!</li>
            <li>Good price, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They are so pigmented and are very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I like the options but the pigment isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>It applied easily, the pigments were great, and everything blended easily together.</li>
            <li>The colors are all very, very neutral and beautiful.</li>
            <li>They are rich and warm and have great color payoff and are easily blendable.</li>
            <li>I love it, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>So far, very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I get better application using my own brushes than the wand that comes with the palette.  </li>
            <li>She said she liked it better than the sephoria nude palette.</li>
            <li>Love Maybelline shadows and this pallet has a nice mix of matte and shimmer shadows.</li>
            <li>If you already own eye-shadow you love in gold, browns and neutrals</li>
            <li>fit good on my skin color.</li>
            <li>I like going for a natural look when I apply eye shadow so this was perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, but the quality is good.</li>
            <li>It is cheap eye shadow but it is really good.</li>
            <li>The highlight for the right quad is beautiful but a medium tone on me that works more as a lid color.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good price!</li>
            <li>favorite look uses the four on the right - they make an absolutely perfect look to wear with cool blues, greys, and blacks.</li>
            <li>I use this like everyday, the colors are great and the pigmentation is perfect.</li>
            <li>So if you have little wrinkles, it is best to use a great quality moisturizer,an even better quality primer ( maybe a luminizer version) and then work with the eyeshadow colors.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>and it was very cheap considering the cost in retail stores.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth.</li>
            <li>Love the pigmentation and the formula is very smooth, almost creamy.</li>
            <li>there are better drugstore nude palettes out there.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on quality but love maybelline</li>
            <li>but pigment is ok</li>
            <li>Love these colors.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OKAY.</li>

            <li>I love all the colors in the set.</li>
            <li>The gold is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love experimenting with all of the colors and mixing shades.</li>
            <li>When this pallet runs out I will be buying it again for sure. :)</li>
            <li>Love my #Nudes :)</li>
            <li>I love it, giving it 4 starts</li>
            <li>I love the colors and how pigmented they are.</li>

            <li>I love this pallete.</li>
            <li>Love the colors</li>
            <li>These are excellent neutrals that really do look great on anyone with anything, and my go-to for daily wear.</li>
            <li>This seems much more like a sampler.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a use for every color and have been satisfied with the opaqueness.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased!!</li>
            <li>I think this is the perfect basic color palette that everyone should have in their makeup drawer!</li>
            <li>This pallete is just okay...</li>
            <li>I wish this palette had more pigment payoff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>but I was expecting more...</li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The various use of this product makes it perfect for travelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but its packaging makes it easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;The price is outstanding for the quality.</li>
            <li>The colors are radiant, I love both the shimmer and the matte.</li>
            <li>We all know this is an awesome alternative to the NAKED palette.  </li>
            <li>BUT MOSTLY buy it on Amazon, because it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li>Stay on and I love the shades.</li>
            <li>Most others have colors I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied I use this for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I do love this kit.</li>
            <li>I love makeup and am a bit of a perfectionist with it and this holds up just as well as the majors.</li>
            <li>Love these colors.</li>
            <li>So many shades to choose from</li>
            <li>This is such a wonderful Palette!</li>
            <li>I love, love the nudes/gold colors.</li>
            <li>I love everything Maybelline.</li>
            <li>Love the color combination</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is inexpensive</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m &amp;#34; middle-aged&amp;#34;, I tend to like the matte nudes better than shimmer.</li>
            <li>It ok</li>
            <li>I love the colors in this palette.</li>
            <li>not my favorite palette.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>These are really nice colors and really great for a natural look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>I really love it..</li>

            <li>Buy Again :)</li>
            <li>LOVE this eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I literally use this on a daily basis and its perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love this color pallet.</li>
            <li>I am using many of the colors that I didn&#x27;t think I would.</li>
            <li>Love this pallet of nude colors.</li>
            <li>but I love the colors and it lasts all day</li>
            <li>some Clinique I was gifted</li>
            <li>Powdery, not terribly pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice, then threw it out.</li>
            <li>I do wish there was one more lighter brown option to fill in my brows, but I can use another product for that.</li>
            <li>The coverage is great, and there isn&#x27;t much fallout.</li>
            <li>What I love about this pallet is the depth of color for both shimmer and matte applications.</li>
            <li>Love the product and the price.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>Many choices to choose from</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I love the colors.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>But I love it anyway:)</li>
            <li>I was expecting much more based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>I love the way the this eye shadow makes my eyes look.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and recommend it.</li>
            <li>The Blushed Nudes is more rosy-toned and has some plum shades.</li>
            <li>The colours are as shown. :)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting more applicator brushes since the one with this wore off. :)</li>
            <li>Love this pallet and how you can group the colors togeather.</li>
            <li>This Maybelline nudes palette is ok.</li>
            <li>I am quite impressed, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>I love the eyeshadow</li>
            <li>Love it can&#x27;t say more 😜</li>
            <li>I love the colors i wear them all the time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still a Maybelline fan for Mascara,eyeliners,bb dream cream,age rewind eye concealer,Brow Drama and now This Nude Palette. :)</li>
            <li>I really love it</li>
            <li>They are ok.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY love the colors of this pallet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the quality is because of the price because I honestly LOVE the ELF product that you can get at Target.</li>
            <li>I was very happy and surprised that this CoverGirl eyeshadow palette has such good coverage and lasts almost all day!  </li>
            <li>Colors nice and rich.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation isn&#x27;t too great, but it&#x27;s a relatively decent nude eyeshadow palette</li>
            <li>Beautiful natural color palette.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a ton for a good color and a shadow primer makes them really pop!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering again as the colors fit my eyeshadow style perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to the Naked pallet, which I own.</li>
            <li>I wound up buying both the naked 2 palette and this one and the difference is incredible.</li>
            <li>Coastal Scents makes great shadows which far outshine Maybelline.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors, they are basic and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I bought this for someone as a gift and loved it so much that I bought myself one.</li>
            <li>I really rubbed it to get a good amour on the app.</li>
            <li>Shipped incredibly fast, good buy.</li>
            <li>She said it is very creamy and good quality.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very surprised to see so many good reviews since everyone I know</li>
            <li>Great  palette for beginners and advanced makeup artists :) can not recommend more especially for its price.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great eye shadow palette!</li>
            <li>easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Also, it came in the mail very quick</li>
            <li>Creased very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and stays on well.</li>
            <li>I applies well and blends easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and one time application lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Use this everyday, I love the nude colors, they go perfectly with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; travel with.</li>
            <li>The colors are easy to build up into darker heavier shades.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The color applies easily and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>So easy to blend and pigmented</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t blend easily.</li>
            <li>I really liked the packaging because they&#x27;re not bulky, and even though they don&#x27;t have a mirror, I liked the clear plastic window because I could see all the colors in the store.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say about the quality of the eyeshadows but the colours are so great and useful.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and blend as well</li>
            <li>, makes it easy to store and to travel with.</li>
            <li>show up nicely and last for a good while.</li>
            <li>The colors aren&#x27;t as strong as I tought they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for anyone that wants a great nude palette at a good price.</li>
            <li>Nice colors - look exactly like they do online and wear well.  </li>
            <li>Good for new make-up user.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not rocket science, but Maybelline quality is fine.</li>
            <li>I am lucky none of the shadow broke or cracked!</li>
            <li>great pigmentation, presentation is also good, tho is really small, almost fit my hand, therefore really easy to transport.</li>
            <li>First off, the eyeshadows are amazing and a great dupe for the UD naked palettes.</li>
            <li>I love this palet so much!!</li>
            <li>They are very pretty!</li>
            <li>Also, the compact is a great size... not so big that it doesn&#x27;t fit into my modestly-size organizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of eyeshadows and I have a ton.</li>
            <li>everything else is kind of chalky and the pigment is really lacking.</li>
            <li>But love all the colors in it and it&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li>This would be a great palette for those just starting to use makeup.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and at low price.</li>
            <li>This palette is great if you want a Naked palette but don&#x27;t want to (or can&#x27;t afford to) spend the money.</li>
            <li>With primer it applies smoothly and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>The powder is light, but it spreads across the eye well without emphasizing the creases in my lids.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its easy to hold, clean, use, and take on the go.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important to me because sometimes I have to wear it all day.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s still light.</li>
            <li>My complexion is olive, she is more golden and they are flattering on both of us.</li>
            <li>Some of the shadows go on smoothly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all the colors within the span of a few days and they look awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, flesh colored tones are perfect to use for your everyday basic/natural look and</li>
            <li>Even at regular price, this is still a good deal for so many versatile colors.</li>
            <li>This is also perfect for those who don&#x27;t want to spend much money for urban decay eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Naked, but it does ok</li>
            <li>I really thought I would love this palette more, but the colors were darker then</li>
            <li>It has a good range for color and my mother said she likes it better than my naked palette!</li>
            <li>the black is great (good pigment matte black) and one of the medium browns are great.</li>
            <li>Not super impressed with the shadows, they aren&#x27;t super pigmented.</li>
            <li>Color ranges from very light cream to black, looks great with my brown eyes.</li>
            <li>The pallet has a great variety of shades from very light to almost black in darkness.</li>
            <li>The colors are highly pigmented which is nice</li>
            <li>Its worth it!</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are beautiful as expected.</li>
            <li>my opinion this product is just as good as some Bare Minerals shadow-</li>
            <li>The colors are rich, blendable, and stay put through the day</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t as rich as I would like.</li>
            <li>The application sponge is a wee bit small, but otherwise, the colors are perfect!</li>
            <li>In general the colors are good, but the quality leaves something to be desired.  </li>
            <li>The selection of colors is pretty much perfect for any kind of look I could want, and it&#x27;s all here in one palette rather than several smaller sets.</li>
            <li>Some of the shades are not very pigmented or finely milled, so you will need a good eyeshadow primer if you want one application to stay all day (I recommend a moisturizing concealer or ELF cheapie primer), but some of the shades (like the matte cool-taupe) are amazing, buttery smooth and very flattering.</li>
            <li>Had to clean it up a bit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The use of applicator also helps to keep the colors clean and  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s nice having so many shades to choose from to create different looks.</li>
            <li>I can clean it up</li>
            <li>Great and fresh product with lasting pigments.</li>
            <li>I would be more thrilled with it if I was still using shimmer shades, but even testing them on the back of my hand</li>
            <li>nice shades, not smudgy and will last most of the day</li>
            <li>love the colors great for everyday use</li>
            <li>This is an incredible value and SO perfect for a travel makeup kit -- it has all the shades for a pretty natural day look to a smokey dramatic neutral evening eye.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love the colors and they look really good.</li>
            <li>Let me just let you know that if you want a decent natural toned pallete for a great price than the Nudes is for you.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to blend and with my oil skin it last most of the day without a primer.</li>
            <li>I love this pallet so so much.</li>
            <li>Love it &amp; fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found a lot of good tutorials for different looks.</li>
            <li>I heard good reviews about this product so decided to buy online, but received a palette that had numerous scratch on the cover and some shades were chipped off.</li>
            <li>full summer</li>
            <li>I loved maybelline eyeshadows since I was a teen.</li>
            <li>good solid neutrals that go one well, blend well will buy again</li>
            <li>Good enough!</li>
            <li>and i never thought i would love it this much.  </li>
            <li>seems to ring true to this product.</li>
            <li>This is more for non professionals, the colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented, and sometimes stuff won&#x27;t come on the brush,  </li>
            <li>But it could be good for a starting out teenager or beginner in eye makeup.</li>
            <li>You really have to dab/srub with brush to get any color out the pigmentation is ok.</li>
            <li>so thats cool.</li>
            <li>Love rhis grwat colors fast ahipping</li>
            <li>If you want something that rivals the Naked palettes but don&#x27;t want to drop $50-$60, this is a good option.</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try since I&#x27;ve just started to learn how to do a proper makeup and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a good palette.</li>
            <li>I apply Milani eyeshadow primer before I put these colors on, and they are very pigmented and lovely.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Great price for the quality, I&#x27;ve used dept. store brands that weren&#x27;t this nice, didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>the colors aren&#x27;t very saturated but if you&#x27;re going for an incredibly natural look I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>Packaging is plastic but adequate.</li>
            <li>I have the Naked Palette, costing much more, and I find myself using this palette more often than that one.</li>
            <li>Arrived Quick and just as described...</li>
            <li>Wears off quick though</li>
            <li>If you can afford an Urban Decay palette this the next best thing for the price.</li>
            <li>Good for everyday look :)</li>
            <li>I like that some have a very light glimmer to them for fun but without looking unprofessional while the others are mainly matte.</li>
            <li>Very pretty neutral, earthy tones.</li>
            <li>It has a great nude shade, a shimmery but subtle cream for highlighting, and I particularly love the taupey grays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shades are nice, but I personally feel like it doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth and nice as the Naked eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>In good weather conditions it last all day, need to reapply if it´s too hot.</li>
            <li>I own many &#x27;high end&#x27; eyeshadow palettes and not only is Maybelline</li>
            <li>Perfect for a rather clumsy beginner!</li>

            <li>It gives me a more natural look while wearing makeup !</li>
            <li>You can easily pull off a light natural look or a heavier darker smokey look with the mix of colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great neutral palatte for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>This pallet is an amazing dupe for the naked pallet.</li>
            <li>The price is a few dollars cheaper than any of my locals stores, which is a great bonus.</li>
            <li>The colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented, so when you try to use a light color, it doesn&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li>Meh, its okay the shades are standard wish all the bronze color where a lot more pigmented and brighter Ok palette if your just starting off</li>
            <li>I love all of the natural shades</li>
            <li>This palette is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Fun to play with, too.</li>
            <li>for the price i didn&#x27;t expect much, its a good palette you might have to swipe a few times on ur eyelid for more color power.</li>
            <li>Like I said for the price its expected :) but if you&#x27;re looking for something with more pigment and price, I&#x27;d go for a nyx nude palette.</li>
            <li>I wanted a cost effective substitute for a Naked palette</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with that my make up skills are on par with a 14 year old girl</li>
            <li>But overall, they give a nice look</li>
            <li>I have alot of fun with this product.</li>
            <li>So not all of the colors are useful for me.</li>
            <li>definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>It was well worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Worth giving it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of the shadows are shimmer formulations, which, being a mature woman, I can&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li>I only like this kind of colors</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised when this palette arrived :)</li>
            <li>The overall color tone tends toward cool (blue) rather than warm, which doesn&#x27;t work well for my skin tone (very light ruddy complexion).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s darker colors are great to use for a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li>colors definitely blend more easily than others (the darker shades take some work), but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the blendability.</li>
            <li>Also, there&#x27;s a good mixture of shimmer and matte colors unlike the Naked palettes that have maybe one matte, a couple glitter shadows, and the rest are high shimmer.</li>
            <li>Difinetly have to have the right brush to make it show up.</li>
            <li>When I started using it however, the colors just didn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are very soft and crumble easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never done my own eye shadow but these colors make it easy to teach yourself and all go really well with each other.</li>
            <li>I honestly use this pallet every single day and rarely stray from it.</li>
            <li>maybe i&#x27;m just lazy about using primer lol</li>
            <li>I love the nude palette, it has plenty of options and colors on the spectrum to create whatever look you want (smokey, or barely there for example).</li>
            <li>Good color payoff in both the dark and highlight colors.</li>
            <li>Tried this for the price instead of Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked series, and it&#x27;s great for the price.  </li>
            <li>Love it do much,  can play around with shades early.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for simple, everyday looks.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great palette if you&#x27;re looking for a very natural look that&#x27;s not too dark.</li>
            <li>So I wanted to try out their first pallet I believe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased especially with the price.</li>
            <li>The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel that some of the matte colors could use just a but more pigmentation.</li>
            <li>I love this basic palette!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see spending over $50 on Urban Decay or Tarte or some of the more prestigious lines for what are basically earth toned eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Can get many different looks from this one palette.</li>
            <li>Of course, this is a lot cheaper than the higher end palettes, so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>the color in the picture is as pretty and exact as in the picture.</li>
            <li>I find myself using this pallet more than the Naked!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a budget-friendly version of the Naked Palettes, I suggest Makeup Revolution&#x27;s Iconic palettes, now at Ulta.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>I own several naked palettes and purchased this via recommendation from a friend since it can fit snuggly in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I found this palette to be exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>Not urban decay but way more affordable too.</li>
            <li>First of all, the case was scratched a lot.</li>
            <li>I thought the numbering sequence and suggestions on the back were fantastic!</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s not likely! :)</li>
            <li>Love the shades especially for my brown eyes</li>
            <li>It is more towards the low end scale for makeup</li>
            <li>Helps to use a primer before hand, if you can use a white one even better.</li>
            <li>I was interested in the color palette, but once I began using it, it doesn&#x27;t apply as well as I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the colors, but they just aren&#x27;t pigmented enough.  </li>
            <li>I also love the suggestions of use in the back of the product.</li>
            <li>Also, its very pigmented so it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get the look you want!</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a matte shadow that is the exact color of my skin and this Maybelline palette doesn&#x27;t contain one.  </li>
            <li>It simply isn&#x27;t consistent.  </li>
            <li>I really am digging the colors!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I is fairly highly pigmented with a very pretty color.  </li>
            <li>Great neutrals with matte and shimmer and very small</li>
            <li>I was super excited when I saw them at my local drugstore, and I picked all three of them up.</li>
            <li>There are some instructions and style suggestions on the back of this palette regarding different eye looks you can create, it gives a good number of suggestions for duos, trios and quads.</li>
            <li>My favorite colors in one palette - the shadows are dark and blend well with a mixture of the other shadows in this palette - def a good quality beauty shadow palette.</li>
            <li>The color are so pretty and goes on really well.</li>
            <li>Great product, comparable to more expensive options in quality and color!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really compare this to higher end products.</li>
            <li>I do use a good quality makeup brush, not the small sponge brushes that come with it.</li>
            <li>Saw this palette at Target (for at least 30% more) and decided it would be a good starting point.</li>
            <li>enough to provide something better, at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>Not as strongly pigmented as the Naked palettes.</li>
            <li>It comes with 12 shades and love every single one.</li>
            <li>I liked this pallet at first (And actually gave it 4 stars) but had to change it to 2 because i decided after a month or two that i actually only like 2 colors out of 12!</li>
            <li>They are exact color matches for the Naked palettes and are nicely pigmented and buttery for only $9.99.</li>
            <li>But they are worth the price especially if you just want a quick color.</li>
            <li>Really like it easy to apply last all day</li>
            <li>but I wish it had a very light pink for highlighting.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very nice in a subtle and classic way.</li>
            <li>It provides the selection of colors from light shading, or very muted look to deep smoky make up for the night.</li>
            <li>I really like these eye shadows, they go on smooth and last for hours.</li>
            <li>im very upset</li>
            <li>Stays on really well without creasing.</li>
            <li>And I will use them when I don&#x27;t want to use too much makeup.</li>
            <li>I really like this palette.</li>
            <li>To much fall out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gorgeous colors and reasonably pigmented.  </li>
            <li>Two of the included quad sets that make up this palette are what I use every day anyway, so it was very convenient to find it here in a 12 color set.</li>
            <li>I noticed they now have a smokes color collection palette that I may have to try after liking this one so much.</li>
            <li>Very versatile.</li>
            <li>They stay on very well too.</li>
            <li>Really like the product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really got upset for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the brush that it comes with, and the colors are neutral so u can wear with any thing.</li>
            <li>The colors looked very powdery when on</li>
            <li>I really enjoy playing with the different colors included.</li>
            <li>Anyway Maybelline didn&#x27;t disappoint me too much.</li>
            <li>I really like them,</li>
            <li>Not a fan of this one as much</li>
            <li>One thing I&#x27;ve learned is that quality products really make a world of difference.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and product was well protected.</li>
            <li>A MUST have, I absolutely adore this set.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really know how to apply eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>The fact is that the shadows don&#x27;t have much pigmentation at all and the colors are nicer in the pictures than they really are.</li>
            <li>But the shadow doesn&#x27;t apply evenly, and is such a light pigmentation that you have to use a lot, even with the darker shades.  </li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>The Maybelline website doesn&#x27;t even sell it for that much</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>I do like the pigmentation of the browns, however, I am really bummed about the gold.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product as it has a variety of the &#x27;nude&#x27; colors.</li>
            <li>I tried this palette and the colors are very pigmented and glide on.</li>
            <li>The Nudes much cheaper</li>
            <li>I bought It for My girlfriend, she loved it, and was actually surprised that in the package actually come two palettes of the same.</li>
            <li>Great natural colors for everyday, does not irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I use Eco Tools brushes, but the narrow sponge that comes with this set is handy for applying shadow along the edges of the lid.</li>
            <li>The pigment isn&#x27;t rich enough</li>
            <li>With all the different colors this pallete is at such a great price and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I generally stick to drugstore brands, but I&#x27;m slowly learning more and more about makeup.</li>
            <li>Great and lasts long for how little it looks.</li>
            <li>Nice palette, although it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li>love the colors and the ideas on how u can use the colors as a single shade, duo, triple or quad!!!</li>
            <li>The free shipping took about a week to get to me, since it was from Amazon and not another country (plus I live in the middle of no where).</li>
            <li>I try to only wear them for special occasions.</li>
            <li>Like all the colors,the squares do come loose easy</li>
            <li>I thought there would be some nice matte browns or taupes to use as transition shades, but no, every single shadow has an obnoxious overspray of glitter that actually will pick up when you dip your brush or your finger in them.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>colors are pretty pigmented &amp; have nice color payoff too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very small &amp; sleek</li>
            <li>When I purchased it said NEW!</li>
            <li>I know l will use them all until l the fit is dry.</li>
            <li>The black could have been more darker and pigmented.</li>
            <li>The Nudes, of course, has more neutral colors--browns, coppers, a black.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked2 and Naked3 and, in comparison, they are more pigmented and last longer than the Maybelline palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors are really bold and last for over 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Not as opaque as I&#x27;d like them to be, but decent for the price</li>
            <li>but this particular one is quite decent.  </li>
            <li>My personal biology leads eyeshadow to wear away quickly.</li>
            <li>I like this better than a MUCH more expensive &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They last all day and you can create so many different looks.</li>
            <li>Hmm... I could pay a high price at Walmart for this, orrrr</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had high end eye-shadow except</li>
            <li>Was gonna splurge on a high end over rated neutral shades palette but decided to give this a try instead.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Colors were what I expected, applied fine and was delivered intact and on time.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are not very pigmented but other than that it is a good palette</li>
            <li>All the shades are usable on me except one, the highlight from the second quad (third from the top row left to right).</li>
            <li>I tried compacting as much of the loose shadow back into its spot but lost most of it.</li>
            <li>Some colors kind like hard to see.</li>
            <li>I paid the New price so it should have been New!</li>
            <li>The color does not go on my eyelid very easily and has to be very heavily applied for it to be noticeable.</li>
            <li>It is a really great alternative to expensive makeup.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of MAC eye shadow and that is great, but expensive.</li>
            <li>Have fun exploring different looks with.</li>
            <li>Sad because the colors do go on gorgeous at first.</li>
            <li>Why would I completely cover the eye with dark brown and then put a smudge of light nude in the corner?!</li>
            <li>Love this palette for everyday looks</li>
            <li>Technically there should be 3 ( one per quad) but only the top left is light enough for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s shimmer colors and normal shades.</li>
            <li>I bought this palette hoping that it contained more than a few matte shades.  </li>
            <li>They have good colour pay-off and come in a sleek and thin package.</li>
            <li>The size of the palette is perfect (I&#x27;m getting so sick of those bulky palettes taking up space) and the design is sleek.</li>
            <li>my new cover been dying for this palette</li>
            <li>I really love this product for multiple reasons.&lt;br /&gt;The palette offer a wide selection of colors-</li>
            <li>The actual product is exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li>that I bought a second immediately after buying the first in case they discontinued it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is unfortunately no dupe for the Naked or Lorac Pro palettes.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to have received TWO palettes!</li>
            <li>I usually only wear neutral colors so I was excited that this pallet gave me a lot of variety that I would actually use.</li>
            <li>very nice shades does not crumble my only complaint would be only one wand</li>
            <li>I was smart and chose the latter.  </li>
            <li>I bought this from Ulta a little unsure on how I would like the quality, given the cheap price.</li>
            <li>Thought this was a great price for a pretty close dupe to other expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the shadows are a little sheer, but build-able.</li>
            <li>The little chart on the back that shows what colors to use together (depending on how many of them you&#x27;d like to use) is helpful.  </li>
            <li>Perfectly pigmented too the only bad side is the price.</li>
            <li>The colors are clear even without primer.</li>
            <li>The application instructions on the back are clear and make it fun to experiment with different applications.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s eye shadow..looks natural</li>
            <li>The old saying you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>You can create both natural look and smoky one with it</li>
            <li>With this set you can do a smoky or natural look</li>
            <li>completely off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d much prefer  the Naked palette.</li>
            <li>I find myself reaching for an additional highlight eyeshadow to complete a look.</li>
            <li>and it offers something I didn&#x27;t have in my collection.</li>
            <li>but when I got it there was one that was almost completely crumbled and another that had popped out of the tray.</li>
            <li>I wear it everyday with the many different shades.  </li>
            <li>If you use a primer or a base before you apply the shadows, you&#x27;ll get the best results from the product.</li>
            <li>talking about color they are exactly as the picture, they last very long, and I really want to buy it again.</li>
            <li>I have experienced that with quite a few eyeshadows I&#x27;ve used in the past, but I did not find this to be the case with this one!</li>
            <li>The scale goes white, pink, browns, and a black which is nice for options.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not trying to go for a high glamour look, just regular coverage.  </li>
            <li>It is very pigmented and stays on all day long.</li>
            <li>Plus it is so compact, but not too small, and it is in a secure casing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really wear the colors because they don&#x27;t stay on long or go on well.</li>
            <li>Even using Urban Decay&#x27;s primer it is very much faded at the end of my long (10-11 hrs)</li>
            <li>The only shade I have used successfully is the upper left one (white) for highlights, since those are supposed to be subtle anyway.</li>
            <li>but it was discontinued and I&#x27;m on my last pack so off to try new ones.</li>
            <li>I am a dark skin toned American so this could have look just fine on a lighter individual.</li>
            <li>I only use a couple of the colors in this palette regularly and if I had known that this would be the case, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased the whole palette.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (I can only wear hypoallergenic jewelry, etc.)</li>
            <li>so many possibilities from dramatic to natural look</li>
            <li>A few colors are a little lighter than I&#x27;d like, but for the most part they all apply really well as long as you blend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not pale and freckled like a lot of red heads.</li>
            <li>The light &amp; white colors do not show, have very little pigment.</li>
            <li>I use a tiny bit of vegetable glycerin and natural concealer to prime my lids and the colors</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the size of this palette, I thought it was going to be a lot smaller.</li>
            <li>The colors are really dark so The Nudes in the title is pretty misleading.</li>
            <li>It comes with an array of nude colors for all different skin colors if going for the natural look.</li>
            <li>, this is just what I expected, I don&#x27;t use to much make up</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to the gold shadow but it barely shows up, even when using a wet brush.</li>
            <li>I looked past the fact that it came with out a brush and tried a few of the colors on with one of my own brushes.</li>
            <li>Normally, paying for a better product&lt;br /&gt;might be worth it, but prices on make up are outrageous in the first place -  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, the darker ones are very pigmented with any form of application.</li>
            <li>The ones I&#x27;ve used so far (4) are a little firm so it doesn&#x27;t apply easily.</li>
            <li>I had been planning to splurge on an Urban Decay Naked palette, but I needed new eyeshadow before I could get to a store that sells Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be an Urban Decay Naked dupe, but these shadows are powdery and dry with only one or two that feel buttery and have a decent amount of pigment.</li>
            <li>But the white eyeshadows are so not pigmented, Plus the third shade is barely pigmented with a brush, and the pad one that they give you.</li>
            <li>The colors are true and go on subtle enough that they can be built up or left sheer.</li>
            <li>I said, I am not a professional, and I generally do use drugstore products, so</li>

            <li> It worked great for me, I am a porcelain/fair skin tone.</li>
            <li> Having read the great reviews for Maybelline&#x27;s The Nudes palette, I decided to head to the drugstore and pick one up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the pigment is great, can&#x27;t wait till I get the blushed nudes.</li>

            <li> I think this isn&#x27;t a product for &amp;#34;professional makeup artist&amp;#34;, the colors aren&#x27;t strongly pigmented but they are SO great for anyone else!</li>

            <li> I realllllly loved this kit!!!!&lt;br /&gt;the colors are really pigmented and they&#x27;re just amazing!!</li>
            <li> They have a large array of matte shades on their website and I am building a wonderful collection.  </li>
            <li> This Palette is AMAZING, everyone&#x27;s been complementing me on my eyes</li>
            <li> Great, cheap nude pallet.</li>
            <li> I have olive skin, and when I try to go for a nude color, often they are too light, but this compact has a great variety of colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are all amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great &#x27;grown up&#x27; palatte, with some mattes and some lightly shimmery tones.  </li>
            <li> It is so amazing.</li>
            <li> Nicely pigmented, nice shades.</li>
            <li> So its nice</li>
            <li> I was expecting so much more from Maybelline because they make really good makeup.</li>
            <li> The colors are great perfect for many different looks, and it&#x27;s a good size</li>
            <li> colors are nice, and it blends well.</li>
            <li> But it can be also an adventage: you can use your own brush or applicator.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Kind of looks like children&#x27;s makeup</li>
            <li> Nice set for a store brand.</li>
            <li> Use your own brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice colors.</li>
            <li> Well the colors are nice, but why does it look like it was used or</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend using your own brushes to apply tho.</li>
            <li> Nice colors.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the applicator, I use my own makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> The shadows seem nice swatched.</li>
            <li> Even came in its own box.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it was featured in a makeup tutorial  that I liked.  </li>
            <li> Nice and slim, travels well</li>
            <li> A nice variety</li>
            <li> Has a nice range of colors, though, and I like how it&#x27;s set up to be used as duo, trio, and quads.</li>
            <li> wouldnt&#x27; recommend this if you want a nice blend and stay-ability.  </li>
            <li> comes in a nice closable case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was enthusiastic to try the colors.</li>
            <li> Really nice selection of colors.</li>
            <li> But its great to have the option for more colors if I ever feel adventurous.</li>
            <li> Covers nicely.</li>
            <li> Wonderful range of colors, lasts me through the whole day.</li>
            <li> Really nice eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I believe every one who uses eyeshadow should own this product.</li>
            <li> The Gold is my FAV nice and shimmery.</li>
            <li> Nice smokey eye looks and Glam Gal eyes as well.  </li>
            <li> These colors blend nicely and are applied very easily too.</li>
            <li> Great shades and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors for an economical price.</li>
            <li> This is a great palette, the colors are so beautiful and goes on very well and are easy to blend.</li>
            <li> I am surprised, the quality is very good,  no fallouts, really good blend of Mattes and shimmers, will have to purchase backups.</li>
            <li> Awesome colors, my new go to makeup item.</li>
            <li> The Maybelline New York Nudes Eyeshadow Palette is beautiful!</li>
            <li> Good price, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> They are so pigmented and are very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I like the options but the pigment isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> It applied easily, the pigments were great, and everything blended easily together.</li>
            <li> The colors are all very, very neutral and beautiful.</li>
            <li> They are rich and warm and have great color payoff and are easily blendable.</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> So far, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I get better application using my own brushes than the wand that comes with the palette.  </li>
            <li> She said she liked it better than the sephoria nude palette.</li>
            <li> Love Maybelline shadows and this pallet has a nice mix of matte and shimmer shadows.</li>
            <li> If you already own eye-shadow you love in gold, browns and neutrals</li>
            <li> fit good on my skin color.</li>
            <li> I like going for a natural look when I apply eye shadow so this was perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, but the quality is good.</li>
            <li> It is cheap eye shadow but it is really good.</li>
            <li> The highlight for the right quad is beautiful but a medium tone on me that works more as a lid color.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good price!</li>
            <li> favorite look uses the four on the right - they make an absolutely perfect look to wear with cool blues, greys, and blacks.</li>
            <li> I use this like everyday, the colors are great and the pigmentation is perfect.</li>
            <li> So if you have little wrinkles, it is best to use a great quality moisturizer,an even better quality primer ( maybe a luminizer version) and then work with the eyeshadow colors.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> and it was very cheap considering the cost in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the pigmentation and the formula is very smooth, almost creamy.</li>
            <li> there are better drugstore nude palettes out there.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on quality but love maybelline</li>
            <li> but pigment is ok</li>
            <li> Love these colors.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OKAY.</li>
            <li> Love the shades and color combination options.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors in the set.</li>
            <li> The gold is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love experimenting with all of the colors and mixing shades.</li>
            <li> When this pallet runs out I will be buying it again for sure. :)</li>
            <li> Love my #Nudes :)</li>
            <li> I love it, giving it 4 starts</li>
            <li> I love the colors and how pigmented they are.</li>
            <li> Love the color combos.</li>
            <li> Love these colors...</li>
            <li> Love the variation of shades.</li>
            <li> I love this pallete.</li>
            <li> Love the colors</li>
            <li> These are excellent neutrals that really do look great on anyone with anything, and my go-to for daily wear.</li>
            <li> This seems much more like a sampler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a use for every color and have been satisfied with the opaqueness.</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased!!</li>
            <li> I think this is the perfect basic color palette that everyone should have in their makeup drawer!</li>
            <li> This pallete is just okay...</li>
            <li> I wish this palette had more pigment payoff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> but I was expecting more...</li>
            <li> Love the colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The various use of this product makes it perfect for travelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but its packaging makes it easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;The price is outstanding for the quality.</li>
            <li> The colors are radiant, I love both the shimmer and the matte.</li>
            <li> We all know this is an awesome alternative to the NAKED palette.  </li>
            <li> BUT MOSTLY buy it on Amazon, because it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> Stay on and I love the shades.</li>
            <li> Most others have colors I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied I use this for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I do love this kit.</li>
            <li> I love makeup and am a bit of a perfectionist with it and this holds up just as well as the majors.</li>
            <li> Love these colors.</li>
            <li> So many shades to choose from</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful Palette!</li>
            <li> I love, love the nudes/gold colors.</li>
            <li> I love everything Maybelline.</li>
            <li> Love the color combination</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is inexpensive</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m &amp;#34; middle-aged&amp;#34;, I tend to like the matte nudes better than shimmer.</li>
            <li> It ok</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this palette.</li>
            <li> not my favorite palette.</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> These are really nice colors and really great for a natural look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> I really love it..</li>
            <li> IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> Buy Again :)</li>
            <li> LOVE this eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I literally use this on a daily basis and its perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love this color pallet.</li>
            <li> I am using many of the colors that I didn&#x27;t think I would.</li>
            <li> Love this pallet of nude colors.</li>
            <li> but I love the colors and it lasts all day</li>
            <li> some Clinique I was gifted</li>
            <li> Powdery, not terribly pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice, then threw it out.</li>
            <li> I do wish there was one more lighter brown option to fill in my brows, but I can use another product for that.</li>
            <li> The coverage is great, and there isn&#x27;t much fallout.</li>
            <li> What I love about this pallet is the depth of color for both shimmer and matte applications.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> Many choices to choose from</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but I love the colors.</li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> But I love it anyway:)</li>
            <li> I was expecting much more based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> I love the way the this eye shadow makes my eyes look.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Blushed Nudes is more rosy-toned and has some plum shades.</li>
            <li> The colours are as shown. :)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting more applicator brushes since the one with this wore off. :)</li>
            <li> Love this pallet and how you can group the colors togeather.</li>
            <li> This Maybelline nudes palette is ok.</li>
            <li> I am quite impressed, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> I love the eyeshadow</li>
            <li> Love it can&#x27;t say more 😜</li>
            <li> I love the colors i wear them all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a Maybelline fan for Mascara,eyeliners,bb dream cream,age rewind eye concealer,Brow Drama and now This Nude Palette. :)</li>
            <li> I really love it</li>
            <li> They are ok.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY love the colors of this pallet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the quality is because of the price because I honestly LOVE the ELF product that you can get at Target.</li>
            <li> I was very happy and surprised that this CoverGirl eyeshadow palette has such good coverage and lasts almost all day!  </li>
            <li> Colors nice and rich.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation isn&#x27;t too great, but it&#x27;s a relatively decent nude eyeshadow palette</li>
            <li> Beautiful natural color palette.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a ton for a good color and a shadow primer makes them really pop!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering again as the colors fit my eyeshadow style perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the Naked pallet, which I own.</li>
            <li> I wound up buying both the naked 2 palette and this one and the difference is incredible.</li>
            <li> Coastal Scents makes great shadows which far outshine Maybelline.  </li>
            <li> I love the colors, they are basic and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone as a gift and loved it so much that I bought myself one.</li>
            <li> I really rubbed it to get a good amour on the app.</li>
            <li> Shipped incredibly fast, good buy.</li>
            <li> She said it is very creamy and good quality.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very surprised to see so many good reviews since everyone I know</li>
            <li> Great  palette for beginners and advanced makeup artists :) can not recommend more especially for its price.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a great eye shadow palette!</li>
            <li> easy to blend.</li>
            <li> Also, it came in the mail very quick</li>
            <li> Creased very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and stays on well.</li>
            <li> I applies well and blends easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and one time application lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Use this everyday, I love the nude colors, they go perfectly with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; travel with.</li>
            <li> The colors are easy to build up into darker heavier shades.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The color applies easily and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> So easy to blend and pigmented</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t blend easily.</li>
            <li> I really liked the packaging because they&#x27;re not bulky, and even though they don&#x27;t have a mirror, I liked the clear plastic window because I could see all the colors in the store.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say about the quality of the eyeshadows but the colours are so great and useful.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply and blend as well</li>
            <li> , makes it easy to store and to travel with.</li>
            <li> show up nicely and last for a good while.</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t as strong as I tought they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for anyone that wants a great nude palette at a good price.</li>
            <li> Nice colors - look exactly like they do online and wear well.  </li>
            <li> Good for new make-up user.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rocket science, but Maybelline quality is fine.</li>
            <li> I am lucky none of the shadow broke or cracked!</li>
            <li> great pigmentation, presentation is also good, tho is really small, almost fit my hand, therefore really easy to transport.</li>
            <li> First off, the eyeshadows are amazing and a great dupe for the UD naked palettes.</li>
            <li> I love this palet so much!!</li>
            <li> They are very pretty!</li>
            <li> Also, the compact is a great size... not so big that it doesn&#x27;t fit into my modestly-size organizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of eyeshadows and I have a ton.</li>
            <li> everything else is kind of chalky and the pigment is really lacking.</li>
            <li> But love all the colors in it and it&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
            <li> This would be a great palette for those just starting to use makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and at low price.</li>
            <li> This palette is great if you want a Naked palette but don&#x27;t want to (or can&#x27;t afford to) spend the money.</li>
            <li> With primer it applies smoothly and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> The powder is light, but it spreads across the eye well without emphasizing the creases in my lids.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its easy to hold, clean, use, and take on the go.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s important to me because sometimes I have to wear it all day.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s still light.</li>
            <li> My complexion is olive, she is more golden and they are flattering on both of us.</li>
            <li> Some of the shadows go on smoothly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all the colors within the span of a few days and they look awesome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, flesh colored tones are perfect to use for your everyday basic/natural look and</li>
            <li> Even at regular price, this is still a good deal for so many versatile colors.</li>
            <li> This is also perfect for those who don&#x27;t want to spend much money for urban decay eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Naked, but it does ok</li>
            <li> I really thought I would love this palette more, but the colors were darker then</li>
            <li> It has a good range for color and my mother said she likes it better than my naked palette!</li>
            <li> the black is great (good pigment matte black) and one of the medium browns are great.</li>
            <li> Not super impressed with the shadows, they aren&#x27;t super pigmented.</li>
            <li> Color ranges from very light cream to black, looks great with my brown eyes.</li>
            <li> The pallet has a great variety of shades from very light to almost black in darkness.</li>
            <li> The colors are highly pigmented which is nice</li>
            <li> Its worth it!</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are beautiful as expected.</li>
            <li> my opinion this product is just as good as some Bare Minerals shadow-</li>
            <li> The colors are rich, blendable, and stay put through the day</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t as rich as I would like.</li>
            <li> The application sponge is a wee bit small, but otherwise, the colors are perfect!</li>
            <li> In general the colors are good, but the quality leaves something to be desired.  </li>
            <li> The selection of colors is pretty much perfect for any kind of look I could want, and it&#x27;s all here in one palette rather than several smaller sets.</li>
            <li> Some of the shades are not very pigmented or finely milled, so you will need a good eyeshadow primer if you want one application to stay all day (I recommend a moisturizing concealer or ELF cheapie primer), but some of the shades (like the matte cool-taupe) are amazing, buttery smooth and very flattering.</li>
            <li> Had to clean it up a bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The use of applicator also helps to keep the colors clean and  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s nice having so many shades to choose from to create different looks.</li>
            <li> I can clean it up</li>
            <li> Great and fresh product with lasting pigments.</li>
            <li> I would be more thrilled with it if I was still using shimmer shades, but even testing them on the back of my hand</li>
            <li> nice shades, not smudgy and will last most of the day</li>
            <li> love the colors great for everyday use</li>
            <li> This is an incredible value and SO perfect for a travel makeup kit -- it has all the shades for a pretty natural day look to a smokey dramatic neutral evening eye.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love the colors and they look really good.</li>
            <li> Let me just let you know that if you want a decent natural toned pallete for a great price than the Nudes is for you.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to blend and with my oil skin it last most of the day without a primer.</li>
            <li> I love this pallet so so much.</li>
            <li> Love it &amp; fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found a lot of good tutorials for different looks.</li>
            <li> I heard good reviews about this product so decided to buy online, but received a palette that had numerous scratch on the cover and some shades were chipped off.</li>
            <li> full summer</li>
            <li> I loved maybelline eyeshadows since I was a teen.</li>
            <li> good solid neutrals that go one well, blend well will buy again</li>
            <li> Good enough!</li>
            <li> and i never thought i would love it this much.  </li>
            <li> seems to ring true to this product.</li>
            <li> This is more for non professionals, the colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented, and sometimes stuff won&#x27;t come on the brush,  </li>
            <li> But it could be good for a starting out teenager or beginner in eye makeup.</li>
            <li> You really have to dab/srub with brush to get any color out the pigmentation is ok.</li>
            <li> so thats cool.</li>
            <li> Love rhis grwat colors fast ahipping</li>
            <li> If you want something that rivals the Naked palettes but don&#x27;t want to drop $50-$60, this is a good option.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try since I&#x27;ve just started to learn how to do a proper makeup and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a good palette.</li>
            <li> I apply Milani eyeshadow primer before I put these colors on, and they are very pigmented and lovely.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Great price for the quality, I&#x27;ve used dept. store brands that weren&#x27;t this nice, didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> the colors aren&#x27;t very saturated but if you&#x27;re going for an incredibly natural look I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Packaging is plastic but adequate.</li>
            <li> I have the Naked Palette, costing much more, and I find myself using this palette more often than that one.</li>
            <li> Arrived Quick and just as described...</li>
            <li> Wears off quick though</li>
            <li> If you can afford an Urban Decay palette this the next best thing for the price.</li>
            <li> Good for everyday look :)</li>
            <li> I like that some have a very light glimmer to them for fun but without looking unprofessional while the others are mainly matte.</li>
            <li> Very pretty neutral, earthy tones.</li>
            <li> It has a great nude shade, a shimmery but subtle cream for highlighting, and I particularly love the taupey grays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shades are nice, but I personally feel like it doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth and nice as the Naked eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> In good weather conditions it last all day, need to reapply if it´s too hot.</li>
            <li> I own many &#x27;high end&#x27; eyeshadow palettes and not only is Maybelline</li>
            <li> Perfect for a rather clumsy beginner!</li>
            <li> you are purchasing this for the added use of the suggestions, make sure you check it against the sequences listed on the Amazon page (or their direct site) before using!</li>
            <li> It gives me a more natural look while wearing makeup !</li>
            <li> You can easily pull off a light natural look or a heavier darker smokey look with the mix of colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great neutral palatte for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> This pallet is an amazing dupe for the naked pallet.</li>
            <li> The price is a few dollars cheaper than any of my locals stores, which is a great bonus.</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented, so when you try to use a light color, it doesn&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li> Meh, its okay the shades are standard wish all the bronze color where a lot more pigmented and brighter Ok palette if your just starting off</li>
            <li> I love all of the natural shades</li>
            <li> This palette is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Fun to play with, too.</li>
            <li> for the price i didn&#x27;t expect much, its a good palette you might have to swipe a few times on ur eyelid for more color power.</li>
            <li> Like I said for the price its expected :) but if you&#x27;re looking for something with more pigment and price, I&#x27;d go for a nyx nude palette.</li>
            <li> I wanted a cost effective substitute for a Naked palette</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with that my make up skills are on par with a 14 year old girl</li>
            <li> But overall, they give a nice look</li>
            <li> I have alot of fun with this product.</li>
            <li> So not all of the colors are useful for me.</li>
            <li> definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> It was well worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Worth giving it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of the shadows are shimmer formulations, which, being a mature woman, I can&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li> I only like this kind of colors</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised when this palette arrived :)</li>
            <li> The overall color tone tends toward cool (blue) rather than warm, which doesn&#x27;t work well for my skin tone (very light ruddy complexion).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s darker colors are great to use for a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> colors definitely blend more easily than others (the darker shades take some work), but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the blendability.</li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s a good mixture of shimmer and matte colors unlike the Naked palettes that have maybe one matte, a couple glitter shadows, and the rest are high shimmer.</li>
            <li> Difinetly have to have the right brush to make it show up.</li>
            <li> When I started using it however, the colors just didn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are very soft and crumble easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never done my own eye shadow but these colors make it easy to teach yourself and all go really well with each other.</li>
            <li> I honestly use this pallet every single day and rarely stray from it.</li>
            <li> maybe i&#x27;m just lazy about using primer lol</li>
            <li> I love the nude palette, it has plenty of options and colors on the spectrum to create whatever look you want (smokey, or barely there for example).</li>
            <li> Good color payoff in both the dark and highlight colors.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the price instead of Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked series, and it&#x27;s great for the price.  </li>
            <li> Love it do much,  can play around with shades early.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for simple, everyday looks.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great palette if you&#x27;re looking for a very natural look that&#x27;s not too dark.</li>
            <li> So I wanted to try out their first pallet I believe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased especially with the price.</li>
            <li> The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel that some of the matte colors could use just a but more pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I love this basic palette!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see spending over $50 on Urban Decay or Tarte or some of the more prestigious lines for what are basically earth toned eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Can get many different looks from this one palette.</li>
            <li> Of course, this is a lot cheaper than the higher end palettes, so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> the color in the picture is as pretty and exact as in the picture.</li>
            <li> I find myself using this pallet more than the Naked!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a budget-friendly version of the Naked Palettes, I suggest Makeup Revolution&#x27;s Iconic palettes, now at Ulta.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> I own several naked palettes and purchased this via recommendation from a friend since it can fit snuggly in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I found this palette to be exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> Not urban decay but way more affordable too.</li>
            <li> First of all, the case was scratched a lot.</li>
            <li> I thought the numbering sequence and suggestions on the back were fantastic!</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not likely! :)</li>
            <li> Love the shades especially for my brown eyes</li>
            <li> It is more towards the low end scale for makeup</li>
            <li> Helps to use a primer before hand, if you can use a white one even better.</li>
            <li> I was interested in the color palette, but once I began using it, it doesn&#x27;t apply as well as I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love the colors, but they just aren&#x27;t pigmented enough.  </li>
            <li> I also love the suggestions of use in the back of the product.</li>
            <li> Also, its very pigmented so it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get the look you want!</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a matte shadow that is the exact color of my skin and this Maybelline palette doesn&#x27;t contain one.  </li>
            <li> It simply isn&#x27;t consistent.  </li>
            <li> I really am digging the colors!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I is fairly highly pigmented with a very pretty color.  </li>
            <li> Great neutrals with matte and shimmer and very small</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I saw them at my local drugstore, and I picked all three of them up.</li>
            <li> There are some instructions and style suggestions on the back of this palette regarding different eye looks you can create, it gives a good number of suggestions for duos, trios and quads.</li>
            <li> My favorite colors in one palette - the shadows are dark and blend well with a mixture of the other shadows in this palette - def a good quality beauty shadow palette.</li>
            <li> The color are so pretty and goes on really well.</li>
            <li> Great product, comparable to more expensive options in quality and color!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really compare this to higher end products.</li>
            <li> I do use a good quality makeup brush, not the small sponge brushes that come with it.</li>
            <li> Saw this palette at Target (for at least 30% more) and decided it would be a good starting point.</li>
            <li> enough to provide something better, at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> Not as strongly pigmented as the Naked palettes.</li>
            <li> It comes with 12 shades and love every single one.</li>
            <li> I liked this pallet at first (And actually gave it 4 stars) but had to change it to 2 because i decided after a month or two that i actually only like 2 colors out of 12!</li>
            <li> They are exact color matches for the Naked palettes and are nicely pigmented and buttery for only $9.99.</li>
            <li> But they are worth the price especially if you just want a quick color.</li>
            <li> Really like it easy to apply last all day</li>
            <li> but I wish it had a very light pink for highlighting.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very nice in a subtle and classic way.</li>
            <li> It provides the selection of colors from light shading, or very muted look to deep smoky make up for the night.</li>
            <li> I really like these eye shadows, they go on smooth and last for hours.</li>
            <li> im very upset</li>
            <li> Stays on really well without creasing.</li>
            <li> And I will use them when I don&#x27;t want to use too much makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette.</li>
            <li> To much fall out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gorgeous colors and reasonably pigmented.  </li>
            <li> Two of the included quad sets that make up this palette are what I use every day anyway, so it was very convenient to find it here in a 12 color set.</li>
            <li> I noticed they now have a smokes color collection palette that I may have to try after liking this one so much.</li>
            <li> Very versatile.</li>
            <li> They stay on very well too.</li>
            <li> Really like the product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really got upset for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the brush that it comes with, and the colors are neutral so u can wear with any thing.</li>
            <li> The colors looked very powdery when on</li>
            <li> I really enjoy playing with the different colors included.</li>
            <li> Anyway Maybelline didn&#x27;t disappoint me too much.</li>
            <li> I really like them,</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this one as much</li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;ve learned is that quality products really make a world of difference.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and product was well protected.</li>
            <li> A MUST have, I absolutely adore this set.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really know how to apply eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The fact is that the shadows don&#x27;t have much pigmentation at all and the colors are nicer in the pictures than they really are.</li>
            <li> But the shadow doesn&#x27;t apply evenly, and is such a light pigmentation that you have to use a lot, even with the darker shades.  </li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> The Maybelline website doesn&#x27;t even sell it for that much</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I do like the pigmentation of the browns, however, I am really bummed about the gold.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product as it has a variety of the &#x27;nude&#x27; colors.</li>
            <li> I tried this palette and the colors are very pigmented and glide on.</li>
            <li> The Nudes much cheaper</li>
            <li> I bought It for My girlfriend, she loved it, and was actually surprised that in the package actually come two palettes of the same.</li>
            <li> Great natural colors for everyday, does not irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I use Eco Tools brushes, but the narrow sponge that comes with this set is handy for applying shadow along the edges of the lid.</li>
            <li> The pigment isn&#x27;t rich enough</li>
            <li> With all the different colors this pallete is at such a great price and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I generally stick to drugstore brands, but I&#x27;m slowly learning more and more about makeup.</li>
            <li> Great and lasts long for how little it looks.</li>
            <li> Nice palette, although it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> love the colors and the ideas on how u can use the colors as a single shade, duo, triple or quad!!!</li>
            <li> The free shipping took about a week to get to me, since it was from Amazon and not another country (plus I live in the middle of no where).</li>
            <li> I try to only wear them for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Like all the colors,the squares do come loose easy</li>
            <li> I thought there would be some nice matte browns or taupes to use as transition shades, but no, every single shadow has an obnoxious overspray of glitter that actually will pick up when you dip your brush or your finger in them.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> colors are pretty pigmented &amp; have nice color payoff too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very small &amp; sleek</li>
            <li> When I purchased it said NEW!</li>
            <li> I know l will use them all until l the fit is dry.</li>
            <li> The black could have been more darker and pigmented.</li>
            <li> The Nudes, of course, has more neutral colors--browns, coppers, a black.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked2 and Naked3 and, in comparison, they are more pigmented and last longer than the Maybelline palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors are really bold and last for over 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Not as opaque as I&#x27;d like them to be, but decent for the price</li>
            <li> but this particular one is quite decent.  </li>
            <li> My personal biology leads eyeshadow to wear away quickly.</li>
            <li> I like this better than a MUCH more expensive &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They last all day and you can create so many different looks.</li>
            <li> Hmm... I could pay a high price at Walmart for this, orrrr</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had high end eye-shadow except</li>
            <li> Was gonna splurge on a high end over rated neutral shades palette but decided to give this a try instead.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Colors were what I expected, applied fine and was delivered intact and on time.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are not very pigmented but other than that it is a good palette</li>
            <li> All the shades are usable on me except one, the highlight from the second quad (third from the top row left to right).</li>
            <li> I tried compacting as much of the loose shadow back into its spot but lost most of it.</li>
            <li> Some colors kind like hard to see.</li>
            <li> I paid the New price so it should have been New!</li>
            <li> The color does not go on my eyelid very easily and has to be very heavily applied for it to be noticeable.</li>
            <li> It is a really great alternative to expensive makeup.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of MAC eye shadow and that is great, but expensive.</li>
            <li> Have fun exploring different looks with.</li>
            <li> Sad because the colors do go on gorgeous at first.</li>
            <li> Why would I completely cover the eye with dark brown and then put a smudge of light nude in the corner?!</li>
            <li> Love this palette for everyday looks</li>
            <li> Technically there should be 3 ( one per quad) but only the top left is light enough for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s shimmer colors and normal shades.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette hoping that it contained more than a few matte shades.  </li>
            <li> They have good colour pay-off and come in a sleek and thin package.</li>
            <li> The size of the palette is perfect (I&#x27;m getting so sick of those bulky palettes taking up space) and the design is sleek.</li>
            <li> my new cover been dying for this palette</li>
            <li> I really love this product for multiple reasons.&lt;br /&gt;The palette offer a wide selection of colors-</li>
            <li> The actual product is exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li> that I bought a second immediately after buying the first in case they discontinued it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is unfortunately no dupe for the Naked or Lorac Pro palettes.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to have received TWO palettes!</li>
            <li> I usually only wear neutral colors so I was excited that this pallet gave me a lot of variety that I would actually use.</li>
            <li> very nice shades does not crumble my only complaint would be only one wand</li>
            <li> I was smart and chose the latter.  </li>
            <li> I bought this from Ulta a little unsure on how I would like the quality, given the cheap price.</li>
            <li> Thought this was a great price for a pretty close dupe to other expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the shadows are a little sheer, but build-able.</li>
            <li> The little chart on the back that shows what colors to use together (depending on how many of them you&#x27;d like to use) is helpful.  </li>
            <li> Perfectly pigmented too the only bad side is the price.</li>
            <li> The colors are clear even without primer.</li>
            <li> The application instructions on the back are clear and make it fun to experiment with different applications.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s eye shadow..looks natural</li>
            <li> The old saying you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> You can create both natural look and smoky one with it</li>
            <li> With this set you can do a smoky or natural look</li>
            <li> completely off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d much prefer  the Naked palette.</li>
            <li> I find myself reaching for an additional highlight eyeshadow to complete a look.</li>
            <li> and it offers something I didn&#x27;t have in my collection.</li>
            <li> but when I got it there was one that was almost completely crumbled and another that had popped out of the tray.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday with the many different shades.  </li>
            <li> If you use a primer or a base before you apply the shadows, you&#x27;ll get the best results from the product.</li>
            <li> talking about color they are exactly as the picture, they last very long, and I really want to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have experienced that with quite a few eyeshadows I&#x27;ve used in the past, but I did not find this to be the case with this one!</li>
            <li> The scale goes white, pink, browns, and a black which is nice for options.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trying to go for a high glamour look, just regular coverage.  </li>
            <li> It is very pigmented and stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> Plus it is so compact, but not too small, and it is in a secure casing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really wear the colors because they don&#x27;t stay on long or go on well.</li>
            <li> Even using Urban Decay&#x27;s primer it is very much faded at the end of my long (10-11 hrs)</li>
            <li> The only shade I have used successfully is the upper left one (white) for highlights, since those are supposed to be subtle anyway.</li>
            <li> but it was discontinued and I&#x27;m on my last pack so off to try new ones.</li>
            <li> I am a dark skin toned American so this could have look just fine on a lighter individual.</li>
            <li> I only use a couple of the colors in this palette regularly and if I had known that this would be the case, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased the whole palette.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (I can only wear hypoallergenic jewelry, etc.)</li>
            <li> so many possibilities from dramatic to natural look</li>
            <li> A few colors are a little lighter than I&#x27;d like, but for the most part they all apply really well as long as you blend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pale and freckled like a lot of red heads.</li>
            <li> The light &amp; white colors do not show, have very little pigment.</li>
            <li> I use a tiny bit of vegetable glycerin and natural concealer to prime my lids and the colors</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the size of this palette, I thought it was going to be a lot smaller.</li>
            <li> The colors are really dark so The Nudes in the title is pretty misleading.</li>
            <li> It comes with an array of nude colors for all different skin colors if going for the natural look.</li>
            <li> , this is just what I expected, I don&#x27;t use to much make up</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to the gold shadow but it barely shows up, even when using a wet brush.</li>
            <li> I looked past the fact that it came with out a brush and tried a few of the colors on with one of my own brushes.</li>
            <li> Normally, paying for a better product&lt;br /&gt;might be worth it, but prices on make up are outrageous in the first place -  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, the darker ones are very pigmented with any form of application.</li>
            <li> The ones I&#x27;ve used so far (4) are a little firm so it doesn&#x27;t apply easily.</li>
            <li> I had been planning to splurge on an Urban Decay Naked palette, but I needed new eyeshadow before I could get to a store that sells Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be an Urban Decay Naked dupe, but these shadows are powdery and dry with only one or two that feel buttery and have a decent amount of pigment.</li>
            <li> But the white eyeshadows are so not pigmented, Plus the third shade is barely pigmented with a brush, and the pad one that they give you.</li>
            <li> The colors are true and go on subtle enough that they can be built up or left sheer.</li>
            <li> I said, I am not a professional, and I generally do use drugstore products, so</li>
            <li> (pale skin, green eyes, light red hair)</li>
            <li> The pigment is very poor for most of the eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for more subtle everyday wear</li>
            <li> I just want throw it in the trash and try tarte or something high quality because this was a waste of bucks.</li>
            <li> Soft and dark tones.</li>
            <li> It has all the colors I use regularly, and stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed by this, because the palette *looks* like a good collection.  </li>
            <li> It does take a few tries to swipe the color on the lid to really bring out the color</li>
            <li> I need a little sparkle for night and am not changing my color palette completely</li>
            <li> colors are waxy, don&#x27;t blend very well, and dull looking.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it takes a little extra blending, but not a big deal .</li>
            <li> I used a ELF eyeshadow primer and it made it stay on ALL day long.</li>
            <li> The color is not nearly as concentrated as UD&#x27;s and the shadows are always falling out of the palette</li>
            <li> Some of the colors show up on my skin slightly different than expected.</li>
            <li> Of course, Maybelline has long been a quality poduct.</li>
            <li> some are chalky, which is strange.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not stay on long at all.</li>
            <li> Of course it is no Naked palette, some of the colors are less opaque than they would seem, but it is a $7-$10 pallete and the Naked pallete is about $50</li>
            <li> However, compared to other drugstore products I have tried, this is above and beyond.</li>
            <li> it is not powdery or dry feeling.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really wear eyeshadow until recently, so I&#x27;m a bit of a newbie at the game.</li>
            <li> Was only shipped in an empty box with absolutely no packing.</li>
            <li> My only complaint and the only reason it doesn&#x27;t get five stars is that it doesn&#x27;t last all day.  </li>
            <li> We have all tried &amp;#34;drug-store brands&amp;#34; that are so frustrating (you have to reload the brush a number of times to get color on your eyelids and it wears off fast) to use that you wish you had spent the extra money at the department store.  </li>
            <li> Too loose of a powder</li>
            <li> I do find the case a little bit difficult to open, especially if you&#x27;re trying not to ruin a fresh manicure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought they would be, so I only use about half of the palette.</li>
            <li> Some people say that there are mattes in the palettes, and yes, there are definitely shadows that look less glittery than the others.</li>
            <li> The only shade I can see myself using is the matte black.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is that there are less mate colors than I thought and my mom loves matte colors.</li>
            <li> These eye shadows travelled a lot before I could put my hands on them, ship, planes, bus and finally my brother&#x27;s car, and THEY WERE INTACT, not even a little loose powder NOTHING,</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little pats of color are much smaller than I expected......and somehow during shipping bits of some of the colors chipped off and were loose in the box.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe just one little downside: there&#x60;s only one applicator comes with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that this palette is actually longer lasting than other shadows I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little darker, but still have the same pink undertones.</li>
            <li> It is my GO TO Palette for my every day natural look and you should try it out too don&#x27;t get caught up in the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Not much pigment in the shadows at all</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> just as expected.</li>
            <li> Not very pigmented though.</li>
            <li> The colors are just as I expected, and they stay on my lids for about five hours.</li>
            <li> It also mixes well with the pink nudes palette.</li>
            <li> I generally wet the brush</li>
            <li> Every shadow was chalky, not very pigmented, and there are absolutely NO mattes in any of these palettes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money--this is not a dupe for the Naked palettes...</li>
            <li> Also, none of the eyeshadows were broken upon arrival; they packed the palette really well.</li>
            <li> Just if anyone was curious.</li>
            <li> it still has grey and black.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is how hard it is to get the color dark enough.</li>
            <li> I pair this up with simple black mascara, black or brown liquid eyeliner and Maybelline Nude Lip</li>
            <li> There is a wide range of tones and the container is not too big nor small.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t show up hardly and doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li> It works with all of my other eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Other than that.</li>
            <li> so I gave the other one to my daughter and she loves it as well.  </li>
            <li> other thing, to keep in mind; this is a powder.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want to use any of my other shadows now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been into browns until now!</li>
            <li> I do actually like that this palette is small (compact)</li>
            <li> All very carefully collected into this box, and elegant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was terribly packed, 2 of the best colors are broken</li>
            <li> Slightly chalky, but that is to be expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s average.</li>
            <li> Two of the colours did detach, something other reviewers also complained about, but I just popped them back in with some e6000 and voila!</li>
            <li> make up.&lt;br /&gt;Better to use real brushed than the small little pad that includes ..</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not worth the hype.</li>
            <li> It has all the neutral and nude hues the average girl like me needs, some matte and some not.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you need a lot of powder for the matte, unlike the shimmery ones.</li>
            <li> I am surprised the eye shadows inside weren&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> With a good base these stay all day!</li>
            <li> There was makeup all in the box with all the other stuff I bought!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shimmery beside the dark brown and black.</li>
            <li> I got it for half the price.</li>
            <li> I got this palette as I am slightly handicapped in the world of makeup.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare it in that aspect, but the pigmentation on these is less than the Coloricon by WetnWild.</li>
            <li> I found that eyelid primer is a must--without it, the eyeshadow has much less staying power, and will crease.</li>
            <li> the case is black with a window style lid so you can see the colors of the palette.</li>
            <li> Not a choice I would make again, but not worth going to the trouble of returning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little heavy-handed to see them well.</li>
            <li> it is a little on the sparkley side...</li>
            <li> , I just wish it had a little mirror</li>
            <li> I was trying to find something a little cheaper that I could wear as well to save from having to continuously buy the pricier stuff.</li>
            <li> Item arrived with the seal broken and several shades of shadows were damaged so severely that when I opened the package it just fell into a crumbly mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go to case everyday.</li>
            <li> Even though I received a sealed product, this one is surely a waste.</li>
            <li> use everyday...</li>
            <li> This product arrived with several of the eye shadows broken and crumbled.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a bit messy.</li>
            <li> But they can still be used for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it goes on well.</li>
            <li> Luckily a few are still intact.</li>
            <li> When I opened the product, I found the brush was missing as well.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday.</li>
            <li> use it everyday</li>
            <li> I use these shadows everyday.</li>
            <li> it was broken, open and one of the colors are completely missing.</li>
            <li> this is not even a dupe for the Wet n Wild Walkin&#x27; on Eggshells trio, it&#x27;s that bad.</li>
            <li> I use a little primer on my lids, or a dusting of powder, then apply with a brush and VOILA!</li>
            <li> A little bit of everything!</li>
            <li> It applies very lightly, so I usually have to go over it a couple</li>
            <li> name brand palette that I purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> The small indicating it had not been opened was already ripped, so I was suspicious that somebody had used it already.</li>
            <li> When I received my package one of the shadows was cracked, broken, and all over the other colors.</li>
            <li> A little awkward to open</li>
            <li> Do not follow the instructions on the back because they&#x27;re just weird and confusing.</li>
            <li> These colors come out lighter than expected and barely stay on, blending is very difficult, and it often comes off powdery and broken.</li>
            <li> There no pigmentation no matter what you do and its hard to apply.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell the colors apart.</li>
            <li> It was a little smudged with make up from its travels but nothing broken</li>
            <li> Some reviews people complained about the colors fading.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any creasing or flaking and I wear my make up for at least 8-9 hours a day.</li>
            <li> I saw negative reviews on this product and i was hesitant in purchasing it, I must say it lives up to my expectation on a neat compact palette with sades</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s something.</li>
            <li> The part that I am not thrilled with is the length of time it stays on and how it goes on.</li>
            <li> I mean the outer cover is scratched and there was no packaging to preserve it.</li>
            <li> The sparkly colors aren&#x27;t overly sparkly either -they can be worn for work and not look ridiculous or inappropriate.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t last for me. :(</li>
            <li> The product came with a broken seal, and the product had scratches and marks all over the cover.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and received the product with a broken seal and dust all over the palette.</li>
            <li> Not  happy about it.</li>
            <li> Just one collor came broken.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken and 3 of the colors looked like they were used.</li>
            <li> Received this item and it came broken packagin was very poor</li>
            <li> It makes applying the shadows difficult because it&#x27;s hard to blend, and the fallout is atrocious.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Mabelline.</li>
            <li> but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I give it the 4 star, not five, merely because it does not blend too well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with neutrals.</li>
            <li> and the wand is poor quilty!</li>
            <li> They have been used And the brush is missing! :(</li>
            <li> Personally, I really hate how hard it is to find matte makeup.  </li>
            <li> My friend buy from my account this item and it was broken and ugly</li>
            <li> Arrived dirty and falling apart.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it came and was already opened and banged around :(</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with a palatte of &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; shades!  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t expensive or I would be doubly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I mean HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> No pigmentation, chalky and impossible to build.</li>
            <li> When I got the package it was in really bad conditions</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are not all bad</li>
            <li> My Maybelline Nudes Eye shadow arrived today, but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use base for eyeshadows</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m appalled at the markup here.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this palette was because I could not for the life of me find a &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; palette that didn&#x27;t have shiny glittery crap in it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed in purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Horrible experience with this one.</li>
            <li> but the fallout is HORRIBLE!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all terrible.</li>
            <li> This had horrible pigmentation  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Great colors and lasts. The price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> easy to blend. good matte colors included. a definite must have.</li>
            <li> When I got the package it was in really bad conditions but, the make up works really good I loved it (:</li>
            <li> This is absolutely perfect and great for beginners. Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it twice and I love it!!! love the colors and the ideas on how u can use the colors as a single shade, duo, triple or quad!!! highly-pigmented and blendable!!! I&#x27;ve no complaints!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for prom (My dress had gold accents) and its perfect! I love this pallet so so much. Its worth it!</li>
            <li> I liked this pallet at first (And actually gave it 4 stars) but had to change it to 2 because i decided after a month or two that i actually only like 2 colors out of 12! the black is great (good pigment matte black) and one of the medium browns are great. everything else is kind of chalky and the pigment is really lacking. there are better drugstore nude palettes out there.</li>
            <li> it was broken, open and one of the colors are completely missing. im very upset</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s a great neutral palatte for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Great colors,  love this pallette.</li>
            <li> The actual product is exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li> It was a little smudged with make up from its travels but nothing broken and it was very cheap considering the cost in retail stores. It&#x27;s a gift so I can&#x27;t comment on quality but love maybelline so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fab!</li>
            <li> product was not sealed when I received it but pigment is ok</li>
            <li> Love these colors. Couldn&#x27;t find this in any stores. Colors nice and rich. It&#x27;s my go to case everyday. Great for any skin tone. I&#x27;m Japanese with tan complexion and I love it. Can go from day to night with same colors. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Mabelline. I&#x27;d buy extra eye sponges, I have 6 in mine plus the one applied it came with.</li>
            <li> For the price I guess you can&#x27;t beat it. But it&#x27;s not worth the hype. It&#x27;s just OKAY. The colors are not pigmented.</li>
            <li> Love the shades and color combination options.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product and found it satisfactory......</li>
            <li> very nice colors....love it!</li>
            <li> Love it &amp; fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Its a great purchase very easy to go from day to night I use it overtime I go out and mix and match different shades to get a custom look for myself. Its very easy to blend and with my oil skin it last most of the day without a primer.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors in the set. I know l will use them all until l the fit is dry.</li>
            <li> Not much pigment in the shadows at all</li>
            <li> Nicely pigmented, nice shades. Has a variety of matte colors &amp; shimmery colors. Very nice.</li>
            <li> The colors are great but it was terribly packed, 2 of the best colors are broken 💔💔</li>
            <li> Love this pallet!!! The gold is my favorite. Stays on really well without creasing. Very good buy!</li>
            <li> out side case was scratched up, but it works</li>
            <li> the colors aren&#x27;t as shown on photo</li>
            <li> Great shades and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Great Quality eyeshadow , stays on all day doesn&#x27;t smudge!</li>
            <li> I came across this palette when looking for nude eyeshadows without parabens. After reading a lot of good things about it I decided to buy it and I&#x27;ve found a lot of good tutorials for different looks. I use a tiny bit of vegetable glycerin and natural concealer to prime my lids and the colors show up nicely and last for a good while. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I heard good reviews about this product so decided to buy online, but received a palette that had numerous scratch on the cover and some shades were chipped off. Even though I received a sealed product, this one is surely a waste. Horrible experience with this one.</li>
            <li> So its nice but I think its too shimmery  and not pigmented enough . . . . maybe i&#x27;m just lazy about using primer lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it though.</li>
            <li> Nice colors! full summer</li>
            <li> This Palette is AMAZING, everyone&#x27;s been complementing me on my eyes and they say it looks so great, I&#x27;m going to be using this palette all the time! Also, it came in the mail very quick, I won&#x27;t be running out anytime soon but when I do, I will be looking forward to another one!</li>
            <li> Very nice eye shadow pallet.  The application instructions on the back are clear and make it fun to experiment with different applications.  Each time I&#x27;ve used them I have gotten compliments.  So far, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  Creased very quickly.</li>
            <li> The pigment is very poor for most of the eye shadows. I was expecting so much more from Maybelline because they make really good makeup. The eye shadows are not all bad but I feel that they doesn&#x27;t last. I use one of the browns to fill my eyebrows the color is perfect for me. And I will use them when I don&#x27;t want to use too much makeup.</li>
            <li> I like some of the colors but I wish it had a very light pink for highlighting.</li>
            <li> Stays on GREAT! I love experimenting with all of the colors and mixing shades.</li>
            <li> Colors were what I expected, applied fine and was delivered intact and on time.</li>
            <li> Very smooth. No eyelid tugging.</li>
            <li> It works well and shows up</li>
            <li> For Nudes it works, but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold well. Even with primer.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette.</li>
            <li> i loved the colors, it&#x27;s a great pallete. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought It for My girlfriend, she loved it, and was actually surprised that in the package actually come two palettes of the same. Deliver was on time too.</li>
            <li> Great, cheap nude pallet. I&#x27;m happy with it and I didn&#x27;t have to go spend 60 bucks to get these gorgeous colors. When this pallet runs out I will be buying it again for sure. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I couldn&#x27;t justify spending 54 dollars on the Naked 2 palette so I thought this should be close enough but boy was I wrong. I wound up buying both the naked 2 palette and this one and the difference is incredible. These colors come out lighter than expected and barely stay on, blending is very difficult, and it often comes off powdery and broken. My naked palette is a dream compared to this one and I regret ever purchasing this Maybelline palette.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible value and SO perfect for a travel makeup kit -- it has all the shades for a pretty natural day look to a smokey dramatic neutral evening eye. Some of the shades are not very pigmented or finely milled, so you will need a good eyeshadow primer if you want one application to stay all day (I recommend a moisturizing concealer or ELF cheapie primer), but some of the shades (like the matte cool-taupe) are amazing, buttery smooth and very flattering. The size of the palette is perfect (I&#x27;m getting so sick of those bulky palettes taking up space) and the design is sleek.</li>
            <li> Meh, its okay the shades are standard wish all the bronze color where a lot more pigmented and brighter Ok palette if your just starting off</li>
            <li> Great product, compares to luxury make at $45 plus.</li>
            <li> Packaging was not the best.  When I received my package one of the shadows was cracked, broken, and all over the other colors. Had to clean it up a bit. I tried compacting as much of the loose shadow back into its spot but lost most of it.</li>
            <li> Returned. To much fall out.</li>
            <li> Beautiful natural color palette. I use it almost daily. The wear on it is great!</li>
            <li> These eye shadows travelled a lot before I could put my hands on them, ship, planes, bus and finally my brother&#x27;s car, and THEY WERE INTACT, not even a little loose powder NOTHING, talking about color they are exactly as the picture, they last very long, and I really want to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use this like everyday, the colors are great and the pigmentation is perfect. The colors blend so perfectly with every eye shadow. it stays on all day. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> The product came with a broken seal, and the product had scratches and marks all over the cover.</li>
            <li> Very good product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous colors and reasonably pigmented.  I get better application using my own brushes than the wand that comes with the palette.  My only complaint and the only reason it doesn&#x27;t get five stars is that it doesn&#x27;t last all day.  Even using Urban Decay&#x27;s primer it is very much faded at the end of my long (10-11 hrs) work day.  I like it enough that I bought a second immediately after buying the first in case they discontinued it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked2 and Naked3 and, in comparison, they are more pigmented and last longer than the Maybelline palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite look uses the four on the right - they make an absolutely perfect look to wear with cool blues, greys, and blacks.</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are beautiful as expected. Love my #Nudes :)</li>
            <li> Pigment is not that great but it&#x27;s workable.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product tho.</li>
            <li> My favorite colors in one palette - the shadows are dark and blend well with a mixture of the other shadows in this palette - def a good quality beauty shadow palette.</li>
            <li> Very good pallet for the price. I loved maybelline eyeshadows since I was a teen. So I wanted to try out their first pallet I believe. I love it, giving it 4 starts cuz 3 of the colors are not that pigmented. The black could have been more darker and pigmented. But love all the colors in it and it&#x27;s worth buying. Have fun exploring different looks with. Best for doing smoky eyes. Good for beginners, all the smoky colors are here that u need.</li>
            <li> Too loose of a powder</li>
            <li> I love the colors and how pigmented they are.</li>
            <li> This palette is awesome! It has all the neutral and nude hues the average girl like me needs, some matte and some not. They have good colour pay-off and come in a sleek and thin package.</li>
            <li> I love it! I feel like I&#x27;m the last person on youtube to purchase this pallet. I love the fact that the shadows are a little sheer, but build-able.</li>
            <li> Love the color combos. I have olive skin, and when I try to go for a nude color, often they are too light, but this compact has a great variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Love these colors...use everyday...Will order again!</li>
            <li> Love the variation of shades. Expect nothing but the best from Maybelline</li>
            <li> The colors are great. I&#x27;m a urban decay girl but I thought I would give these a try. I&#x27;m pleased especially with the price. Some reviews people complained about the colors fading. You just have to use a primer. Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> good solid neutrals that go one well, blend well will buy again</li>
            <li> Love this palette! It&#x27;s light, flesh colored tones are perfect to use for your everyday basic/natural look and it&#x27;s darker colors are great to use for a more dramatic look. Easy to apply and stays on well. I&#x27;m so happy I bought this add on.</li>
            <li> I love all of the natural shades this collection has.  It works with all of my other eye shadows. I applies well and blends easily.</li>
            <li> I use base for eyeshadows so I do not have to reapply. It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I love this pallete. Let me just let you know that if you want a decent natural toned pallete for a great price than the Nudes is for you. Of course it is no Naked palette, some of the colors are less opaque than they would seem, but it is a $7-$10 pallete and the Naked pallete is about $50 so yeah. This palette is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m heels over head these palettes! I just can&#x27;t get enough of them and I love how I can both use it for night and day makeup!</li>
            <li> I love this palet so much!!</li>
            <li> In good weather conditions it last all day, need to reapply if it´s too hot. Love the colors</li>
            <li> I have hazel eyes and this set rocks! Great quality and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The colors are great perfect for many different looks, and it&#x27;s a good size</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone as a gift and loved it so much that I bought myself one.</li>
            <li> Two of the included quad sets that make up this palette are what I use every day anyway, so it was very convenient to find it here in a 12 color set. These are excellent neutrals that really do look great on anyone with anything, and my go-to for daily wear. .If I need a little sparkle for night and am not changing my color palette completely, I just use the colors in this set that have sparkle added in rather than the mattes I prefer for daily wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I get about 8-10 good hours of wear before I need a refresh. Comfortable and easy to use. I noticed they now have a smokes color collection palette that I may have to try after liking this one so much. I got this on a lightning deal for about 2 for $12 I think. Even at regular price, this is still a good deal for so many versatile colors.</li>
            <li> I have been using another nude palette for years now but it was discontinued and I&#x27;m on my last pack so off to try new ones. This one had great reviews and price so I gave it a go. There is a wide range of tones and the container is not too big nor small. I like that some have a very light glimmer to them for fun but without looking unprofessional while the others are mainly matte. The scale goes white, pink, browns, and a black which is nice for options. You don&#x27;t need a ton for a good color and a shadow primer makes them really pop! Overall I recommend this nude palette and even use one matte color for my brows too!</li>
            <li> This is a great nude color palette put together by Maybelline. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel that some of the matte colors could use just a but more pigmentation. I feel like I have to apply some of these colors a little heavy-handed to see them well. Besides that, it&#x27;s a great color palette for the money and I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Not a choice I would make again, but not worth going to the trouble of returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little pats of color are much smaller than I expected......and somehow during shipping bits of some of the colors chipped off and were loose in the box.  This seems much more like a sampler.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> Good price, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love this basic palette! Paired with a basic primer, the shadows last all day.</li>
            <li> Works great. The colors are really bold and last for over 24 hours. I give it the 4 star, not five, merely because it does not blend too well. Other than that. It is a really great alternative to expensive makeup. I use this pallet every time I put my makeup on.</li>
            <li> I had bought one at walmart before love It!!</li>
            <li> Great colors.  Easy to apply and one time application lasts all day.  Somehow I accidentally ordered two instead of one so I gave the other one to my daughter and she loves it as well.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a use for every color and have been satisfied with the opaqueness. Not quite as opaque as Mac, but the colors are on point</li>
            <li> this is comparable to the naked pallet</li>
            <li> Great colors. The matte and shimmer are both great. My only complaint is that you need a lot of powder for the matte, unlike the shimmery ones. Overall, very pleased!!</li>
            <li> These colors are amazing! I think this is the perfect basic color palette that everyone should have in their makeup drawer! Plus the price is great!</li>
            <li> The colors/combos are great. The ones I&#x27;ve used so far (4) are a little firm so it doesn&#x27;t apply easily. I softened up with my brush and that made it a bit easier. A good purchase for the money.</li>
            <li> LOVE these eyeshades! They go on well with primer</li>
            <li> Nice colors and nice picmentation!!!!</li>
            <li> This pallete is just okay... the colors aren&#x27;t very saturated but if you&#x27;re going for an incredibly natural look I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Not as opaque as I&#x27;d like them to be, but decent for the price</li>
            <li> This is a great palette, the colors are so beautiful and goes on very well and are easy to blend. My palette also arrive within two days which I was very satisfied about.</li>
            <li> very pleased with this palette, nice range of colors (neutrals) and a great price! I can&#x27;t see spending over $50 on Urban Decay or Tarte or some of the more prestigious lines for what are basically earth toned eyeshadows. I use a little primer on my lids, or a dusting of powder, then apply with a brush and VOILA! It&#x27;s not rocket science, but Maybelline quality is fine. Fun to play with, too. Packaging is plastic but adequate. I do use a good quality makeup brush, not the small sponge brushes that come with it.</li>
            <li> Received this item and it came broken packagin was very poor</li>
            <li> It applies very lightly, so I usually have to go over it a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are nice, and it blends well.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the price instead of Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked series, and it&#x27;s great for the price.  Good enough!</li>
            <li> I wish this palette had more pigment payoff. It&#x27;s okay but I was expecting more...</li>
            <li> For the price I think it&#x27;s a very nice Palette. You can mix and match withe colors and they all go well together. It does take a few tries to swipe the color on the lid to really bring out the color but it&#x27;s very nice in a subtle and classic way.</li>
            <li> Love the colors. Great selection, easy to apply. Can&#x27;t go wrong with neutrals.</li>
            <li> I really love this product for multiple reasons.&lt;br /&gt;The palette offer a wide selection of colors- regardless of the owner&#x60;s skin tone.It provides the selection of colors from light shading, or very muted look to deep smoky make up for the night.Obviously the shades can be used separately or blended together- which widens its use to unlimited options.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the colors are matte and others are luminous.All very carefully collected into this box, and elegant.&lt;br /&gt;The various use of this product makes it perfect for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;It is so versatile, that in my family and friends&#x60; circle all ladies use it form age 14 to 75!Now that is a great product.!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe just one little downside: there&#x60;s only one applicator comes with it.But it can be also an adventage: you can use your own brush or applicator.&lt;br /&gt;I always have a set of unused foam applicators with me - at home I prefer precision angled brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The use of applicator also helps to keep the colors clean and  the eyes healthy.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing, to keep in mind; this is a powder.So if you have little wrinkles, it is best to use a great quality moisturizer,an even better quality primer ( maybe a luminizer version) and then work with the eyeshadow colors.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this product is just as good as some Bare Minerals shadow- but its packaging makes it easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;The price is outstanding for the quality.</li>
            <li> very nice shades does not crumble my only complaint would be only one wand and the wand is poor quilty! better off using your own brushes!</li>
            <li> Great price; great pallet. Love it!</li>
            <li> All colors needed for me are here!</li>
            <li> just as expected. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Great colors. Not very pigmented though. Still love this palette!</li>
            <li> Even with my Urban Decay shadow primer this still creases before the end of the day. Sad because the colors do go on gorgeous at first. It just doesn&#x27;t last for me. :(</li>
            <li> Lots of options for the price!</li>
            <li> Great palette. Very versatile.</li>
            <li> saw this same pallet at Walmart for $12.99. I got it for half the price. The colors are all amazing. There are matte colors as well as shimmery colors. They blend beautifully and stay on all day. I am constantly getting compliments on my make up when I use this pallet. After working over 10 hours a day my make up looks as if I just applied it. Very fast shipping. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the size of this palette, I thought it was going to be a lot smaller. The colors are radiant, I love both the shimmer and the matte. I will definitely be ordering again as the colors fit my eyeshadow style perfectly. They stay on very well too. Definitely recommend for anyone that wants a great nude palette at a good price.</li>
            <li> Kind of looks like children&#x27;s makeup but it works for the price lol</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a drug store nude eyeshadow palette, there are dozens out there but this particular one is quite decent.  If you use a primer or a base before you apply the shadows, you&#x27;ll get the best results from the product.</li>
            <li> Hmm... I could pay a high price at Walmart for this, orrrr I could just order it for a lot cheaper on here, and have it delivered.  I was smart and chose the latter.  We all know this is an awesome alternative to the NAKED palette.  The colors are rich, blendable, and stay put through the day There&#x27;s a lot of options for a neutral look or smokey eyes.  Lots of different color combos to try.  BUT MOSTLY buy it on Amazon, because it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> Stay on and I love the shades.</li>
            <li> I have waited awhile for this color comb.  Most others have colors I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> Perfect colors for me. Great pigment and easy to blend. Can get many different looks from this one palette.</li>
            <li> Really like the product</li>
            <li> I love this nude palette! This was recomended to me by a friend and i never thought i would love it this much.  Colors are blendable and the tutorial in the back helps especially when u are in a hurry and have no time to experiment looks.</li>
            <li> This was a great gift for my daughter.  She said she liked it better than the sephoria nude palette. It was a lot cheaper also.  The color went on and blended perfectly.  Thank you</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok..nothing to stand up and cheer about...it&#x27;s eye shadow..looks natural</li>
            <li> They came intact, the color was perfect!</li>
            <li> still waiting on this I will receive it tomorrow I can not wait to try out my new cover been dying for this palette and I finally got it...</li>
            <li> Not as strongly pigmented as the Naked palettes. The shades are nice, but I personally feel like it doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth and nice as the Naked eyeshadows. Its size is convenient for on-the-go though. Of course, this is a lot cheaper than the higher end palettes, so you get what you pay for. And it does the job. I am going to use it while I have it, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll re-purchase.</li>
            <li> This product arrived with several of the eye shadows broken and crumbled.  Did not ship with any protection.  The eye shadows are very soft and crumble easily.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied I use this for my eyebrows. and liner. its perfect.</li>
            <li> i loooovee this pallette! the color in the picture is as pretty and exact as in the picture. It is very pigmented and stays on all day long. each color is creamy and does not fall off your skin when applied..This is also perfect for those who don&#x27;t want to spend much money for urban decay eyeshadows. This Maybelline &amp;#34;The Nude&amp;#34; palllette is awesome. I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. You get what you pay for. Nothing too excellent but not a lost cause either. Falls in the middle of the spectrum.</li>
            <li> Nice set for a store brand. Great neutrals with matte and shimmer and very small so it&#x27;s great for your clutch purse. I do love this kit. Perfect for brown skin as well. Applicator isn&#x27;t so great but they never are. Use your own brushes. Beautiful results with it. I love makeup and am a bit of a perfectionist with it and this holds up just as well as the majors. Get it. You will be happy you did.</li>
            <li> Love these colors. They are so pigmented and are very easy to apply. I used a ELF eyeshadow primer and it made it stay on ALL day long. This is a great alternative to the Naked pallet, which I own. I find myself using this pallet more than the Naked! Great product.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day. More pigmented than I thought it would be, but very nice.</li>
            <li> Eh. Not as impressed with this as I was hoping to be. I am a longtime lover of Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked palettes and was hoping this would be a cheaper alternative. The color is not nearly as concentrated as UD&#x27;s and the shadows are always falling out of the palette so it&#x27;s a bit messy. The old saying you get what you pay for seems to ring true to this product.</li>
            <li> for the price i didn&#x27;t expect much, its a good palette you might have to swipe a few times on ur eyelid for more color power. Like I said for the price its expected :) but if you&#x27;re looking for something with more pigment and price, I&#x27;d go for a nyx nude palette. I would recommend to someone who is just getting into makeup. It&#x27;s a really good palette to experiment with and mix and match with.</li>
            <li> Love it! Some of the colors show up on my skin slightly different than expected. I wanted a cost effective substitute for a Naked palette and I was not disappointed. I use this almost daily</li>
            <li> I love this palette!  Personally, I really hate how hard it is to find matte makeup.  I&#x27;m not thirteen, I don&#x27;t want to cover my face in glitter all the time.  This is a great &#x27;grown up&#x27; palatte, with some mattes and some lightly shimmery tones.  Two of the colours did detach, something other reviewers also complained about, but I just popped them back in with some e6000 and voila!</li>
            <li> So many shades to choose from</li>
            <li> I actually did not like this palette at all and I&#x27;m very surprised to see so many good reviews since everyone I know didn&#x27;t like this either. I was expecting it to be an Urban Decay Naked dupe, but these shadows are powdery and dry with only one or two that feel buttery and have a decent amount of pigment. Also there is not enough color variation, some shades look almost the same within the palette.  If you&#x27;re looking for a budget-friendly version of the Naked Palettes, I suggest Makeup Revolution&#x27;s Iconic palettes, now at Ulta. They are exact color matches for the Naked palettes and are nicely pigmented and buttery for only $9.99.</li>
            <li> Nice palette, although it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t show up hardly and doesn&#x27;t last long! Had to reapply many times in the day!</li>
            <li> Good colors I like them</li>
            <li> Good product, I just don&#x27;t use the darker colors.</li>
            <li> This pallet is an amazing dupe for the naked pallet. The colors are clear even without primer. The quality of the shadows are just like the naked pallets.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are not very pigmented but other than that it is a good palette</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful Palette! I love, love the nudes/gold colors. They&#x27;re awesome!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it came and was already opened and banged around :(</li>
            <li> I love everything Maybelline. I use quite a bit of their cosmetics. This Nude eyeshadow set is just wonderful. The color are so pretty and goes on really well. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> If you want a beautiful natural look this is the best neutral palette, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Best palette I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon. You can create both natural look and smoky one with it and some can be used for the brow as well.</li>
            <li> This is more for non professionals, the colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented, and sometimes stuff won&#x27;t come on the brush,  But it could be good for a starting out teenager or beginner in eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday, I love the nude colors, they go perfectly with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really wear eyeshadow until recently, so I&#x27;m a bit of a newbie at the game. Saw this palette at Target (for at least 30% more) and decided it would be a good starting point. LOVED how on the bottom, there is a &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; showing the correct eyeshadow duos, triples, and quads. The colors are true and go on subtle enough that they can be built up or left sheer. Perfect for a rather clumsy beginner! My personal biology leads eyeshadow to wear away quickly. I&#x27;ve found that this palette is actually longer lasting than other shadows I&#x27;ve had in the past. Also, the compact is a great size... not so big that it doesn&#x27;t fit into my modestly-size organizer. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A little awkward to open</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the colors in this palette. They are rich and warm and have great color payoff and are easily blendable. I have not noticed any creasing or flaking and I wear my make up for at least 8-9 hours a day.</li>
            <li> This has to be the worest thing EVER! There no pigmentation no matter what you do and its hard to apply. I just want throw it in the trash and try tarte or something high quality because this was a waste of bucks.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t as rich as I would like. But it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> This pallet has some very beautiful colors in it but the fallout is HORRIBLE!! I mean HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> The pigment isn&#x27;t rich enough</li>
            <li> Great selection of colors</li>
            <li> great mixture of colors. great buy</li>
            <li> The pigmentation isn&#x27;t too great, but it&#x27;s a relatively decent nude eyeshadow palette</li>
            <li> This is a good a good group of colors.&lt;br /&gt;And the price was also a plus. It will stay on all day.</li>
            <li> it is a little on the sparkley side... if you don&#x27;t like that glitter effect DO NOT buy these! I&#x27;m okay with that my make up skills are on par with a 14 year old girl so This was perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Love the color combination</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is inexpensive</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t as strong as I tought they&#x27;d be. But overall, they give a nice look</li>
            <li> I am surprised, the quality is very good,  no fallouts, really good blend of Mattes and shimmers, will have to purchase backups.</li>
            <li> I have alot of fun with this product. Stays on my eyes without melting away.</li>
            <li> Good price. Nice colors. Do it, get this eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Well the colors are nice, but why does it look like it was used or something? I mean the outer cover is scratched and there was no packaging to preserve it. I really got upset for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the plastic, it was me who opened it.</li>
            <li> Love it, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I own several naked palettes and purchased this via recommendation from a friend since it can fit snuggly in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;and I love it! For it&#x27;s price it&#x27;s pretty pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;Good if you&#x27;re looking for something with good quality but you&#x27;re on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using your own brushes to apply tho. I didn&#x27;t like the applicator that came with it.</li>
            <li> I found this palette to be exactly what I need. Now that I&#x27;m &amp;#34; middle-aged&amp;#34;, I tend to like the matte nudes better than shimmer. I like this better than a MUCH more expensive &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; name brand palette that I purchased in the past. Plus it is so compact, but not too small, and it is in a secure casing. Easy to use &amp; travel with. No powder &amp;#34;dusting down&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors for an economical price. I can&#x27;t say enough about this palette. I have the Naked Palette, costing much more, and I find myself using this palette more often than that one. Every shade blends well and goes on with ease without causing irritation or wearing off throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The colors are just as I expected, and they stay on my lids for about five hours. Gorgeous pallet, perfect for my skin/eye colors. (pale skin, green eyes, light red hair) The price is a few dollars cheaper than any of my locals stores, which is a great bonus. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice colors.  Last several hours too.</li>
            <li> No pigmentation, chalky and impossible to build. Lasting power: 0 (even with primer!). This is unfortunately no dupe for the Naked or Lorac Pro palettes.</li>
            <li> This was for my wife. She is really happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Good color compared to others. Some color where lighter than I thought they would be. Had to apply lots to see color. It ok</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this palette. I have red/head auburn coloring. I&#x27;m not pale and freckled like a lot of red heads. I&#x27;m a little darker, but still have the same pink undertones. This looks great on! You can easily pull off a light natural look or a heavier darker smokey look with the mix of colors. As with all eye makeup palettes I&#x27;ve ever used, there are some colors that I use ALWAYS and some I&#x27;ve never touched. So not all of the colors are useful for me. But it&#x27;s nice having so many shades to choose from to create different looks. I haven&#x27;t used the applicator, I use my own makeup brushes. The colors are easy to build up into darker heavier shades. I haven&#x27;t had any creasing either.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Naked, but it does ok</li>
            <li> Very good just what I wanted</li>
            <li> I bought this from Ulta a little unsure on how I would like the quality, given the cheap price. And I love it! I wear it everyday with the many different shades.  I like how even though it is a brown palette it still has grey and black.  Vey impressed with this product and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> My friend buy from my account this item and it was broken and ugly</li>
            <li> Not super impressed with the shadows, they aren&#x27;t super pigmented. But they can still be used for everyday use. not my favorite palette.</li>
            <li> For the price? LOVE. Not urban decay but way more affordable too.</li>
            <li> looooove the colors i bought it as a gift for my sister and i was going to order another one for me however when it arrived i got two pallets for 6 dollars. i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a mistake cause i read earlier reviews and they too got two pallets. definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I like this palette. I use it everyday and it goes on well. Stays all day too.</li>
            <li> These are really nice colors and really great for a natural look. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the colors don&#x27;t hold up well. I wear an eyeshadow primer and I still feel like these colors wear off compared to my Urban Decay shadows. But they are worth the price especially if you just want a quick color.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter in law.  All the colors she uses.  Of course, Maybelline has long been a quality poduct.</li>
            <li> Love Maybelline shadows and this pallet has a nice mix of matte and shimmer shadows. Color ranges from very light cream to black, looks great with my brown eyes.</li>
            <li> Awesome colors, my new go to makeup item. A must have. Just LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> The shadows seem nice swatched. Bought it because it was alot cheaper than what I would have got it for in the store.. The packaging for it sucked. I am lucky none of the shadow broke or cracked! When I opened it though there was looks eye shadow powder every where on the palette... I can clean it up but I was expecting it to look nicer and &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Difinetly have to have the right brush to make it show up. Other than that it&#x27;s average. Not my going to be my go to by any means. I do like the brown on the bottom row, 4th from the left. I use a damp brush and use it for eyeliner. Works great.</li>
            <li> Great drugstore pallet. Slightly chalky, but that is to be expected for the price.  Good color payoff in both the dark and highlight colors. This would be a great palette for those just starting to use makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this kit. I can use it for my eyebrows and lids. Great colors that go on in one swipe  so you don&#x27;t have to do layers and with great color. Great buy!</li>
            <li> great pigmentation, presentation is also good, tho is really small, almost fit my hand, therefore really easy to transport.</li>
            <li> Love this palette!  The colors were great for both me and my mom and this was a great deal well. After my naked 2 palette was stolen I needed a go to palette and this is it.</li>
            <li> A primer is necessary.</li>
            <li> Arrived dirty and falling apart. The eyeshadows came out of their spots and crumbled. Luckily a few are still intact. Even came in its own box.</li>
            <li> All the colors I needed.  The application sponge is a wee bit small, but otherwise, the colors are perfect!</li>
            <li> My Maybelline Nudes Eye shadow arrived today, but I was disappointed. First of all, the case was scratched a lot. The small indicating it had not been opened was already ripped, so I was suspicious that somebody had used it already. When I opened the product, I found the brush was missing as well.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found some finger prints on the shadow. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is great for any occasion it stays on all day. I really like the brush that it comes with, and the colors are neutral so u can wear with any thing.</li>
            <li> Looks perfect! Just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Great product, but $21.95??? You can get it from Walmart for $9.89. I&#x27;m appalled at the markup here.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it was featured in a makeup tutorial  that I liked.  The colors looked very powdery when on and I ended up going to MAC and getting the colors there to continue the look I had learned.  I am a dark skin toned American so this could have look just fine on a lighter individual.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy playing with the different colors included. With this set you can do a smoky or natural look</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, and it&#x27;s fun to experiment</li>
            <li> I got this palette as I am slightly handicapped in the world of makeup. I thought the numbering sequence and suggestions on the back were fantastic! When I started using it however, the colors just didn&#x27;t seem right. Why would I completely cover the eye with dark brown and then put a smudge of light nude in the corner?! Then I looked online and it turned out the numbering sequence on my box was completely off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve relabeled it, the colors are wonderful and well-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are purchasing this for the added use of the suggestions, make sure you check it against the sequences listed on the Amazon page (or their direct site) before using!</li>
            <li> Greats colors but it is not pigmented so it&#x27;s hard to tell the colors apart. It&#x27;s a great palette if you&#x27;re looking for a very natural look that&#x27;s not too dark.</li>
            <li> Love these colors, perfect for my skin tone. The only thing is that it takes a little extra blending, but not a big deal . Great price for the quality, I&#x27;ve used dept. store brands that weren&#x27;t this nice, didn&#x27;t last as long. Nice and slim, travels well , I just wish it had a little mirror</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my daughter!! love it!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with a palatte of &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; shades!  A nice variety and you can mix &amp; match to your hearts content.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t need to buy eye shadow for the next year and I could just use this.  But that&#x27;s not likely! :)</li>
            <li> Great colors love them!</li>
            <li> Maybelline has always been my go-to make-up before I started ordering stuff online. I like Maybelline. It&#x27;s good stuff. It&#x27;s not always the cheapest though. The reason I bought this palette was because I could not for the life of me find a &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; palette that didn&#x27;t have shiny glittery crap in it. When I want nude stuff for costumes, I despise buying a nude palette and each colour is tainted with glitter. That just doesn&#x27;t work for animal costumes and stuff. Anyway Maybelline didn&#x27;t disappoint me too much. Out of the 12 colours on the palette, 6 of them weren&#x27;t tainted with glittery mica powder. The free shipping took about a week to get to me, since it was from Amazon and not another country (plus I live in the middle of no where). Great product just for what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Full Makeup review with pictures can be found here: http://tatsuusan.tumblr.com/post/110365855409/okay-so-i-promised-a-review-like-forever-ago-so</li>
            <li> The colors are really dark so The Nudes in the title is pretty misleading.</li>
            <li> I really love it.. It become my daily use!</li>
            <li> Love this Maybelline palette! Soft and dark tones. Easy to apply. IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> wonderful shades! I really like them, so many possibilities from dramatic to natural look and it&#x27;s all in one!</li>
            <li> Arrived Quick and just as described... Would def. Buy Again :)</li>
            <li> Great product, comparable to more expensive options in quality and color!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this eyeshadow palette!!  The little chart on the back that shows what colors to use together (depending on how many of them you&#x27;d like to use) is helpful.  The color applies easily and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors with this palette! It has a great mix of matte and glitter shadow. I wear it everyday. It also mixes well with the pink nudes palette.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this one as much, I&#x27;d much prefer  the Naked palette. Good colors though, alright price.</li>
            <li> one of the best palettes I have super pigmented a great buy</li>
            <li> Great color selection.</li>
            <li> You really have to dab/srub with brush to get any color out the pigmentation is ok. Not as happy with it as i thought i would be</li>
            <li> LOVE this eye shadow. Absolutely worth it. It comes with 12 shades and love every single one. They last all day and you can create so many different looks. With all the different colors this pallete is at such a great price and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> So easy to blend and pigmented</li>
            <li> I love this palette! A few colors are a little lighter than I&#x27;d like, but for the most part they all apply really well as long as you blend. I always use it with primer and it stays all day.</li>
            <li> This palette is wonderful! I literally use this on a daily basis and its perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are pretty pigmented &amp; have nice color payoff too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very small &amp; sleek so its great to take around with you for touch ups as well.&lt;br /&gt;The colors in this palette are truly sooooo outstandingly beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> I love this color pallet. I am using many of the colors that I didn&#x27;t think I would.</li>
            <li> Good mix of both matte and shiny colors. This is a great product and at low price. Love this pallet of nude colors.</li>
            <li> Love the shades especially for my brown eyes</li>
            <li> Love the colors! Only thing I don&#x27;t like is how hard it is to get the color dark enough. I generally wet the brush but I love the colors and it lasts all day</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product, it came within 2 days of ordering and is just absolutely great!</li>
            <li> Good and neutral. Stays on well, which is good, because I would not re-apply even if it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love this pallet! It has all the colors I use regularly, and stays on a long time. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I saw negative reviews on this product and i was hesitant in purchasing it, I must say it lives up to my expectation on a neat compact palette with sades I am happy with it is not powdery or dry feeling. It is my GO TO Palette for my every day natural look and you should try it out too don&#x27;t get caught up in the negative reviews. Ciao.</li>
            <li> This palette is great if you want a Naked palette but don&#x27;t want to (or can&#x27;t afford to) spend the money. It is more towards the low end scale for makeup so you can&#x27;t expect it to be perfect, but the colors are pigmented and go on great, blend easily. You may have to build it up a bit to get the color as shown in the palette but I don&#x27;t mind it. Helps to use a primer before hand, if you can use a white one even better. Has a nice range of colors, though, and I like how it&#x27;s set up to be used as duo, trio, and quads. Very good for beginners! Love this palette for everyday looks</li>
            <li> Great natural colors for everyday, does not irritate my sensitive eyes. Good mix of matte and light/semi glitter.</li>
            <li> I came with a LOT of scratches on the outside.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and received the product with a broken seal and dust all over the palette. Not  happy about it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because of the mixed reviews but was tempted by the low price here on Amazon. I ended up getting 2 so thats cool. I&#x27;ve never had high end eye-shadow except some Clinique I was gifted so I can&#x27;t compare it in that aspect, but the pigmentation on these is less than the Coloricon by WetnWild. All the shades are usable on me except one, the highlight from the second quad (third from the top row left to right). It&#x27;s almost the same as my skin tone and dissapears. I think overall this is lacking in highlight shades. Technically there should be 3 ( one per quad) but only the top left is light enough for my skin tone. The highlight for the right quad is beautiful but a medium tone on me that works more as a lid color.  Because of that the concept of these being arranged as quads doesn&#x27;t work for me. I find myself reaching for an additional highlight eyeshadow to complete a look. But I&#x27;m still happy with this and it offers something I didn&#x27;t have in my collection. If you already own eye-shadow you love in gold, browns and neutrals this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> I was interested in the color palette, but once I began using it, it doesn&#x27;t apply as well as I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt&#x27; recommend this if you want a nice blend and stay-ability.  Normally, paying for a better product&lt;br /&gt;might be worth it, but prices on make up are outrageous in the first place -  Maybelline has been around&lt;br /&gt;long enough to provide something better, at a decent price.  This truly lacks in quality.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> First off, the eyeshadows are amazing and a great dupe for the UD naked palettes. But the white eyeshadows are so not pigmented, Plus the third shade is barely pigmented with a brush, and the pad one that they give you. On the other hand, the darker ones are very pigmented with any form of application. It worked great for me, I am a porcelain/fair skin tone. and another problem is that, when after usage and then reopening it the next day, there is eyeshadow powder ALL over the palette. Oh and instead of paying $16 on here, go buy it for $10 at walmart.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice closable case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;The colors are waxy, don&#x27;t blend very well, and dull looking. Powdery, not terribly pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice, then threw it out.</li>
            <li> I really like these eye shadows, they go on smooth and last for hours.</li>
            <li> I was enthusiastic to try the colors. however the one I bought came with out a brush.  I looked past the fact that it came with out a brush and tried a few of the colors on with one of my own brushes. I didn&#x27;t like how unpigmented the colors are. I would not recommend this palette.</li>
            <li> I should begin by saying that I am something of a makeup novice, and I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup on a daily basis. I generally stick to drugstore brands, but I&#x27;m slowly learning more and more about makeup. One thing I&#x27;ve learned is that quality products really make a world of difference. I had been planning to splurge on an Urban Decay Naked palette, but I needed new eyeshadow before I could get to a store that sells Urban Decay. Having read the great reviews for Maybelline&#x27;s The Nudes palette, I decided to head to the drugstore and pick one up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I am not a professional, and I generally do use drugstore products, so I can&#x27;t really compare this to higher end products. However, compared to other drugstore products I have tried, this is above and beyond. The selection of colors is pretty much perfect for any kind of look I could want, and it&#x27;s all here in one palette rather than several smaller sets. The price cannot be beat! I do wish there was one more lighter brown option to fill in my brows, but I can use another product for that. It has a great nude shade, a shimmery but subtle cream for highlighting, and I particularly love the taupey grays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some colors definitely blend more easily than others (the darker shades take some work), but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the blendability. The coverage is great, and there isn&#x27;t much fallout. I found that eyelid primer is a must--without it, the eyeshadow has much less staying power, and will crease. With primer it applies smoothly and lasts for hours. I use Eco Tools brushes, but the narrow sponge that comes with this set is handy for applying shadow along the edges of the lid. I do find the case a little bit difficult to open, especially if you&#x27;re trying not to ruin a fresh manicure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Maybelline continues making this palette for years to come, because it&#x27;s a keeper. For my purposes, I think I can skip splurging and just stick with this palette.</li>
            <li> Love it do much,  can play around with shades early.  Perfect for a day out and for night.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday. The colors last, the pigment is great, can&#x27;t wait till I get the blushed nudes.</li>
            <li> A little bit of everything! Color lasts all day</li>
            <li> I like the options but the pigment isn&#x27;t very strong. Takes a lot to show up on your eyes.</li>
            <li> I looked for a nude pallet quite a while and this one is perfection personified. What I love about this pallet is the depth of color for both shimmer and matte applications. I honestly use this pallet every single day and rarely stray from it. The pallet has a great variety of shades from very light to almost black in darkness. The powder is light, but it spreads across the eye well without emphasizing the creases in my lids.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I found this product to be almost perfect.</li>
            <li> Beautifully pigmented. Silky shadows with great payoff! Love the product and the price.  Fast shipping, and product was well protected.</li>
            <li> Great  fit good on my skin color.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, but they just aren&#x27;t pigmented enough.  You have to keep applying to build any color.</li>
            <li> Love rhis grwat colors fast ahipping</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to have received TWO palettes! Great and fresh product with lasting pigments.</li>
            <li> Really nice selection of colors.</li>
            <li> I love this! This a really good color for a tan face. This also blends together perfectly. It&#x27;s shimmery beside the dark brown and black.</li>
            <li> who needs Naked Pallete when you got this one? I also love the suggestions of use in the back of the product.</li>
            <li> The colors are even more beautiful in person that they looked online.  :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like spending the money on Urbam Decay so I tried a cheaper Naked pallet. It was well worth what I paid for it. :) I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> Just one collor came broken.</li>
            <li> Colors go with everything. I love it</li>
            <li> I love this palette. It&#x27;s everything you can ask for in a nude eyeshadow palette. There&#x27;s shimmer colors and normal shades. I think this isn&#x27;t a product for &amp;#34;professional makeup artist&amp;#34;, the colors aren&#x27;t strongly pigmented but they are SO great for anyone else!</li>
            <li> A MUST have, I absolutely adore this set.  I use Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked basics and Naked 3, and I still end up coming back to this palette. Its easy to hold, clean, use, and take on the go. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. Also, its very pigmented so it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get the look you want! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really thought I would love this palette more, but the colors were darker then I thought they would be, so I only use about half of the palette. But its great to have the option for more colors if I ever feel adventurous.</li>
            <li> Great colors. Many choices to choose from</li>
            <li> Do not follow the instructions on the back because they&#x27;re just weird and confusing. Other than that, I love the colors and they look really good.</li>
            <li> Good eyeshadow. Wears off quick though</li>
            <li> Was gonna splurge on a high end over rated neutral shades palette but decided to give this a try instead. I love it. All the shades have great pigment. Beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> I realllllly loved this kit!!!!&lt;br /&gt;the colors are really pigmented and they&#x27;re just amazing!! i definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Item arrived with the seal broken and several shades of shadows were damaged so severely that when I opened the package it just fell into a crumbly mess.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect. Tons of different shades for whatever mood your in. Fast shipping and good price!</li>
            <li> The Maybelline New York Nudes Eyeshadow Palette is beautiful! It has all the nude tones that are suitable for those with fair skin or those that tend to prefer nude and earthy tones. The eyeshadows are pigmented and can be mixed and matched in order to create a number of looks. I pair this up with simple black mascara, black or brown liquid eyeliner and Maybelline Nude Lip Gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette is about 3\\&quot; x 5\\&quot;, the case is black with a window style lid so you can see the colors of the palette. There are some instructions and style suggestions on the back of this palette regarding different eye looks you can create, it gives a good number of suggestions for duos, trios and quads. These colors blend nicely and are applied very easily too. Brush is included with the palette.

            <li> Amazing palette! The colors are great perfect for many different looks, and it&#x27;s a good size! I payed the $7 something and got two! Idk if that was a mistake but I love the colors. Maybelline doesn&#x27;t disappoint when it comes to eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Like all the colors,the squares do come loose easy but colors stay on for the bulk of the day.</li>
            <li> I love the color but I&#x27;m a beginner so I don&#x27;t really know how to apply eyeshadow. But I love it anyway:)</li>
            <li> If you want something that rivals the Naked palettes but don&#x27;t want to drop $50-$60, this is a good option. The colors are highly pigmented which is nice but they don&#x27;t blend easily. Also, there&#x27;s a good mixture of shimmer and matte colors unlike the Naked palettes that have maybe one matte, a couple glitter shadows, and the rest are high shimmer. Unless you like all that shimmer, in which case, get the Naked palettes.</li>
            <li> I was expecting much more based on the reviews. I decided to give it a try since I&#x27;ve just started to learn how to do a proper makeup and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a good palette. The fact is that the shadows don&#x27;t have much pigmentation at all and the colors are nicer in the pictures than they really are.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite palettes! I use this palette all the time, it comes with me where ever I go. If you can afford an Urban Decay palette this the next best thing for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the way the this eye shadow makes my eyes look.  It goes on so smooth and lasts a long time.  I have oily skin but no oily buildup and no creases.  That&#x27;s important to me because sometimes I have to wear it all day.  Love this product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Perfect, easy starter kit to use. I&#x27;ve never done my own eye shadow but these colors make it easy to teach yourself and all go really well with each other.</li>
            <li> Luv the colours, i will buy it again</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed by this, because the palette *looks* like a good collection.  But the shadow doesn&#x27;t apply evenly, and is such a light pigmentation that you have to use a lot, even with the darker shades.  I&#x27;m not trying to go for a high glamour look, just regular coverage.  The overall color tone tends toward cool (blue) rather than warm, which doesn&#x27;t work well for my skin tone (very light ruddy complexion).  The only shade I have used successfully is the upper left one (white) for highlights, since those are supposed to be subtle anyway.</li>
            <li> This is going to be a review of The Nudes, The Blushed Nudes, and The Smokes (as all three of them are listed as different color options).  These three palettes have different color schemes, but they&#x27;re all the same size and have the same &amp;#34;formula&amp;#34; (what&#x27;s the word used with pressed powder eye shadows? I have no idea). I was super excited when I saw them at my local drugstore, and I picked all three of them up. I really liked the packaging because they&#x27;re not bulky, and even though they don&#x27;t have a mirror, I liked the clear plastic window because I could see all the colors in the store. The colors looked so beautiful! Each palette came with two sponge tipped applicators.  The Nudes, of course, has more neutral colors--browns, coppers, a black. The Blushed Nudes is more rosy-toned and has some plum shades. The Smokes is darker, with a navy, silvers, blacks, and grays.  They&#x27;re all terrible. Every shadow was chalky, not very pigmented, and there are absolutely NO mattes in any of these palettes. I thought there would be some nice matte browns or taupes to use as transition shades, but no, every single shadow has an obnoxious overspray of glitter that actually will pick up when you dip your brush or your finger in them. There is a super glittery black in The Smokes, and whatever, that&#x27;s for smokey looks, but having glitter in the black shadow in The Nudes? Really?  Some people say that there are mattes in the palettes, and yes, there are definitely shadows that look less glittery than the others. However, just try swatching them on your arm and hold it up to the light--you will see tiny glitters. It makes applying the shadows difficult because it&#x27;s hard to blend, and the fallout is atrocious. I always use an eye primer because my lids are oily, and even with a primer, these shadows look like they fade throughout the day.  Don&#x27;t waste your money--this is not a dupe for the Naked palettes...this is not even a dupe for the Wet n Wild Walkin&#x27; on Eggshells trio, it&#x27;s that bad.</li>
            <li> Great colors. Not too glittery.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (I can only wear hypoallergenic jewelry, etc.) and this eyeshadow did NOT irritate my eyes. I love the nude palette, it has plenty of options and colors on the spectrum to create whatever look you want (smokey, or barely there for example). Also, none of the eyeshadows were broken upon arrival; they packed the palette really well. The sparkly colors aren&#x27;t overly sparkly either -they can be worn for work and not look ridiculous or inappropriate. And for the price? Done deal for me.</li>
            <li> I usually only wear neutral colors so I was excited that this pallet gave me a lot of variety that I would actually use.</li>
            <li> Love the pigmentation and the formula is very smooth, almost creamy. Applies beautifully.</li>
            <li> great colors i got one for me and for my kit and i couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> Thought this was a great price for a pretty close dupe to other expensive brands. The colors are great, if they showed up on skin. The light &amp; white colors do not show, have very little pigment. I really rubbed it to get a good amour on the app. &amp; it&#x27;s still light. Well, for about $8, what can I expect. The darker colors I may use &amp; salvage something out of it.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Was not damaged and packaging was great. Received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> LOVED THIS&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given 5 stars but the color payoff isn&#x27;t excellent. But for a drugstore brand, at nearly $9 it&#x27;s great. Love!</li>
            <li> It was an opened product and looked used! I paid the New price so it should have been New! There was makeup all in the box with all the other stuff I bought! Lesson Learned!</li>
            <li> I got many colors with just one eyeshadow palette! it´s perfect</li>
            <li> Gave this set to my mom and she simply loved it!!! The colours are as shown. :)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting more applicator brushes since the one with this wore off. :)</li>
            <li> Love this pallet and how you can group the colors togeather. Perfectly pigmented too the only bad side is the price. The Maybelline website doesn&#x27;t even sell it for that much</li>
            <li> I love the neutral  colors! It gives me a more natural look while wearing makeup !</li>
            <li> Just received it today. The seal was broken and 3 of the colors looked like they were used. When I purchased it said NEW!</li>
            <li> Product came as advertised and would definitely recommend.  Nice colors - look exactly like they do online and wear well.  Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Great shadows. They have good pigment. Very pretty neutral, earthy tones. I&#x27;m a brunette, my daughter is a blonde. My complexion is olive, she is more golden and they are flattering on both of us.</li>
            <li> This Maybelline nudes palette is ok. I do like the pigmentation of the browns, however, I am really bummed about the gold. I was really looking forward to the gold shadow but it barely shows up, even when using a wet brush. I only use a couple of the colors in this palette regularly and if I had known that this would be the case, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased the whole palette.</li>
            <li> Very good eyeshadow.  Very pigmented.  I am quite impressed, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. Covers nicely.</li>
            <li> Good product at an affordable price. Exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> I love the eyeshadow but when I got it there was one that was almost completely crumbled and another that had popped out of the tray.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette hoping that it contained more than a few matte shades.  It doesn&#x27;t.  Most of the shadows are shimmer formulations, which, being a mature woman, I can&#x27;t use.  Good thing it wasn&#x27;t expensive or I would be doubly disappointed.  Some of the shadows go on smoothly (the matte ones anyway) and some are chalky, which is strange.  I recently discovered a makeup line that is inexpensive but the shadows go on like a dream.  Coastal Scents makes great shadows which far outshine Maybelline.  They have a large array of matte shades on their website and I am building a wonderful collection.  I am always looking for a matte shadow that is the exact color of my skin and this Maybelline palette doesn&#x27;t contain one.  I would be more thrilled with it if I was still using shimmer shades, but even testing them on the back of my hand revealed that they are a bit garish.  In general the colors are good, but the quality leaves something to be desired.  It simply isn&#x27;t consistent.  I&#x27;ve stashed this palette in my makeup drawer where the things I don&#x27;t use go to die.  Good thing I&#x27;m only out 10 bucks.  The only shade I can see myself using is the matte black.  At least that&#x27;s something.</li>
            <li> Really like this product as it has a variety of the &#x27;nude&#x27; colors.</li>
            <li> Really like it easy to apply last all day</li>
            <li> Love it can&#x27;t say more 😜</li>
            <li> nice shades, not smudgy and will last most of the day</li>
            <li> Great product! It has a good range for color and my mother said she likes it better than my naked palette! Shipped incredibly fast, good buy.</li>
            <li> Good for everyday look :)</li>
            <li> AMAZING colors and good quality.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend ordered this and loved it!</li>
            <li> I love the colors i wear them all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of eyeshadows and I have a ton. I wear a lot of browns/nudes and am a big fan of my Naked pallets, although I don&#x27;t like wearing them daily. I try to only wear them for special occasions. After researching reasonably prices makeup, I saw that this Nudes Pallet was suggested over and over, and was even used in a few YouTube videos that I watched. After receiving in the mail, I immediately used it. After priming my eyelids and applying the Nudes Pallet, I was rather impressed. It applied easily, the pigments were great, and everything blended easily together. At the end of the day, my makeup was all still in place. I didn&#x27;t have any creasing or pigmentation loss. This is a great product and I&#x27;d recommend this over and over to anyone who uses makeup!</li>
            <li> Not bad. Some colors kind like hard to see.</li>
            <li> purchased as a birthday gift for my son&#x27;s gf...she loved it</li>
            <li> Good variety and stays on</li>
            <li> I like going for a natural look when I apply eye shadow so this was perfect. It comes with an array of nude colors for all different skin colors if going for the natural look. On the back it even gives you different ways to apply it depending on the style you want.</li>
            <li> Good for new make-up user. I love the colors, they are basic and beautiful. It&#x27;s cheap, but the quality is good.</li>
            <li> Great and lasts long for how little it looks.</li>
            <li> The colors are perfect for my eye and hair color and skin tone.</li>
            <li> I just started to get into makeup and this palette is perfect for me! The colors come both in matte and shimmer. it also contains instructions on where to apply each color in the back of the palette.</li>
            <li> Wonderful range of colors, lasts me through the whole day. Arrived promptly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> love the colors great for everyday use</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say about the quality of the eyeshadows but the colours are so great and useful. Great combination of colours and price!</li>
            <li> Really nice eye shadow. Was only shipped in an empty box with absolutely no packing. I am surprised the eye shadows inside weren&#x27;t broken. Good product. Not the greatest packing for shipping.</li>
            <li> can in perfect condition and im happy with my item I purchased</li>
            <li> Loved it. Great price!</li>
            <li> This palette comes with every matte and glitter colour I have ever wanted. Perfect for simple, everyday looks.</li>
            <li> Great colors..any nude color you could want is in this palette.</li>
            <li> I believe every one who uses eyeshadow should own this product. The price is cheaper but the product is amazing!</li>
            <li> Great, my mom loved it. She said it is very creamy and good quality. Only thing is that there are less mate colors than I thought and my mom loves matte colors. Other than that it&#x27;s a great eye shadow palette!</li>
            <li> I only like this kind of colors, this is just what I expected, I don&#x27;t use to much make up so this is perfect for me, even the shiny ones are what I need for a night out make up.&lt;br /&gt;Better to use real brushed than the small little pad that includes ..</li>
            <li> I LOVE this palette!! It is so amazing. It has the perfect matte shades and the whites are perfect highlighters. The layout of the product is awesome. Great  palette for beginners and advanced makeup artists :) can not recommend more especially for its price.</li>
            <li> I have a carmel complexion and read some of the reviews that some of the colors lacked pigmentation. I have experienced that with quite a few eyeshadows I&#x27;ve used in the past, but I did not find this to be the case with this one! I&#x27;ve used all the colors within the span of a few days and they look awesome. I&#x27;m really impressed. .I don&#x27;t want to use any of my other shadows now. I highly recommend this and it gets two thumbs up in my book!</li>
            <li> I tried this palette and the colors are very pigmented and glide on. I use It cosmetic brushes and Mac so that isn&#x27;t the issue along with Urban Decay eyeshadow primer.  I normally only wear Rimmel.Nyc and MAC eyeshadows BUT this palette ROCKS! It has every neutral,natural,nude color i need. The Gold is my FAV nice and shimmery. Nice smokey eye looks and Glam Gal eyes as well.  I&#x27;m still a Maybelline fan for Mascara,eyeliners,bb dream cream,age rewind eye concealer,Brow Drama and now This Nude Palette. :)</li>
            <li> I use these shadows everyday. There are countless combinations. For those who prefer these colors, this is the only eye shadow pack you will ever need. I really love it and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I really am digging the colors! I&#x27;ve never really been into browns until now! These colors you can literally do ANYTHING with! It&#x27;s a must have for any make up lover!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for more subtle everyday wear and I was pleasantly surprised when this palette arrived :) The pigmentation/pay-off is very good for all the colors. They are easy to apply and blend as well (I use brushes not the wand). I own many &#x27;high end&#x27; eyeshadow palettes and not only is Maybelline The Nudes much cheaper but the quality is comparable to say Urban Decay or Too Faced (etc). Even though I wish the colors were bigger I do actually like that this palette is small (compact), makes it easy to store and to travel with. If you like neutral colors I recommend giving this palette a try.</li>
            <li> They are ok.  I did not realize they would have the shine to them.</li>
            <li> It is cheap eye shadow but it is really good.</li>
            <li> It was smashed to pieces when it arrived. Not going this route ever again.</li>
            <li> They have been used And the brush is missing! :(</li>
            <li> Excellent product and according to the specifications and with great value and a great specification Thank you for this offer</li>
            <li> I REALLY love the colors of this pallet. They are very pretty! The part that I am not thrilled with is the length of time it stays on and how it goes on. The color does not go on my eyelid very easily and has to be very heavily applied for it to be noticeable. I do know that this is a cheaper brand and that is probably why. I thought I would give it a shot before spending the money on the NAKED palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not stay on long at all. I have a lot of MAC eye shadow and that is great, but expensive. I was trying to find something a little cheaper that I could wear as well to save from having to continuously buy the pricier stuff. I don&#x27;t think the quality is because of the price because I honestly LOVE the ELF product that you can get at Target. It has the same colors and stays on all day for me at work. It&#x27;s actually even cheaper than this brand and I use it more than any of my expensive makeup. It&#x27;s all just based on preference and skin, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could go back, I would not get this product. I can&#x27;t really wear the colors because they don&#x27;t stay on long or go on well. But I&#x27;ll just keep them and use them if I get in a pinch! Like I said, it could just be my skin, but I have no problem with a cheaper brand or more expensive brands so maybe it&#x27;s just the quality of these shadows. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was very happy and surprised that this CoverGirl eyeshadow palette has such good coverage and lasts almost all day!  I is fairly highly pigmented with a very pretty color.  We have all tried &amp;#34;drug-store brands&amp;#34; that are so frustrating (you have to reload the brush a number of times to get color on your eyelids and it wears off fast) to use that you wish you had spent the extra money at the department store.  This is a standout drug-store product!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented, so when you try to use a light color, it doesn&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li> Love this! I have no complaints at all. With a good base these stay all day!</li>
            <li> I wanted to start using eyeshadow, so I looked up some reviews and saw this as an alternative to the Naked Palettes. The colors are all very, very neutral and beautiful. I apply Milani eyeshadow primer before I put these colors on, and they are very pigmented and lovely. They work in quads, trios, and duos. Just if anyone was curious. A girl explains this in a youtube review on this palette. So glad I bought this, gives a great smokey effect.</li>
            <li> This had horrible pigmentation  and I&#x27;m very disappointed in purchasing it.</li>
