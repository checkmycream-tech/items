    <ol>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>but this is the best I have found.....and in a pinch, I will wipe it across my cheek bones and nose!  </li>
            <li>It is the best lip protection ever</li>
            <li>FOUND THE BEST PRICE FOR IT ON AMAZON.</li>
            <li>this is good stuff!</li>
            <li>Worked great for our motorcycle trip.</li>
            <li>Dermatone is a great product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I put it on ONCE and didn&#x27;t need any more for the rest of the day!  </li>
            <li>I guess I should&#x27;ve assumed that anything too good to be true</li>
            <li>One container lasted more than 3 seasons.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries this</li>
            <li>Love for hiking and desert living.</li>
            <li>This is still the best lip balm and I am only able to find it on Amazon now...</li>
            <li>LOVE BUYING FROM AMAZON.</li>
            <li>My 2-year-old had licked a chapped ring all around her lips and, of course, the more chapped it got, the more she licked.</li>
            <li>Took this to the top of the Grand Teton and it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>you are faced with extreme weather, Dermatone is the best</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite product-very effective lip balm in cool (masculine friendly) shape/size</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find this in any store except for where I originally discovered it in Connecticut.  </li>
            <li>I love Dermatone, I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Chap sticks might make them feel better for a minute, but never actually heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>, I first found this stuff in a $1 bin on my way to the checkout at MEC (Canada&#x27;s REI) --</li>
            <li>This stated that it was case of 50 marked as a markdown of 96% off the original price and pictured a counter display of Dermatone.  </li>
            <li>I frequently get chapped lips and other Chapsticks are not as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>(I used to get really stressed out watching LOST because I imagined myself stuck on a desert island with no Dermatone).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M A REAL LIP BALM FREAK AND THIS PRODUCT FITS ALL OF MY LIP BALM NEEDS.</li>
            <li>I apply it at the first sign of chapping now and by morning she&#x27;s always clear.</li>
            <li>I have tired many MANY different types of lip balms...</li>
            <li>we live in the arid desert southwest....</li>
            <li>I keep this with me during the day for quick soothing relief from dry lips.....</li>
            <li>Not sure why they don&#x27;t sell this in more places.</li>
            <li>Excellent for cold, dry, and windy weather.</li>
            <li>It lasts so much longer, and actually medicates your lips.  </li>
            <li>, this is a little large to carry around all the time, but for a major trip this works very well because it can be used to protect nose, cheeks, ears, neck, etc.  </li>
            <li>Protects against further damage without needing frequent re-application.  </li>
            <li>My kids have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this, in fact they actually request it.  </li>
            <li>I use Burts Bees and Soft Lips, but they only temporary relieve chapping.  </li>
            <li>I tried several products from Carmex to Blistex to Chapstick and Soft Lips</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy because of the price and my dislike for chopsticks in the past, but this was worth the money.</li>

            <li> This stick is really fat and sort of awkward to apply on her tiny features - but still worth it.</li>

            <li> Small compact did the trick</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it looks like the manufacturer has changed the formula on this product, and it is no longer as thick as it used to be, so it doesn&#x27;t stay put when you apply it.</li>
            <li> That stuff just couldn&#x27;t handle the snow, wind, and cold.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the change that was made.</li>

            <li> Deceptive ad!  This stated that it was case of 50 marked as a markdown of 96% off the original price and pictured a counter display of Dermatone.  I was shipped 1 stick.  I guess I should&#x27;ve assumed that anything too good to be true probably is.</li>
            <li> Years ago, I went skiing and found myself putting on Carmex EVERY SINGLE TIME I got on the lift.  That stuff just couldn&#x27;t handle the snow, wind, and cold.  I bought a container of this stuff at the pro shop.  I put it on ONCE and didn&#x27;t need any more for the rest of the day!  One container lasted more than 3 seasons.  I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else - especially for outdoor activities.</li>
            <li> Excellent for cold, dry, and windy weather. Soothes chapped lips without the burning/stinging sensation that some &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; lip balms give. Protects against further damage without needing frequent re-application.  Works equally well for daily usage and extended hikes.  My kids have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this, in fact they actually request it.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find this in any store except for where I originally discovered it in Connecticut.  I don&#x27;t know why, but with this product my lips do not chap with regular use.  I use Burts Bees and Soft Lips, but they only temporary relieve chapping.  I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries this - I will be stocking up on them!</li>
            <li> Not sure why they don&#x27;t sell this in more places. My husband&#x27;s favorite product-very effective lip balm in cool (masculine friendly) shape/size</li>
            <li> Took this to the top of the Grand Teton and it worked just fine.  I wish I can picked up a chapstick size as well, this is a little large to carry around all the time, but for a major trip this works very well because it can be used to protect nose, cheeks, ears, neck, etc.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those guys that has had persistent chapped lips since childhood, and nothing ever seemed to help. Chap sticks might make them feel better for a minute, but never actually heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I first found this stuff in a $1 bin on my way to the checkout at MEC (Canada&#x27;s REI) -- man, I wish I&#x27;d bought a case of them at that price! This stuff works like a dream and, despite the tiny size, lasts for quite a while. If I had to guess, my last one followed me for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The annoying thing is that it&#x27;s bigger than most, meaning it&#x27;s bulky if you want to just jam it in your jeans. However, that also means I don&#x27;t seem to lose it. Come to think of it, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever misplaced one of these, unlike those &#x27;disposables&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I keep this with me during the day for quick soothing relief from dry lips.....I have tired many MANY different types of lip balms...but this is the best I have found.....and in a pinch, I will wipe it across my cheek bones and nose!  we live in the arid desert southwest....this is good stuff!</li>
            <li> I have had this Chapstick for a couple of weeks now and I am very satisfied with this product. I frequently get chapped lips and other Chapsticks are not as good as this one.  It is starting to run out and when it does I will definitely get another one.</li>
            <li> Love for hiking and desert living. No excessive greasy-ness, obnoxious taste, or odd smell. I was hesitant to buy because of the price and my dislike for chopsticks in the past, but this was worth the money. Hope it lasts!</li>
            <li> When I moved to Colorado 26 years ago, I realized this is the state of skin cream and lip balm year round, due to the low humidity.  I started with chap stick, then Burt&#x27;s Bees when it came on the market.  Just recently, on a ski trip, I realized I forgot my Burt&#x27;s Bees, and bought Dermatone at a ski shop.  What a difference.  It lasts so much longer, and actually medicates your lips.  Give it a try and I know you will become a regular user.[[ASIN:B0006MVSJY Dermatone Medicated Lip Conditioner &amp; SPF23 Sunblock]]</li>
            <li> Worked great for our motorcycle trip. Small compact did the trick</li>
            <li> This is still the best lip balm and I am only able to find it on Amazon now...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it looks like the manufacturer has changed the formula on this product, and it is no longer as thick as it used to be, so it doesn&#x27;t stay put when you apply it. This may be fine for casual use, but it&#x27;s not great for real outdoor exposure.</li>
            <li> I love Dermatone, I can&#x27;t live without it! It is the best lip protection ever (I used to get really stressed out watching LOST because I imagined myself stuck on a desert island with no Dermatone).&lt;br /&gt;I obviously somehow missed the price, or assumed it was for a multi-pack or something!&lt;br /&gt;This was $10.45 it retails for less than $3.00.&lt;br /&gt;RIDICULOUS</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS. FOUND THE BEST PRICE FOR IT ON AMAZON. THEY SELL IT IN STICKS ALSO. I&#x27;M A REAL LIP BALM FREAK AND THIS PRODUCT FITS ALL OF MY LIP BALM NEEDS. LOVE BUYING FROM AMAZON.</li>
            <li> My 2-year-old had licked a chapped ring all around her lips and, of course, the more chapped it got, the more she licked. I tried several products from Carmex to Blistex to Chapstick and Soft Lips but none of them helped. I applied the Dermatone after she fell asleep one night and she was totally cleared up in the morning. I apply it at the first sign of chapping now and by morning she&#x27;s always clear. Don&#x27;t waste your time on other products - this is it. I do wish I&#x27;d purchased the smaller size, though. This stick is really fat and sort of awkward to apply on her tiny features - but still worth it.</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars I would.  The product has changed since the last time I purchased it.  I will never buy this again.  I am very disappointed in the change that was made.</li>
            <li> Dermatone is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;If you are faced with extreme weather, Dermatone is the best protection.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You, ThinkFast.</li>
            <li> We lived in Wyoming for s few months and thus stuff was a god send since I was not used to the dryness.</li>
