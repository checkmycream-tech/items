            <li>Great for texturizing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t smell great either.&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan of this product.</li>

            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Love this spray!  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Great texturizing, and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>but I think it just kind of makes my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t one thing I liked about this product.  </li>
            <li>I mostly spray at the ends to try to make it textured and stylish but it just doesn&#x27;t look good and it makes my hair look and feel greasy.</li>
            <li>That would be nice and healthy, but the bottle lists some 20 ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce, beginning with Hydrofluorocarbon 152a, SD Alcohol 40-B (Alcohol Denat.), and Glycerin.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice shine to your hair and makes it more managable.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is great for rockin&#x27; a pixie cut, hands down the best ever.</li>
            <li>In terms of value for money, the shaping balm is probably better value than the spray.</li>
            <li>Some may love it, but I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than hairspray.</li>
            <li>Great for short hair, not so good once your hair starts to grow out, but awesome for very short cuts.</li>
            <li>I really love this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product and the cheapest that I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for short hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it everytime I go out.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product to use.</li>
            <li>I buy them in multiples.  :)</li>
            <li>Will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>More like spray wax than hairspray</li>
            <li>but I love this product and use it more like a pomade.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair \\&quot;spray\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to shake before using.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before and was so pleased to see that I could get this from Amazon....</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Love this it gives me texture</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Terrific product at an awesome price.</li>
            <li>Product is excellent for short hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a very nice product!</li>
            <li>For my hair, I&#x27;ve been applying a leave-in conditioner, then working through a dab of Quick Change balm and getting the shape I want, then spray a bit of this on top to keep the ends from straying as the hair drys and also to add that nice shine.</li>
            <li>I use it on dry and pick it out for best look!</li>
            <li>The shorter, the more lift you will get and you can shape the look you want easily.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a light hair spray.  </li>
            <li>Who cares how cute your hair looks when you reek of cheap incense?</li>
            <li>This product smells amazing and gives my hair the right amount of texture (when tousled) to make my curls not so mary-jane.</li>
            <li>But ever since I ran out of that original bottle I havent been able to find it ANYWHERE.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I Received my order very quickly.</li>
            <li>I could easily put the product in and style it one way and then change it up with adding a headband or some type of accessory.</li>
            <li>-it&#x27;s easy to do if you&#x27;re not used to this product.</li>
            <li>but this is easy to just spray lightly and evenly through your hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is thinning a bit as my life gets longer.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this to any one with fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hairs not even fine</li>
            <li>This stuff does not work on my fine textured hair - no holding power.</li>
            <li>Super product!  </li>
            <li>I have fine smooth hair</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong but worth it!</li>
            <li>Spray it lightly on hair...</li>
            <li>I really wish I liked this product.</li>
            <li>This spray is a quick easy way to get frizzy flyaway hair tamed and to keep your hair styled without using tons of hairspray.</li>
            <li>This works great to keep static down and makes my hair pliable without looking greasy.</li>
            <li>Make sure you shake it VERY VERY well and don&#x27;t overspray your hair.</li>
            <li>I originally found out about this stuff on pinterest for making the pefect wavy beach hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to get it for less than the price I have paid in beauty salons and free shipping to boot!!!</li>
            <li>and it smells good enough to eat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Must order more very soon.</li>
            <li>on return and am informed Amazon won&#x27;t take back the same hazardous material they were happy to have sent to</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it does deliver shine, which is great.</li>
            <li>Similar to the paul mitchell spray wax but so much more affordable!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and straight and this stuff just couldn&#x27;t make the grade.</li>
            <li>This really does nothing for my baby fine bobbed hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to give your hair a little lift at the end of your styling routine.</li>
            <li>I gave this to a friend who&#x27;s hair is fine, and always looks better the next day.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt feel sticky or gross in your hair and has amazing holding power.</li>
            <li>It also makes hair nice and glossy, which is a big plus in my book as my hair tends to be dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the staff use it every day for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does everything it should do for short hair..holds and shines without being stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Especially nice for silver hair too!&lt;br /&gt;Would definately recommend this product for texturizing.</li>
            <li>Love what I can do with my hair not sticky and the wind can not mess it up.</li>
            <li>All other reviews were good</li>
            <li>I was expecting a bigger bottle, when it arrived in the mail, but overall I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>The item was received super fast.</li>
            <li>you want very light definition and to prevent frizzies on a short hairstyle, give it a try.</li>
            <li>I think part of the issue with my satisfaction is that I have fine soft hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what she just ran out of</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it, I found it at Target for $10 and tried it.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I prefer the sexy hair dry wax spray.</li>
            <li>, I am CERTAIN I clicked on the $4.99 seller version but</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin and the spray ensures it&#x27;s distributed evenly to give more fullness to my hair.</li>
            <li>This really helps me style my fine, very short hair.  </li>
            <li>Not much hold at all and spraying more really doesn&#x27;t seem to help.</li>
            <li>and she said the price ws reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT WORKS ON ALL THOSE PLACES THAT ARE CONTRARY AND DON&#x27;T WANT TO DO WHAT THE REST OF YOUR HAIR WANTS TO DO.  </li>
            <li>This hair spray keeps your hair in place until your man runs his fingers gently through it.  </li>
            <li>This seems to go fast</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I use it while Im still blowdrying/styling my hair to really &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the pieces of hair in the direction</li>
            <li>holds hair well, but cheap hairspray works the same.</li>
            <li>and this stuff really helps rock my style.  </li>
            <li>Works very well thanks</li>
            <li>I think I may have used too much.</li>
            <li>And I am going to re order this product very soon.</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair and then spray with this product for fullness and control and then use a light hairspray - cannot live without it!!!</li>
            <li>I have short asymmetrical hair and was excited to use this, but even though I have lots of hair</li>
            <li>Just got a pixie cut and this product took the look to a whole new level!</li>
            <li>Great for after I have just washed ,dried and curled my hair so it does not look dry!</li>
            <li>I love that I can buy it online and not have to track it down in stores/salons.</li>
            <li>Yes, \\&quot;Sexy Hair\\&quot; is a stupid brand name, but the products are great.</li>
            <li>Spray on very lightly; less is more with this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>AMAZING keeps hair in place w/o that hard hairspray look.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Even though it says Short Sexy Hair this spray can does wonders for my long curls.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t do my hair without it, especially the first day of washing it.</li>
            <li>used this for a few years and love it.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product, never liked something so much for my curls.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my short fine hair from looking so flat.</li>
            <li>This is the only spray wax that allows me to texturize my very fine hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I puchased this item and was pleasantly surprised to find that I purchased it for less than the beuty salon and recieved free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Much to heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I found it to be too heavy for my fine hair and because I don&#x27;t shampoo every day, it made my hair feel crusty.</li>
            <li>For fine I&#x27;d recommend the Cocky.</li>
            <li>Just a little bit gives my hair great texture and hold, but it doesn&#x27;t feel hard or crunchy.</li>
            <li>Whereas Quick Change has a nice slightly lemony smell, this spray has a very sweet fragrance that I would describe as sickly.</li>
            <li>This product works great but is like hairspray and with that being said it is too expensive for simply hairspray.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to last the whole day without a touch up.</li>
            <li>Really does wonders with short hair!  </li>
            <li>Makes my thick, frizzy curly hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>I have been using Quick Change shaping balm for a few months and decided to see what the texturizing spray was like.</li>
            <li>I love it because I have flat thick hair, and when I curl it</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and like a carefree style - usually have a pixie cut or a short shag.</li>
            <li>I went from very long hair to very short hair, and when it is in that &amp;#34;in between cuts&amp;#34; stage, this is the only product I can find that keeps my hair looking natural (vs. plastered back) while keeping me from looking too much like Justin Bieber.</li>
            <li>and I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>Tried just about everything, but this separates and holds my &amp;#34;shaggy style&amp;#34;, and keeps it looking wild all day long!</li>

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this to any one with fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hairs not even fine</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work on my fine textured hair - no holding power.</li>
            <li> Super product!  </li>
            <li> I have fine smooth hair</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strong but worth it!</li>
            <li> Spray it lightly on hair...</li>
            <li> I really wish I liked this product.</li>
            <li> This spray is a quick easy way to get frizzy flyaway hair tamed and to keep your hair styled without using tons of hairspray.</li>
            <li> This works great to keep static down and makes my hair pliable without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Make sure you shake it VERY VERY well and don&#x27;t overspray your hair.</li>
            <li> I originally found out about this stuff on pinterest for making the pefect wavy beach hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to get it for less than the price I have paid in beauty salons and free shipping to boot!!!</li>
            <li> and it smells good enough to eat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Must order more very soon.</li>
            <li> on return and am informed Amazon won&#x27;t take back the same hazardous material they were happy to have sent to</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it does deliver shine, which is great.</li>
            <li> Similar to the paul mitchell spray wax but so much more affordable!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and straight and this stuff just couldn&#x27;t make the grade.</li>
            <li> This really does nothing for my baby fine bobbed hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to give your hair a little lift at the end of your styling routine.</li>
            <li> I gave this to a friend who&#x27;s hair is fine, and always looks better the next day.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt feel sticky or gross in your hair and has amazing holding power.</li>
            <li> It also makes hair nice and glossy, which is a big plus in my book as my hair tends to be dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the staff use it every day for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does everything it should do for short hair..holds and shines without being stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Especially nice for silver hair too!&lt;br /&gt;Would definately recommend this product for texturizing.</li>
            <li> Love what I can do with my hair not sticky and the wind can not mess it up.</li>
            <li> All other reviews were good</li>
            <li> I was expecting a bigger bottle, when it arrived in the mail, but overall I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The item was received super fast.</li>
            <li> you want very light definition and to prevent frizzies on a short hairstyle, give it a try.</li>
            <li> I think part of the issue with my satisfaction is that I have fine soft hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what she just ran out of</li>
            <li> The first time I bought it, I found it at Target for $10 and tried it.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I prefer the sexy hair dry wax spray.</li>
            <li> , I am CERTAIN I clicked on the $4.99 seller version but</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and thin and the spray ensures it&#x27;s distributed evenly to give more fullness to my hair.</li>
            <li> This really helps me style my fine, very short hair.  </li>
            <li> Not much hold at all and spraying more really doesn&#x27;t seem to help.</li>
            <li> and she said the price ws reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT WORKS ON ALL THOSE PLACES THAT ARE CONTRARY AND DON&#x27;T WANT TO DO WHAT THE REST OF YOUR HAIR WANTS TO DO.  </li>
            <li> This hair spray keeps your hair in place until your man runs his fingers gently through it.  </li>
            <li> This seems to go fast</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I use it while Im still blowdrying/styling my hair to really &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the pieces of hair in the direction</li>
            <li> holds hair well, but cheap hairspray works the same.</li>
            <li> and this stuff really helps rock my style.  </li>
            <li> Works very well thanks</li>
            <li> I think I may have used too much.</li>
            <li> And I am going to re order this product very soon.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and then spray with this product for fullness and control and then use a light hairspray - cannot live without it!!!</li>
            <li> I have short asymmetrical hair and was excited to use this, but even though I have lots of hair</li>
            <li> Just got a pixie cut and this product took the look to a whole new level!</li>
            <li> Great for after I have just washed ,dried and curled my hair so it does not look dry!</li>
            <li> I love that I can buy it online and not have to track it down in stores/salons.</li>
            <li> Yes, \\&quot;Sexy Hair\\&quot; is a stupid brand name, but the products are great.</li>
            <li> Spray on very lightly; less is more with this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> AMAZING keeps hair in place w/o that hard hairspray look.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Even though it says Short Sexy Hair this spray can does wonders for my long curls.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t do my hair without it, especially the first day of washing it.</li>
            <li> used this for a few years and love it.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product, never liked something so much for my curls.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my short fine hair from looking so flat.</li>
            <li> This is the only spray wax that allows me to texturize my very fine hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I puchased this item and was pleasantly surprised to find that I purchased it for less than the beuty salon and recieved free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Much to heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I found it to be too heavy for my fine hair and because I don&#x27;t shampoo every day, it made my hair feel crusty.</li>
            <li> For fine I&#x27;d recommend the Cocky.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit gives my hair great texture and hold, but it doesn&#x27;t feel hard or crunchy.</li>
            <li> Whereas Quick Change has a nice slightly lemony smell, this spray has a very sweet fragrance that I would describe as sickly.</li>
            <li> This product works great but is like hairspray and with that being said it is too expensive for simply hairspray.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last the whole day without a touch up.</li>
            <li> Really does wonders with short hair!  </li>
            <li> Makes my thick, frizzy curly hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> I have been using Quick Change shaping balm for a few months and decided to see what the texturizing spray was like.</li>
            <li> I love it because I have flat thick hair, and when I curl it</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and like a carefree style - usually have a pixie cut or a short shag.</li>
            <li> I went from very long hair to very short hair, and when it is in that &amp;#34;in between cuts&amp;#34; stage, this is the only product I can find that keeps my hair looking natural (vs. plastered back) while keeping me from looking too much like Justin Bieber.</li>
            <li> and I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> Tried just about everything, but this separates and holds my &amp;#34;shaggy style&amp;#34;, and keeps it looking wild all day long!</li>
            <li> Its the only thing that controls my hair (summers with 100% humidity at 105 degrees is rough!), and keeps my hair lightweight, blowing in the breeze, no heavy sticky feeling that hairspray or gels leave</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to use too much as it can weigh down your hair.  </li>
            <li> Even though I was expecting a bigger bottle, this will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see this bottle lasting as long.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, and it gives your hair extra texture.</li>
            <li> It goes very flat if I haven&#x27;t shampooed.</li>
            <li> My hair is very flat and this sutff gives it some umph.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and I often curl it.  </li>
            <li> Even though my hair is short, you can&#x27;t use a lot of this, it makes your hair look wet.  </li>
            <li> Not often a product does exactly what you hopes - giving you a firm hold for messy styles.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff and sadly it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find!  </li>
            <li> Just spray a bit on your dry hair and style roughly with your fingertips...done!</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight hair in a longer pixie cut.</li>
            <li> If I had to suggest an alternative, I would suggest giving Redken&#x27;s Rough Paste a try.</li>
            <li> but I really do not like it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You might not even need to use any other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gives thin hair a new look.  </li>
            <li> Regular styling waxes are hard to work through hair evenly</li>
            <li> When the smell of a product is offensive, it&#x27;s hard to evaluate any further.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is the fragrance.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> Way to greasy and weighs hairs down .</li>
            <li> and it weighs it down</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very thin and straight</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always hard to find product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair go flat or limp after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to keep my hair messy, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Sticky and made my hair heavy and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> i have short thin hair and this gives it volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not appropriate for all hair types.</li>
            <li> a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> I spray a little on when just out of the shower and it keeps my short hair from going crazy.</li>
            <li> Hard to find item in Spokane..even at beauty supplies.</li>
            <li> I recommend the Play Dirty spray, which I&#x27;ve been using for a couple weeks on my short pixie-type hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Instead of adding any &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; to your hair, it just leaves a dirty residue visible and hair falls back into the &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; you were attempting to correct with the wax.</li>
            <li> I have especially thick, short hair</li>
            <li> Start out slowly</li>
            <li> Perhaps it would work well for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t go without this hair product.  </li>
            <li> Also its so not good for the ozone...</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t overspray or your hair will have that heavy, dirty feeling.  </li>
            <li> I like it because I hate damaging my hair with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Wonder what I&#x27;m doing wrong or  have I been duped?  </li>
            <li> This product is way too expensive and does not work for me.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly as it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I very thin hair and have been using this product for years.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be without my Play Dirty spray.</li>
            <li> And it makes your hair look dirty and textured</li>
            <li> but it makes my hair too stringy and too dirty.</li>
            <li> It has mad &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong?!</li>
            <li> It was a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair look anything but dirty!  </li>
            <li> The smell is horrible!  </li>
            <li> Just horrible.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> The smell for one thing is horrible!!!!</li>

            <li> I have fine smooth hair and I live in a dry climate. It goes very flat if I haven&#x27;t shampooed. If I spray this on my hair the second day after shampoo and scrunch, it makes waves. I have shoulder length hair so no short hair necessary.</li>
            <li> I found and ordered this for my neighbor.  She loves the product.  It&#x27;s exactly what she just ran out of and she said the price ws reasonable.  Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I originally found out about this stuff on pinterest for making the pefect wavy beach hair. The first time I bought it, I found it at Target for $10 and tried it. I loved it!! But ever since I ran out of that original bottle I havent been able to find it ANYWHERE. I was so happy to find it on amazon!</li>
            <li> Tried just about everything, but this separates and holds my &amp;#34;shaggy style&amp;#34;, and keeps it looking wild all day long!</li>
            <li> Love this spray! Just a little bit gives my hair great texture and hold, but it doesn&#x27;t feel hard or crunchy. The smell is pleasant, sort of like candy.</li>
            <li> Yes, \\&quot;Sexy Hair\\&quot; is a stupid brand name, but the products are great. I recommend the Play Dirty spray, which I&#x27;ve been using for a couple weeks on my short pixie-type hairstyle. I have been using Quick Change shaping balm for a few months and decided to see what the texturizing spray was like. Well, I love it! It delivers an ultra-fine mist that you can use to give your hair instant shape and definition. It also makes hair nice and glossy, which is a big plus in my book as my hair tends to be dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want very light definition and to prevent frizzies on a short hairstyle, give it a try. You might not even need to use any other products. For my hair, I&#x27;ve been applying a leave-in conditioner, then working through a dab of Quick Change balm and getting the shape I want, then spray a bit of this on top to keep the ends from straying as the hair drys and also to add that nice shine. In terms of value for money, the shaping balm is probably better value than the spray. I don&#x27;t see this bottle lasting as long. On the other hand, it does deliver shine, which is great. Also, it&#x27;s like an instant styler when you&#x27;re on the run. Just spray a bit on your dry hair and style roughly with your fingertips...done! Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the fragrance. Whereas Quick Change has a nice slightly lemony smell, this spray has a very sweet fragrance that I would describe as sickly. Some may love it, but I&#x27;m not a fan. Don&#x27;t let that put you off, though. Overall, a very nice product!</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible!  I had to throw it away!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t figure out what it does. Instructions say spray for hold and texture. I get neither. When I shake the can, I feel product  but I feel no difference on my hair after spraying it. Wonder what I&#x27;m doing wrong or  have I been duped?  Can&#x27;t return since I bought on line.</li>
            <li> Love the staff use it every day for my naturally curly hair. It&#x27;s better than hairspray.</li>
            <li> Great for short hair, not so good once your hair starts to grow out, but awesome for very short cuts.</li>
            <li> Even though it says Short Sexy Hair this spray can does wonders for my long curls.  It holds them together very nicely.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great for providing texture to your hair. My hair is very fine and thin and the spray ensures it&#x27;s distributed evenly to give more fullness to my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a lightweight, run your fingers through it kinda product!!  I use it on dry and pick it out for best look!</li>
            <li> AMAZING keeps hair in place w/o that hard hairspray look.  It lasts a long time, and it gives your hair extra texture.</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t go without this hair product.  I have long hair, and I often curl it.  This product smells amazing and gives my hair the right amount of texture (when tousled) to make my curls not so mary-jane.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not appropriate for all hair types. I have thin, straight hair in a longer pixie cut. I used this product once and knew it was not for me. Instead of adding any &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; to your hair, it just leaves a dirty residue visible and hair falls back into the &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; you were attempting to correct with the wax. Just horrible. If I had to suggest an alternative, I would suggest giving Redken&#x27;s Rough Paste a try.</li>
            <li> I really love this hair spray.  It has mad &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; a thing of the past.  I will never be without it and it smells good enough to eat.&lt;br /&gt;Gives thin hair a new look.  Must order more very soon.</li>
            <li> What a great deal! This is my favorite hair product and the cheapest that I&#x27;ve found it. I Received my order very quickly. I will definitely order again!!</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS FOR MY SPIKED HAIR STYLE.  NOT STICKY BUT WORKS ON ALL THOSE PLACES THAT ARE CONTRARY AND DON&#x27;T WANT TO DO WHAT THE REST OF YOUR HAIR WANTS TO DO.  GREAT STUFF!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is great for rockin&#x27; a pixie cut, hands down the best ever. Make sure you shake it VERY VERY well and don&#x27;t overspray your hair.</li>
            <li> This hair spray keeps your hair in place until your man runs his fingers gently through it.  He can&#x27;t resist the wonderful smell and neither will you.  A great product!</li>
            <li> This seems to go fast and I have very short hair. I think part of the issue with my satisfaction is that I have fine soft hair. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last the whole day without a touch up.</li>
            <li> I puchased this item and was pleasantly surprised to find that I purchased it for less than the beuty salon and recieved free shipping.  Verry pleased!</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a light hair spray.  Seems to dissipate into the air as soon as I spray it.  Not much hold at all and spraying more really doesn&#x27;t seem to help.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I really can&#x27;t do my hair without it, especially the first day of washing it. Love that its a wax in a spray!</li>
            <li> Keeps my short fine hair from looking so flat. Definitely adds some texture. The scent is a bit strong but worth it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to keep my hair messy, but not greasy.  This product does the trick incredibly!</li>
            <li> Much to heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and I really like it.  You have to be careful not to use too much as it can weigh down your hair.  I have especially thick, short hair and this does a great job of separating and giving my hair texture.</li>
            <li> Item was perfect!! This is the best product for short hair. Shipped fast! I would highly recommend. I love it!</li>
            <li> Who cares how cute your hair looks when you reek of cheap incense? Smell does not dissipate with time; persisted even after several hours; had to wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;Clicked on return and am informed Amazon won&#x27;t take back the same hazardous material they were happy to have sent to me.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, I am CERTAIN I clicked on the $4.99 seller version but somehow a $14.99 seller version ended up in my order box, which I didn&#x27;t realize until this can o&#x27; stank landed in my possession.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My hair is very flat and this sutff gives it some umph. I love this product and use it everytime I go out.</li>
            <li> I very thin hair and have been using this product for years.  I blow dry my hair and then spray with this product for fullness and control and then use a light hairspray - cannot live without it!!!</li>
            <li> Even though my hair is short, you can&#x27;t use a lot of this, it makes your hair look wet.  Also its so not good for the ozone...when i spray it in my bathroom, even with the fan on, it so smokes up the room.  Awful. But I still use it sometimes.  Would buy again, just will use in moderation.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but a little bit goes a long way. I was expecting a bigger bottle, when it arrived in the mail, but overall I am happy with the product. Even though I was expecting a bigger bottle, this will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> The description lists beeswax, rosewood oil, and aloe vera leaf juice as the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; ingredients. That would be nice and healthy, but the bottle lists some 20 ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce, beginning with Hydrofluorocarbon 152a, SD Alcohol 40-B (Alcohol Denat.), and Glycerin. Beeswax is only the 10th ingredient listed. If I knew about this chemical concoction, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this product. And it makes my hair too greasy.</li>
            <li> I love it. Similar to the paul mitchell spray wax but so much more affordable! Makes my thick, frizzy curly hair more manageable. I spray a little on when just out of the shower and it keeps my short hair from going crazy. I like it because I hate damaging my hair with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and sadly it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find!  I don&#x27;t have short hair, so don&#x27;t let the name fool you. It also makes my hair look anything but dirty!  This spray is a quick easy way to get frizzy flyaway hair tamed and to keep your hair styled without using tons of hairspray. Regular styling waxes are hard to work through hair evenly but this is easy to just spray lightly and evenly through your hair. I can&#x27;t be without my Play Dirty spray.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. It is supposed to add texture but I think it just kind of makes my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff helps me maintain curling iron curls without frizz and stiffness.  Just don&#x27;t overspray or your hair will have that heavy, dirty feeling.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product to use. I have fine hair that is thinning a bit as my life gets longer. This works great to keep static down and makes my hair pliable without looking greasy. I buy them in multiples.  :)</li>
            <li> I adore this hairspray.  I use it while Im still blowdrying/styling my hair to really &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the pieces of hair in the direction Id like them to fall in.  It doesnt feel sticky or gross in your hair and has amazing holding power.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair so it&#x27;s always hard to find product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair go flat or limp after an hour or so. This works for both styling and as a hairspray. You don&#x27;t have to use very much to get the perfect look.</li>
            <li> Not often a product does exactly what you hopes - giving you a firm hold for messy styles.  This is it.</li>
            <li> The perfect amount of hold. But also allows for movement.</li>
            <li> Sticky and made my hair heavy and unmanageable.  I prefer the sexy hair dry wax spray.</li>
            <li> holds hair well, but cheap hairspray works the same.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product, never liked something so much for my curls.  Adds life without making it crunchy.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite hair products! I love that I can buy it online and not have to track it down in stores/salons.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hairspray and makes hair sticky. Not for me again</li>
            <li> A hairdresser turned me onto this product.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky.  It gives me the ability to style my hair and make the layers show up.  I also like that it brushes out.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I just spray it on my hand and then tap my hands together until it gets tacky and then style my hair before putting on hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;Have used this for a few years and love it.</li>
            <li> This is the only spray wax that allows me to texturize my very fine hair without weighing it down. Will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> Just got a pixie cut and this product took the look to a whole new level! It adds the perfect amount of texture and it&#x27;s so easy to change styles! I could easily put the product in and style it one way and then change it up with adding a headband or some type of accessory. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is short.. growing back from chemo.. and this stuff really helps rock my style.  Love it.  Get yours!</li>
            <li> More like spray wax than hairspray but I love this product and use it more like a pomade.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love what I can do with my hair not sticky and the wind can not mess it up. Love it.</li>
            <li> Works very well thanks</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and like a carefree style - usually have a pixie cut or a short shag. This is my favorite hair \\&quot;spray\\&quot;. It keeps my styling all day but maintains that effortless look. I like the smell too. Spray on very lightly; less is more with this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the goods. My hair is fine and straight and this stuff just couldn&#x27;t make the grade.</li>
            <li> This really helps me style my fine, very short hair.  Just be sure to shake before using.  Great for texturizing.</li>
            <li> i have short thin hair and this gives it volume.&lt;br /&gt;i can spike or just have a fuller look to my style.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and was so pleased to see that I could get this from Amazon....&lt;br /&gt;It does everything it should do for short hair..holds and shines without being stiff.&lt;br /&gt;Especially nice for silver hair too!&lt;br /&gt;Would definately recommend this product for texturizing.</li>
            <li> The product took the shine out of my hair and I didn&#x27;t like the texture after use either - felt dirty.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t smell great either.&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> I gave this to a friend who&#x27;s hair is fine, and always looks better the next day.  She likes this.  I think I may have used too much.</li>
            <li> Great for after I have just washed ,dried and curled my hair so it does not look dry!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It gives my hair body !  And I am going to re order this product very soon.</li>
            <li> Great texturizing, and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This product is way too expensive and does not work for me. I actually prefer a mousse but thought I would give this a try because of all the rave reviews. I found it to be too heavy for my fine hair and because I don&#x27;t shampoo every day, it made my hair feel crusty.</li>
            <li> Hard to find item in Spokane..even at beauty supplies. Great price too!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to give your hair a little lift at the end of your styling routine. Start out slowly so you don&#x27;t &amp;#34;over wax&amp;#34; your hair -it&#x27;s easy to do if you&#x27;re not used to this product.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t one thing I liked about this product.  When the smell of a product is offensive, it&#x27;s hard to evaluate any further.  It was a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for approx 3 yes.  It has worked well to give my hair a&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;separated&amp;#34; look?</li>
            <li> Super product!  Really does wonders with short hair!  Spray it lightly on hair... run your hands through your hair and voila!</li>
            <li> Love this it gives me texture</li>
            <li> I love it because I have flat thick hair, and when I curl it I can spray it on and it gives my curl texture without all the hairspray!</li>
            <li> Love this spray!  I spike my hair up in the back and this spray helps keep everything where I want it!</li>
            <li> I went from very long hair to very short hair, and when it is in that &amp;#34;in between cuts&amp;#34; stage, this is the only product I can find that keeps my hair looking natural (vs. plastered back) while keeping me from looking too much like Justin Bieber.</li>
            <li> This product works great but is like hairspray and with that being said it is too expensive for simply hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it!!!  Gives a nice shine to your hair and makes it more managable.  Similar to hair spray but doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  I was able to get it for less than the price I have paid in beauty salons and free shipping to boot!!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this product. Its the only thing that controls my hair (summers with 100% humidity at 105 degrees is rough!), and keeps my hair lightweight, blowing in the breeze, no heavy sticky feeling that hairspray or gels leave</li>
            <li> I have a PIXIE and I LOVE this stuff! Does wonders for my short hair!!</li>
            <li> I have short asymmetrical hair and was excited to use this, but even though I have lots of hair it&#x27;s very thin and straight and this just gunked it up.</li>
            <li> Way to greasy and weighs hairs down . I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this to any one with fine hair. My hairs not even fine and it weighs it down</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work on my fine textured hair - no holding power.</li>
            <li> This really does nothing for my baby fine bobbed hair. Perhaps it would work well for thick hair.For fine I&#x27;d recommend the Cocky.</li>
            <li> I really wish I liked this product. I&#x27;ve used it numerous times and Tried to give it chance after chance but I really do not like it. The smell for one thing is horrible!!!! And it makes your hair look dirty and textured which is what it&#x27;s suppose to do but it makes my hair too stringy and too dirty. I don&#x27;t use a lot. I mostly spray at the ends to try to make it textured and stylish but it just doesn&#x27;t look good and it makes my hair look and feel greasy. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong?!</li>
            <li> I did not get the texturizing I wanted from this hair spray.  Regular hair spray would have done the same.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gives my short hair body and life that it never had before. It&#x27;s not sticky or weighty.</li>
            <li> Terrific product at an awesome price. The item was received super fast. I would do business with the excellent seller again!</li>
            <li> Product is excellent for short hair.  The shorter, the more lift you will get and you can shape the look you want easily. Use sparingly as it is expensive. Very satisfied. Discovered it as it was used in a hair salon I went to.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet, so I cannot rate product.  All other reviews were good so I hope my experience will be too.</li>
