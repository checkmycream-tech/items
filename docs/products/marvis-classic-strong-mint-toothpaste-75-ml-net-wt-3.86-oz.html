            <li>I bought this toothpaste expecting something amazing--</li>
            <li>I had received a sample of this toothpaste as a gift, and I quite liked it.</li>
            <li>So when I found it online at a good price, I was pleased.</li>
            <li>When I was a kid I loved Ultra Brite toothpaste, because the flavor was so strong it felt like it was doing a super-good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>but it is so much better tasting, much better for making your teeth &amp; mouth feel clean and it tastes really good.</li>
            <li>Love the design of the tube too.</li>
            <li>how many 18 year olds even comment on toothpaste?  </li>
            <li>They all taste great and really freshen your mouth.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking into this toothpaste, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve read about this stuff before.</li>
            <li>excellent toothpaste - leaves breathy minty fresh and excellent quality would highly recommend over other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I love the strong Mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste has a very nice and stong mint flavor as i expected and the packaging looks good as well.</li>
            <li>Like the reviews I read before deciding to buy, I find the taste and after-feel of this paste delightful; I want to try some of the other flavors too.</li>
            <li>In comparison, Ultra Brite no longer seemed strong at all</li>
            <li>It tastes great and doesn&#x27;t have the harshness of traditional toothpastes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth the price to me, I look forward to brushing my teeth now more.</li>
            <li>Your teeth will feel as clean and smooth as if you just came out from the dentist.</li>
            <li>i love this toothpaste so much!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, and has a wonderful, refreshing flavor that does not overpower, unlike other common brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great toothpaste, really makes your whole mouth feel crisp and clean.</li>
            <li>WoW, this toothpaste is amazing, i was told once i tried Marvis</li>
            <li>has a great taste, texture and doesnt feel like its full of chemicals like some other toothpastes on the market today.</li>
            <li>Marvis makes your teeth  and mouth feel so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It has a nice and strong minty taste and will make your breathe fresh for a long ime, it is like altoids but in toothpaste form.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel incredible after brushing with this paste, but not sure it is worth the price yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice mint flavor, but I expected &#x27;curiously strong&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Of course I have succeeded in finding an even pricier toothpaste than Rembrandt, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the $</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s like the difference between Tang and fresh squeezed orange juice.</li>
            <li>Can you really get excited about toothpaste?</li>
            <li>but i am willing to pay for the result it gives me.</li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s more expensive, but once you try it you won&#x27;t believe how much better it is.</li>
            <li>seems i dont need as much paste to lather up as before.</li>
            <li>changes your whole teeth brushing experience.</li>
            <li>It really is some of the strongest toothpaste I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes a cool gift idea too.</li>
            <li>He particularly likes the flavor.</li>
            <li>Ever was my 18 year old son&#x27;s review of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>And while the taste is pleasant and is certainly a \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; mint taste than regular toothpaste, it&#x27;s not a very strong taste (certainly not curiously strong) and it doesn&#x27;t last any longer than the minty taste of regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Other than the high price, the major drawback is that it contains parabens.</li>
            <li>How good or bad can a toothpaste be after all?</li>

            <li> When I was a kid I loved Ultra Brite toothpaste, because the flavor was so strong it felt like it was doing a super-good job of cleaning my teeth. For years now I&#x27;ve used Rembrandt whitening paste, but it&#x27;s pricey so I wanted something I could alternate with it. In comparison, Ultra Brite no longer seemed strong at all (guess my tastebuds have aged!) so I Googled &amp;#34;strong flavored toothpaste&amp;#34; and found Marvis. Of course I have succeeded in finding an even pricier toothpaste than Rembrandt, but so far I love it. Like the reviews I read before deciding to buy, I find the taste and after-feel of this paste delightful; I want to try some of the other flavors too. And a tiny bit goes a long way, so a tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is great toothpaste, really makes your whole mouth feel crisp and clean. It has a nice and strong minty taste and will make your breathe fresh for a long ime, it is like altoids but in toothpaste form. Yes it is expensive compared to the store bought over the counter brands but it is so much better tasting, much better for making your teeth &amp; mouth feel clean and it tastes really good. Does not have a \\&quot;burn\\&quot; or \\&quot;sting\\&quot; alot of people get from OTC toothpaste. I just recently purchased the Aquatic Mint flavor so I will write a review once I use that. I will continue to use Marvis Toothpaste as my \\&quot;Go To\\&quot; toothpaste.. A+ toothpaste and A+ odor/flavor all the way..great purchase..try it out for yourself, you will not be dissapointed..</li>
            <li> WoW, this toothpaste is amazing, i was told once i tried Marvis i would not use anything else, i must say that person was spot on. i do not think i will go back to colgate any time soon. Marvis makes your teeth  and mouth feel so clean and fresh. A little more expensive but i am willing to pay for the result it gives me. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Based on what I read, I expected it to be stronger in flavor and effect. It&#x27;s a nice mint flavor, but I expected &#x27;curiously strong&#x27;.</li>
            <li> has a great taste, texture and doesnt feel like its full of chemicals like some other toothpastes on the market today. Love the design of the tube too. its a little pricey but it might last longer than other toothpastes. seems i dont need as much paste to lather up as before.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brand, says its also got a good taste, this one is the best flavor out of the others</li>
            <li> My teeth feel incredible after brushing with this paste, but not sure it is worth the price yet. Also not clear if it contains fluoride ( which I don&#x27;t want), site says it does but I don&#x27;t see it listed as an ingredient.</li>
            <li> Best Toothpaste Ever was my 18 year old son&#x27;s review of this toothpaste.  That is a ringing endorsement!  how many 18 year olds even comment on toothpaste?  He particularly likes the flavor.</li>
            <li> I really have nothing bad to say about any of Marvis toothpastes. They all taste great and really freshen your mouth. I want to say I buy all of them except the licorice.......do they have licorice? I think they do and I don&#x27;t care for licorice but all the others are great. They even have mouthwash, which is my next purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste expecting something amazing--I&#x27;d heard such rave reviews of Marvis toothpaste that I figured, what the heck, let&#x27;s try it. And while the taste is pleasant and is certainly a \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; mint taste than regular toothpaste, it&#x27;s not a very strong taste (certainly not curiously strong) and it doesn&#x27;t last any longer than the minty taste of regular toothpaste. I&#x27;m not so impressed that I need to buy another tube.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a very nice and stong mint flavor as i expected and the packaging looks good as well.</li>
            <li> i wish amazon would sell this in bulk! i love this toothpaste so much! you ate something with onions? no worries this toothpaste will kill the smell. my gums feel better and a lot healthier feeling teeth!</li>
            <li> Besth toothpaste ever! I found it in Europe and was happy I was able to purchase here in the States! Worth the $</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of this toothpaste as a gift, and I quite liked it. So when I found it online at a good price, I was pleased. The problem was that the vendor shipped it in an envelope, so the box was flattened and the tube somewhat mangled. It wasn&#x27;t broken, and with a little massaging it looked just fine. (I wasn&#x27;t keeping the box anyway.) But given the careless way it was shipped, it could have been a minty mess. I&#x27;ll still use the toothpaste, even if it is a bit pricey, but I&#x27;ll order it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> excellent toothpaste - leaves breathy minty fresh and excellent quality would highly recommend over other toothpastes. A cut above the rest</li>
            <li> How good or bad can a toothpaste be after all? This stuff is amazing! It tastes great and doesn&#x27;t have the harshness of traditional toothpastes. Admittedly, it is hard to articulate with words, but just try it . . . . changes your whole teeth brushing experience.</li>
            <li> Can you really get excited about toothpaste? In the case of Marvis, I think so.  This stuff is great, and has a wonderful, refreshing flavor that does not overpower, unlike other common brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never thought you would consider paying $11 for a tube of toothpaste? Well the time has come. You will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like the difference between Tang and fresh squeezed orange juice. Sure it&#x27;s more expensive, but once you try it you won&#x27;t believe how much better it is.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking into this toothpaste, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve read about this stuff before. It really is some of the strongest toothpaste I have ever tried. I don&#x27;t smoke, but I could imagine it would work well for smothers breath... Definitely makes a cool gift idea too.</li>
            <li> Provides for a nicer mouthfeel post brush, and has a very nice feel on the teeth. I use it with a sonic toothbrush and it works great. The price may seem like a bit compared to other brands, but when you&#x27;re only using a pea sized amount each time it isn&#x27;t breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the price to me, I look forward to brushing my teeth now more. Looking towards trying the other flavors!</li>
            <li> I have been using Marvis for a few years now.  I love the strong Mint flavor.  When I have to use another brand, I am sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Once you brush your teeth with this toothpaste you will feel a big difference when compared to regular brands. Your teeth will feel as clean and smooth as if you just came out from the dentist. Other than the high price, the major drawback is that it contains parabens.</li>
