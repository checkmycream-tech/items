            <li>The results were phenomenal!  </li>
            <li>And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had spectacular results with the Monoi Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li>It added a shine that I really liked.</li>
            <li>I had read many good reviews about both products before purchasing.  </li>
            <li>However, the one that shipped from amazon doesn&#x27;t smell as nice.  </li>
            <li>now i know how jada pinkett-smith keeps her hair looking shiny, healthy, and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It was nice to find something that works for me.</li>
            <li>While the product adds temporary shine, and while it smells great, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it until I decided to use to flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li>*, this balm is nice to have but more of a take it or leave it level product for me.</li>
            <li>I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it makes her braids look really nice and her hair looks healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>love, love, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I have been using the Elixir for 2years and its great as a hot oil.</li>
            <li>it is very light.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s very light.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product just fine.  </li>
            <li>I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff</li>
            <li>I have never been able to keep moisture in my hair overnight.</li>
            <li>I do admit in most cases it&#x27;s been user error.</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I am giving it a 5 because it has been better than anything else</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I am giving it a 5 because it has been better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I use the hair butter/ Marguerite&#x27;s magic to twist out.</li>
            <li>Love this for my hair.</li>
            <li>the way I love it..</li>
            <li>that isn&#x27;t necessarily my favorite, but its not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>this hair balm works well as a leave in conditioner to minimize frizz, add amazing shine and smooth the hair when drying the hair under a dome dryer (I don&#x27;t know how well it would work by blow drying as I stopped using blow dryers).</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I have this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for quite some time as a daily moisturizer for my hair and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I love the Hair Balm.  </li>
            <li>Smells ok , sticky and waxy.</li>
            <li>Their are better products out there for biracial hair</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s an OK product</li>
            <li>It keep my dreads looking healthy and a shine, the smell...even better.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Well first let me say that shipping took FOR-EV-ER!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got that sweet almond oil scent with a mix of some of the greatest natural scents.</li>
            <li>but it was a good read loved it and would look for similar</li>
            <li>So far it has been a week and its great.</li>
            <li>Wow, this hair balm is great, my hair drinks it in.</li>
            <li>The contents work great for relaxed and natural hair.</li>
            <li>Very light for the hair and absorbs quickly so it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this item from HSN it had an amazing scent.  </li>
            <li>they are all fine except some</li>
            <li>I am caucasian and have fine, wavy (often frizzy) hair</li>
            <li>It works great on my short, relaxed hair to keep it shiny and smooth all day.  </li>
            <li>it manages my fly aways so well and actually maintains my hair longer in between salon visits.  </li>
            <li>I was excited about purchasing this product along with the elixir.  </li>
            <li>It also had a pleasant scent that wasn&#x27;t overwhelming like some of the other carol&#x27;s daughter products.</li>
            <li>The hair balm is perfect for my thick permed hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a super hydrating hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really for moisturizing, but it gives your hair amazing shine!  </li>
            <li>I am becoming a hair product junkie as much as I try not to be.  </li>
            <li>great product, with exception of the consistency could be more solid and in a different container.</li>
            <li>I love it its not heavy its perfect because my hair is thick and Kinky .Just</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, has a nice fragrance, and you don&#x27;t need much product to achieve soft, conditioned, moisturized hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I had put a little more effort and research into the products&#x27; usage the results would have improved.  </li>
            <li>Great for African American hair.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, it did moisturize my hair, but it is a little heavy, and not too pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li>If you do buy with Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixir, you&#x27;ll only be able to use one at a time.</li>
            <li>pomade works pretty well with my hair.</li>
            <li>This is my first CD product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products and I&#x27;m so glad I found this one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though the product (that I received from HSN) does a great job keeping my dry hair hydrated--more especially in the winter--and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I sectioned her hair in large sections and applied the hair balm with my fingers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m transitioning from a relaxer to a natural state, and my hair has been really the dry, but since I&#x27;ve been using CD&#x27;s hair balm I must say that I loving the way my hair looks and feel.</li>
            <li>i juct cant figure out why it cost so much here,its $9 at target and on the Carols daughter website</li>
            <li>It was a dissapointment, because I was really looking forward to trying these products.</li>
            <li>I did not have as much shrinkage with this product.</li>
            <li>really like this product.  </li>
            <li>also line is very pricey.</li>
            <li>Additionally, this product can be greasy if one applies too much.</li>
            <li>I used it with the organic root stimulator and the two products work very well together for my flexi set.  </li>
            <li>It adds nice shine and tames the frizz and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy, making it feel healthier to the touch.</li>
            <li>This product made the hairs lay down on the rod nicely, made my hair feel weightless, the curls did not frizz when I separated them, and the curls were soft!</li>
            <li>Works better than any of the other products I ordered.</li>
            <li>My hair looks just a little shinier and felt more silky.</li>
            <li>Smells okay, leaves the hair a little more manageable, a little shinier but not bowled over with the results.</li>
            <li>I use it on my little man&#x27;s hair, too :)  </li>
            <li>but the line changes so much and so frequently that one can&lt;br /&gt;never</li>
            <li>I love the heavy weight of the hair balm.</li>
            <li>I have mixed hair - a combination of fine, Indian hair and coarse, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>A friend recommended this hair balm to me and I haven&#x27;t used a new hair product since.</li>
            <li>If I apply this on completely dry hair, it makes my hair feel more dry.</li>
            <li>As a Caucasian woman with dry skin and dry, frizzy hair, Carol&#x27;s Daughter Products have been a favorite of mine for ages.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use a lot or it&#x27;ll weigh my hair down, but I really enjoy everything about the product.</li>
            <li>The only thing this was good for was adding shine to my dry hair, but that didn&#x27;t last very long, either.</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that it&#x27;s a natural hair product.</li>
            <li>Old - One of my daughters has eczema</li>
            <li>B00634THEM Organic Root Stimulator Hairepair Vital Oils for Hair and Scalp, 4.3 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>No problem with smell, it&#x27;s a natural smell.</li>
            <li>It not only moisturizes my hair really well, but I loooooooove the smell.</li>
            <li>I have transitioned to Natural hair and as soon as i placed the Hair balm on my hair it was receptive.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by a friend when I decided to go natural.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m natural.</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair moisturized for a while, much longer than some products that actually say that it will keep your hair moisturized.</li>
            <li>It just works really well to keep my hair looking nice and moisturized all day (not dried out), especially in the harsh winters, despite using the flat iron almost daily.  </li>
            <li>and it is pretty dry.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural, fine, and curly to slightly frizzy - tends to be fragile too which has improved considerably with the shampoo+conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a loose wavy/curly pattern, but because my hair is so long and thick the weight of my hair tends to pull down on the top of my hair causing the top part to be straighter....</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very easy to comb, helps hold it in place and isn&#x27;t heavy and weighed down.  </li>
            <li>So far the only thing that has worked for her is the Nature&#x27;s Natural Carrot oil from House of Nubian.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and moisturized but be careful because too much will leave it a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>Outside of the salon, MY HAIR HAS NEVER BEEN SO SOFT!  </li>
            <li>Finally, I think this product would be too much for fine thin hair; but should be ok for someone with thick or coarse hair.</li>
            <li>This is unusual for me because I totally wet by hair each morning in order to add moisture.  </li>
            <li>But, then other products too much comes out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to really penetrate the hair and scalp so that you could probably use this product every other day (rather than every day).  </li>
            <li>I have stored the bottle upside down in order to remove it&#x27;s contents, but most of the oil seeps through and I am left with the dried remains.</li>
            <li>( I recently began to transition back to natural hair).</li>
            <li>There are so many expensive natural products out there.</li>
            <li>I typically have to run it under hot water to get it out especially when it gets low.</li>

            <li> I was excited about purchasing this product along with the elixir.  </li>
            <li> It also had a pleasant scent that wasn&#x27;t overwhelming like some of the other carol&#x27;s daughter products.</li>
            <li> The hair balm is perfect for my thick permed hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a super hydrating hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really for moisturizing, but it gives your hair amazing shine!  </li>
            <li> I am becoming a hair product junkie as much as I try not to be.  </li>
            <li> great product, with exception of the consistency could be more solid and in a different container.</li>
            <li> I love it its not heavy its perfect because my hair is thick and Kinky .Just</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light, has a nice fragrance, and you don&#x27;t need much product to achieve soft, conditioned, moisturized hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I had put a little more effort and research into the products&#x27; usage the results would have improved.  </li>
            <li> Great for African American hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, it did moisturize my hair, but it is a little heavy, and not too pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> If you do buy with Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixir, you&#x27;ll only be able to use one at a time.</li>
            <li> pomade works pretty well with my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first CD product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products and I&#x27;m so glad I found this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall though the product (that I received from HSN) does a great job keeping my dry hair hydrated--more especially in the winter--and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I sectioned her hair in large sections and applied the hair balm with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning from a relaxer to a natural state, and my hair has been really the dry, but since I&#x27;ve been using CD&#x27;s hair balm I must say that I loving the way my hair looks and feel.</li>
            <li> i juct cant figure out why it cost so much here,its $9 at target and on the Carols daughter website</li>
            <li> It was a dissapointment, because I was really looking forward to trying these products.</li>
            <li> I did not have as much shrinkage with this product.</li>
            <li> really like this product.  </li>
            <li> also line is very pricey.</li>
            <li> Additionally, this product can be greasy if one applies too much.</li>
            <li> I used it with the organic root stimulator and the two products work very well together for my flexi set.  </li>
            <li> It adds nice shine and tames the frizz and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy, making it feel healthier to the touch.</li>
            <li> This product made the hairs lay down on the rod nicely, made my hair feel weightless, the curls did not frizz when I separated them, and the curls were soft!</li>
            <li> Works better than any of the other products I ordered.</li>
            <li> My hair looks just a little shinier and felt more silky.</li>
            <li> Smells okay, leaves the hair a little more manageable, a little shinier but not bowled over with the results.</li>
            <li> I use it on my little man&#x27;s hair, too :)  </li>
            <li> but the line changes so much and so frequently that one can&lt;br /&gt;never</li>
            <li> I love the heavy weight of the hair balm.</li>
            <li> I have mixed hair - a combination of fine, Indian hair and coarse, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended this hair balm to me and I haven&#x27;t used a new hair product since.</li>
            <li> If I apply this on completely dry hair, it makes my hair feel more dry.</li>
            <li> As a Caucasian woman with dry skin and dry, frizzy hair, Carol&#x27;s Daughter Products have been a favorite of mine for ages.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use a lot or it&#x27;ll weigh my hair down, but I really enjoy everything about the product.</li>
            <li> The only thing this was good for was adding shine to my dry hair, but that didn&#x27;t last very long, either.</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that it&#x27;s a natural hair product.</li>
            <li> Old - One of my daughters has eczema</li>
            <li> B00634THEM Organic Root Stimulator Hairepair Vital Oils for Hair and Scalp, 4.3 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> No problem with smell, it&#x27;s a natural smell.</li>
            <li> It not only moisturizes my hair really well, but I loooooooove the smell.</li>
            <li> I have transitioned to Natural hair and as soon as i placed the Hair balm on my hair it was receptive.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend when I decided to go natural.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m natural.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair moisturized for a while, much longer than some products that actually say that it will keep your hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> It just works really well to keep my hair looking nice and moisturized all day (not dried out), especially in the harsh winters, despite using the flat iron almost daily.  </li>
            <li> and it is pretty dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural, fine, and curly to slightly frizzy - tends to be fragile too which has improved considerably with the shampoo+conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a loose wavy/curly pattern, but because my hair is so long and thick the weight of my hair tends to pull down on the top of my hair causing the top part to be straighter....</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very easy to comb, helps hold it in place and isn&#x27;t heavy and weighed down.  </li>
            <li> So far the only thing that has worked for her is the Nature&#x27;s Natural Carrot oil from House of Nubian.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and moisturized but be careful because too much will leave it a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> Outside of the salon, MY HAIR HAS NEVER BEEN SO SOFT!  </li>
            <li> Finally, I think this product would be too much for fine thin hair; but should be ok for someone with thick or coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This is unusual for me because I totally wet by hair each morning in order to add moisture.  </li>
            <li> But, then other products too much comes out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to really penetrate the hair and scalp so that you could probably use this product every other day (rather than every day).  </li>
            <li> I have stored the bottle upside down in order to remove it&#x27;s contents, but most of the oil seeps through and I am left with the dried remains.</li>
            <li> ( I recently began to transition back to natural hair).</li>
            <li> There are so many expensive natural products out there.</li>
            <li> I typically have to run it under hot water to get it out especially when it gets low.</li>
            <li> Just as I was about to chop my hair off into a pixie, due to the fact that it was unmanageable, this hair balm gave me soft, shiny waves.</li>
            <li> For the past 2 months, I have used the Hair Balm on a daily basis and my hair is healthy, thick and shiny.</li>
            <li> However, if I add or mix this balm with a decent hair moisturizer it helps to maintain softness in my hair for a few hours.</li>
            <li> (Paul Mitchell Sleek Works) when flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t last long at all!  </li>
            <li> Secondly, I feel this balm helps seal in moisture as opposed to add moisture to dry hair.</li>
            <li> 19 Month Old - A few days later I washed the 19 month-old&#x27;s hair and used the balm on her scalp and braided her hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for months, and I&#x27;ve been using it to add shine to my natural, tightly curled hair.  </li>
            <li> I applied a little of this product to my roots and worked it into my scalp and &amp;#34;WA LA&amp;#34; comb goes through and hair stays soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of old school hair dress or \\&quot;grease\\&quot; but it&#x27;s not a strong scent and wears off.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been working my way through several other products in the CD line.</li>
            <li> I use the balm daily or every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with locks and use this product every other day now.</li>
            <li> Applied to dry hair it freshens my waves a bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to flat iron natural afro hair, but this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> It works well when my hair is wet, damp or dry.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, this did not help my very dry hair at all, and did nothing for my texture.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Me - I added a little water to my 4b/c hair and sectioned the hair and added the balm (I deep conditioned 2 days ago).</li>
            <li> I am 4c btw, so I have the worst hair situation ever, lol.</li>
            <li> This smells like Skin So Soft, which I have never liked, so that was already a turn-off.  </li>
            <li> I have very short hair, and it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy or too heavy feel.</li>
            <li> on her scalp while her hair was still wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as thick as a Vaseline type product but just a tiny amount warmed on my hands and then run through my hair gives just enough on the strands to make a difference.</li>
            <li> The bottle is stiff so when you get to the last bit, you have to devise ways to scrape it out rather than squeeze it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of this product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Also you only need a very little.</li>
            <li> I am not too fond of the smell and it overpowers the other products that I use.  </li>
            <li> I tried a curling iron and by the time I finished one side of my head the curls on the other side would already be falling out, so after lots of research I found flexi rods.  </li>
            <li> I did the wet set with just leave in and the organic root simulator and the results were &amp;#34;Meh&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> I use it for blowing drying and once a day or once every other day to maintain.  </li>
            <li> so I have to be very careful about what I put on her hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have very dry hair and just a little bit of it</li>
            <li> *really* thick - not what I personally would call a *liquid* pomade.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product after a week as it DOES way down the hair and produces a flaky itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I&#x27;m black with relaxed shoulder length hair and</li>
            <li> I use less than the size of a dime</li>
            <li> My hair would become so dry and tangle and hard to comb through at the roots.</li>
            <li> I was half expecting it to be too heavy as it is</li>
            <li> I use a little every morning.</li>
            <li> a little goes a loooooong way and</li>
            <li> Remember all you need is a little.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair balm for a little over a week, and I must say &amp;#34;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy</li>
            <li> a little goes a loooong way</li>
            <li> and I could have gotten the same results with other less expensive products.</li>
            <li> This really dried my daughters scalp.</li>
            <li> i waste my money</li>
            <li> It is solid and becomes thin liquid when you rub on your hands.</li>
            <li> By using this small amount, my hair did not feel weighed down.  </li>
            <li> and I have very thick and long ethnic hair.  </li>
            <li> The hair balm is thick and it does weigh down the hair.</li>
            <li> A little!</li>
            <li> A very little goes a looonnnggg way.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply it when my hair is still damp, and then I comb it through and wrap it with a doo rag for the night.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I usually have a lot of shrinkage.</li>
            <li> usually like carol&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This product is greasy even when using small amounts.  </li>
            <li> Way too thick and heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> It has a very heavy smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremly thick and shoulder length, and a dime-size amount covered every square inch after combing it through.  </li>
            <li> But even so, with my relatively thick hair, the greasiness feeling dissipates within an hour.</li>
            <li> It can be a little difficult to get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The smell is not good either.</li>
            <li> I twisted my hair in about 7 twists and wrapped it with a satin scarf and went to bed.</li>
            <li> this shipment was definitely weird.</li>
            <li> Although I like this product, it is often difficult to remove the contents from the bottle.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter.  The hair balm is perfect for my thick permed hair.  A little goes a long way.  Makes my hair very easy to comb, helps hold it in place and isn&#x27;t heavy and weighed down.  Very nice scent also.</li>
            <li> I liked this product just fine.  I have very short hair, and it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy or too heavy feel. I usually apply it when my hair is still damp, and then I comb it through and wrap it with a doo rag for the night.  I will order this again. Works better than any of the other products I ordered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for months, and I&#x27;ve been using it to add shine to my natural, tightly curled hair.  While the product adds temporary shine, and while it smells great, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with it until I decided to use to flat iron my hair.  Outside of the salon, MY HAIR HAS NEVER BEEN SO SOFT!  It&#x27;s so hard to flat iron natural afro hair, but this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, it did moisturize my hair, but it is a little heavy, and not too pleasant smelling. I do like the fact that it&#x27;s a natural hair product.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff i juct cant figure out why it cost so much here,its $9 at target and on the Carols daughter website</li>
            <li> The hair balm is thick and it does weigh down the hair. The smell is not good either. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month or so now and I could have gotten the same results with other less expensive products. It was a dissapointment, because I was really looking forward to trying these products. If you do buy with Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixir, you&#x27;ll only be able to use one at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had spectacular results with the Monoi Shampoo and Conditioner so I&#x27;ve been working my way through several other products in the CD line. My hair is natural, fine, and curly to slightly frizzy - tends to be fragile too which has improved considerably with the shampoo+conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pomade works pretty well with my hair. I was half expecting it to be too heavy as it is *really* thick - not what I personally would call a *liquid* pomade. It&#x27;s almost as thick as a Vaseline type product but just a tiny amount warmed on my hands and then run through my hair gives just enough on the strands to make a difference. My hair looks just a little shinier and felt more silky. Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I think the shampoo+conditioner are for me beauty *essentials*, this balm is nice to have but more of a take it or leave it level product for me. Smells okay, leaves the hair a little more manageable, a little shinier but not bowled over with the results.</li>
            <li> I am becoming a hair product junkie as much as I try not to be.  This is my first CD product. When I was transitioning the reviews were so mixed on the products so I didn&#x27;t try them because of the costs.&lt;br /&gt;I was in Target and I saw this hair balm on the shelf and I thought it would be a good idea to try it on my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 3 Year Old - One of my daughters has eczema so I have to be very careful about what I put on her hair. I washed and conditioned her hair. I put the [[ASIN:B00634THEM Organic Root Stimulator Hairepair Vital Oils for Hair and Scalp, 4.3 Ounce]] on her scalp while her hair was still wet. I sectioned her hair in large sections and applied the hair balm with my fingers. It added a shine that I really liked. I braided her hair and it held the moisture with a shine. She did not scratch her scalp or have any discomfort. Thank goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 19 Month Old - A few days later I washed the 19 month-old&#x27;s hair and used the balm on her scalp and braided her hair. I was very pleased with the result. I tied her hair up with a scarf when she woke up the next morning her braids looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me - I added a little water to my 4b/c hair and sectioned the hair and added the balm (I deep conditioned 2 days ago). I twisted my hair in about 7 twists and wrapped it with a satin scarf and went to bed. When I woke up I was very happy with the moisture in my hair. I have never been able to keep moisture in my hair overnight. I do admit in most cases it&#x27;s been user error. This product was not too greasy. My hair had a shine. I then spritzed water on my hair and styled for work. This is unusual for me because I totally wet by hair each morning in order to add moisture.  Therefore, I usually have a lot of shrinkage. I did not have as much shrinkage with this product. I plan to try the Mimosa Hair Honey next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- It can be a little difficult to get it out of the bottle. But, then other products too much comes out.&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t like the $10 price. But, when a product works it works. This is currently working for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product. So glad I purchased it. I am giving it a 5 because it has been better than anything else I have tried.n&#x27;t like the $10 price. But, when a product works it works. This is currently working for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product. So glad I purchased it. I am giving it a 5 because it has been better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was excited about purchasing this product along with the elixir.  I had read many good reviews about both products before purchasing.  Let me just say for me, personally speaking, the products are too greasy.  I have mixed hair - a combination of fine, Indian hair and coarse, curly hair.  I&#x27;m sure if I had put a little more effort and research into the products&#x27; usage the results would have improved.  I believe this is still a great product, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it makes her braids look really nice and her hair looks healthy and moisturized. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Love it. Keeps my hair from getting fuzzy.</li>
            <li> Is good, I&#x27;m very happy when I use my hair look super goood</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the hair Elixir. I have been using the Elixir for 2years and its great as a hot oil. I decided to try the balm for daily shine and softness. I like it. I use a little every morning. A little! So far it has been a week and its great. I prefer using this on my twists versus the hair milk. I use the hair butter/ Marguerite&#x27;s magic to twist out. Then to refresh shine I use the balm daily or every other day. Cheers.</li>
            <li> I brought this product from Sally&#x27;s and tried it on my hair. ( I recently began to transition back to natural hair). My hair would become so dry and tangle and hard to comb through at the roots. I applied a little of this product to my roots and worked it into my scalp and &amp;#34;WA LA&amp;#34; comb goes through and hair stays soft and shinny. And to think I almost didn&#x27;t get it. Also you only need a very little. a little goes a loooooong way and Im talking a dime size amount. I also doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> really like this product.  it is very light.  usually like carol&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;product but the line changes so much and so frequently that one can&lt;br /&gt;never get the same product when it runs out. also line is very pricey.</li>
            <li> great product, with exception of the consistency could be more solid and in a different container. No problem with smell, it&#x27;s a natural smell.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this hair balm to me and I haven&#x27;t used a new hair product since. It not only moisturizes my hair really well, but I loooooooove the smell. It&#x27;s got that sweet almond oil scent with a mix of some of the greatest natural scents. If I wasn&#x27;t so concerned about the well-being of my hair, I&#x27;d used it as a body balm.</li>
            <li> always loved this a really great read who would have known. but it was a good read loved it and would look for similar</li>
            <li> I have transitioned to Natural hair and as soon as i placed the Hair balm on my hair it was receptive. Very good product. Love this for my hair.I love it its not heavy its perfect because my hair is thick and Kinky .Just the way I love it..</li>
            <li> The Hair balm smells really good but it didn&#x27;t work for my daughter&#x27;s hair. My daughter has 3C-4C hair that eats up moisture. This really dried my daughters scalp. There are so many expensive natural products out there. So far the only thing that has worked for her is the Nature&#x27;s Natural Carrot oil from House of Nubian. I mix it with virgin melted Coconut oil and that does the trick. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My daughter and I both have very dry hair and just a little bit of it does the job. It leaves your hair soft and moisturized but be careful because too much will leave it a bit greasy.  I use Carol&#x27;s Daughter products regularly and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair, and used this product as a replacement for my heat serum (Paul Mitchell Sleek Works) when flat ironing my hair.  The results were phenomenal!  Not only was my hair sleek and glossy after straightening, my curls did not fall (even after wrapping my hair),and I also did not expereince the usual hot iron smell that is left on my hair after using my CHI of FHI irons. The smell of the hair balm reminds me of loc wax (honey scent) that isn&#x27;t necessarily my favorite, but its not overpowering.  Remember all you need is a little.  My hair is extremly thick and shoulder length, and a dime-size amount covered every square inch after combing it through.  By using this small amount, my hair did not feel weighed down.  Adjust as needed for hair length and thickness.  Works great with hair milk (as blow drying lotion) and khoret amen hair oil.</li>
            <li> for some reason this bottle is not like the others I have been using this product for 4 years and this is a different color and did not smell the same. this shipment was definitely weird.</li>
            <li> This Product was as advertised and it  reached in good time.I am very satisfied with this Carol&#x27; Daughter.This is real good for the hair, and it gives it a real nice shine.for my shoulder lenth hair. Every one should try thisi</li>
            <li> Firstly, I&#x27;m black with relaxed shoulder length hair and this hair balm works well as a leave in conditioner to minimize frizz, add amazing shine and smooth the hair when drying the hair under a dome dryer (I don&#x27;t know how well it would work by blow drying as I stopped using blow dryers). Secondly, I feel this balm helps seal in moisture as opposed to add moisture to dry hair. If I apply this on completely dry hair, it makes my hair feel more dry. However, if I add or mix this balm with a decent hair moisturizer it helps to maintain softness in my hair for a few hours. I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a super hydrating hair moisturizer. Anyway, I&#x27;m glad I have this product. Additionally, this product can be greasy if one applies too much. But even so, with my relatively thick hair, the greasiness feeling dissipates within an hour. Finally, I think this product would be too much for fine thin hair; but should be ok for someone with thick or coarse hair. UPDATE: I stopped using this product after a week as it DOES way down the hair and produces a flaky itchy scalp. I&#x27;ll pass on this one! If I could change the rating, I would only give this product a 2-star. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works great on my short, relaxed hair to keep it shiny and smooth all day.  A little bit of this product goes a long way.  It seems to really penetrate the hair and scalp so that you could probably use this product every other day (rather than every day).  It is greasy when applying the product, but it seems to be just what my hair needs once its actually in my hair.  My hair does not feel greasy or slippery to the touch after using this product.  It just works really well to keep my hair looking nice and moisturized all day (not dried out), especially in the harsh winters, despite using the flat iron almost daily.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products and I&#x27;m so glad I found this one.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.  4 stars only because of the greasy feel when applying it, however, it doesn&#x27;t feel like grease in your hair once applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite some time as a daily moisturizer for my hair and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this item from HSN it had an amazing scent.  However, the one that shipped from amazon doesn&#x27;t smell as nice.  The smell from this product smells like a smoking muffler…YES. THAT. BAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though the product (that I received from HSN) does a great job keeping my dry hair hydrated--more especially in the winter--and shiny.  I use less than the size of a dime and I have very thick and long ethnic hair.  If you are looking for a product to keep your hair shiny, hydrated, without weighing it down…then look no further, this is IT!</li>
            <li> Wow, this hair balm is great, my hair drinks it in. I love the heavy weight of the hair balm.</li>
            <li> I have recently bleached my hair was warned that it must remain properly conditioned. For the past 2 months, I have used the Hair Balm on a daily basis and my hair is healthy, thick and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love the Hair Balm.  It&#x27;s not really for moisturizing, but it gives your hair amazing shine!  And I believe it softens your hair.  A very little goes a looonnnggg way.  In fact, I might use a dime size amount for my entire head. Just squirt a drop, rub it between your hands and rub through.  I use it on my little man&#x27;s hair, too :)  The smell reminds me of old school hair dress or \\&quot;grease\\&quot; but it&#x27;s not a strong scent and wears off.  I use it for adding shine to 2nd or 3rd day curls.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Mother and she loves it.</li>
            <li> they are all fine except some i waste my money so i will not be getting nothing else for my phone from here</li>
            <li> wonderful product, woulld like to find more products by carol&#x27;s daughter.  I would recommend carol&#x27;s daughter for friends and family.</li>
            <li> My fav hair oil/balm, thank you carols daughter and Amazon for the great deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair balm for a little over a week, and I must say &amp;#34;I&#x27;m very impressed with the results&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m transitioning from a relaxer to a natural state, and my hair has been really the dry, but since I&#x27;ve been using CD&#x27;s hair balm I must say that I loving the way my hair looks and feel.</li>
            <li> Very light for the hair and absorbs quickly so it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is greasy even when using small amounts.  I am not too fond of the smell and it overpowers the other products that I use.  After using this product I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the overall moisture of my hair.</li>
            <li> This hair balm was not oily or greasy. It made my hair feel soft and shiny. It also had a pleasant scent that wasn&#x27;t overwhelming like some of the other carol&#x27;s daughter products.</li>
            <li> love, love, LOVE this product! it&#x27;s light, has a nice fragrance, and you don&#x27;t need much product to achieve soft, conditioned, moisturized hair. i bought this to use with &#x27;lisa&#x27;s hair elixir&#x27; oil, and they&#x27;re both wonderful! now i know how jada pinkett-smith keeps her hair looking shiny, healthy, and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Smells ok , sticky and waxy. Their are better products out there for biracial hair</li>
            <li> The bottle is stiff so when you get to the last bit, you have to devise ways to scrape it out rather than squeeze it. The contents work great for relaxed and natural hair.</li>
            <li> Well first let me say that shipping took FOR-EV-ER!!!  That&#x27;s where my problem with this product lies!  As soon as I received this I ran in and started in on my hair!  I used it with the organic root stimulator and the two products work very well together for my flexi set.  I have a loose wavy/curly pattern, but because my hair is so long and thick the weight of my hair tends to pull down on the top of my hair causing the top part to be straighter....hence me wanting flexi rods!  I tried a curling iron and by the time I finished one side of my head the curls on the other side would already be falling out, so after lots of research I found flexi rods.  I did the wet set with just leave in and the organic root simulator and the results were &amp;#34;Meh&amp;#34;!  I had lots of frizz especially when separating the curls and it didn&#x27;t last long at all!  This product made the hairs lay down on the rod nicely, made my hair feel weightless, the curls did not frizz when I separated them, and the curls were soft!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. I am caucasian and have fine, wavy (often frizzy) hair and it is pretty dry. I put just a tiny bit of this in my hand, rub my palms together, and then run it through my hair. It adds nice shine and tames the frizz and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy, making it feel healthier to the touch. It works well when my hair is wet, damp or dry. Applied to dry hair it freshens my waves a bit. I can&#x27;t use a lot or it&#x27;ll weigh my hair down, but I really enjoy everything about the product. And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Although I like this product, it is often difficult to remove the contents from the bottle. I have stored the bottle upside down in order to remove it&#x27;s contents, but most of the oil seeps through and I am left with the dried remains. I often find myself using the handle of a rattail comb in order to use the product.</li>
            <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughter products have worked well for my hair, so I have been using this product for over a year.  Couldn&#x27;t find it at the local store any longer. Happy to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use on the scalp.  It is a little greasy so if you don&#x27;t like that this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> It has a very heavy smell. But it&#x27;s an OK product overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Mimosa Hair Honey the best.</li>
            <li> As a Caucasian woman with dry skin and dry, frizzy hair, Carol&#x27;s Daughter Products have been a favorite of mine for ages. This one is by far the best. Just as I was about to chop my hair off into a pixie, due to the fact that it was unmanageable, this hair balm gave me soft, shiny waves. The smell is reminiscent of the discontinued, and dearly missed, scent of Groove.</li>
            <li> All it takes is a dime size to give your hair a great shine without feeling greasy.  Great for African American hair.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend when I decided to go natural. I do like it. It is lite. My only problem is that it can be a challenge to get it out of the bottle. It is solid and becomes thin liquid when you rub on your hands. I typically have to run it under hot water to get it out especially when it gets low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with locks and use this product every other day now. I use to use the oil sheen, and the oil spray but this product have it beat big time! It keep my dreads looking healthy and a shine, the smell...even better. A product that can add shine and fragrance!! I now get them to send me a bottle every month. I&#x27;m sold for life now.</li>
            <li> This smells like Skin So Soft, which I have never liked, so that was already a turn-off.  Furthermore, this did not help my very dry hair at all, and did nothing for my texture.  The only thing this was good for was adding shine to my dry hair, but that didn&#x27;t last very long, either.</li>
            <li> My Hair loves this. I was transitioning when I bought this and now I&#x27;m natural. My hair STILL loves this. I was reluctant to buy it because I was just starting to try products and figure out what works and what doesn&#x27;t. It was nice to find something that works for me. I am 4c btw, so I have the worst hair situation ever, lol. This keeps my hair moisturized for a while, much longer than some products that actually say that it will keep your hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> Way too thick and heavy for my hair. Had a very gritty feel as well. Was not a fan of the smell either. Will not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Loved this product, have been using it for a couple years now and I dont know what I have done without it.  it manages my fly aways so well and actually maintains my hair longer in between salon visits.  I use it for blowing drying and once a day or once every other day to maintain.  Love it.  a little goes a loooong way</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair balm for years.  I love that it&#x27;s very light.  Plus it last forever.</li>
