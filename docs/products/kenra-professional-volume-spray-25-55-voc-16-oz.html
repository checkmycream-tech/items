            <li>Kenra Volume Spray 16oz does an excellent job keeping one&#x27;s hair in place, and is practically odorless.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to my family members and friends and they all have been pleased as well.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent and hold.  </li>
            <li>It makes me feel like I know what I am doing with my hair :)</li>
            <li>I always bought this at the salon and paid a lot more.  </li>
            <li>It is a large can, smells very nice, and mom loves it.</li>
            <li>It holds very well without looking like your hair has been varnished, and it smells good, too.</li>
            <li>Easy to brush out.</li>
            <li>Great hairspray that provides good hold without getting sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li>even afer 12 hours, her hair was just as amazing as when she first arrived.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be my solution to fine hair.</li>
            <li>When I use this it holds my fine hair and when I want to come through it</li>
            <li>For baby fine hair, this spray is a must.</li>
            <li>Best hairspray I have ever used, just a little pricey.</li>
            <li>A woman at work had fabulous curls ..</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I purchased it when arriving home in MA from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>, this hairspray holds up great, isnt sticky nor does it leave your hair feeling hard and its gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Well..I tried it and she was so right !</li>
            <li>Great price compared to other stores.  </li>
            <li>giving the look of amazing soft beach hair even after 12 grueling hours in a demanding and fast paced work environment.  </li>
            <li>The product holds without being stiff and is just the ticket for continuious great looking style.</li>
            <li>and she swore her hair was limp and fine but that this spray was the ticket to fabulous hair.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>Tried everything (rubbing alcohol, straight pin, changed nozzle), nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if this were a $5 can of hairspray, but for this much expect to use every drop.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>Nice soft firm hold.  </li>
            <li>but I will buy the ten ounce next time because this 16 ounce can is too large to easily hold.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Kenra Volume Spray 25.</li>
            <li>Of course, the price is kind of ridiculous -- over $20 a can.</li>
            <li>But for some reason, it didn&#x27;t feel or hold the same the first time trying the product.  </li>
            <li>I bought the exact same item</li>
            <li>it is a little difficult to hold when spraying - but overall a great product!</li>
            <li>I have really fine limp hair, where even the slightest humidity will make it go flat</li>
            <li>This stuff holds like no other.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and I use hot rollers and follow with a gentle spritz of Volume spray when I remove the rollers..</li>

            <li> It goes on almost completely dry, and it&#x27;s way stronger than all the hairsprays that my hair cutter uses.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel a bit sticky and dry.  </li>
            <li> and she beats the in-store prices hands down every time.</li>
            <li> I also noticed it weighs down my hair too.  </li>
            <li> I would also recommend the Kenra #9 lighter spray for everyday use.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 5 years at least.</li>
            <li> This has serious hold</li>
            <li> Sorry, Kenra, but that cost you 1 star.</li>
            <li> Terrible shipping!</li>

            <li> Great product! Terrible shipping! Do better!</li>
            <li> Great hairspray that provides good hold without getting sticky or stiff.  My only issue is the can is a so big it is a little difficult to hold when spraying - but overall a great product!</li>
            <li> A very strong holding spray. I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff holds like no other. It goes on almost completely dry, and it&#x27;s way stronger than all the hairsprays that my hair cutter uses. And I&#x27;ve tried them all, since she lets me make myself presentable before I leave, while she&#x27;s cleaning up. Of course, the price is kind of ridiculous -- over $20 a can. Sorry, Kenra, but that cost you 1 star.</li>
            <li> Hairspray works great.  Shipping was fast.  However, after using about a third of the can, product stopped spraying.  Tried everything (rubbing alcohol, straight pin, changed nozzle), nothing worked.  Wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if this were a $5 can of hairspray, but for this much expect to use every drop.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray I have ever used, just a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Only worked 2 days then clogged...... i have tried everything to get it to work</li>
            <li> Best hairspray out there. This has serious hold and I&#x27;ve used it for a finishing spray at weddings. We were in Seattle with humidity and light rain and wind and all the bridesmaids hair and bride&#x27;s hair stayed in place perfectly. I would also recommend the Kenra #9 lighter spray for everyday use. It smells really good too!</li>
            <li> Kenra Volume Spray 16oz does an excellent job keeping one&#x27;s hair in place, and is practically odorless.  The 16oz can is a great value for the money.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A woman at work had fabulous curls ..even afer 12 hours, her hair was just as amazing as when she first arrived. I asked her about her hair care and she swore her hair was limp and fine but that this spray was the ticket to fabulous hair. Well..I tried it and she was so right ! My hair is thick and I use hot rollers and follow with a gentle spritz of Volume spray when I remove the rollers..giving the look of amazing soft beach hair even after 12 grueling hours in a demanding and fast paced work environment.  The product holds without being stiff and is just the ticket for continuious great looking style.</li>
            <li> The item was sent very quickly and the hairspray is great but I will buy the ten ounce next time because this 16 ounce can is too large to easily hold.</li>
            <li> Just scan that barcode on the bottom of your makeup ladies and then choose the best deal on Amazon.  I do it all of the time for all of my wifes makeup needs and she beats the in-store prices hands down every time. Do it!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST hairspray I have ever used and believe me I have tried many.....even the ones from my hair salon!  I have recommended it to my family members and friends and they all have been pleased as well.  I highly recommend Kenra Volume Spray 25.</li>
            <li> Use &amp; there is no build up on your hair; holds well &amp; helps style your hair at the same time--good product!</li>
            <li> I have used Kenra volume spray and find it to be the best hair spray I&#x27;&#x27;ve ever tried.  Other brands claim the same results but they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Using this for years...expensive but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair matted.  Holds your style without looking like you have hairspray on your hair.  I have been using for 5 years at least.</li>
            <li> Nice soft firm hold.  Not sticky.  Easy to brush out.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY HAIR SPRAY I WILL USE!</li>
            <li> Have used Kenra products for years. Have tried others but always come back!</li>
            <li> I used this product while vacationing in Texas and I was very happy with how it held my style with the humidity.  I liked it so much I purchased it when arriving home in MA from Amazon.  Great price compared to other stores.  But for some reason, it didn&#x27;t feel or hold the same the first time trying the product.  I bought the exact same item so I am not sure why. It makes my hair feel a bit sticky and dry.  I also noticed it weighs down my hair too.  I have tried only spraying under the hair and not over which helps a bit.  Bottom line though is I will not purchase again for this price.  I was hoping it would be my solution to fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and hold.  It makes me feel like I know what I am doing with my hair :)</li>
            <li> love this hairspray!  I have really fine limp hair, where even the slightest humidity will make it go flat, this hairspray holds up great, isnt sticky nor does it leave your hair feeling hard and its gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li> When I use this it holds my fine hair and when I want to come through it I can without pulling my hair out.  Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I always bought this at the salon and paid a lot more.  The only spray that works for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best spray ever!  For baby fine hair, this spray is a must. Would recommend it highly! Love it!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my mom&#x27;s hair dresser for her. It is a large can, smells very nice, and mom loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray!  It holds very well without looking like your hair has been varnished, and it smells good, too.</li>
