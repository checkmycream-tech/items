    <ol>
            <li>now I&#x27;m very happy with</li>
            <li>Awesome shave</li>
            <li>Great safety razor!</li>
            <li>, the Merkur 34C fits perfectly in the Mingshi travel case.</li>
            <li>This is a very good razor for the money.</li>
            <li>Great value for the price.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;  Great,  quality razor for the money.  </li>
            <li>works great and shaves like i remember shaving when i was a kid.</li>
            <li>It shaves great (as great as the blades you use) and I&#x27;ve had no problems with the weight.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Decent razor for a great price.</li>
            <li>Great beginner model.  </li>
            <li>For the money, it was a great value.</li>
            <li>If this razor works for you, it&#x27;s a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not that good</li>
            <li>Pop a good quality blade in there</li>
            <li>Seems to be as good as the quality of the $20-ish variants from W-Mart and T-Get.  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I get more mileage from the safety razor!  </li>
            <li>Since the Merkur travel case costs $15 on its own, it is actually a better deal to buy the Mighsi-l with the case for $10, throw out the shaver, then use the case for the Merkur 34C!</li>
            <li>The razor itself, is nice looking and works</li>
            <li>When I first opened the box I was hopeful; the plastic case looks nice and is a great way to store the razor.</li>
            <li>but it is very light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the performance of this razor</li>
            <li>It is ok for the money</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>Very much pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>In addition to that there&#x27;s the outrageously high price of replacement cartridges, the environmental impact of tons of plastic and metal ending up in the trash, and a shave that is not all that great anyway.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it because I wanted a butterfly mechanism and the mechanism on this razor is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It was easy to fix.</li>
            <li>well well made smooth shave.</li>
            <li>No nicks and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It costs more, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I found that because I am more accustomed to a heavier razor I exerted a bit more effort in shaving than what is normal for me.  </li>
            <li>It cuts though the 4 days worth of stubble, no problem!</li>
            <li>I am a pretty experienced double edge user</li>
            <li>Great starter model if you want to see if single blade safety razor is right for you.</li>
            <li>I now regularly use a more refined and heavier Merkur that has better build quality but also cost 5 times the Ming Shi.</li>
            <li>butterfly doors on this model are very cool.&lt;br /&gt;The stainless-steel design makes this razor fairly easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it is much too light weight for my taste.</li>
            <li>Finally decided to give it a try now that I acutely have a reason to shave.  </li>
            <li>However, I can say this razor works terrific; the travel case is a nice plus, and having used this about 2 months</li>
            <li>My rating of 5 stars is based on it&#x27;s value and being a good starter razor to learn with, plus it comes with a travel case that can accommodate other razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived today and I used it right out of the  box.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a safety razor again because I am tired of the escalating &amp;#34;Blade Wars,&amp;#34; as if adding more and more blades makes for a better shave.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>The first couple of shaves</li>
            <li>Much higher price, but would not be a throw-away item.</li>
            <li>Then for the next 25 years I used disposables, mostly BIC brand.  </li>
            <li>, I forgot how good it feels to have a heavy razor in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I knew when I purchased this razor that it had a short handle, but it&#x27;s still a good razor, especially at this price.</li>
            <li>another positive note</li>
            <li>the disposable razors are all becoming a one time only product.  </li>
            <li>The chrome plating is very light and rough on the doors, looking like the metal underneath was not quite finished before plating.</li>
            <li>Had I been a bit more careful, this could have been avoided.  </li>
            <li>razor DID give me the confidence that I could manage an old-fashioned safety razor without much</li>
            <li>like the travel case, which is very handy.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I just purchased the light yellow version for my 14 year old son as his first razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve the use the first one 6 times so far.</li>
            <li>The plastic case was nice to store the razor and spare blades; it also came with a small mirror.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp blades, I will need more practice to not nick my neck.</li>
            <li>I do recommend using the classic style shaving brush to apply shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor as a backup and not as my main shaving instrument.</li>
            <li>I used one of these through my high school and college years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve nicked myself nearly every time I used this poduct, and gotten very severe razor burn.</li>
            <li>right like I did with my standard multiple-blade razors.</li>
            <li>it is easy to install the blades and comes with enough to last several months.</li>
            <li>The Merkur,  on the other hand, let me take multiple passes that were as smooth as a knife through butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it, but mainly to those with smaller hands than mine.  </li>
            <li>I do not like gold and was a little concerned about light yellow</li>
            <li>t was a de-facto standard back then, with genuine &#x27;Gillette&#x27; razors and other accessories.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was due to being a novice at using a saftey razor.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the razor would not stay tightened as it was one of the lower priced razors, but it has worked just fine despite a few &amp;#34;nicks&amp;#34; due to my inexperience.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Adequate as a spare comes with terrible blades do not use them. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Tried this type of razor when I was a kid, using my Grandfathers.  Finally decided to give it a try now that I acutely have a reason to shave.  Works well just go slow.</li>
            <li> I decided to go back to basics and the style of razor that I started out shaving with.  I&#x27;m using a safety razor again because I am tired of the escalating &amp;#34;Blade Wars,&amp;#34; as if adding more and more blades makes for a better shave.  In addition to that there&#x27;s the outrageously high price of replacement cartridges, the environmental impact of tons of plastic and metal ending up in the trash, and a shave that is not all that great anyway.  I&#x27;m pleased with the performance of this razor and I would recommend it, but mainly to those with smaller hands than mine.  I knew when I purchased this razor that it had a short handle, but it&#x27;s still a good razor, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> not that good but i like the case</li>
            <li> I agree with the comment &amp;#34;not bad at all. &amp;#34;  Great,  quality razor for the money.  Pop a good quality blade in there and it is money well spent.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> works great and shaves like i remember shaving when i was a kid.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the complaints about this razor.  It shaves great (as great as the blades you use) and I&#x27;ve had no problems with the weight.  Having never used a Merker razor I can&#x27;t compare.  However, I can say this razor works terrific; the travel case is a nice plus, and having used this about 2 months now I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Decent razor for a great price.</li>
            <li> Great beginner model.  Love it!  For the money, it was a great value. Seems to be as good as the quality of the $20-ish variants from W-Mart and T-Get.  Came with four blades.  I&#x27;ve the use the first one 6 times so far. I&#x27;ve heard you can use each blade up to 10 times, but why!?!  You can find 5-packs of blades in the local drug store for $2.00.  The first couple of shaves I noticed a bit of razor burn.  I do recommend using the classic style shaving brush to apply shaving cream. I also suggest watching a YouTube video on how to use a safety razor.  This razor works!  I did not have to go up and down and left and right like I did with my standard multiple-blade razors. The plastic case was nice to store the razor and spare blades; it also came with a small mirror.  Great starter model if you want to see if single blade safety razor is right for you.</li>
            <li> It says &amp;#34;light yellow&amp;#34; but it looks like chrome to me. When I first opened the box I was hopeful; the plastic case looks nice and is a great way to store the razor. But then I took out the razor and gave the handle a twist to open the butterfly doors, and one of the doors fell off! It was easy to fix. Just a minor bend adjustment to the hinge-pin, but it made a bad first impression - that should not have happened. The chrome plating is very light and rough on the doors, looking like the metal underneath was not quite finished before plating. Well, I got what I paid for, maybe less. I have not shaved with it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try it eventually and likely keep it as a backup, but I am looking really hard at either a Mercur or Parker. Much higher price, but would not be a throw-away item.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a backup and not as my main shaving instrument. It is ok for the money but it is very light and I like a heavier razor for my beard.  I originally bought it because I wanted a butterfly mechanism and the mechanism on this razor is pretty good. That said, I did experience a couple of nicks with this one.  I am a pretty experienced double edge user and I found that because I am more accustomed to a heavier razor I exerted a bit more effort in shaving than what is normal for me.  As a consequence my shaving rhythm was thrown off and I got a couple of nicks.  Had I been a bit more careful, this could have been avoided.  Nevertheless, I was not very comfortable with this razor and would not buy another one.  The razor itself, is nice looking and works ok.  But it is much too light weight for my taste.</li>
            <li> works well well made smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This was my introduction to wet shaving. I purchased this razor after studying up on the subject and reading reviews. My rating of 5 stars is based on it&#x27;s value and being a good starter razor to learn with, plus it comes with a travel case that can accommodate other razors. I now regularly use a more refined and heavier Merkur that has better build quality but also cost 5 times the Ming Shi. I still rely on the Ming Shi as my travel and camping razor. I just purchased the light yellow version for my 14 year old son as his first razor. I do not like gold and was a little concerned about light yellow, it just has a very faint yellowish tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Great value&lt;br /&gt;Ability to adjust how aggressive you want the blade angle.&lt;br /&gt;Ideal starter razor. Allows you to try wet shaving with minimal investment and you can adjust the blade to be less aggressive for the beginner.&lt;br /&gt;Travel case that holds blades, can accommodate different razors, and has a built in mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Cheezy packaging, at least on one side, almost comical.&lt;br /&gt;Included blades are unfamiliar and likely inferior to a Shark or Derby.</li>

            <li> I used one of these through my high school and college years.  t was a de-facto standard back then, with genuine &#x27;Gillette&#x27; razors and other accessories.  Then for the next 25 years I used disposables, mostly BIC brand.  However, recently, the pricess of disposables have gone through the roof with rather mediocre quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived today and I used it right out of the  box.  Awesome shave, I forgot how good it feels to have a heavy razor in your hand.  It cuts though the 4 days worth of stubble, no problem! This is a very good razor for the money. I only wish the handle was a bit longer.  Maybe the next purchase.</li>
            <li> DE Razor newbie - seems to be what I needed.  No nicks and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back into the safety razor game for a number of reasons.  I hate the idea of all those plastic disposable razors in landfills (next to the lighters) and the disposable razors are all becoming a one time only product.  I get more mileage from the safety razor!  I was concerned that the razor would not stay tightened as it was one of the lower priced razors, but it has worked just fine despite a few &amp;#34;nicks&amp;#34; due to my inexperience.</li>
            <li> Great safety razor! it is easy to install the blades and comes with enough to last several months. Very sharp blades, I will need more practice to not nick my neck. Before using these, I recommend looking up some wet shaving videos on youtube to find the proper technique.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to get into wet shaving and to save money by moving away from the Mach 3 shaving system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD POINTS:&lt;br /&gt;This razor DID give me the confidence that I could manage an old-fashioned safety razor without much difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;I like the travel case, which is very handy.&lt;br /&gt;The butterfly doors on this model are very cool.&lt;br /&gt;The stainless-steel design makes this razor fairly easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;The price cannot be beaten. If this razor works for you, it&#x27;s a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVES:&lt;br /&gt;This razor is simply not heavy enough for wet shaving. I&#x27;ve nicked myself nearly every time I used this poduct, and gotten very severe razor burn. At first, I thought it was due to being a novice at using a saftey razor. However, I recently upgraded to a Merkur 34C, and the difference is astounding.&lt;br /&gt;Merkur 34C blows this Mingshi model out of the water: Merkur is heavier, but the head angles the blade slightly for a safer AND closer shave. When I took a second pass with the Mingshi, it would nick me or give me razor burn each time. The Merkur,  on the other hand, let me take multiple passes that were as smooth as a knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go with Merkur. It costs more, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another positive note, the Merkur 34C fits perfectly in the Mingshi travel case. Since the Merkur travel case costs $15 on its own, it is actually a better deal to buy the Mighsi-l with the case for $10, throw out the shaver, then use the case for the Merkur 34C!</li>
