            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>w SPF, bio-oil, and Calendula lotion which I think is truly amazing!</li>
            <li>I am going to keep using them until they are almost gone :P</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product with great ingredients to combat scars and wounds.</li>
            <li>The cream feels good on my face and I am already seeing results.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I remember.</li>
            <li>it is good product.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how good this stuff works.</li>
            <li>The scar  is  looking good and fading.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>I am already very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love the product but the smell is not so pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>The results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I honestly, didn&#x27;t think this cream would work.</li>
            <li>so I can leave an honest review.</li>
            <li>I still have a while to go, but very happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>Ended up going to the dermatologist and he gave me something better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy with how fast it&#x27;s eradicating them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be more intensive, and I always use the scar removal for my face skin cancer removals at night.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this product would work better than it is advertised, but not for me.</li>
            <li>Amazon price is better, but you can buy it anywhere.</li>
            <li>Vitamin E works better than this.</li>
            <li>So just make sure  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Notice no change at all,  the gel works much better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to put too many layers on so it could penetrate.</li>
            <li>But I want to make sure it has the opportunity to work.</li>
            <li>The bottle is almost done and my scars on my back is 90-95% gone how awesome is that.  </li>
            <li>and I have more confidence in wearing what I want to now.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>but surely I notice the difference and so have others.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I expect both scars to look A LOT better 6 months from now!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there is nerve damage.</li>
            <li>It would probably help even more</li>
            <li>It definitely seems to be working, be patient and you should be able to see some great results in a hand full of weeks.</li>
            <li>I bought two more tubes because, for me, it&#x27;s been worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for 6 weeks now and am so happy with the results it&#x27;s had in my acne scars.</li>
            <li>works really well...been using Mederma products for many years...</li>
            <li>Good price.sells for few dollars more at drug stores.</li>
            <li>This works phenomenally well, even on older skin wound marks</li>
            <li>its worth</li>
            <li>Used right away on scar once skin no longer had a sore.</li>
            <li>But if you are just looking for something new to try and slowly fade out the scars, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>the scare has lighted more than 50 percent and its light pink now!</li>
            <li>IT actually works as advertised, my surgery scare is getting better.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well, my scar on my hand it going away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure on light-skinned folks, this cream will definitely diminish the scarring.</li>
            <li>One thing i would like to point out for everyone and this probably goes for every skin type is that make sure you apply the creme only on the scar</li>
            <li>but if I were I would probably see better results than what I&#x27;m currently seeing.</li>
            <li>I have a scar from some hot oil that burned my skin on my forearm.</li>
            <li>I did not see any improvement on my brown skin after consistent use.</li>
            <li>I think it works the same as the Mederma 1x, just more costly.</li>
            <li>One must be patient and consistent.</li>
            <li>I have a burn scar on my arm from a hot pan and a scar on my hand from a cut,I have been applying it every night for 2 weeks now and the scars are lightening up and fading gradually.</li>
            <li>recommend it,I used the standard Mederma before and this stuff works much better.</li>
            <li>Just be consistent..</li>
            <li>My scars are going away; -)</li>
            <li>Has a funny onion smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it was the cause of it, but it certainly didn&#x27;t help ;)</li>
            <li>There are cheaper products on the market, but I&#x27;ve used Mederma often with good results, in the past.</li>
            <li>but I just used a large bandage and Neosporin on it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this cream on my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; scar for only a week now, and I can already notice a huge difference in the healing of my scar.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at Target, and it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>and it really has made a difference on the acne scars I had in my face.</li>
            <li>Really haven&#x27;t seen much of a change.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>they are all really well formulated</li>
            <li>it is really waist..</li>
            <li>Thank you to the merdema company for making this product really helps my acne scars I saw resulta in a week.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This product has so much fragrance that I couldn&#x27;t use it for the scar on my neck.  </li>
            <li>Why on earth would they put so much fragrance in a scar cream??</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference</li>
            <li>Truly I had tried almost everything, and didn&#x27;t expect much results.</li>
            <li>It really helped it reduce.</li>
            <li>The doctor who put in stitches kind of left a lump of skin above my eye once the stitches came out.  </li>
            <li>I used this for about two months (not even every night) and the red mark is significantly lighter.</li>
            <li>I did not have high expectations from this cream either, but it really DOES WORK.</li>
            <li>and I already I&#x27;ve been able to see my dark spots gets lighter.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t speak for older scars.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended by my pharmacy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream for scars.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li>also started using it on other scars that are more than 10 years old</li>
            <li>My scar looks a little better</li>
            <li>made scar fade after whole bottle of use, but need another bottle to complete fading</li>
            <li>It really helps clear up scars every morning I notice a difference.</li>
            <li>No improvement in scar over my normal healing</li>
            <li>It is better than gel, because it last long in the skin.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for me on a relatively new scar.</li>
            <li>Discontinuing and trying a new product</li>
            <li>It was as if new skin was &amp;#34;forming&amp;#34; (</li>
            <li>I have some scars that I want to get rid of and at first I was thrown off how tiny the tube is.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased as I have &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pictures and am anxious to take &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; pics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you are at all sensitive to fragrance don&#x27;t purchase this product!  </li>
            <li>The product claims to reduce the visibility of scars after 8 weeks on new scars and 3-6 months on old scars.</li>
            <li>Used on old and new scars.  </li>
            <li>I applied nightly to my acne scars, both new and old, for about a month.</li>
            <li>My impression so far is that it works pretty well for acne scars (especially the ones on my chin).</li>
            <li>After many months of finally healing, it turned black and I have no feeling in the area.</li>
            <li>The scar was about a month old when I started using the cream.</li>
            <li>This scars were from acne and they were a year old.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed much if any further improvement, but I did buy another tube</li>
            <li>Very pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I put it on as the last layer I won&#x27;t peel as much?</li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t been two months like the cream suggests for old scars.  </li>
            <li>In any case, I&#x27;ve been using the day &amp; night Mederma creme &amp; so far I am not seeing any changes.</li>
            <li>and I am an adult.</li>
            <li>But so far I&#x27;ve had no breakouts whatsoever.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if the scar disappears completely.</li>
            <li>you do!&lt;br /&gt;needs to come with a free service to have someone come over at night when you&#x27;re tired &amp; just wanna go to sleep, who will rub it on for you, so you can just go to sleep not go wash it off your hands first...</li>
            <li>Cream has not worked yet, and the tube is only half filled.</li>
            <li>I used this product for a couple of weeks, and you can barely see the scar, and the skin bump is completely gone.</li>
            <li>The scar appearance went back to normal once I stopped.</li>
            <li>The regular Mederma worked on a very stubborn deep tissue scar I had.</li>
            <li>I had shoulder surgery 14 months ago and you can barely see my scar!</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried bleaching it using several different products but all it did was make the scar smooth, shiny and look like a patch of dark brown patent leather.  </li>
            <li>The scar has faded, not entirely yet, but I can see clear improvement.</li>
            <li>Now it is almost gone, I can barely notice I have something,  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve been using this Mederma PM for a month and barely seen a lightening of the scar.</li>
            <li>I have been applying this cream on several spots, including acne scars on my face, and surgical scars (that is 2.5 years old).</li>
            <li>My minor scars are fading, slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this and the day cream religiously for about 2 weeks and my burn/puncture scars are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>And obviously as time passes ur scars will get worse and theres a greater chance it will permanently stay on you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>stopped using the product for a little bit and notice that my scar doesn&#x27;t look a whole lot</li>

            <li> It really helps clear up scars every morning I notice a difference.</li>
            <li> No improvement in scar over my normal healing</li>
            <li> It is better than gel, because it last long in the skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me on a relatively new scar.</li>
            <li> Discontinuing and trying a new product</li>
            <li> It was as if new skin was &amp;#34;forming&amp;#34; (</li>
            <li> I have some scars that I want to get rid of and at first I was thrown off how tiny the tube is.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased as I have &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pictures and am anxious to take &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; pics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you are at all sensitive to fragrance don&#x27;t purchase this product!  </li>
            <li> The product claims to reduce the visibility of scars after 8 weeks on new scars and 3-6 months on old scars.</li>
            <li> Used on old and new scars.  </li>
            <li> I applied nightly to my acne scars, both new and old, for about a month.</li>
            <li> My impression so far is that it works pretty well for acne scars (especially the ones on my chin).</li>
            <li> After many months of finally healing, it turned black and I have no feeling in the area.</li>
            <li> The scar was about a month old when I started using the cream.</li>
            <li> This scars were from acne and they were a year old.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed much if any further improvement, but I did buy another tube</li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I put it on as the last layer I won&#x27;t peel as much?</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t been two months like the cream suggests for old scars.  </li>
            <li> In any case, I&#x27;ve been using the day &amp; night Mederma creme &amp; so far I am not seeing any changes.</li>
            <li> and I am an adult.</li>
            <li> But so far I&#x27;ve had no breakouts whatsoever.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if the scar disappears completely.</li>
            <li> you do!&lt;br /&gt;needs to come with a free service to have someone come over at night when you&#x27;re tired &amp; just wanna go to sleep, who will rub it on for you, so you can just go to sleep not go wash it off your hands first...</li>
            <li> Cream has not worked yet, and the tube is only half filled.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a couple of weeks, and you can barely see the scar, and the skin bump is completely gone.</li>
            <li> The scar appearance went back to normal once I stopped.</li>
            <li> The regular Mederma worked on a very stubborn deep tissue scar I had.</li>
            <li> I had shoulder surgery 14 months ago and you can barely see my scar!</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried bleaching it using several different products but all it did was make the scar smooth, shiny and look like a patch of dark brown patent leather.  </li>
            <li> The scar has faded, not entirely yet, but I can see clear improvement.</li>
            <li> Now it is almost gone, I can barely notice I have something,  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been using this Mederma PM for a month and barely seen a lightening of the scar.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this cream on several spots, including acne scars on my face, and surgical scars (that is 2.5 years old).</li>
            <li> My minor scars are fading, slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this and the day cream religiously for about 2 weeks and my burn/puncture scars are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> And obviously as time passes ur scars will get worse and theres a greater chance it will permanently stay on you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> stopped using the product for a little bit and notice that my scar doesn&#x27;t look a whole lot</li>
            <li> My friend is a medical professional and said that the active ingredient is actually a steroid.</li>
            <li> and I have applied it to my 3 year old&#x27;s new scar every single night for the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had tiny scars on my shoulder for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I am on my second purchase for a scar about 2 ft long.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re desperate I&#x27;d say definitely go for it :)</li>
            <li> The shiny area actually began to dull and started matching my surrounding normal skin.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, I used it more than once a day because I was desperate to see results.  </li>
            <li> So I finally came around to purchasing mederma, and a month later my dark spots have lightened up and my face improved drastically.</li>
            <li> This helped a post cyst scab/scar nearly disappear after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Acne scars faded but not completely gone yyet.</li>
            <li> My doc said the skin takes a really long time to heal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having problems with scars on my back due to pimples since I could remember...</li>
            <li> Recommended using a q tip and placing only on scar as it can be drying to other areas.</li>
            <li> One reviewer had said that it has the same active ingredients as chapstick.</li>
            <li> (My wife is Asian and has dark skin, so the scarring is noticeable, but the sutures have almost disappeared.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple products for scars including the dark scar removal from proactive, nothing I used worked.</li>
            <li> I already finished with the product it still have the same dark spot</li>
            <li> The gash is about 2 inches long and one inch wide.  </li>
            <li> Slowly lightening my new acne scars.</li>
            <li> it definitely made a difference, since then I have been lazy the last few weeks only using it eh</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a week now for my facial acne scars.</li>
            <li> also have been using it on a big amount of little scars on one of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> i like this but for the price it is a small amount does not last long</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have one on my forehead, and after several weeks see very little difference-PM does not seem to be intensive.</li>
            <li> I had a small red burn scar on my face for a year, before using Mederma</li>
            <li> Not much bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> No more acne, but ofcourse the pesky red or dark spots have remained.</li>
            <li> Still have dark marks.</li>
            <li> (I had two acne scars that I kept picking it, and it turned them into dark scars on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles from this, but even so, the results were a let down.</li>
            <li> I fell through a step and gashed my leg down to the bone in 1996.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 months on surgical scars, in which previously I was just using the Mederma 1x.</li>
            <li> After using this, it is much less noticeable and softer.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t even lighten it little bit..</li>
            <li> I have little burn spot on my face and little of acne spot but no difference nothing..</li>
            <li> so i have very thick hair and when it pokes my back it creats pimples.</li>
            <li> I can feel difference in few days.</li>
            <li> Feels like a waste of money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Used it for a few months as directed...</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve been applying it for a couple of weeks and am already noticing my scars fading slightly!</li>
            <li> I had a pretty bad scar for a kid that scratched my face (in between my nose and under my eye area).</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product almost every night for the past 4 months and not a lot has changed.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but not sure if I was supposed to see a drastic change.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with acne the past year</li>
            <li> Within a week I started noticing small changes.  </li>
            <li> The scars are really bad, I&#x27;m actually going to see a plastic surgeon about fixing them because they are causing me extreme pain, etc.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t hardly noticed a difference</li>
            <li> It was embarrassing because it was hard to disguise with make up because it&#x27;s on my shin in the front of my leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Again, if you have high expectations, you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> so it may have been too late to start using this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews, maybe they should wait a while before leaving a review.</li>
            <li> slowly</li>
            <li> but first let me explain the worst one.</li>
            <li> It works, just get tired of using it, night after night after night...</li>
            <li> I like that it is not a greasy product or one that leaves a lot of residue behind.</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> It was red,  very awful.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Much less nasty looking.</li>
            <li> and it have made me very insecure.</li>
            <li> but I was some what doubtful</li>
            <li> Post pregnancy, my C-section scare was purple, horrible, and applying this cream day and night for one month</li>
            <li> I also had one of the worst breakouts I&#x27;ve had in years while using this.</li>
            <li> It was horrible.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a week now for my facial acne scars. The cream feels good on my face and I am already seeing results. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I remember.</li>
            <li> Wife likes this product because it seems to be speeding the process of reducing scares to legs and arms</li>
            <li> IT actually works as advertised, my surgery scare is getting better. Much less nasty looking.</li>
            <li> this is stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Too expensive. Still have dark marks. Ended up going to the dermatologist and he gave me something better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this and the day cream religiously for about 2 weeks and my burn/puncture scars are almost completely gone. In the process they&#x27;ve already lightened and smoothed, I can only assume it will keep working! I&#x27;m no stranger to scars so I&#x27;m happy with how fast it&#x27;s eradicating them. If you&#x27;re desperate I&#x27;d say definitely go for it :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my scars from my car accident. It works pretty well, my scar on my hand it going away.</li>
            <li> The price on this scar cream was great, and it seems that it&#x27;s working well up till now. It&#x27;s supposed to be more intensive, and I always use the scar removal for my face skin cancer removals at night. There are cheaper products on the market, but I&#x27;ve used Mederma often with good results, in the past.</li>
            <li> The best product everrr</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would work better than it is advertised, but not for me. All scars are different. I have one on my forehead, and after several weeks see very little difference-PM does not seem to be intensive.</li>
            <li> Finished tube no results</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Target, and it was reasonably priced. Amazon price is better, but you can buy it anywhere. It&#x27;s an amazing product with great ingredients to combat scars and wounds. You won&#x27;t regret buying this. This helped a post cyst scab/scar nearly disappear after a few weeks. Very pleased with this. A bargain!</li>
            <li> It definitely seems to be working, be patient and you should be able to see some great results in a hand full of weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought  this product at Target because I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  It truly works.  I&#x27;ve been using it every night on my face for about 2 months. I had a pretty bad scar for a kid that scratched my face (in between my nose and under my eye area). The scar was about a month old when I started using the cream. It was red,  very awful. Now it is almost gone, I can barely notice I have something,  it is matching my skin color.&lt;br /&gt;I also have been using it on a big amount of little scars on one of my cheeks. This scars were from acne and they were a year old. Guess what!!! They are gone.&lt;br /&gt;The cream worked for me!</li>
            <li> This product has dramatically improved the look of my skin!</li>
            <li> Gone through the whole tube now and find that it was a waste of money..  No improvement in scar over my normal healing</li>
            <li> The regular Mederma worked on a very stubborn deep tissue scar I had. However, I&#x27;ve been using this Mederma PM for a month and barely seen a lightening of the scar. Not sure if it&#x27;s for me. Vitamin E works better than this.</li>
            <li> I can feel difference in few days. it is good product.</li>
            <li> A great cream for fading scars. Helps a ton.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me on a relatively new scar.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 6 weeks and it really has made a difference on the acne scars I had in my face. I will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> awesome, noticed a difference over night!!!</li>
            <li> It works, just get tired of using it, night after night after night...yes, I am inherently lazy!&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t work too well when you don&#x27;t use it regularly, works well when you do!&lt;br /&gt;needs to come with a free service to have someone come over at night when you&#x27;re tired &amp; just wanna go to sleep, who will rub it on for you, so you can just go to sleep not go wash it off your hands first...that would be terrific!&lt;br /&gt;all that being said, I used it religiously from week 2 after my dual surgeries in May, for 6 weeks...it definitely made a difference, since then I have been lazy the last few weeks only using it eh maybe 2-3 times a week...haven&#x27;t noticed much if any further improvement, but I did buy another tube so I suppose at some point I will get back in the habit &amp; make those scars disappear!!</li>
            <li> Wife had total knee replacement surgery and used this nightly (and during the daytime, used the regular Mederma cream) and scarring and sutures seem to lessen the scarring. (My wife is Asian and has dark skin, so the scarring is noticeable, but the sutures have almost disappeared.) I&#x27;m sure on light-skinned folks, this cream will definitely diminish the scarring. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> My minor scars are fading, slowly but surely. One thing i would like to point out for everyone and this probably goes for every skin type is that make sure you apply the creme only on the scar&lt;br /&gt;Itself and to pay close attention on the surrounding unscarred skin because even the surround skin can become lightened. So just make sure  you get enough cream for just the scar.</li>
            <li> This product spreads well and isn&#x27;t greasy. The product claims to reduce the visibility of scars after 8 weeks on new scars and 3-6 months on old scars. I&#x27;ve been applying it for about 3 weeks now and I already I&#x27;ve been able to see my dark spots gets lighter. I haven&#x27;t been using it diligently but if I were I would probably see better results than what I&#x27;m currently seeing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this s*** yet, but I still like the idea of it. That gets four stars from me. I wonder where this is....</li>
            <li> I have noticed my scars starting to fade after using product for a month.  I still have a while to go, but very happy with the results so far.  Used on old and new scars.  I like that it is not a greasy product or one that leaves a lot of residue behind. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had singles &amp; it worked great for my scars</li>
            <li> Not what it says it is.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement as of yet and I have applied it to my 3 year old&#x27;s new scar every single night for the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> made scar fade after whole bottle of use, but need another bottle to complete fading</li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised by this product. I had a small red burn scar on my face for a year, before using Mederma (I know I wasn&#x27;t thinking). I used this for about two months (not even every night) and the red mark is significantly lighter. I am so thankful.</li>
            <li> jet to see the results</li>
            <li> It look like its working. 😉</li>
            <li> Acne scars faded but not completely gone yyet. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have a scar from some hot oil that burned my skin on my forearm. The age of the scar is about 3 years so it may have been too late to start using this product. I&#x27;ve used this product almost every night for the past 4 months and not a lot has changed. My scar looks a little better but I think that is only because it is moisturized from this product..?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the product for a little bit and notice that my scar doesn&#x27;t look a whole lot different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars because it did help the appearance while I was using it. The scar appearance went back to normal once I stopped.</li>
            <li> I love it. I had shoulder surgery 14 months ago and you can barely see my scar!</li>
            <li> I like the product, but not sure if I was supposed to see a drastic change.  My doc said the skin takes a really long time to heal.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see that it works</li>
            <li> Useless. It did not work for me at all. I did not see any improvement on my brown skin after consistent use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had tiny scars on my shoulder for as long as I can remember. I finally decided I wanted to get rid of them, so I invested in this mederma PM stuff. I used it religiously for about 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t see any results at all. Feels like a waste of money. I still gave it two stars because perhaps it&#x27;s my fault for not being patient enough.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t hardly noticed a difference but I tried vitamin c serum for my face and it faded Sun spots and made my face look younger!!</li>
            <li> Notice no change at all,  the gel works much better.</li>
            <li> Really haven&#x27;t seen much of a change. I have been using it for about 3 months on surgical scars, in which previously I was just using the Mederma 1x. I think it works the same as the Mederma 1x, just more costly.</li>
            <li> It help clearing my scar</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a different yet.</li>
            <li> It is amazing. I would never had gotten it but my sister got it for me.Thanks</li>
            <li> Been using for 2 weeks and its already starting to work. Causing skin to peel with every night use. Slowly lightening my new acne scars. Can&#x27;t speak for older scars. I put it on after I cleanse, tone and serum. Then I put my nightly moisturizer on after the mederma. I didn&#x27;t want to put too many layers on so it could penetrate. Maybe if I put it on as the last layer I won&#x27;t peel as much? But I want to make sure it has the opportunity to work. One reviewer had said that it has the same active ingredients as chapstick. My friend is a medical professional and said that the active ingredient is actually a steroid. Do with that info what you will..</li>
            <li> I was surprized this worked! I used it on 2 scars on my face, that lightened them up (I had two acne scars that I kept picking it, and it turned them into dark scars on my skin.  I also had a surgical cut on my side above my ribs from a colapsed lung that looked like a stab wound.  After using this, it is much less noticeable and softer.</li>
            <li> If you have any problems with scars because of acne please buy this product. I didn&#x27;t buy it at Amazon but at a local store and let me tell you this product works wonders. I&#x27;ve been having problems with scars on my back due to pimples since I could remember...since middle school and it have made me very insecure. Im part hawaiian so i have very thick hair and when it pokes my back it creats pimples. And obviously as time passes ur scars will get worse and theres a greater chance it will permanently stay on you.&lt;br /&gt;I hid my back for years but now that I have turned 27 I was determined to get rid of my scars if it was possible. I saw this products ad on tv and said this might work since the regular mederma helped with my scars from cuts. Anywho I wished I took pictures from the beginning so I could compare the results but I was some what doubtful so I didnt. The results are amazing. The bottle is almost done and my scars on my back is 90-95% gone how awesome is that.  I used mederma pm off and on for about 2 months. I would forget or would be at my bfs house a lot so i wouldnt use it but the key word is to be &amp;#34;consistent&amp;#34;. Thank god this came out im so happy and I have more confidence in wearing what I want to now. Buy it...its worth it trust me!</li>
            <li> i like this but for the price it is a small amount does not last long</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by my pharmacy. I am on my second purchase for a scar about 2 ft long.</li>
            <li> I honestly, didn&#x27;t think this cream would work. I have some scars that I want to get rid of and at first I was thrown off how tiny the tube is. But I&#x27;ve been applying it for a couple of weeks and am already noticing my scars fading slightly! Again, if you have high expectations, you may be disappointed. It looks like this cream will take a while to have the effect you desire. But if you are just looking for something new to try and slowly fade out the scars, it&#x27;s perfect. Be warned though if you don&#x27;t like fragrances. This does have the Mederma cream smell!</li>
            <li> Been using mederma pm for two weeks now and I can see that my acne scars are starting to  look lighter</li>
            <li> I had a surgery 5 months ago, and this product, with the Mederma Cream SPF 30, has been a miracle. I use both creams daily, combined is 3 times a day, and I have seen results in this 3 weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it. I am very happy I purchased this brand. It is better than gel, because it last long in the skin. I am going to keep using them until they are almost gone :P</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! 9 months Post pregnancy, my C-section scare was purple, horrible, and applying this cream day and night for one month the scare has lighted more than 50 percent and its light pink now! I am soo amazed with this cream I will recommend it to anyone with a scare.</li>
            <li> works really well...been using Mederma products for many years...they are all really well formulated</li>
            <li> No improvement for over a month. Discontinuing and trying a new product</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  The scar I was trying to heal is almost gone and it hasn&#x27;t been two months like the cream suggests for old scars.  I highly recommend this cream for scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this creme for about a month now because my doctor encouraged me for scars that my kitty cat left on the inside of my wrist. The scars are really bad, I&#x27;m actually going to see a plastic surgeon about fixing them because they are causing me extreme pain, etc. In any case, I&#x27;ve been using the day &amp; night Mederma creme &amp; so far I am not seeing any changes.</li>
            <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve already seen results! Will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Cream has not worked yet, and the tube is only half filled. Not much bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about a month. I have tried multiple products for scars including the dark scar removal from proactive, nothing I used worked. I did not have high expectations from this cream either, but it really DOES WORK. slowly but surely I notice the difference and so have others. Fading scars can take time and you have to be patient with products such as these. I would definitely recommend his product for acne scars. I look forward to continuing to use this cream.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles from this, but even so, the results were a let down. I applied nightly to my acne scars, both new and old, for about a month. At the end of the month there was no noticeable improvement. I also had one of the worst breakouts I&#x27;ve had in years while using this. I&#x27;m not saying it was the cause of it, but it certainly didn&#x27;t help ;) all in all, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, and I probably won&#x27;t even use the rest of this tube.</li>
            <li> works welll for scars. love it. still havent finished the bottle. it works well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month since I&#x27;ve purchased. I wantef to wait a month so I can leave an honest review. I&#x27;ve suffered with acne the past year and I am an adult. I am under going medication and my face have cleared up. No more acne, but ofcourse the pesky red or dark spots have remained. And how  to get rid of them. I did not know. I tried kany products but none seemed to work. I tried derma roller, that didnt work. So I finally came around to purchasing mederma, and a month later my dark spots have lightened up and my face improved drastically. I cannot believe how good this stuff works. I was also worried about break outs if I use this stuff. But so far I&#x27;ve had no breakouts whatsoever. This stuff is amazing! I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews, maybe they should wait a while before leaving a review. One must be patient and consistent.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Granddaughter she hasn&#x27;t given me an evaluation yet!</li>
            <li> Yes it works and you must be patient! I have a burn scar on my arm from a hot pan and a scar on my hand from a cut,I have been applying it every night for 2 weeks now and the scars are lightening up and fading gradually. I expect both scars to look A LOT better 6 months from now!&lt;br /&gt;Again,Do not expect &amp;#34;Amazing&amp;#34; results after using it for just a week or two. This stuff takes time to work.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it,I used the standard Mederma before and this stuff works much better.</li>
            <li> It works.. Try it... Just be consistent..</li>
            <li> Be patient! Works gradually. Recommended using a q tip and placing only on scar as it can be drying to other areas. Fades, but doesn&#x27;t eliminate deep scars. Mine was on face from a cat. Use this along w Eucerin facial lotion w SPF, bio-oil, and Calendula lotion which I think is truly amazing! Used right away on scar once skin no longer had a sore. Will take a while.</li>
            <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t work at all don&#x27;t waste your money I this product . I bought this cream hoping it would help my scar from my belly a piercing scar it didn&#x27;t work like at all !</li>
            <li> Used it for a few months as directed...didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the difference  I already finished with the product it still have the same dark spot and it didn&#x27;t even lighten it little bit.. it is really waist.. I have little burn spot on my face and little of acne spot but no difference nothing..</li>
            <li> Thank you to the merdema company for making this product really helps my acne scars I saw resulta in a week. I just got to get rid of the pimples and im all set. It really helps clear up scars every morning I notice a difference. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have several scars I&#x27;m using this cream on but first let me explain the worst one. I fell through a step and gashed my leg down to the bone in 1996. I should have had stitches but I just used a large bandage and Neosporin on it.  The gash is about 2 inches long and one inch wide.  After many months of finally healing, it turned black and I have no feeling in the area. I&#x27;m sure there is nerve damage. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried bleaching it using several different products but all it did was make the scar smooth, shiny and look like a patch of dark brown patent leather.  It was embarrassing because it was hard to disguise with make up because it&#x27;s on my shin in the front of my leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this tube a month ago.  Admittedly, I used it more than once a day because I was desperate to see results.  Within a week I started noticing small changes.  The shiny area actually began to dull and started matching my surrounding normal skin.  It was as if new skin was &amp;#34;forming&amp;#34; (here and there) in place of the obviously damaged. I am so pleased as I have &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pictures and am anxious to take &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; pics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started using it on other scars that are more than 10 years old and I am seeing vast improvements. I bought two more tubes because, for me, it&#x27;s been worth every penny.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li> My scars are going away; -)</li>
            <li> Good price.sells for few dollars more at drug stores.</li>
            <li> I was attacked outside of a bar, and had to have eight stitches above my eye.  The doctor who put in stitches kind of left a lump of skin above my eye once the stitches came out.  I used this product for a couple of weeks, and you can barely see the scar, and the skin bump is completely gone.</li>
            <li> This product has so much fragrance that I couldn&#x27;t use it for the scar on my neck.  It was horrible.  It didn&#x27;t even wash off with soap.  I had to use alcohol pads to get rid of the smell.  If you are at all sensitive to fragrance don&#x27;t purchase this product!  Why on earth would they put so much fragrance in a scar cream??</li>
            <li> My wife had total knee replacement and has been applying Mederma every night.  Her doctor recommened it. The scar  is  looking good and fading.</li>
            <li> This product made my face broke out. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months now and no difference.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference but I will continue to use it and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Love the product but the smell is not so pleasant.</li>
            <li> So, I have been using this product for about a month. I have been applying this cream on several spots, including acne scars on my face, and surgical scars (that is 2.5 years old). My impression so far is that it works pretty well for acne scars (especially the ones on my chin). About surgical scars, I still cannot see noticeable effect.   I will keep applying it to see some results..</li>
            <li> I bought it with some hesitation. Truly I had tried almost everything, and didn&#x27;t expect much results. I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for 6 weeks now and am so happy with the results it&#x27;s had in my acne scars. My skin feels softer, and I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 10 days on my acne scar and I can already see the results! The scar has faded, not entirely yet, but I can see clear improvement. We&#x27;ll see if the scar disappears completely.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream on my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; scar for only a week now, and I can already notice a huge difference in the healing of my scar. I am already very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I had a raised scar on my chest. It really helped it reduce. It would probably help even more but I stopped applying</li>
            <li> Has a funny onion smell</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t seem to do anything</li>
            <li> This works phenomenally well, even on older skin wound marks</li>
    </ol>
