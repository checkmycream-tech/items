            <li>but when i used this my hair really like it and my hair looks fresh now...</li>
            <li>What I also love about this oil is that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, so I still have natural volume even though my hair is very fine and straight.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and silky and very easy to style the next day.  </li>
            <li>but maybe I used too much.</li>
            <li>An amazing product which you can apply to tame your hair after taking a shower.</li>
            <li>It also last a full year</li>

            <li>It just absorbs into my hair like a fluffy could and works it magic.</li>
            <li>Every time I put it in my hair, my Sister always compliments me &amp; wants 2 know what I did different with my hair &amp; how pretty it looks &amp;</li>
            <li>I have very fine natural blonde hair with some very light highlights and my hair is down about 4 inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft just using those two things, but when I use this Biotin &amp; Collagen oil treatment, it brings my hair from an 8 to a 10 in seconds!</li>
            <li>far as the Seller, I blinked &amp; the product was at my doorstep!</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical about purchasing this oil when I was in the store the other day, but I am so glad I did because it is amazing!</li>
            <li>I leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feel soft and moist when i apply this product to it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through dozens of oils in the past year</li>
            <li> Makes my hair unbelievably manageable.</li>
            <li> This was a little heavy for my thin hair</li>
            <li> I will be heart broken if it is discontinued?  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair as a result of chemotherapy a couple of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> would not buy again, anyone with &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34; in it is bad for your hair.</li>

            <li> I have 4b/c natural hair and mix it with some water and moisturizer in a spray bottle helps soften my hair really good</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing this oil when I was in the store the other day, but I am so glad I did because it is amazing! I know I didn&#x27;t buy it on amazon, but I had to write a review because I encourage more people to buy this oil. It is indeed everything it says it is. I have very fine natural blonde hair with some very light highlights and my hair is down about 4 inches past my shoulders. I have been trying to find the right combination of shampoo and conditioner and hair oil for months. I finally found it all! I use Biolage Hydratherapie shampoo and conditioner and they are both amazing products. My hair is so soft just using those two things, but when I use this Biotin &amp; Collagen oil treatment, it brings my hair from an 8 to a 10 in seconds! I don&#x27;t even have to brush my hair - I can just run my fingers through it and let it air dry and it&#x27;s perfect. What I also love about this oil is that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, so I still have natural volume even though my hair is very fine and straight. It just absorbs into my hair like a fluffy could and works it magic. If you&#x27;re looking for a hair oil that does it all, this is the one to try. I&#x27;ve gone through dozens of oils in the past year and I am officially done searching!</li>
            <li> would not buy again, anyone with &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34; in it is bad for your hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only oil that doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. An amazing product which you can apply to tame your hair after taking a shower. Makes my hair unbelievably manageable. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works well on my baby fine thin hair.  Has it been discontinued?  I use it daily with my hair flex brush.... Noticed some fullness starting to appear...  I will be heart broken if it is discontinued?  Story of my life... Find something that works and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> My hair was starting to feel and look like cotton candy because it was so dry. The humidity in Florida did not help with frizzies. This oil is wonderful and has made a big difference in the texture of my hair. Just use about a nickel size drop in your hand and rub it through your hair before you dry it. Love this oil.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything but make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> great for hair and skin too!!</li>
            <li> This product was just ok.  There were no noticeable effects of using this product other than it tamed my fly-a-ways a bit.  But it didn&#x27;t last long.  Also felt like I needed to use way more product than what was recommended.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this product again.  I will just finish what I have.</li>
            <li> Love love love this oil it makes your hair so soft and managble you will love it plus it smells great. It also last a full year you only need a dime even for natural hair yes yall thick natural hair if you use any more your hair is so greasy it wont do anything.</li>
            <li> This is a very unique product. I have been using thickening and volumizing products for 15 years and the leave-in products always leave my hair feeling kind of dry and brittle because they contain alcohol. This is the first of its kind that actually conditions your hair, yet somehow it doesn&#x27;t leave your roots looking oily. My hair is so fine I would never dream of putting a product like this in my roots, but for some reason I tried it out and it looked great, my hair was smooth and tame and shiny and had lots of volume. A little product goes a long way so it&#x27;s really a great value for your money. I have been using for two weeks and have barely made a dent in it.</li>
            <li> This product is everything it promises to be and more.  I have very thin hair as a result of chemotherapy a couple of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products to help rectify this problem, all with no success.  After ONE use there was a huge difference in the appearance of my hair.  I could no longer see my scalp showing through!  My hair was soft and silky and very easy to style the next day.  It also smells great!  I only used two drops since my hair is short and it worked like gangbusters.  I highly recommend this product, especially for women with thin hair.</li>
            <li> I leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> love it absorbs right into the scalp.  non greasy hopes this helps</li>
            <li> I have been losing hair on the top of my head since I had gastric bypass surgery in 2008. This product gives me back me back my self confidence! Every time I put it in my hair, my Sister always compliments me &amp; wants 2 know what I did different with my hair &amp; how pretty it looks &amp; how pretty I look!! It gives my hair such fullness &amp; body!!! It is worth every penny I spent!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the Seller, I blinked &amp; the product was at my doorstep! Thanks4 the fast shipping! Would gladly purchase this from you again in the future!</li>
            <li> this is what I use so of course I like it.</li>
            <li> Great for leave in treatments, adding shine to a finished look, and smells nice. It&#x27;s also nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> I did not not a thickening quality from using this at all. I prefer the argon oil. It&#x27;s not a bad produce by any means. It did not leave my hair greasy and smells nice. I just didn&#x27;t find a thickening quality that I had purchased this for. It adds a touch of shine and helps to detangle and is a good conditioner for damaged hair so it is okay. the price is great and I like this line very much. It is the only line other than Wen I will use.</li>
            <li> Lightweight oil which does not make my hair oily.</li>
