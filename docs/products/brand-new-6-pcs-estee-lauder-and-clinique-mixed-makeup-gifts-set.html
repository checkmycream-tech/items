            <li>Face screams serve as great testers.</li>
            <li>I would happily purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner is one of the best out there and the lipstick&#x27;s color is just adorable.</li>
            <li>they are good</li>
            <li>All this products are amazing and good quality.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I was a very good detail for a gift, very useful stuff no woman can deny and</li>
            <li>I am a very fair skinned person, look best in blue based shades.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and love to buy cosmetics, this is a good variety of quality cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>The tinted moisturizer is nice.</li>
            <li>love all clinique products.  </li>
            <li>The products are OK but was packaged in a ziplock type plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the cleanser and lipgloss as well.</li>
            <li>; lotion reminded me that I already tried this product.......for me the product tends to get flaky as I apply make-up over it, my issue maybe, glad it was a sample.</li>
            <li>The texture of the lipstick is also very good, it isn&#x27;t sticky yet not dry.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of brown shadow but the quality of the brown, Chocolate Chip shadow is very good, it stays on all day and unlike Urban Decay eye shadow it doesn&#x27;t drop of the applicator and ruin your already applied under eye concealer.</li>
            <li>Mascara is great for daily wear.  </li>
            <li>So the lipstick does not look good, even with bronzer on it is too yellow based.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a great deal for such a price.</li>
            <li>My personal favorite is the flirt honey lipstick.  </li>
            <li>The two mascaras are okay, I would have preferred to be only one.</li>
            <li>the lip gloss is pretty neutral, I like it.</li>
            <li>This Clinique eye shadow was pretty close to the colour I was looking for</li>
            <li>They seemed to be very old merchandise.</li>

            <li> it suits my pale skin, the Lucky Penny shade has a little hint of pink to it, for me it compliments my skin colour.</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected since they were going to be used as.</li>
            <li> The little bottle of &amp;#34; repair wear&amp;#34</li>
            <li> so if.you use it a few times and need to turn it to make the tip extend, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It makes it useless after just a few applications.</li>
            <li> I got a gel blush, weird mascara and an ugly shade of color lipstick</li>

            <li> My personal favorite is the flirt honey lipstick.  Mascara is great for daily wear.  Face screams serve as great testers.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and love to buy cosmetics, this is a good variety of quality cosmetics.  The shades are compatible with my medium/light skin color.  I would happily purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> very pleased really excellent product I can recommend it met my expectations so well that I was really very happy thank you</li>
            <li> I was a very good detail for a gift, very useful stuff no woman can deny and very good quality</li>
            <li> I was delivered a different set, i din not get the blush, or the eyeliner and mascara, insetad I got a gel blush, weird mascara and an ugly shade of color lipstick</li>
            <li> Excellent attention, the product according to the photo</li>
            <li> love all clinique products.  They have an array of colors that seams to match all skin tones  would purchase this product again</li>
            <li> me gusto, era lo que esperaba y es de excelente calidad y llego en perfecytas condiciones al destino solicitado bien</li>
            <li> The products are OK but was packaged in a ziplock type plastic bag. This was not what I expected since they were going to be used as.Christmas presents. The eyeliners in both packages I ordered did not turn or advance so if.you use it a few times and need to turn it to make the tip extend, it doesn&#x27;t. It makes it useless after just a few applications.</li>
            <li> I just received the products and I&#x27;m very happy. The eyeliner is one of the best out there and the lipstick&#x27;s color is just adorable. The texture of the lipstick is also very good, it isn&#x27;t sticky yet not dry. Satisfied with the cleanser and lipgloss as well. The two mascaras are okay, I would have preferred to be only one. Overall I think this is a great deal for such a price.</li>
            <li> Muy bueno el producto igual al ofrecido llegando al tiempo estipulado de muy buena calidad en realidad muy complacido espero volver hacer negocios los recomiendo ampliamente</li>
            <li> All this products are amazing and good quality.&lt;br /&gt;For travel or purse or your stuff they are good&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll recomend them everybody.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Marilisa</li>
            <li> me encantaron los cosm&amp;eacute;ticos y me parecieron mu practico para llevarlos en la cartera  excelente vendedor muy responsable  lo recomiendo!!!</li>
            <li> as so often we tend to forget the fact that everybody has different taste, skin type and skin color. I am a very fair skinned person, look best in blue based shades. So the lipstick does not look good, even with bronzer on it is too yellow based. The tinted moisturizer is nice. the lip gloss is pretty neutral, I like it. The little bottle of &amp;#34; repair wear&amp;#34; lotion reminded me that I already tried this product.......for me the product tends to get flaky as I apply make-up over it, my issue maybe, glad it was a sample. This Clinique eye shadow was pretty close to the colour I was looking for it suits my pale skin, the Lucky Penny shade has a little hint of pink to it, for me it compliments my skin colour. I am not a fan of brown shadow but the quality of the brown, Chocolate Chip shadow is very good, it stays on all day and unlike Urban Decay eye shadow it doesn&#x27;t drop of the applicator and ruin your already applied under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> This was an overpriced group of samples.  They seemed to be very old merchandise. I  Will not order these again.</li>
