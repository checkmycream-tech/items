            <li>Great colors!</li>
            <li>I got it on time, a very nice colour!</li>
            <li>Very bright</li>
            <li>very good quality  and texture</li>
            <li>The required 2 coats make it beautiful.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>this color is kinda like magenta, not quite purple, somewhat bright.  </li>
            <li>But it is bright and it has glitter in it and that is even better than neon in my opinion!</li>
            <li>It is not neon if that&#x27;s what you want, but I think it&#x27;s better!</li>
            <li>LOVE IBD GEL POLISHES!</li>
            <li>Colors are great and application is easy.</li>
            <li>The color is nice, I just thought it was going to be brighter.  </li>
            <li>Still nice.</li>
            <li>This color will definitely be used because it is still incredible gorgeous on!</li>
            <li>I love this color</li>
            <li>I love IBD polishes for quality and the prices cannot be beat, but this shade just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li>This color was not my favorite</li>
            <li>It almost reminds me a berry, it does get darker with the more coats you add</li>
            <li>I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>Fun, bright, purple color.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I think I will use more decorating or when I plan on doing a bold mix and match nail design.</li>
            <li>The quality is GREAT, I have a big collection of ibd Gelish and it continues to grow.</li>
            <li>, I recomand it for summer fun!</li>
            <li>Ordered it and it was in my hands fast , love this color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not neon like the picture shows but still a very pretty color.</li>
            <li>This was a little more than I was expecting, it&#x27;s a nice purple</li>
            <li>This product is just as good at nearly half the price.</li>
            <li>One of my first disappointments from IBD.</li>
            <li>The color of this is fuchsia with beautiful subtle sparkle in it!</li>
            <li>I was really looking for just a purple.</li>
            <li>I didnt like this color because it was very see-through</li>
            <li>Molly is a lovely neon purple loaded with blue and red glitter.</li>
            <li>but WOW!!</li>
            <li>then you know the colors are sometimes a little light unless applied correctly</li>
            <li>UV/LED polish is a little lighter and brighter than the same shade IBD lacquer and required more coats to achieve complete opacity.</li>
            <li>IBD polishes apply, wear, and remove as well as the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried but is also available in matching regular nail</li>
            <li>Its right in between a pinkish purple and purple, but not exactly neon.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other shades, this shade was very opaque (very odd for a dark color), and I could never get the rich, pretty purple that the label features.</li>
            <li>It is soooo much prettier in person than I expected!</li>

            <li> And the color is just not attractive.</li>
            <li> but I was just a little bit disappointed when I tested the color and saw that it was sparkly.</li>
            <li> sparkles with a purple base coat.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this gel polish. I started out with Gelish at $15 per bottle. This product is just as good at nearly half the price. Colors are great and application is easy.</li>
            <li> I love this color but I was just a little bit disappointed when I tested the color and saw that it was sparkly. I was really looking for just a purple. This color will definitely be used because it is still incredible gorgeous on! Molly takes about three coats to get an opaque look.</li>
            <li> Ordered it and it was in my hands fast , love this color. Got it for my little girl and she loves it !!!</li>
            <li> I didnt like this color because it was very see-through and it didnt apply well. One of my first disappointments from IBD. And the color is just not attractive.</li>
            <li> I love IBD polishes for quality and the prices cannot be beat, but this shade just didn&#x27;t do it for me. Compared to other shades, this shade was very opaque (very odd for a dark color), and I could never get the rich, pretty purple that the label features.</li>

            <li> DO NOT LIKE the glitter...I have worn Molly for years and they ADDED glitter to this.....HATE!!  Want my Molly neon back!!!</li>
            <li> If you know about Gel then you know the colors are sometimes a little light unless applied correctly but this color is pretty hard to mess up.  The required 2 coats make it beautiful.</li>
            <li> Great product. Beautiful color!</li>
            <li> LOVE IBD GEL POLISHES! Great colors! Lasts forever!! Quality product.</li>
            <li> I got it on time, a very nice colour! very good quality  and texture, I recomand it for summer fun!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not neon like the picture shows but still a very pretty color. Purple with blueish glitter. Lots of compliments! Will buy other colors from this brand.</li>
            <li> This color was not my favorite it has blue and several different colors of purple sparkles with a purple base coat.</li>
            <li> Molly is a lovely neon purple loaded with blue and red glitter. The Just Gel soak off UV/LED polish is a little lighter and brighter than the same shade IBD lacquer and required more coats to achieve complete opacity. IBD polishes apply, wear, and remove as well as the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried but is also available in matching regular nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cured using Salon Edge 36W Nail UV Lamp.</li>
            <li> This was a little more than I was expecting, it&#x27;s a nice purple but WOW!! it&#x27;s PURPLE. It almost reminds me a berry, it does get darker with the more coats you add but it definitely holds the Purple no mater how dark you go. I think I will use more decorating or when I plan on doing a bold mix and match nail design. The quality is GREAT, I have a big collection of ibd Gelish and it continues to grow.</li>
            <li> I bought this purple, thinking it&#x27;s going to be a neon purple. Well it is definitely not neon! But it is bright and it has glitter in it and that is even better than neon in my opinion! I am in love with it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell by the bottle, but this color has a bit of sparkle to it. I&#x27;m not a big sparkle fan, but I don&#x27;t mind it in this color. Fun, bright, purple color.</li>
            <li> this color is kinda like magenta, not quite purple, somewhat bright.  Its right in between a pinkish purple and purple, but not exactly neon.  The color is nice, I just thought it was going to be brighter.  Still nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this purple and did not expect to be sparkly but it is. Very bright and I love it</li>
