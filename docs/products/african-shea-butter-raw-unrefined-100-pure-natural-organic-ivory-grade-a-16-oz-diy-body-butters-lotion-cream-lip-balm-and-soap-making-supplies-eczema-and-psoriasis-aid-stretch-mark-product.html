            <li> Fabulous for dry skin</li>
            <li> Quality and quantity at a good price...</li>
            <li> Excellent buttery soft natural pure excellent smelling goodness. This Shea is so smooth &amp; fresh &amp; mixes up well to make my home made all natural organic lotion for my bod. I guess it is probably a body butter. Anyway great stuff &amp; does wonders for my skin. I love this stuff &amp; I will continue to purchase it as long as they sell it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so much trouble finding a product that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Even the hypoallergenic creams caused me to break out!  This is my answer.  My daughter made me some cream using shea butter and I love it so ordered more for myself to make my own.  It&#x27;s relatively inexpensive too.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Great quality shea butter for a low price!</li>
            <li> Mild scent. Mixed with coconut oil and grapeseed oil to make body butter, and it turned out great!</li>
            <li> The product is natural and additive free as it suggests..but it is quite gritty and slightly hard unlike Molivera&#x27;s raw ivory Shea butter..I probably won&#x27;t order this brand again. However, it does the job for now.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product.  In dry, arid Colorado guests love using it.  Excellent quality and value.</li>
            <li> great! better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Kinda smelly, but it works great for varying degrees of dry skin.</li>
            <li> Too hard, had to melt it to use it..funky smell.</li>
            <li> Made some sample lotion bars to have friends try.  I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in product.  Cannot be used ....comparable to a jar of sand.  If an option I would have given it a zero star.  This should be taken off the site, I&#x27;ve thrown my jar in the trash.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! Take a chunk and rub in hands to melt. Not grainy, very smooth. Love love!!</li>
            <li> Very grainy doesn&#x27;t mix well.</li>
            <li> Product works perfectly.</li>

            <li> I just received it today and it is wonderful. Smooth and buttery.  There is no perfumes or additives.  In its natural state ie hard but once you rub it through, it just feels so rich and hydrating.  Definitely purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for severely cracked heels.  This product has worked better than ANY other cream or salves I have used!</li>
            <li> This product is hard in the jar but I used a spoon to break it up. Its does wonders on kinky/curly hair (I&#x27;m black). I have very frizzy hair and this butter along with a curling cream has tamed my frizz. I also use it on my sons dry skin and it helps.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, much better than lotion and provides a great layer of protection during the winter.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product few months ago ,it&#x27;s really great i used it for my body also my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it the better shea butter i have used until now . 👍🏻</li>
            <li> I love this!  I use it with my essential oils blends</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really works thank u</li>
            <li> Butter smells horrible. I would never could put this stuff on my skin, it smells like an old pig fat or greasy old oil. What a waist of money! It stinks? It is incredibly hard and feels like sand if I try to get it with my fingers, I have to melt it I guess but even then I can&#x27;t put it on my body with this awful smell. I threw it in garbage.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, I used this Shea Butter  to make a natural homemade deodorant and lotions. It worked great, very moisturizing and absolutely no skin irritation. Add some essential oil and you can customize the scent also.</li>
            <li> I use it for my skin and hair, it made my skin and hair dry and ichey</li>
