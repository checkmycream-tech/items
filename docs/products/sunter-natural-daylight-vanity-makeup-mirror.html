            <li>Really great quality construction as well.</li>
            <li>Great mirror.  </li>
            <li>Great mirror.</li>
            <li>The magnification side is great for working on your eyebrows, or applying eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Great mirror bought it at Costco for 14.99</li>
            <li>OMG this mirror is wonderful it has nothing to envy to a one hundred or more something dollars you know them</li>
            <li>Bright light and magnification is perfect!  </li>
            <li>the light is really good all you need for a flawless makeup application</li>
            <li>I thought the price was extremely fair.</li>
            <li>Even at this price here on Amazon it is still a good mirror.</li>
            <li>She loved it alot</li>
            <li>Exceeded my expectation for good customer service.  </li>
            <li>Not as bright as I thought it would be but for the price it was a good deal</li>
            <li>But this one has plenty of light and the magnification is excellent.</li>
            <li>The daylight light works wonderfully</li>
            <li>Great for people who need &amp;#34;readers&amp;#34; for fine print!  </li>
            <li>I thought I was buying her a great gift that she would love.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>THIS mirror is pretty much perfect for me!</li>
            <li>Love the mirror!  </li>
            <li>And I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s the perfect height and has just the right amount of light.  </li>
            <li>Good light, though.</li>
            <li>Good morrow, light could be better.</li>
            <li>All around fantastic mirror!</li>
            <li>I wish they had more</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find them at Costco any more</li>
            <li>I love these mirrors.</li>
            <li>it Very durable, great quality.</li>
            <li>you cannot make any mistake you&#x27;ll be able to see what you didn&#x27;t before</li>
            <li>It is taller than most mirrors</li>
            <li>The natural light is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Way better then the fluorescent lighted mirrors.  </li>
            <li>In any case, I would have been better off ordering a vanity mirror and a stand alone lamp.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>long I have searched for the perfect makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li>I should have done my research better nad bought correct light for her.</li>
            <li>Image was distorted around the edges of the mirror, so you had to be perfectly centered or you could not really see, as well,</li>
            <li>I get more light from my iPhone.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to slouch down and the magnified side is awesome.</li>
            <li>The magnification helps to see eyebrow hairs and all those fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>It gives me the light that I need to put my make up on.</li>
            <li>When I turned it on, there was no difference in light.</li>
            <li>the light bulb busted on it&#x27;s journey to me</li>
            <li>The lighting sucked, it&#x27;s a 13 watt light bulb that is suggested.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to put on eye makeup and actually see the details!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>To be honest they usually don&#x27;t last more then a year then need to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>They had this on special at Costco for $10.00.</li>
            <li>It provides good lighting enough to put on her makeup without her overdoing it.  </li>
            <li>I had to put my face right up to it to get any light.</li>
            <li>But buying a new lightbulb is easy, since the type they use is easy to find.</li>
            <li>Other then the chip its nice!</li>
            <li>I spent a fair amount of money on this mirror as a gift.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for one, but didn&#x27;t want to pay $60+ for a decent one (which looks to be around the original cost of this item according to the listing).  </li>
            <li>Great vanity makeup mirror for such a low cost.</li>
            <li>Strong clear magnification.</li>
            <li>Only thing that would be better is if it was adjustable in height.</li>
            <li>She said she really likes it!</li>
            <li>I see every freakin wrinkle no matter how tiny :)</li>
            <li>The light is soft, not obnoxious.</li>
            <li>I like it that much.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The owner very justly corrected an error with a make up mirror I received.  </li>
            <li>If this is your ONLY light source, it might be sufficient.</li>
            <li>Once you turn it on, give it a second and the light gets brighter.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to bend over as much.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s because the bulb they use is an actual light bulb that we use for every day use.  </li>
            <li>And replacing the bulb would have been easier if the holes where the screws are weren&#x27;t off so much.  </li>
            <li>but it had different light settings for evening, day and office.</li>
            <li>I got this at Costco last winter on a holiday special.</li>
            <li>Quality seems good but not a good choice for us.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lighted vanity from this maker.</li>
            <li>When she sits at her vanity this light is too tall and the light is not good.</li>
            <li>Very dim.</li>
            <li>The fluorescent light beats other light sources hands down.</li>
            <li>Two reasons, the first being over priced and the second is it&#x27;s dim.</li>
            <li>First, I will say that the size of the mirror is far larger than what I thought so</li>
            <li>The one that I was lucky enough to purchase was only $20!</li>
            <li>Great price for such an expensive looking item.</li>
            <li>Natural lighting is what you need if you truly want to see well for plucking with the 10X side.</li>
            <li>What we received completely did not meet my expectations for a gift.  </li>
            <li>, it really lets you see any mistakes you might have missed if you were using a regular mirror.</li>
            <li>However, the lighting is perfect, both sides of the mirror are extremely clear, and the base is heavy</li>

            <li> However, the lighting is perfect, both sides of the mirror are extremely clear, and the base is heavy</li>
            <li> I am older and have trouble seeing close up.  </li>
            <li> The other mirror was too low</li>
            <li> I have used it everyday since I got it, and the lightbulb only went out last week.</li>
            <li> You may spend hours in front of this mirror agonizing over every single &amp;#34;flaw&amp;#34; in your face!</li>
            <li> It was a little larger than I anticipated, but I set it on my bathroom counter and use it standing up.</li>
            <li> The only thing missing is that I saw a mirror like this</li>
            <li> I love the long neck base on this model.</li>
            <li> This was money well spent!</li>
            <li> It was extremely fat</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because I was tired of hunching over to see my face with traditional low height mirror stands.</li>
            <li> and I had to hunch down to look into it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also add that the size of the mirror might be a little too bulky.  </li>
            <li> The brushed silver stand goes with everything and doesn&#x27;t take up much room at the base.</li>
            <li> The 10X magnified side is especially helpful for tweezing, although sometimes all of my enlarged pores look a little scary.</li>
            <li> Now the negative...</li>
            <li> expensive brands like jerdon or zadro</li>
            <li> I randomly found this while walking the aisles at Costco, and I couldn&#x27;t have been any happier!</li>
            <li> I bought a Conair lighted mirror with adjustable lighting, 10X/1X magnification and was SO DISAPPOINTED!</li>

            <li> This was a gift for my Sister.  She lovesit.  The fluorescent light beats other light sources hands down.</li>
            <li> I randomly found this while walking the aisles at Costco, and I couldn&#x27;t have been any happier! I&#x27;ve been looking for one, but didn&#x27;t want to pay $60+ for a decent one (which looks to be around the original cost of this item according to the listing).  The one that I was lucky enough to purchase was only $20! BARGAIN!  This really is a great product and I&#x27;d happily buy it again.  You get a great, quality product for a great price.  It&#x27;s totally changed my morning and night routine; it has transformed my entire beauty process.  To me, it&#x27;s the perfect height and has just the right amount of light.  Buy this mirror!  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This mirror exceeded my expectations. The magnification side is great! I thought the price was extremely fair. This was money well spent!</li>
            <li> This mirror is excellent. It gives me the light that I need to put my make up on. I did not realize how tall it was until I received it, which I thought was going to be a problem. It turns out it is perfect for me. I don&#x27;t have to slouch down and the magnified side is awesome. I can see everything I don&#x27;t want too, if that makes sense. All around fantastic mirror!</li>
            <li> I use this several times a day, every day. But be warned! You may spend hours in front of this mirror agonizing over every single &amp;#34;flaw&amp;#34; in your face! Good light, though. It was a little larger than I anticipated, but I set it on my bathroom counter and use it standing up. Only thing that would be better is if it was adjustable in height. Still like it though!</li>
            <li> I got this at Costco last winter on a holiday special. Paid around $20. I wish they had more, it&#x27;s a very good mirror. Even at this price here on Amazon it is still a good mirror. I can&#x27;t find them at Costco any more and I&#x27;m actually considering purchasing another at this price. I like it that much.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because I was tired of hunching over to see my face with traditional low height mirror stands. I love the long neck base on this model. The illumination is great. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love these mirrors. To be honest they usually don&#x27;t last more then a year then need to be replaced.  I will continue to purchase them however, I took off one star because of it.</li>
            <li> My wife is not a tall woman about 5 froot 4 inches. When she sits at her vanity this light is too tall and the light is not good. Quality seems good but not a good choice for us. I thought I was buying her a great gift that she would love. I should have done my research better nad bought correct light for her.</li>
            <li> My grown daughter wanted a mirror for Christmas.  After researching reviews online, I decided this one was probably the best buy with good ratings.  She said she really likes it!</li>
            <li> God this for a friend for xmas.  It was a great deal, great price, as advertised. She loved it alot</li>
            <li> Great vanity makeup mirror for such a low cost. I use it daily and have no complaints. The 10X magnified side is especially helpful for tweezing, although sometimes all of my enlarged pores look a little scary. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought a Conair lighted mirror with adjustable lighting, 10X/1X magnification and was SO DISAPPOINTED! Image was distorted around the edges of the mirror, so you had to be perfectly centered or you could not really see, as well, the lighting was NOT sufficient! THEN I FOUND THIS MIRROR! I love it! Perfect. Natural lighting is what you need if you truly want to see well for plucking with the 10X side. And the 1X side is perfect for makeup! This product looks well made and sits at what I now realize too is the perfect height! The other mirror was too low and I had to hunch down to look into it. THIS mirror is pretty much perfect for me! I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The owner very justly corrected an error with a make up mirror I received.  She fully refunded the purchase price plus shipping.  Because the item was a gift to my daughter and the error was not discover until after she received the gift, I was told to just keep the mirror as a courtesy.  Exceeded my expectation for good customer service.  Have to thank the merchant for outstanding customer service!!!!</li>
            <li> If this is your ONLY light source, it might be sufficient. However, it really isn&#x27;t very bright at all. The mirror itself is a great size though.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror to travel with but when I got it I realized that it was way too big for my suite case.  However, the lighting is perfect, both sides of the mirror are extremely clear, and the base is heavy so it won&#x27;t tip over.  Even though it is too big to travel with I&#x27;m so happy with it that I&#x27;m going to keep it as an portable home mirror.</li>
            <li> Love the mirror!  Bright light and magnification is perfect!  Price was perfect.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Would definitely recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> You have no idea long I have searched for the perfect makeup mirror.  I saw this and just thought I would go for it. And I am so glad I did! Once you turn it on, give it a second and the light gets brighter. PROS: I can pluck my eyebrows like never before CONS: I see every freakin wrinkle no matter how tiny :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom, she wears glasses which get in the way of tweezing she loves! it Very durable, great quality. Strong clear magnification. The light is soft, not obnoxious. I&#x27;ll probably be getting one for myself. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> They had this on special at Costco for $10.00. Thank God I didn&#x27;t get it online. Two reasons, the first being over priced and the second is it&#x27;s dim. Very dim. When I turned it on, there was no difference in light. I had to put my face right up to it to get any light.</li>
            <li> Good morrow, light could be better.</li>
            <li> OMG this mirror is wonderful it has nothing to envy to a one hundred or more something dollars you know them expensive brands like jerdon or zadro the light is really good all you need for a flawless makeup application is daylight-light to truly see the colors and with the 10x you cannot make any mistake you&#x27;ll be able to see what you didn&#x27;t before, I own a 5X and this is the perfect upgrade so happy I got this mirror! totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great price for such an expensive looking item. It is taller than most mirrors so I don&#x27;t have to bend over as much. The brushed silver stand goes with everything and doesn&#x27;t take up much room at the base. It is perfect for my needs and is just as described. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> The natural light is awesome!  Way better then the fluorescent lighted mirrors.  Perfect for putting your make up on.  Really great quality construction as well.</li>
            <li> Great mirror.  I bought this mirror for my daughter who loves it. It was the perfect height. It provides good lighting enough to put on her makeup without her overdoing it.  I highly recommend this lighted vanity from this maker.</li>
            <li> I spent a fair amount of money on this mirror as a gift.  What we received completely did not meet my expectations for a gift.  First, I will say that the size of the mirror is far larger than what I thought so there&#x27;s that going for them...but that&#x27;s it.  I&#x27;ll also add that the size of the mirror might be a little too bulky.  It was extremely fat but that&#x27;s because the bulb they use is an actual light bulb that we use for every day use.  Now the negative...the light bulb busted on it&#x27;s journey to me so I had to replace that.  And replacing the bulb would have been easier if the holes where the screws are weren&#x27;t off so much.  It was as if they didn&#x27;t pre-drill a hole and just stuck the screw in.  The lighting sucked, it&#x27;s a 13 watt light bulb that is suggested.  I get more light from my iPhone.  The plastic knob for the switch fell off so that was another strike.  Not to mention the mirror looked and felt plastic to me.  In any case, I would have been better off ordering a vanity mirror and a stand alone lamp.  Unless this mirror was listed for $20.00 don&#x27;t buy it.  The quality is sub-par.</li>
            <li> Other then the chip its nice! Not as bright as I thought it would be but for the price it was a good deal</li>
            <li> I am older and have trouble seeing close up.  This mirror is invaluable.  The lighting is just perfect.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great mirror. Love it. Was delivered promptly. The only thing missing is that I saw a mirror like this but it had different light settings for evening, day and office. Wish I had seen that one. But this one has plenty of light and the magnification is excellent. It&#x27;s great to put on eye makeup and actually see the details!</li>
            <li> Great for people who need &amp;#34;readers&amp;#34; for fine print!  The magnification helps to see eyebrow hairs and all those fine lines and wrinkles we get by the time we need &amp;#34;readers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I got this as a christmas gift 5 years ago. I didn&#x27;t ask for it, but it was one of the best gifts I have received. The daylight light works wonderfully, it really lets you see any mistakes you might have missed if you were using a regular mirror. The magnification side is great for working on your eyebrows, or applying eye makeup. I have used it everyday since I got it, and the lightbulb only went out last week. But buying a new lightbulb is easy, since the type they use is easy to find. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great mirror bought it at Costco for 14.99</li>
