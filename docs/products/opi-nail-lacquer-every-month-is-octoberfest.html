            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big fan, and will gladly buy again.</li>
            <li>Favorite polish such a gorgeous color!!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS POLISH.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for something a bit more plum based.</li>
            <li>Very cool product</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely beautiful wine with gold microglitter polish that will appear more red or more purple depending on the light.</li>
            <li>It is definitly more unique then a lot of the darker colors OPI has put out.</li>
            <li>all I strongly recommend the product and the seller to every body.</li>
            <li>so I went on the website and was very pleased to find it and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Such a great color.</li>
            <li>My nails both look and feel stronger and thicker when this is applied, and they stand up impressively even to chores that usually destroy my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it is now in my top ten (maybe even top five!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great color and lasts for a long time!  </li>
            <li>I love this color and have always liked OPI because it seems to last the longest on my nails.</li>
            <li>favorite shades out of an extremely large nail polish collection.</li>
            <li>love the color, fast shipping</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful dark nail color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However the seller shipped it quickly and</li>
            <li>However this color is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>If you like dark colors that can work for most skin tones for either an elegant, classic look or an edgier, vampy style with nothing more than a change of attire, this is definitely worth adding to your polish stash.</li>
            <li>So Much you notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I really liked the red in that color.  </li>
            <li>, this goes with pretty much everything and looks classic and elegant.</li>
            <li>Was WAY more red than purple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a pretty color just so not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The color is much more red than the picture.</li>
            <li>I will definitely revisit the website for more purchases.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This nail color is hands down, my favorite nail color ever!  </li>
            <li>It is a perfect deep purple, black, red color.  </li>
            <li>The color is very dark, as pictured, but has a great deal of red to it.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>expected more purple type color</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>black first and then top it with this color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the dark purple.</li>
            <li>First layer is very blue with purple undertones.  </li>
            <li>Without light it looks black.  </li>
            <li>Redder in artificial light than shown in the photo, but I still love it.</li>
            <li>Came early...</li>
            <li>This color is classy.</li>
            <li>Has a red tone, dark purple and blues depending on the light.</li>
            <li>Pretty dark stuff.  </li>
            <li>a deep Dark red-purple and sexy; changes colors slightly (to a deep burgundy with slight shimmer) in the light!&lt;br /&gt;OPI</li>
            <li>It appears as a dark red but shines a purple-ish hue, exactly like in the image.</li>
            <li>Similar to many other dark red OPI nail colors, but very different at the same time.</li>

            <li> /&gt;After trying this - together with OPI&#x27;s base &amp; top coat - I am completely converted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a little bit of a navy blue cast to it.  </li>
            <li> Not really what&#x27;s on the picture.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a dark nail polish type of girl, although I don&#x27;t usually shell out for name</li>
            <li> I find that their nailpolish lasts at least two days longer than the other brands.  </li>
            <li> high quality formula that dries without the annoying air bubbles.</li>
            <li> And very, very thin.</li>
            <li> I saw a friend with it and wanted it so bad</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This is an absolutely beautiful wine with gold microglitter polish that will appear more red or more purple depending on the light. I like it so much, it is now in my top ten (maybe even top five!) favorite shades out of an extremely large nail polish collection. If you like dark colors that can work for most skin tones for either an elegant, classic look or an edgier, vampy style with nothing more than a change of attire, this is definitely worth adding to your polish stash.</li>
            <li> I love this color! I think this will be my go to color this winter. It&#x27;s a basic dark purple with a hint of black and goes with everything. I&#x27;m a big OPI fan to begin with and this is another goody for my collection.</li>
            <li> Such a great color. I get compliments on it all the time! Perfect for fall.</li>
            <li> Was WAY more red than purple. And very, very thin. Very disappointed. It&#x27;s still a pretty color just so not what I was looking for. In order to get close to the color in the photo, I have to paint my nails black first and then top it with this color.&lt;br /&gt;However the seller shipped it quickly and it was well packaged!</li>
            <li> This goes for ALL of OPI Nail Lacquer, I LOVE ALL OF THEM!!!! Always and A+++++++ I would recommend these to everyone. Those of us who love nail polish, well we would pay to have them!!! Great colors!! Great service getting to me!!!! I love the way they shine!!!!</li>

            <li> love the color, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great color.  Dark purple that changes color in the sun.  Has a red tone, dark purple and blues depending on the light.</li>
            <li> The colour is actually a bit darker than I expected and has some undertones of dark blue/ purple, but all in all I really like it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This nail color is hands down, my favorite nail color ever!  If I could only chose one color to use for the rest of my life I would definitely chose this shade.  It is a perfect deep purple, black, red color.  It is truly gorgeous!!</li>
            <li> Redder in artificial light than shown in the photo, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful shade of purple! I got a manicure and had to buy the bottle after I left the nail salon. It has an iridescent thing going on too. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love OPI.  I find that their nailpolish lasts at least two days longer than the other brands.  The color is very dark, as pictured, but has a great deal of red to it.  It&#x27;s really lovely.</li>
            <li> Similar to many other dark red OPI nail colors, but very different at the same time. Putting it next to my other colors such as Glove You So Much you notice a huge difference. Very nice rich color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark nail polish type of girl, although I don&#x27;t usually shell out for name brands.&lt;br /&gt;After trying this - together with OPI&#x27;s base &amp; top coat - I am completely converted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gorgeous, reddish purple hue, this goes with pretty much everything and looks classic and elegant. It is also rock solid! My nails both look and feel stronger and thicker when this is applied, and they stand up impressively even to chores that usually destroy my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big fan, and will gladly buy again.</li>
            <li> LOOOOOOVE this color...already on my fingers and toes! Came early...no complaints at all!!</li>
            <li> ITS GOOD BUT IT CHIPS IN 3 DAYS SO YOU WILL NEED A GOOD TOP COAT TO SEAL IT IN.</li>

            <li> LOVE THIS POLISH. IT IS DEEPLY COLORED. IT IS NOT A ONE-DIMENSION POLISH.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dark purple nail polish and stumbled upon this color.  I had gotten my nails done with Opi&#x27;s Black Cherry Chutney.  I really liked the red in that color.

I can&#x27;t stop watching the color change in different lights.  You should buy this color.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful wine color with twinkles. The quality is beautiful and perfect for Fall and Winter. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This color is classy. It appears as a dark red but shines a purple-ish hue, exactly like in the image. It&#x27;s a great fall and winter color and I wear it all the time.</li>

            <li> This is a beautiful dark nail color. It has fabulous undertones of purples and burgandies and would look good on a variety of skin tones. It is definitly more unique then a lot of the darker colors OPI has put out.</li>
