            <li>#love</li>
            <li>Definitely better than hair from the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>I am much pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Buy you will love the hair.</li>
            <li>So I installed the hair and I will say that I am pleased.</li>
            <li>the curls were beautiful and soft.</li>
            <li>it was packaged nice and the hair feels amazing its real brazilian.</li>
            <li>Very quick to respond to customer.</li>
            <li>THIS HIS IS PRETTY NICE</li>
            <li>tangle free.</li>
            <li>hair color got light after 1st wash..</li>
            <li>i know the hair is cheap but DONT PUT 20 INCHES</li>
            <li>It holds curls and looks great wet.</li>
            <li>and I really was satisfied with the outcome.</li>
            <li>only good thing is the shipping.</li>
            <li>be true</li>
            <li>The hair is nice and soft, can&#x27;t wait to use it, would use this vender anytime.</li>
            <li>IF ITS NOT thank you and its not a 1b its more like a 2 very brown</li>
            <li>When I ordered this hair it was long, pretty, smelled good, no tangles or shedding while it was still bundled.</li>
            <li>The hair tangles very easily and must constantly be brushed.</li>
            <li>The item is exactly what it was described as.</li>
            <li>How many hair companies can offer you that for only 9.97 a month?</li>
            <li>i wish they have more if it because i only ordered 2</li>
            <li>The hair absolutely sucked!</li>
            <li>the most tangly, shedful, definitely NOT human hair</li>
            <li>When I first got the hair it looked exactly as it did on the pictures.</li>
            <li>The hair was pretty for the first day.</li>
            <li>They have better hair for the same price in the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>The hair is real!</li>
            <li>When I first got it ..</li>
            <li>It did not last more then 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li>, this would be great for someone who has super thin hair.</li>
            <li>It looks really nice in the package and is soft to the touch but as soon as you put it in your hair it is not the same.</li>
            <li>Hair feels ok but not 20in and not a full bundle you will need 4 bundles for a full head</li>
            <li>This hair was great before I washed it, I wash it tge same as I do my other extensions...</li>
            <li>Almost no  shedding, Soft and smooth high quality.</li>
            <li>They look great out of the bag but by the end of the day they look pretty thin</li>
            <li>so you will be prepared just in case because it is a very LOW price for \\&quot;brazilian\\&quot; hair :) try fabric softner to get the weave smell out the hair, soften it, and detangle the hair if u feel like its a little tangly for u :)</li>
            <li>I really appreciate it.</li>
            <li>It gets nappy too fast</li>
            <li>thanks guys 😘</li>
            <li>anyone know where I can get Real Brazilian Virgin hair...</li>
            <li>THE REAL THING..</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>&amp; I am getting ready to take it out &amp; throw it away.  </li>
            <li>hair was very tangled.</li>
            <li>It was good and thick.</li>
            <li>i highly doubt i will ever purchase hair for amazon ever agin because of the false advertisement i am truly a un happy customer</li>
            <li>This hair is really soft and blends really well!</li>
            <li>The hair felt great before it was installed tangled a little bit but after installed and da hair got wet</li>
            <li>I have been wearing weave for 3 years and wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>The hair is a bit thin at the ends compared to the top, but still definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and the bundle is full but I will have to either dye it again or try to blend in with other tracks.</li>
            <li>I say piece because it was no where near the size of a bundle.</li>
            <li>soft hair</li>
            <li>When I tried to wash the hair it complete clumped and tangled up</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li>They replied back fast and we&#x27;re very cooperative in helping me order the next two bundles.</li>
            <li>The hair did keep its natural wave and luster.</li>
            <li>Hair is very stringy and all different sizes on the weft.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and is human hair.</li>
            <li>If it is not braided at night and wrapped up it will starting looking old</li>
            <li>Ended up throwing it away, as most of the hair was broken off.</li>
            <li>but after a week it was a HOT MESS.</li>
            <li>and i looked like a hot mess on my trip.</li>
            <li>You can do better at a hair store its blended hair doesn&#x27;t, loses its wave pattern as soon as you wet it or straighten it</li>
            <li>The hair did shed a little straight out the pack maybe 3 or 4 strands.</li>

            <li> The hair did shed a little straight out the pack maybe 3 or 4 strands.</li>
            <li> It shed and could not withstand the heat of by flat irons at 450 degrees.</li>
            <li> Even if you were to blow dry or flat iron it, 10 minutes later it wouldn&#x27;t look like you did anything.</li>
            <li> It is always coarse &amp; dry looking, no matter what I put on this hair the texture or look doesn&#x27;t change.  </li>
            <li> n deep conditioned it and let it air dry this hair came to life</li>
            <li> This hair was not what i expected to be it wsnt 20inches within a few days it gotten very tangled and nappy</li>
            <li> the hair was okay at first but after washing it a few time it began to shed really badly.</li>
            <li> This was my 1st time buying Virgin Remy Hair, &amp; I thought it was a really good deal for the price that I paid, but boyyy was I wrong!!</li>
            <li> This was not a good buy the hair was so thin,I should of went with my first thought to goof too</li>
            <li> and it lasted long.  </li>
            <li> The hair took long to come...</li>
            <li> The hair was dry</li>
            <li> but u have to keep it braided because it get dry overnight.  </li>
            <li> Only a few strands were the actual length they were supposed to be.</li>
            <li> the only time it was tangle free was when it was drenched in water and even then, it shed like crazy while wet.</li>
            <li> was not what was expected</li>
            <li> please hollow.</li>
            <li> It even tangles &amp; sheds when it is wet.  </li>
            <li> Minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> I order this hair have not put it in yet, but it feels nice and soft my only problem is at the end is very thin thin thin and</li>
            <li> the bulk appears to be half a bulk not a full bulk because its very short.</li>
            <li> I will be trying to go thru other vendors from now on.</li>
            <li> BUT OTHER</li>
            <li> I really thought that the hair was going to be fake.</li>
            <li> Product is not real Brazilian don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> This was not as advertised it was dyed black with temp coloring so as soon as I washed it</li>
            <li> , the water did not turn black.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s has so much black dye in it.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE</li>
            <li> It is poor quality, no matter who is selling it, when it comes in the blue packaging with the little lady on the front...</li>
            <li> so money wasted..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money or time</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
            <li> I use it everyday &amp; when I wash it</li>
            <li> onced it air dried</li>
            <li> I have bought many bundles of hair and this is the worst piece of hair I&#x27;ve ever gotten</li>
            <li> &quot; the hair is horrible  and on the thin side waste of my money never again could of had better hair from the hair</li>
            <li> It started to tangle and shed bad the first day and got worse each day.</li>
            <li> A little thin</li>
            <li> the welts are thick  </li>
            <li> and i was forced to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I mean shed like a dog.</li>
            <li> Seriously ladies, this is that $19.99 hair in the beauty supply.</li>

            <li> Received the item in the estimated delivery time, more towards the end, but on time nonetheless!! The item is exactly what it was described as. The hair is a bit thin at the ends compared to the top, but still definitely worth the price. I can&#x27;t conplain. Very happy with the product, the shipping and overall experience!</li>
            <li> this hair shed like a dog! I thought I will be good quality hair but I was wrong. just horrible</li>
            <li> no real, low hair, dont buy it</li>
            <li> I just received my hair, and while it is nice hair it is NOT 20 INCHES. I will be trying to go thru other vendors from now on.</li>
            <li> This was not as advertised it was dyed black with temp coloring so as soon as I washed it I saw it was med brown w/red highlights.  The hair is soft and the bundle is full but I will have to either dye it again or try to blend in with other tracks.</li>
            <li> For those wanting to wear 5A hair and only have to purchase two bundles then go to [...] You get what you pay for! Not only will you be buying quality hair for a discount but sign up and become a rep to ear money off your sustomer orders. How many hair companies can offer you that for only 9.97 a month?</li>
            <li> This item was supposed to be 3 pieces, HOWEVER I RECEIVED ONLY 1., This cannot be used.</li>
            <li> was not what was expected</li>
            <li> This hair looked FAB after wash and install. but after a week it was a HOT MESS. I did Ombre the tips so maybe I wrecked the hair because I had to bleach it for hours because it would not change color after a lot of bleach. I purchased this for my cruise and i looked like a hot mess on my trip. people probably though what is wrong with that chicks hair!!! so money wasted..</li>
            <li> Great Job!!!! I loved my package and I really was satisfied with the outcome. I really appreciate it. Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> This hair is freakin amazing i love itt i wish they have more if it because i only ordered 2 but i need one more lol this hair rocks</li>
            <li> i  loved the hair , nice price and it lasted long.  tangle free. washable.  very nice. i loved it .  great</li>
            <li> got this for my granddaughter she needed this for school she want to be a hairdresser and  they needed to  put these in their hair and get graded on  how well they did it</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as curly as I taught but its okay</li>
            <li> The hair absolutely sucked! There was no way that was 100% human. It only last one week. It shedded drastically then brgan to fuse together. Please read reviews when it comes to this Amazon s***</li>
            <li> they sent my hair to another state i asked for a refund its suspicious activities to me they probably do it all the time to people to see if they repert it or not</li>
            <li> The worst hair ever but that&#x27;s what discounts get you!! Don&#x27;t waste ur money or time the most tangly, shedful, definitely NOT human hair I want my money back all of it including S&amp;H Only had it for 2 wks it&#x27;s a total DISASTER</li>
            <li> Thin thin thin piece of hair. I say piece because it was no where near the size of a bundle. I have bought many bundles of hair and this is the worst piece of hair I&#x27;ve ever gotten</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with my purchase although care instruction was enclosed more knowledge Should be given to ensure maximum aChievement.</li>
            <li> i purchased this hair a couple weeks ago.  it came extremely fast however the quality of the hair was horrible. I am returning it for a refund</li>
            <li> I really thought that the hair was going to be fake. I washed it, and it did NOT mat up. The hair CAN be Bleached &amp; Colored. I washed it after  and it STILL had  it curl pattern. Oh but I am a stylist so I know how to handle the hair. Over all it was a good deal.IM happy</li>
            <li> This hair is really soft and blends really well! Easy to style also! Best hair I have gotten yet! Yup</li>
            <li> It gets nappy too fast</li>
            <li> Its seem to have a okay quality  look to it ...soft hair the welts are thick  the color looks good</li>
            <li> This was a very bad grade of hair it shedded bad and matted. Basically it was mixed blended and was suppose to be 100% human. Terrible</li>
            <li> This is bad hair. It looks really nice in the package and is soft to the touch but as soon as you put it in your hair it is not the same. The hair tangles very easily and must constantly be brushed. Even if you were to blow dry or flat iron it, 10 minutes later it wouldn&#x27;t look like you did anything. When I tried to wash the hair it complete clumped and tangled up and i was forced to throw it away.</li>
            <li> the hair was okay at first but after washing it a few time it began to shed really badly. I mean shed like a dog.</li>
            <li> I love this hair thanks guys 😘😘😘😁😁</li>
            <li> I do not think this is virgin or Brazilian Hair.  It shedded and was of a questionable quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone know where I can get Real Brazilian Virgin hair...please hollow.</li>
            <li> I order this hair have not put it in yet, but it feels nice and soft my only problem is at the end is very thin thin thin and the bulk appears to be half a bulk not a full bulk because its very short.</li>
            <li> They look great out of the bag but by the end of the day they look pretty thin so I have to constantly brush them out, this would be great for someone who has super thin hair.</li>
            <li> Hair feels ok but not 20in and not a full bundle you will need 4 bundles for a full head the end of the hair is very thin</li>
            <li> This is the WORST hair I&#x27;ve ever purchased. VERY thin at the ends. Ended up throwing it away, as most of the hair was broken off. Only a few strands were the actual length they were supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money I order a 20\\&quot; and the hair is more like a 16\\&quot; the hair is horrible  and on the thin side waste of my money never again could of had better hair from the hair store.the only good thing is the shipping.</li>
            <li> SOFT AND VERY GOOD QUALITY.. THE REAL THING.. MY FRIEND WOULD LIKE SOME..I RECOMMENDED THEM.. CAN I ORDER TWO MORE PACKS FOR DEL BEFORE CHRISTMAS?</li>
            <li> I really like it I use it everyday &amp; when I wash it the color don&#x27;t come off , would get it again (:</li>
            <li> The hair felt great before it was installed tangled a little bit but after installed and da hair got wet it tangled really bad u would have to brush it every 5 minutes I would not recommend this hair n they called n asked could they take my review n refund my money</li>
            <li> Any hair that comes with this packaging is the same.  When I 1st got the hair, &amp; had it installed I was thrilled.  This was my 1st time buying Virgin Remy Hair, &amp; I thought it was a really good deal for the price that I paid, but boyyy was I wrong!! THIS HAIR SHEDS SOOOOOOO BAD!! &amp; THE TANGLING IS EVEN WORSE!!!! I have to comb this hair out about 6-8 times a day no lie.  It is always coarse &amp; dry looking, no matter what I put on this hair the texture or look doesn&#x27;t change.  It even tangles &amp; sheds when it is wet.  I have only had this hair in 3 weeks &amp; I am getting ready to take it out &amp; throw it away.  I have even become ashamed to be seen with this horrible hair in my head.  It is poor quality, no matter who is selling it, when it comes in the blue packaging with the little lady on the front...AVOID BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY!!! I will never buy this hair again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair and was really skeptical...,but this hair is great... When I first got the hair it looked exactly as it did on the pictures. The hair was dry I washed it n deep conditioned it and let it air dry this hair came to life the curls were beautiful and soft. The hair was lighter brown so i put color rinse and it turned out great. I was pleasantly surprised. Will buy again for the price..</li>
            <li> The hair was pretty for the first day. The beautician who sew hair even said it was bad hair. They have better hair for the same price in the beauty supply store. I had to take this hair out by the seventh day. It matted up so badly that I could not even comb it. It started to tangle and shed bad the first day and got worse each day. I never had a sew-in for a such a short period of time. I have been wearing weave for 3 years and wanted to try something new. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Seriously ladies, this is that $19.99 hair in the beauty supply.</li>
            <li> Terrible, Terrible, Terrible hair! Sheds and tangles in a knot as you wear it. I will never buy this again!!</li>
            <li> The hair is real! When I first got it .. it was packaged nice and the hair feels amazing its real brazilian. No shedding at all. It does come with one bundle so I ordered 2 more bit I can&#x27;t wait to put it in. Also if you have a problem just email the seller. They replied back fast and we&#x27;re very cooperative in helping me order the next two bundles. #love I Will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I purchase 3 bundles of hair from this seller 2 Peruvian and 1 Brazilian.The hair came on time and the seller was quite helpful. However a soon as I saw it i realized that it wasn&#x27;t Brazilian hair but Peruvian hair. I was going for a mix of Brazilian and Peruvian but end up all Peruvian, that&#x27;s was the only downfall.</li>
            <li> This hair was not what i expected to be it wsnt 20inches within a few days it gotten very tangled and nappy and i have been purchashing brazilian remy for about a year never and never have i ever had to bt deal with hair like this before. i wish i could ask for my money back after this i highly doubt i will ever purchase hair for amazon ever agin because of the false advertisement i am truly a un happy customer</li>
            <li> Definitely better than hair from the beauty supply store. Curls well. Minimal shedding. A little thin but I love it!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this hair it was long, pretty, smelled good, no tangles or shedding while it was still bundled. After the hair  was installed, it tangled very badly, it matted in the back constantly, it shed sooooo bad. i literally had hair balls after every time I brushed or combed it. when i washed it, the color came out. It went from a 1B to a 4. the only time it was tangle free was when it was drenched in water and even then, it shed like crazy while wet. even when i cut it up to my shoulders, it was still tangling really bad and shedding everywhere. i couldnt even run my fingers thru it.</li>
            <li> it was alright I just felt like they feel to short to be 20 inches...I didn&#x27;t like the length .</li>
            <li> THIS HIS IS PRETTY NICE I HAVEN&#x27;T STRAIGHTEN IT YET THE ENDS ARE A LIL KNOTTY SHEDS A LITTLE BUT OTHER THEN THAT ITS NICE BETTER THEN SALLYS HAIR THATS FORSURE.</li>
            <li> The hair took long to come...nice when 1styou put in.. hair color got light after 1st wash..hair was very tangled. I can only maintain it if it was braid in one big braid. It did not last more then 3 weeks. Definitely wasted my money.  :(</li>
            <li> This hair was great before I washed it, I wash it tge same as I do my other extensions...onced it air dried it stayed frizzy and often Matt up. however it held up for a month!!</li>
            <li> This hair is really good! I was a bit scared since I saw tons of bad reviews. I am much pleased with the results. Almost no  shedding, Soft and smooth high quality. Although it does have a bit of a processed smell.</li>
            <li> The hair was suppose to be delivered Jan 29-31 but it actually came jan 25th and i ordered it on the 22nd so it was excellent shipping. The hair did shed a little straight out the pack maybe 3 or 4 strands. when i washed the hair it did SHED alot but it kept its color 1b, the water did not turn black. After washing and conditioning the hair it did not shed at all. After it dried it had 1 or 2 strands but very minimum shedding. This is actually good hair i can honestly see why the hair sheds because the WEFTS arent as neat as they should be but if you SEAL your wefts before installation you shouldnt have a severe shedding problem. The hair did keep its natural wave and luster. I suggest before you buy the hair you research how to deal with shedding and tangles so you will be prepared just in case because it is a very LOW price for \\&quot;brazilian\\&quot; hair :) try fabric softner to get the weave smell out the hair, soften it, and detangle the hair if u feel like its a little tangly for u :)</li>
            <li> This was not a good buy the hair was so thin,I should of went with my first thought to goof too be true it was horrible!</li>
            <li> Please do not purchase this hair! Hair is very stringy and all different sizes on the weft. Not a good deal at all. Very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> The hair is nice and soft, can&#x27;t wait to use it, would use this vender anytime. Very quick to respond to customer., don&#x27;t be scared to buy from them, with all the bad reviews,  I was afraid to buy from here.  Buy you will love the hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered one bundle just to try it out amidst the mixed reviews. Hair is soft and is human hair. However it sheds a bit and I recommend sealing the wefts before installing. It needs to be washed and moisturized often just like human hair. I&#x27;&#x27;ll definitely be buying again</li>
            <li> Hair was good quality and good length but u have to keep it braided because it get dry overnight.  If it is not braided at night and wrapped up it will starting looking old</li>
            <li> i know the hair is cheap but DONT PUT 20 INCHES IF ITS NOT thank you and its not a 1b its more like a 2 very brown</li>
            <li> Product is not real Brazilian don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> It shed and could not withstand the heat of by flat irons at 450 degrees. It was good and thick. Alright for synthetic hair. Good price</li>
            <li> The hair is terrible, the bundle was thin as hell and not even a 20in it was a good 16in. I advise all not to buy!!!!! You can do better at a hair store its blended hair doesn&#x27;t, loses its wave pattern as soon as you wet it or straighten it , it&#x27;s has so much black dye in it. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> So I installed the hair and I will say that I am pleased. It holds curls and looks great wet.</li>
