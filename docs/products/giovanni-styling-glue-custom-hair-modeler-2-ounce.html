            <li>Among the best pomades I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>shipment was perfect</li>
            <li>this helps, have a great day!</li>
            <li>This is great stuff!  </li>
            <li>Good hold, very light</li>
            <li>So of course I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>This styling product is water-based so doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I think it looks better for that.  </li>
            <li>All in all, this is my favorite pomade, bar none.</li>
            <li>So much better than the Giovanni Wicked Texture.</li>
            <li>The styling glue has better hold - still the matte finish.</li>
            <li>my sons use it to style their hair and love it</li>
            <li>My hairsylist uses this product which I love.</li>
            <li>This product used to be my favorite but</li>
            <li>My boo really likes it and it makes his hair smell amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;*update, after reading the review by the mom who doesn&#x27;t believe this is a great product because it doesn&#x27;t have great hold, i read the instructions, and followed them, the \\&quot;problems\\&quot; with a firm hold i was experiencing as well(but</li>
            <li>They should call the &amp;#34;wicked texture&amp;#34; a styling gel instead, and call this Giovanni Wicked Fiber/texture, because it more accurately reflects what you get.</li>
            <li>It also washes out easily</li>
            <li>Depending on the look you&#x27;re going for, you&#x27;ll get a more full look if your hair is drier.  </li>
            <li>Delivered quickly!</li>
            <li>same great quality as the pomade, and same great price.  </li>
            <li>Despite my requests to special order, they were unwilling/unable to accommodate me.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>Love this natural product.  </li>
            <li>The styling glue actually holds my hair nicely BUT does not work well in the hot humid heat.</li>
            <li>Generally in my experience and opinion paste like this is better for shorter spikier hair.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent and even though I use it daily and only shampoo once a week</li>
            <li>Thick, with great holding power, but</li>
            <li>first I thought it was just a defective item</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like elmers...</li>
            <li>My scalp itched with many other products, but rarely at all with this one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;American Crew (Giovanni is superior, in my opinion), and this product is actually sold by Whole Foods and (obviously) meets their product standards.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really need a lot of it, just the size of a dime rubbed throughout your hands and fingertips.  </li>
            <li>hair very sticky</li>
            <li>I like Giavanni Styling Glue because of its gentle ingredients</li>
            <li>but I feel like I really need to use a lot to get the piecey look to my hair.</li>
            <li>This products works very well with my hair.</li>
            <li>I wasted $40 but kept ordering because I liked this product so much...</li>
            <li>I went back to buying it at whole foods and its much better with no white specs.</li>
            <li>I live in NY and its very humid in the summer.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it washes out very easily and is definitely a matte finish which I love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty new to short hair stying products.</li>
            <li>that doesn&#x27;t leave your head feeling gross like many other products.  </li>
            <li>When you first open the container, you think what the hell am I putting on my hair?!?!?</li>
            <li>So, during the summer I use Mandom Gatsby Moving Rubber Wild Shake.</li>
            <li>Although several beauty supplies in my area carry the product line,  none of them carried this particular item.</li>
            <li>I recently cut my hair pixie short for the first time in my life</li>
            <li>This one goes down as my all time favorite for its ability to hold without giving my hair that really wet look.</li>
            <li>There are grainy bulks of the material that will not spread out and will leave highly noticeable white residue on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product does not flake or make your hair stiff but its strong enough to hold your hairstyle.</li>
            <li>I wanted something vegan that I could play around with and make different styles out of my new haircut.  </li>
            <li>I had bought this same product from whole foods several times and saw that I could get it cheaper on Amazon, so of course I bought it here.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a decent product considering how limited natural hair styilng products are.</li>
            <li>Comparable to American Crew Fiber in quality - only with natural products.</li>
            <li>I have coarse/curly hair cut in a pixie style and use this daily with a little Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair oil first.  </li>

            <li> I have coarse/curly hair cut in a pixie style and use this daily with a little Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair oil first.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it.  It has a nice light scent and even though I use it daily and only shampoo once a week it doesn&#x27;t build up or aggravate my scalp.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s natural.  My scalp itched with many other products, but rarely at all with this one.  Good hold, very light that doesn&#x27;t leave your head feeling gross like many other products.  Don&#x27;t really need a lot of it, just the size of a dime rubbed throughout your hands and fingertips.  Depending on the look you&#x27;re going for, you&#x27;ll get a more full look if your hair is drier.  Generally in my experience and opinion paste like this is better for shorter spikier hair.  I think it looks better for that.  I use this when my hair is shorter, otherwise, I prefer hair spray when a bit longer which keeps a slightly nicer wet look that I can shape out of the shower and then just use hair spray to hold that in place.  Paste requires you to style and it holds to that style then.</li>
            <li> Among the best pomades I&#x27;ve ever used.  Thick, with great holding power, but not crazy thick like, for example, crew cut waxes like Murray&#x27;s (although I like Murray&#x27;s).  I used to think of this product as somewhat spendy, although I no longer think so - way less money than, say,&lt;br /&gt;American Crew (Giovanni is superior, in my opinion), and this product is actually sold by Whole Foods and (obviously) meets their product standards.  All in all, this is my favorite pomade, bar none.</li>
            <li> I just received the product and it is not what is advertised on the photo of the product. The one I received does not say &amp;#34;organic hair care&amp;#34; next to the logo. The product I received also contains alcohol while the list of ingredients on the amazon page doesn&#x27;t. I was looking for an alcohol free product and pretty disappointed that the one I received is not.</li>
            <li> I wanted something vegan that I could play around with and make different styles out of my new haircut.  I bought Giovanni&#x27;s styling glue and one of their pomade styling products as well, and ended up liking them both.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a moderate hold.</li>
            <li> i have bought this product online in the past and rarely (but much to my dissapointment) it has arrived old and past any used...very tacky and not smooth like i know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this shipment was perfect</li>
            <li> same great quality as the pomade, and same great price.  no scent, nothing negative to say about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update, after reading the review by the mom who doesn&#x27;t believe this is a great product because it doesn&#x27;t have great hold, i read the instructions, and followed them, the \\&quot;problems\\&quot; with a firm hold i was experiencing as well(but did not mind) were solved when i applied to thoroughly dried hair.  i found when applying it to damp hair and then blow drying it, created a \\&quot;loose hold\\&quot; but now, i blow dry/air dry, then apply to completely dry hair, and the biggest complaint i have is too much hold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps, have a great day!</li>
            <li> So much better than the Giovanni Wicked Texture. The styling glue has better hold - still the matte finish. Comparable to American Crew Fiber in quality - only with natural products. They should call the &amp;#34;wicked texture&amp;#34; a styling gel instead, and call this Giovanni Wicked Fiber/texture, because it more accurately reflects what you get. - Guy with short/medium long hair</li>
            <li> the hold is weak&lt;br /&gt;makes hair very sticky&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t use it again&lt;br /&gt;i do not recommend for those you want to spike or have a long lasting hold</li>
            <li> my sons use it to style their hair and love it</li>
            <li> My hairsylist uses this product which I love. Although several beauty supplies in my area carry the product line,  none of them carried this particular item. Despite my requests to special order, they were unwilling/unable to accommodate me. My daughter found it on Amazon.com for half the price that my hairdresser pays! So of course I am thrilled. This styling product is water-based so doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair own. It also washes out easily</li>
            <li> This product used to be my favorite but the last 5 orders for me was all bad. I&#x27;m not sure if the seller made a mistake with storing it at a high temperature area or if the recent batch of the product was bad but the last 5 of them I ordered all had problem with grainy residue. There are grainy bulks of the material that will not spread out and will leave highly noticeable white residue on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it was just a defective item but the the next order was the same. I then switched the seller and ordered two and again same white residue issue. I stopped ordering for 3 months and tried ordering again and the item I received still had same issue. I wasted $40 but kept ordering because I liked this product so much... Now I have moved on to a different product.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this.  I had bought this same product from whole foods several times and saw that I could get it cheaper on Amazon, so of course I bought it here.  Well, I don&#x27;t know if Amazon is selling inauthentic or whether they&#x27;re taking messed up batches off of the manufacturer&#x27;s hands but the product was gritty and you could see the gritty white specs in my hair after styling.  I thought that maybe I just got a &amp;#34;one off&amp;#34; and ordered it again, and the second one was the same gritty pomade.  I went back to buying it at whole foods and its much better with no white specs.</li>
            <li> I recently cut my hair pixie short for the first time in my life so I&#x27;m pretty new to short hair stying products. I like Giavanni Styling Glue because of its gentle ingredients but I feel like I really need to use a lot to get the piecey look to my hair. If I&#x27;m not messing with my hair all day it holds but if it&#x27;s touched a lot (windy day or if the kiddos are climbing on me) it seems to \\&quot;disappear.\\&quot; On the other hand, it washes out very easily and is definitely a matte finish which I love.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a decent product considering how limited natural hair styilng products are. I would use it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of hair products in my day. This one goes down as my all time favorite for its ability to hold without giving my hair that really wet look. Giovanni has secured a customer for life. Also, Giovanni&#x27;s dedication to providing a high-quality, animal cruelty-free product is just icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!  I have short, heavy hair and nothing but GLUE keeps it the way I want it!</li>
            <li> This had bits of white particulate in it. When applied to my hair it looked as if I had flakes... Now, I used this product before a while back and can&#x27;t recall that but I won&#x27;t be take my chances again with it.</li>
            <li> Love this natural product.  Delivered quickly!</li>
            <li> My boo really likes it and it makes his hair smell amazing!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something wrong with this.  It&#x27;s grainy and the texture is not like it is when I&#x27;ve bought it from other retailers.</li>
            <li> I have used Giovanni Styling Glue for over 3 years. When you first open the container, you think what the hell am I putting on my hair?!?!? It looks exactly like elmers... This products works very well with my hair. I have thin medium length hair which is difficult to style. The styling glue actually holds my hair nicely BUT does not work well in the hot humid heat. I live in NY and its very humid in the summer. So, during the summer I use Mandom Gatsby Moving Rubber Wild Shake. All other seasons I use Giovanni Styling Glue. The product does not flake or make your hair stiff but its strong enough to hold your hairstyle.</li>
