            <li>I notice a lot of people say it&#x27;s too clumpy, I used one layer and found it very nice and lengthening.</li>
            <li>I found it very nice after one layer though.</li>
            <li>It goes on beautifully and the end result is amazing.</li>
            <li>I heard good things about this mascara</li>
            <li>The brush does not work good at all.</li>
            <li>I will us it as I need it to look good</li>
            <li>It works good and it wasn&#x27;t clumpy.</li>
            <li>It actually is better!</li>
            <li>, never find one that can be used on there own.</li>
            <li>Good mascara but not any better than Cover Girl or Maybelline.</li>
            <li>That being said this is a really nice mascara</li>
            <li>I love too faced cosmetics</li>
            <li>There are drugstore mascara&#x27;s that work better then this that are cheaper in price.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>Just ok it was sorta gummy.  </li>
            <li>I have used many mascara&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>The way I wear it is with Maybelline&#x27;s Rocket Mascara in Waterproof to hold the curl of my lashes and then use this mascara on top.</li>
            <li>It looks stunning and I always get compliments on my eyes when I wear it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this mascara because I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok and it flakes.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I had better stick to my Clean Definition mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara didn&#x27;t get clumpy and it really fills out your lashes and fans them out nicely.</li>
            <li>But I could definitely use this on it&#x27;s own with 2 layers!</li>
            <li>and I will be betting the full size</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually true.....</li>
            <li>Not bad if you&#x27;re going for the &amp;#34;goth/I&#x27;m so sad/</li>
            <li>and it makes my lashes super luscious.</li>
            <li>Bought a full size right after I got this one.</li>
            <li>Not better than sex, but darn good!  </li>
            <li>i use it over top a dry coat of waterpoof just to add more volume, and it doesnt dissapoint</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the price</li>
            <li>totally worth the money and shipping</li>
            <li>This was a fun purchase</li>
            <li>I can use a store bought mascara that costs a third of the cost of this product and it works better that this</li>
            <li>I more than likely will not buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I use it over a white primer and then add the lash flakes on top</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t spend $23 on the regular size.  </li>
            <li>It was not sealed either which made me very cautious in using it in the first place.</li>
            <li>I say that because i know others with this same size and the packaging did not look as cheap</li>
            <li>but I had so much going on that</li>
            <li>was fast.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day unless I wipe my eyes too much</li>
            <li>I really thought i&#x27;d regret buying this mascara</li>
            <li>but the mascara really runs.  </li>
            <li>This black mascara goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li>I definitely wouldn&#x27;t pay $20+ for the full sized version.</li>
            <li>this mascarra is my new fave!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes about this product</li>
            <li>Lashes are full and long</li>
            <li>Not too different than many other mascaras.  </li>
            <li>While I did find a huge difference with just one coat, I have to say it did clump up after the second coat and only lasted a few hours before I ended up with raccoon eyes ( just to be clear, i only had the mascara on, no other eye makeup).</li>
            <li>I can barely see the mascara on my eyes when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not enough to even put a slight smile on my face.</li>
            <li>I think i will try the regular size and will buy it directly from their site next time.</li>
            <li>Gets lashes looking full and thick.</li>
            <li>It smudges on lower lashes for racoon eyes, and does not last as long as other mascaras such as Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real.</li>

            <li> you need very little to make HUGE lashes and it is non irritating....</li>
            <li> so i wanted to try out the travel version before commiting to the larger size as it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Harder to use on bottom lashes, but if careful, it will work.</li>
            <li> I just went past the days that I could have sent it back.</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do but a bit pricey for such a small amount...</li>
            <li> I did not find that this mascara did anything different from my usual brand.  </li>
            <li> This is not worth the price</li>
            <li> Not worth the hype.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I wish the brush was slightly thinner, not shorter, as for easier application onto my lower lashes.  </li>
            <li> It adheres to my lashes well and doesn&#x27;t clump but by the end of the day I look like I&#x27;ve been crying due to the mascara &amp;#34;snow&amp;#34; under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Thick, long eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Not special.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> This was the little tester size.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well the product works, because it was somewhat dried out.</li>
            <li> way too clumpy for me, and it wore off on my skin after a few hours...</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I opened it and it was completely dried out.</li>
            <li> if only it was less expensive I would wear this mascara everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the way it suppose to be, but I plan to return it.</li>
            <li> it is like putting on fake eyelashes, I have never gotten a compliment on my eye make-up until last week from the shampoo girl at my salon.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they have all the hype about this mascara.  </li>
            <li> A little dried out!!!</li>
            <li> Trying to use the mascara was like putting sludge on your eyelashes - way too thick and clumpy.  </li>
            <li> then it slowly comes off.  </li>
            <li> However, the application is very messy as the applicator is poorly designed.</li>
            <li> i was wrong.</li>
            <li> and I am so disappointed!!  </li>

            <li> Great mascara!  Gives lashes great length and no clumps.</li>
            <li> I love too faced cosmetics and I have to say this mascara didn&#x27;t disappoint. This mascara didn&#x27;t get clumpy and it really fills out your lashes and fans them out nicely. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this mascara so i wanted to try out the travel version before commiting to the larger size as it is a little pricey. While I did find a huge difference with just one coat, I have to say it did clump up after the second coat and only lasted a few hours before I ended up with raccoon eyes ( just to be clear, i only had the mascara on, no other eye makeup). Im not sure if this was all because this product was not the real deal. I say that because i know others with this same size and the packaging did not look as cheap and i found that the brush on this one did not have the hourglass shape ive heard makes all the difference.  I think i will try the regular size and will buy it directly from their site next time.</li>
            <li> There are drugstore mascara&#x27;s that work better then this that are cheaper in price. This is not worth the price</li>
            <li> I notice a lot of people say it&#x27;s too clumpy, I used one layer and found it very nice and lengthening. I guess after 3 coats it might clump, but just take a comb and brush through your lashes! I found it very nice after one layer though. I layer my mascaras though, never find one that can be used on there own. But I could definitely use this on it&#x27;s own with 2 layers!</li>
            <li> Good mascara but not any better than Cover Girl or Maybelline. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t pay $20+ for the full sized version.</li>
            <li> This is not &amp;#34;better than sex&amp;#34;!! It&#x27;s not enough to even put a slight smile on my face. (Figuratively speaking).  I had high hopes about this product and I am so disappointed!!  The brush does not work good at all. I can barely see the mascara on my eyes when I put it on.  I can use a store bought mascara that costs a third of the cost of this product and it works better that this. I was going to send it back but I had so much going on that I just went past the days that I could have sent it back.</li>
            <li> Trying to use the mascara was like putting sludge on your eyelashes - way too thick and clumpy.  Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. The hour glass shaped brush gets even the tiniest lashes at the corners of the eye. My lashes look great and they weren&#x27;t clumped together.</li>
            <li> It smudges on lower lashes for racoon eyes, and does not last as long as other mascaras such as Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real.</li>
            <li> if only it was less expensive I would wear this mascara everyday. it is like putting on fake eyelashes, I have never gotten a compliment on my eye make-up until last week from the shampoo girl at my salon.</li>
            <li> It was ok. Not special. Just ok it was sorta gummy.  I will us it as I need it to look good</li>
            <li> I was impressed by this mascara.. It works good and it wasn&#x27;t clumpy. I think it is worth the price and I will be betting the full size</li>
            <li> totally worth the money and shipping was fast. this mascarra is my new fave! i use it over top a dry coat of waterpoof just to add more volume, and it doesnt dissapoint</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do but a bit pricey for such a small amount...a larger sized at the same amt. would be perfect</li>
            <li> I did not find that this mascara did anything different from my usual brand.  I more than likely will not buy it again.  It was not sealed either which made me very cautious in using it in the first place.</li>

It looks stunning and I always get compliments on my eyes when I wear it. Buy this mascara, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I really thought i&#x27;d regret buying this mascara but it turned out i was wrong. It makes your lashes look fuller and really beautiful.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they have all the hype about this mascara.  Glad I didn&#x27;t spend $23 on the regular size.  Works like regular mascara to me.</li>
            <li> The best mascara Ive ever used.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mascara because I love it. When it arrived, I opened it and it was completely dried out. Didn&#x27;t get to use it at all!</li>
            <li> Not worth the hype.  It&#x27;s ok and it flakes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually true.....you need very little to make HUGE lashes and it is non irritating....I will buy again and definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This was a fun purchase and I like the wand but the mascara really runs.  It adheres to my lashes well and doesn&#x27;t clump but by the end of the day I look like I&#x27;ve been crying due to the mascara &amp;#34;snow&amp;#34; under my eyes.  Not bad if you&#x27;re going for the &amp;#34;goth/I&#x27;m so sad/I&#x27;ve been working so hard&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Not better than sex, but darn good!  Gives lashes great volume and coverage.  Harder to use on bottom lashes, but if careful, it will work.</li>
            <li> Definitely adds definition. Gets lashes looking full and thick. However, the application is very messy as the applicator is poorly designed.</li>
            <li> It actually is better! I love this mascara. It goes on beautifully and the end result is amazing. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Thick, long eye lashes.</li>
