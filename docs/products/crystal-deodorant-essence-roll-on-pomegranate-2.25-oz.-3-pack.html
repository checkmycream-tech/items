            <li>Ordering it in the three pack is the most cost effective and you can keep one in the gym bag, one in the bathroom and one in the car for the emergency.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, great price, received quickly and would order again.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fine with me!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to use chemical anti-antiperspirants, but many of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ones did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for many years and love it .</li>
            <li>I have re ordered this again and still love it .</li>
            <li>I used to get the unscented version, but I love the scent of the Pomegranate.</li>
            <li>I love the Pomegranate scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light too, which I love.</li>
            <li>I started using Crystal Deodorant in 2012 and its really my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use it on cleaned skin.</li>
            <li>But this was the sure solution for me.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about carcinogens when using it.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant line.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Best deodorant around-and NO Aluminum Chlorohydrate to contribute to potential cancer.</li>
            <li>Just ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li>I make most of my purchases on-line because I don&#x27;t have time...</li>
            <li>This deodorant lasts long and smells great!</li>
            <li>Love the light scent and ease of use.  </li>
            <li>Most of all, it is aluminum free.</li>
            <li>Easy to spot.  </li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t even happen as quickly if I don&#x27;t put deodorant on at all!</li>
            <li>I loved how my skin felt using this product, but it wasn&#x27;t effective for very long...</li>
            <li>I use as many natural products as I can, and this is just another amazing product.  </li>
            <li>It was bizarre.</li>
            <li>Aluminum free is why I buy it</li>
            <li>I would put this on the subscription if available.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is great for it&#x27;s very short list of ingrediants.  </li>
            <li>, I recently had a baby and experienced a significant increase in odor after it.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh clean scent, works well, and is safe to use.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to have a pretty scented deodorant in years.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant after trying SO many natural ones.</li>
            <li>I avoid antiperspirants because of their chemical content, so finding a good effective deodorant is not easy.</li>
            <li>these smell good and last all day</li>
            <li>It works and it&#x27;s not bad for you health.</li>
            <li>I am super allergic to aluminum deodorant and</li>
            <li>It dries rather quickly</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>No irritation and a mild scent.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that- don&#x27;t plan to workout and think you going to get away with it - without reapplying more :)</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent.  </li>
            <li>I love it, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Doesnt give me any rashes like other deodorants and has a very nice smell.</li>
            <li>I do hope the Natural product industry can come out with something more in an anti-perspirant in the near future, but until then, will continue to use this, and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I feel fresh.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love that they&#x27;re natural, and I will keep using them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many natural deodorants, it seems, and I haven&#x27;t had any luck with them working.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and that it&#x27;s a roll-on.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell &amp; the bottle lasts a long while-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s free of harsh chemicals, yet it keeps me feeling fresh and odor free better than most commercial brand deodorants.  </li>
            <li>My husband even uses it and likes it very much.</li>
            <li>It does not fell sticky, although you might have to put on more that the usual deodorant, but it is fine!</li>
            <li>and this is just one more way of using a product that doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of extra chemicals.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>I used to use the unscented version with reasonable success.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like this..</li>
            <li>It works pretty well</li>
            <li>I love that I can get the Pomegranate one on here as my local stores don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but ordered 2 for $9.82 &amp; never received the 2nd roll-on!!!!</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work-- as someone with super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Amazing, I have been looking for an alternative to the aluminum containing deodorants for a few years.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant.</li>
            <li>And cover your whole armpit area.</li>
            <li>I like natural scents and this product works and smells fresh.  </li>
            <li>No more stinky pits, glad I ordered this!</li>
            <li>It has a light scent, and keeps you from smelling yourself all day long.  </li>
            <li>Been using this brand for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I like that they don&#x27;t irritate my skin (unlike Tom&#x27;s long-lasting, whose name has more to do with how long my underarm skin was scarred than how long its odor protection lasts).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a roll-on fan, but again, the MUA reviews did not steer me wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I also wanted something natural, and although this does have Potassium Alum, the jury is still out to whether this is harmful or not.</li>
            <li>Wow - never in a million years</li>
            <li>The pomegranate is fruity but not heavy or cloying.</li>
            <li>When I was looking for a natural deodorant that had a scent I found this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural deodorant there is.  </li>
            <li>However, they do work, only on clean underarms, as some other reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li>Apparently my baby needs to SMELL me!!</li>
            <li>Love the scent, plus it is hard to find in our local drug stores.</li>
            <li>If you are new to Crystal (stone or liquid) then know that it takes about 5 days of not using traditional deodorant for this type of product to work.&lt;br /&gt;Catching</li>
            <li>I certainly am of the opinion it has less ingredients as a whole than regular drug store deodorants .</li>
            <li>the past several years, I apply in the morning and am BO free for almost 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>The list of ingredients is as follows: Purified Water, Natural Mineral Salts, Potassium Alum, Cellulose, Pomegranate Fragrance, Essential Oils and Extracts.</li>
            <li>I completely agree with Alyssa D&#x27;s comment above.  </li>
            <li>This did not work, I smelled unpleasant pretty quickly under normal day-to-day conditions.</li>
            <li>Love this deoderant that is free of aluminum and other bad things.  </li>

            <li> I like that they don&#x27;t irritate my skin (unlike Tom&#x27;s long-lasting, whose name has more to do with how long my underarm skin was scarred than how long its odor protection lasts).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a roll-on fan, but again, the MUA reviews did not steer me wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I also wanted something natural, and although this does have Potassium Alum, the jury is still out to whether this is harmful or not.</li>
            <li> Wow - never in a million years</li>
            <li> The pomegranate is fruity but not heavy or cloying.</li>
            <li> When I was looking for a natural deodorant that had a scent I found this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural deodorant there is.  </li>
            <li> However, they do work, only on clean underarms, as some other reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Apparently my baby needs to SMELL me!!</li>
            <li> Love the scent, plus it is hard to find in our local drug stores.</li>
            <li> If you are new to Crystal (stone or liquid) then know that it takes about 5 days of not using traditional deodorant for this type of product to work.&lt;br /&gt;Catching</li>
            <li> I certainly am of the opinion it has less ingredients as a whole than regular drug store deodorants .</li>
            <li> the past several years, I apply in the morning and am BO free for almost 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> The list of ingredients is as follows: Purified Water, Natural Mineral Salts, Potassium Alum, Cellulose, Pomegranate Fragrance, Essential Oils and Extracts.</li>
            <li> I completely agree with Alyssa D&#x27;s comment above.  </li>
            <li> This did not work, I smelled unpleasant pretty quickly under normal day-to-day conditions.</li>
            <li> Love this deoderant that is free of aluminum and other bad things.  </li>
            <li> We like this all natural alternative to other deodorants.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I bought the three pack as it was only 3 dollars more than a single.</li>
            <li> This deodorant does not last long at all.  </li>
            <li> I have a very fancy perfume that is hard to find and this deodorant smells very similar to it.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to look for way to go natural with less chemicals.  </li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO body odor - even by next a.m.!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it leaves me completely dry &amp; deodorized all day long, but I would have to use an antiperspirant to do that.</li>
            <li> did I ever guess that I would use a deodorant instead of an anti-perspirant /deodorant combo, but once I read the reviews here and on MUA, and due to an increasing dissatisfaction w/ the AP/D products I&#x27;ve used for years,  I thought - why not try something totally different?  </li>
            <li> The bottle itself also lasts a VERY long time.</li>
            <li> and it helps keep me dry.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my armpits actually sweat LESS when I have used this rather than an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Works for a normal day, but at the gym I usually end up a little stinky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male in my late twenties, not particularly active (though trying to change that), and by mid-day, I always smell a little funky.  </li>
            <li> We take this in order to avoid using the other types of deodorant on the market.  </li>
            <li> I breakout due to the aluminum in deodorant</li>
            <li> I was a fan of the crystal but kept dropping it in the sink, breaking it into scratchy sharp pieces.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find on the shelf at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;d suggest giving it a few tries before you decided if u like it or not!</li>
            <li> For less chemical and less harm to the body and the environment-</li>
            <li> Luckily, no one seems to have noticed.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is weak, and I&#x27;m currently looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, it was cheaper than the Degree I recently switched to (after developing some resistance to Dove and Secret products).  </li>
            <li> I have always had trouble finding a deodorant without aluminum in the product.  </li>
            <li> a sale at the local drug store may have been less expensive.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t care for fruity fragrances, but this one is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works as least as well as others in this category.</li>
            <li> I use to use secret.</li>
            <li> I started using this a while back, after reading about the crap in the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> so it makes me VERY unhappy when I then have to spend time to find out why my order was not complete and write a bad review.</li>
            <li> I always carried a spare one in the beginning because I was afraid that my arm pits will stink, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering of fake smelling!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We take this in order to avoid using the other types of deodorant on the market.  I&#x27;ve had breast cancer and this is just one more way of using a product that doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of extra chemicals.</li>
            <li> This deodorant lasts long and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great. Exactly what i wanted. And it came on time</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I have ever used.  I don&#x27;t want to use chemical anti-antiperspirants, but many of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ones did not work for me.  This one is amazing, and the pomegranate scent is great.</li>
            <li> I am super allergic to aluminum deodorant and these smell good and last all day</li>
            <li> Before buying this product I was using another Crystal deodorant roll-on...I was happy with it, but wanted something with a more feminine scent. I also wanted something natural, and although this does have Potassium Alum, the jury is still out to whether this is harmful or not. The list of ingredients is as follows: Purified Water, Natural Mineral Salts, Potassium Alum, Cellulose, Pomegranate Fragrance, Essential Oils and Extracts. It is a very pleasant scent, and as I do reside in a very warm climate(desert), it works most of the time, and when I feel it is not doing it&#x27;s job, I just re-apply. I do hope the Natural product industry can come out with something more in an anti-perspirant in the near future, but until then, will continue to use this, and am happy with my purchase. I certainly am of the opinion it has less ingredients as a whole than regular drug store deodorants .</li>
            <li> Love this deoderant that is free of aluminum and other bad things.  One bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant after trying SO many natural ones. I avoid antiperspirants because of their chemical content, so finding a good effective deodorant is not easy. I can&#x27;t say that it leaves me completely dry &amp; deodorized all day long, but I would have to use an antiperspirant to do that. It has a nice smell &amp; the bottle lasts a long while- I order 3 at a time. I also have the same spray deodorant.</li>
            <li> Wow - never in a million years did I ever guess that I would use a deodorant instead of an anti-perspirant /deodorant combo, but once I read the reviews here and on MUA, and due to an increasing dissatisfaction w/ the AP/D products I&#x27;ve used for years,  I thought - why not try something totally different?  So, I motored over to my local Walgreens (couldn&#x27;t find this product at Target).  Lo and behold, it was cheaper than the Degree I recently switched to (after developing some resistance to Dove and Secret products).  I&#x27;m not usually a roll-on fan, but again, the MUA reviews did not steer me wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past several years, I apply in the morning and am BO free for almost 24 hours.  It dries rather quickly and ......IT WORX!!!!  Absolutely NO body odor - even by next a.m.!  I have tried all the scents in this line and I truly like each of them and they don&#x27;t interfere w/ my perfume choice of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work-- as someone with super sensitive skin I haven&#x27;t been able to have a pretty scented deodorant in years. I used to use the unscented version with reasonable success. This did not work, I smelled unpleasant pretty quickly under normal day-to-day conditions.</li>
            <li> I use for under the breast and does a great job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a sweaty girl but I put this on after my shower and started to smell literally 5 minutes later. That doesn&#x27;t even happen as quickly if I don&#x27;t put deodorant on at all! It was bizarre. Also, the smell doesn&#x27;t smell like pomegranate to me. It&#x27;s like a musky citrus. Unfortunately, I bought the three pack as it was only 3 dollars more than a single.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve purchased, has a pleasant smell and gets the job done.  I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like this.. I even gave a bottle away. but I realized it was working! And I did like it! So, I&#x27;d suggest giving it a few tries before you decided if u like it or not!</li>
            <li> This is great. The fragrance is beautiful and the stick works!!!</li>
            <li> Use this on a daily basis.  Aluminum free is why I buy it and it helps keep me dry.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it lasts all day long and has a great fragrance! Not overpowering of fake smelling! I have noticed my armpits actually sweat LESS when I have used this rather than an antiperspirant. Go figure. It&#x27;s so much better for you, give it a try!</li>
            <li> Love the scent, plus it is hard to find in our local drug stores.</li>
            <li> We like this all natural alternative to other deodorants. The pomegranate scent is light and pleasant. Works great!</li>
            <li> Thank You, Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great scent.  Arrived on time. Good price for 3.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years and love it . I have re ordered this again and still love it . Received it promptly.</li>
            <li> Daughter likes this product, works well, smells nice. Shipping was quick. We will order it again.</li>
            <li> I loved how my skin felt using this product, but it wasn&#x27;t effective for very long...</li>
            <li> Best natural deoderant ever!</li>
            <li> Love this product, great price, received quickly and would order again.</li>
            <li> This is a healthy alternative to the dreaded antiperspirant and it has a nice aroma. It works pretty well and I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Attractive container.  Easy to spot.  Pleasant aroma.  Works as least as well as others in this category.</li>
            <li> I used to get the unscented version, but I love the scent of the Pomegranate. Been using this brand for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the only women&#x27;s deodorant that does not cause rashes.  I love the Pomegranate scent.  I have always had trouble finding a deodorant without aluminum in the product.  At last I have found it. Thank you.  Rita Balliot</li>
            <li> Great service!  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using the crystal brand deodorant for years, but always the unscented one. I didn&#x27;t know they had a scented version. So, I decided to try the pomegranate and am extremely happy with my purchase. I have a very fancy perfume that is hard to find and this deodorant smells very similar to it. It&#x27;s very reminiscent of honey suckle mixed with grapefruit. It&#x27;s nice and light too, which I love.</li>
            <li> My deodorant  of choice without aluminum. I breakout due to the aluminum in deodorant No irritation and a mild scent.</li>
            <li> I started using Crystal Deodorant in 2012 and its really my favorite. Doesnt give me any rashes like other deodorants and has a very nice smell. Love it</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast. I really like this deodorant. I use to use secret. And my daughter use to get lumps under her arm but now since she&#x27;s been using it she does it not get the bumps. I like it because  my arms does not smell. I feel fresh. It doesn&#x27;t stop you from sweating, but when I do sweat it does not smell. I always carried a spare one in the beginning because I was afraid that my arm pits will stink, but it didn&#x27;t. My husband even uses it and likes it very much. Just make sure you use it on cleaned skin. And cover your whole armpit area. It&#x27;s really good. Worth the money. Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used. I always had odor problems with my arms. But this was the sure solution for me.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works perfectly for me.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about carcinogens when using it.  My daughter and I love it.</li>
            <li> I use as many natural products as I can, and this is just another amazing product.  It&#x27;s free of harsh chemicals, yet it keeps me feeling fresh and odor free better than most commercial brand deodorants.  This stuff is the best!  The price on the multipack makes it a total bargain.  I love that I can get the Pomegranate one on here as my local stores don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant line. Safe, natural, effective, and they smell great! I have all three scents, because why not switch it up?! :) The pomegranate is fruity but not heavy or cloying. I usually don&#x27;t care for fruity fragrances, but this one is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recently had a baby and experienced a significant increase in odor after it. Apparently my baby needs to SMELL me!! I was at my wit&#x27;s end until I happened upon the solution: wash with shampoo (not soap or body wash), and use this stuff. Voile! Under control.</li>
            <li> This is already an excellent product, now with good pricing &amp; fast delivery this is the place to purchase these items from.</li>
            <li> Dave&#x27;s wife here: Amazing, I have been looking for an alternative to the aluminum containing deodorants for a few years.  No more stinky pits, glad I ordered this!</li>
            <li> Nice alternative to the aluminum deodorants.</li>
            <li> I stopped wearing antiperspirant over a year ago and use this or the Thai stone. Works for a normal day, but at the gym I usually end up a little stinky.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant around-and NO Aluminum Chlorohydrate to contribute to potential cancer. Very effective protection. Hard to find on the shelf at the local drug store. Very glad it&#x27;s still being sold through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on me I felt like I smelled with this product</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant on the market.  I like natural scents and this product works and smells fresh.  Ordering it in the three pack is the most cost effective and you can keep one in the gym bag, one in the bathroom and one in the car for the emergency.  I would put this on the subscription if available.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!!!! No aluminum! It works and it&#x27;s not bad for you health.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you want a roll-on deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it.</li>
            <li> When I was looking for a natural deodorant that had a scent I found this. I have been using it for two years.</li>
            <li> I started using this a while back, after reading about the crap in the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; antiperspirants. These are NOT made for keeping you from sweating, but are for keeping you from stinking when you do. It takes a bit of getting used to, especially if you are not used to sweating in the armpit area. However, they do work, only on clean underarms, as some other reviews have mentioned. I love that they&#x27;re natural, and I will keep using them.</li>
            <li> Love the light scent and ease of use.  I was a fan of the crystal but kept dropping it in the sink, breaking it into scratchy sharp pieces.  Now, wish to see a travel size for flying.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to look for way to go natural with less chemicals.  This deodorant does the job! It does not fell sticky, although you might have to put on more that the usual deodorant, but it is fine! For less chemical and less harm to the body and the environment- that&#x27;s fine with me! :) plus it smells great!!! The only thing is that- don&#x27;t plan to workout and think you going to get away with it - without reapplying more :)</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!  even in the tropics (I KNOW!!).  must be made of unicorn tears or something because it smells divine and works here in the topics of Mexico.  Just ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant !!  It has a fresh clean scent, works well, and is safe to use.  I can never find it in the stores so I have to order it online.  This company sells it for a great price.</li>
            <li> If you are new to Crystal (stone or liquid) then know that it takes about 5 days of not using traditional deodorant for this type of product to work.&lt;br /&gt;Catching a sale at the local drug store may have been less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural deodorant there is.  The only ones that truly keep me from smelling is the Crystal Essence Brand. I love it, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve tried so many natural deodorants, it seems, and I haven&#x27;t had any luck with them working. This one, however, works!!!! I love that it&#x27;s all natural and that it&#x27;s a roll-on. Amazing product! I&#x27;m so happy to have found Crystal Essence.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but ordered 2 for $9.82 &amp; never received the 2nd roll-on!!!! I make most of my purchases on-line because I don&#x27;t have time...so it makes me VERY unhappy when I then have to spend time to find out why my order was not complete and write a bad review.</li>
            <li> I completely agree with Alyssa D&#x27;s comment above.  This deodorant does not last long at all.  I&#x27;m a male in my late twenties, not particularly active (though trying to change that), and by mid-day, I always smell a little funky.  Luckily, no one seems to have noticed. Still, I know how I want to smell, and this deodorant hasn&#x27;t gotten me there. I&#x27;ve used the pomegranate and lavender roll-ons, as well as the lavender spray, and it&#x27;s the same story with all of them.  I do like the smells, though, and I like that they don&#x27;t irritate my skin (unlike Tom&#x27;s long-lasting, whose name has more to do with how long my underarm skin was scarred than how long its odor protection lasts).  Still, you don&#x27;t get points for not injuring your customers.  This deodorant is weak, and I&#x27;m currently looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great for it&#x27;s very short list of ingrediants.  I can not use anti-perspirants because I am allergic to whetever they put in them(bad breakouts).  It has a light scent, and keeps you from smelling yourself all day long.  The bottle itself also lasts a VERY long time.</li>
            <li> It works well.  It has a mild scent.  Most of all, it is aluminum free.</li>
