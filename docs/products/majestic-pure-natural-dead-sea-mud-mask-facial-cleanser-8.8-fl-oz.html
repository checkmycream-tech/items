            <li>It has a nice mild smell and a smooth texture, really covers well,  </li>
            <li>This makes my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I have used cheap Walmart packets ($1), Glam Glow ($70), LUSH handmade fresh face masks, and many many more.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think of this at first.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I was pleased with the smell, and though the kids looked at me at first</li>
            <li>It is an 8.8 oz jar and it is full, not like potato chips when you buy a huge bag</li>
            <li>I love that so much!</li>
            <li>You hear that the rich does it at the spa.  </li>

            <li>This mak has a smooth texture and goes on easy and doesnt require a large amount to be used.  </li>
            <li>I love trying new beauty products,  but it has always been important to me that the products contain no chemicals.  </li>
            <li>The most exotic and exclusive ingredient rich products you pay a fortune for are such a gamble.  </li>
            <li>clean wow, great feel after this wash, you will start to notice the effect after the first use, your skin will start to feel and look much cleaner, i wish this product was around years ago.</li>

            <li>It dries within 6 minutes so if you need a quick face mask, this is</li>
            <li>It feels like you treat yourself to a quick spa session.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>received  this product for free or discount  for an honest  review as stated above</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy with how much brighter and smoother my face is and is it possible my neck is tighter?  </li>
            <li>It’s very gentle and has a light scent.</li>
            <li>The smell was kind of muted so no strong odors which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I find the dark blue-grey color attractive</li>
            <li>I enjoy being able to save a few dollars and do it myself in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure is amazing and their products are always high quality.</li>
            <li>it works better for me after the first application my skin felt so soft and smooth before I even applied the moisturizer</li>
            <li>Saw a significant change in the cleanliness of my skin from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels tight and great when I use it.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to give this a try since the Majestic Pure line has been so good to me.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and dried very nicely and evenly unless you put too much..</li>
            <li>I applied a thick layer all around my face, first of all noticing the smell as I wasn&#x27;t expecting it at all was very pleasant.</li>
            <li>The application went very smooothly and even and the texture of the mask felt light and not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>This facial mask is amazing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak enough about this, it really is amazing.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin extremely soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>so it is worth saying twice.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my skin feeling fresh and cleaned.</li>
            <li>I put it on (scared my toddlers a bit, which was fun) and after the 5 minutes I removed it...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with a &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; mask, but I was pleasantly surprised with it.</li>
            <li>so you know when it was manufactured, so you know how fresh it</li>
            <li>but it actually has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really big into any kind of mask right now, and I love anything that offers pore minimizing benefits.</li>
            <li>I. It will leave your skin clean,  bright,  and firm after just one use.</li>
            <li>It’s very easy to wash off and leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft, and not dry/stripped like most other masks that I have used, but I still follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t dry all the way, as most &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; masks have alcohol in them and that dries out your face!</li>
            <li>It went on easily and really didn&#x27;t need to use much at all to cover my face.  </li>
            <li>When I opened it, I first noticed the incredibly fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I used a coupon to purchase this and another Majestic Pure item, check the Special Offers and Product Promotions section for available codes/</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no added scent and the natural smell is very mild.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It left my skin soft and smoother, and my pores diminished, which is just what I expect from a good mud mask.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out skin like most masks.</li>
            <li>It went on very smoothly and felt relaxing, which was an instant mark in its favor.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling smooth and extremely clean.</li>
            <li>This Dead Sea Mud Mask by Majestic Pure is amazing!</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it even if you haven&#x27;t ever done a mud mask and are kind of thinking it&#x27;s gross.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I think mine might not recover from the shock. ;)</li>
            <li>;)</li>

            <li>Have already left a review for this but really love it</li>
            <li>You are going to fall in love with this deep cleaning mask.</li>
            <li>the second application by blemishes started to dissappear I really love this mud mask</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely gonna purchase more</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a a mud mask.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this mask.</li>
            <li>, first off, it&#x27;s a clay face mask that ummm smells pretty much like clay!</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot, so I think I should be good for a few months.</li>
            <li>The dead sea mud mask was seriously super amazing.</li>
            <li>Its hard to describe but to me its like a nice clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin and when I woke up this morning my skin was not oily and sticky like it normally is</li>
            <li>Mud masks are great for a healthy and clean looking skin especially in the summer due to sweat and dirt clogging the pores and making the skin rough.</li>
            <li>I used this mud mask the other day and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>The cream is a grey color but very smooth, and has&lt;br</li>
            <li>The appearance of pores was indeed somewhat reduced, but what I really noticed was the smooth, clear look of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 8-plus-ounce container will last a long time because you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot; it spreads willingly and with a nice smooth texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a nice treat at the end of a busy week.</li>
            <li>product is 100% pure and from the earth NOT fake or manufactured</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m careful with what I put on my skin since it tends to breakout very easily.</li>
            <li>It washed off easily and left my face clean, smooth, and (exciting for me and my sensitive skin) not red or oily.</li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised at the noticeable results so quickly.</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>Nothing makes me feel quite as pampered as a good mud mask, usually while taking a relaxing bubble bath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick &amp; goopy as you would expect with mud, but very easy to apply &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>The directions are simple and easy, but instead of leaving it on  for 5 minutes, I leave it on for up to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>will certainly repurchase.</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure is a company that is located in Carlsbad, California (I like USA products), however they partner with companies that include Chile, Italy, France, Bulgaria, India, Morocco, and China.</li>
            <li>They claim that all products are 100% pure.</li>
            <li>I also have large pores.</li>
            <li>Once Again, I got to try out some of Majestic Pure&#x27;s product....</li>
            <li>jar is rather large</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s only half a bag of chips, lol.</li>
            <li>, I mean it was a pleasant experience to wear it for five minutes, almost like aroma therapy, I would say.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and even, is totally non-irritating, and only has a very mild, earthy scent.</li>
            <li>I found little use in these kind of products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our faces were extremely soft after the first use!</li>
            <li>Loved this mask, the smell and texture of it was smooth, applied as directed and removed as directed it left my face and neck soft and clear of all dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I either use mud masks before showering, I use a warm wet washcloth on my face for a couple of minutes then apply the mask, but not very thick.  </li>
            <li>This Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask is amazing.</li>
            <li>get inflammation and it helps with that pro else specially when it&#x27;s hot outside.</li>
            <li>This mask cleans them right out, and leaves my skin feeling very smooth without being dried out.</li>
            <li>This was an amazing dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li>It was really gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li>Are you ready for some craziness?</li>
            <li>It really cleans and shrinks my pores.</li>
            <li>really am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling revamped and also smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask.  </li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The packaging and smell are very pleasing</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>my product came fast</li>
            <li>My face felt very refreshed after using this.</li>
            <li>My face felt much softer after using this.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I never paid much attention to skin.</li>
            <li>Its extremely gentle and soothing.</li>
            <li>This beneficial mud still remains a modern day phenomena.  </li>
            <li>My pores are much cleaner</li>
            <li>but this mud mask is an absolute miracle.</li>
            <li>it left my skin feeling smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure it made my pores shrink or anything, since I have only used it once so far, but I am hopeful.  </li>
            <li>So it was kind of messy in that</li>
            <li>To be honest being a male transgender into a female</li>
            <li>It came of easily, with gentle scrubs and my skin was left very soft, and my pores almost invisible!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been starting to notice little fine lines around my eyes an dsome very noticeable pores around my cheeks and forehead, though I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work a miracle or at all on my fine lines, it did made my pores shrink a lot!</li>
            <li>Easy to dry and wipe off.</li>
            <li>and I use mud masks to help deep clean my pores.</li>
            <li>I apply a nice thin mask and allow it to completely dry then wash off with warm water.</li>
            <li>This mask is surprisingly smooth and thick, but easy to apply.</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone that wants to bring home the luxurious spa for less than a salon but more relaxation because you are saving money too.  </li>
            <li>Oh was I wrong, this stuff smells good, its soft, smooth and you dont need alot to apply on.</li>
            <li>Regardless, if you&#x27;re looking for an afternoon of soft skin, this stuff&#x27;s pretty bomb.</li>
            <li>to dry skin, pretty mild.</li>
            <li>it feels a  little more even (I have very combination</li>
            <li>Have only used a few times but feel that with routine use I Would see more significant results.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t smell BAD, per se, but they sure didn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li>Product did not crack like I expected and was easy to peel</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a thick consistency and covers my face perfectly and evenly without feeling heavy or clogging on my skin.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft &amp; smooth</li>
            <li>This is definitely a good quality mud mask, ive used a few different kinds</li>
            <li>This mask doesn&#x27;t necessarily make me feel like it&#x27;s cleaning my skin the way salt mud ought, BUT it does leave my face feeling like smooth soft silky silk.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The mask does not dry hard like other masks I&#x27;ve used, which was kind of nice but</li>
            <li>I have been on a beauty product kick lately, and I must say that I&#x27;m glad that I got the chance to review this product!</li>
            <li>I compare this face mask to Origins ash clay mask because of the detox ingredients and high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite part other than how soft my skin is, is how well it cleans out my pores</li>
            <li>Loved that a little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this product to all the ladies who wants to have a young looking skin or face.</li>
            <li>This mask is an excellent combination of white clay, dead sea salts, and dead sea mud.  </li>
            <li>My skin has been kind of blah lately with summer heat and pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to receive this dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li>and I will update my review after a few more uses to let you know if I have noticed any improvement there.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s for normal</li>
            <li>Make sure to only use it every couple weeks or else your skin will dry out and acne will form.</li>
            <li>Though I almost went right to splashing water on myself, what you&#x27;re actually supposed to do is rub the mask off of your face in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very large bottle that should last for months.  </li>
            <li>I was spending a fortune on another new &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; mask just like this</li>
            <li>I will buy a new jar when mine is all</li>
            <li>my skin felt so soft and cleansed, I recommend it to anyone who wants to clear face.</li>
            <li>I received this quickly but it went on oily and didn&#x27;t dry ?</li>
            <li>I tried this mud mask because it&#x27;s 100% natural and because it came to me highly recommended.</li>
            <li>had a headache at the time, so excuse my less than thrilled expression in the photos!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My teen also tried it and she absolutely loves it also!</li>
            <li>The mud looks very perfect, not like other mud masks; it almost looks fake since the color is so defined.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my sister and she loves it so far!</li>
            <li>my face is super soft and less sensitive to the hot summer air.</li>
            <li>That is ok, the benefits are definitely worth it and yucky addictives are no good for your skin anyways!</li>
            <li>I have combination (mostly oily), dull, and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I just recently purchased this Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask and after using this my face felt as smooth as a baby&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>way of using this mask is that I steam my face first to help my pores to open up.&lt;br /&gt;You can also use a lukewarm water to wet you face and dab it later on with a clean</li>
            <li>I rarely get the chance to do a little pampering for myself, but I was very excited to try out this Dead Sea Mud Mask.  </li>
            <li>My face is clear and hydrated.</li>
            <li>So when I get the chance to review this item I am really looking forward for the same result..</li>
            <li>So it seems to be working so far (at 3 weeks of using it @ 2x a week)</li>
            <li>only use this mask once every week, and it really helped me with my acnes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin soft and smoother feeling..</li>
            <li>As far as for your skin it has been used as an over the counter treatment for psoriasis, eczema and acne.</li>
            <li>When it dries, toxins from diet, pollution, and even makeup are naturally drawn out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, slather this all over yourself to look forever young.</li>
            <li>not Dead Sea Mud Mask</li>
            <li>My 9 year old asked why I was putting mud on my face though!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>and when I washed my face it was so soft.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>It removes impurities, and makes the skin feel soft after using.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product to my sister and so far she&#x27;s liking this.</li>
            <li>and you will be surprised how baby soft</li>
            <li>My face was so soft.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my face felt.  </li>
            <li>Said it makes her skin so soft</li>
            <li>Cleared up some hormonal acne and made my skin feel unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel soft.</li>
            <li>I am 43 years old and it made my face feel like a baby&#x27;s face</li>
            <li>When I told my wife the price, she was surprised.</li>
            <li>so it stays soft, and is easier to remove.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I was worried about a reaction since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this treatment then sitting back while it dried gave me 15 minutes of relaxation.</li>
            <li>This little added touch gives me comfort that the product I&#x27;m using is fresh and a date to toss it out; how neat!</li>
            <li>It is hands down better than masks I have purchased from drug stores and does not leave the dry itchy feeling that some give you.</li>
            <li>Once I applied the mud on, theres a cool sensation with a slight tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>This mud mask by Majestic Pure is great quality and the company stands behind its product and states they will refund your money within 60 days if you are not satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I received my first tub of Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask for a reduced  price through a promotional offer.  </li>
            <li>I will buy again when I finish the container - which will be a while I&#x27;m sure because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use many products on my skin because some products can cause serious skin irritation after reading  the reviews on this mud mask I decided to try it</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean and firm.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to rinse thoroughly, the mud likes to hide in the small creases in your face such as beside your nose.</li>
            <li>My main issue was milia and white heads caused by clogged pores.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that even the deep pore cleaning of this Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask would help draw out the cystic acne areas, BUT it DID!!!</li>
            <li>and I am always leary on trying new facial masks</li>
            <li>I really like this mask especially since it only has to be on for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>My skin is really starting to look healthier and my pores are so much cleaner and smaller!</li>
            <li>It is a thick but creamy mud that is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The feel of you skin is soft, new, and firm, not flaky and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mid Mask for free in return to Review &amp; inform the prospective buyers of its benefits.</li>
            <li>The dead sea is full of magnesium, sodium, phosphates, bromides and other minerals thought to improve skin conditions as well as certain heart and lung conditions.  </li>
            <li>I love dead sea masks, I have tried a lot already from other brands</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>But why spend so much on beauty products when you can get the same healing benefits of Dead Sea mud from Majestic Pure for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>toddler thought I was hilarious looking the entire time this sat on my face, which I let be longer than the five minutes because after five minutes some of it was still a little wet to the touch.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what live sea mud feels like, but this Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud feels GREAAAAATTTT.</li>
            <li>I have noticed smaller looking pores and clear looking skin.</li>
            <li>This is another product I have purchased recently that my 15 year old daughter had to &amp;#34;snag&amp;#34; the moment it came into the house.  </li>
            <li>Product left skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I personally have thought that trying a Mud Mask from the dead Sea would be a very healthy product to use considering all of the minerals in the Dead Sea Mid Mask.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This mask will absorbed excess oil and remove dead skin.</li>
            <li>Most other mud mask leaves your face real tight and dry, so much</li>
            <li>consistency is rich and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask 8.8 Oz - Spa&#x27;s Premium Quality Facial Cleanser for All Skin Types - 100% Natural Formula, Absorbs Excess Oil, Removes Dead Skin Cells, Dirt and Toxins to Reveal Fresh and Soft Skin - Known to Heals Acne, Acne Scars, Pimples, Blackheads, Eczema &amp; Psoriasis -</li>
            <li>It has a decent amount of product so it&#x27;ll last for a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much lighter feeling than other masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is rich and even thick, requiring no stirring or mixing of the product before use.  </li>
            <li>Before I noticed any change my husband already told me my facial skin looked clearly brighter and younger after the mud was washed off.  </li>
            <li>Here are a few things that make it outstanding and a few reasons you should try it if you are looking for this as an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this not dry it out..</li>
            <li>I used it at the end of a shower so that my pores would be nice and open, and I applied a somewhat thin layer of the facial mask- just enough to cover my entire face without piling it on.</li>
            <li>I am a new customer and I highly recommend giving this dead sea mud mask a go.</li>
            <li>I noticed within the first use that my pores (which have started to enlarge) were smaller and less</li>
            <li>This one is made from the healing mud of the dead sea, which has a higher concentration of salts and minerals to promote healing and all sorts of skin benefits.</li>
            <li>, this was my first time doing a Dead Sea mask.</li>
            <li>It feels a bit weird going on, but once it comes off, your skin feels real soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I just used my fingers and it didn&#x27;t dry completely out to where it cracked or anything I left it on for about 8 min</li>
            <li>you can really feel it pulling your skin tight as it dries.</li>
            <li>she sees me everyday at work so for her to see me without no make up at all and comment how my skin looks &amp;#34;so great&amp;#34; is certainly a compliment.  </li>

            <li> There&#x27;s no way for me to know all the proportions of everything used in the mud, but I&#x27;d bet all the added oils combined account for most of what&#x27;s in that jar.</li>

            <li> I love trying new beauty products,  but it has always been important to me that the products contain no chemicals.  </li>
            <li> The most exotic and exclusive ingredient rich products you pay a fortune for are such a gamble.  </li>

            <li> Shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy with how much brighter and smoother my face is and is it possible my neck is tighter?  </li>
            <li> It’s very gentle and has a light scent.</li>
            <li> The smell was kind of muted so no strong odors which is nice.  </li>
            <li> I find the dark blue-grey color attractive</li>
            <li> I enjoy being able to save a few dollars and do it myself in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure is amazing and their products are always high quality.</li>
            <li> it works better for me after the first application my skin felt so soft and smooth before I even applied the moisturizer</li>
            <li> Saw a significant change in the cleanliness of my skin from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight and great when I use it.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to give this a try since the Majestic Pure line has been so good to me.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and dried very nicely and evenly unless you put too much..</li>
            <li> I applied a thick layer all around my face, first of all noticing the smell as I wasn&#x27;t expecting it at all was very pleasant.</li>
            <li> The application went very smooothly and even and the texture of the mask felt light and not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> This facial mask is amazing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak enough about this, it really is amazing.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin extremely soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> so it is worth saying twice.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my skin feeling fresh and cleaned.</li>
            <li> I put it on (scared my toddlers a bit, which was fun) and after the 5 minutes I removed it...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with a &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; mask, but I was pleasantly surprised with it.</li>
            <li> so you know when it was manufactured, so you know how fresh it</li>
            <li> but it actually has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really big into any kind of mask right now, and I love anything that offers pore minimizing benefits.</li>
            <li> I. It will leave your skin clean,  bright,  and firm after just one use.</li>
            <li> It’s very easy to wash off and leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft, and not dry/stripped like most other masks that I have used, but I still follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t dry all the way, as most &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; masks have alcohol in them and that dries out your face!</li>
            <li> It went on easily and really didn&#x27;t need to use much at all to cover my face.  </li>
            <li> When I opened it, I first noticed the incredibly fresh smell.</li>
            <li> I used a coupon to purchase this and another Majestic Pure item, check the Special Offers and Product Promotions section for available codes/</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no added scent and the natural smell is very mild.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It left my skin soft and smoother, and my pores diminished, which is just what I expect from a good mud mask.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out skin like most masks.</li>
            <li> It went on very smoothly and felt relaxing, which was an instant mark in its favor.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling smooth and extremely clean.</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud Mask by Majestic Pure is amazing!</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it even if you haven&#x27;t ever done a mud mask and are kind of thinking it&#x27;s gross.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I think mine might not recover from the shock. ;)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>

            <li> the second application by blemishes started to dissappear I really love this mud mask</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely gonna purchase more</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a a mud mask.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this mask.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot, so I think I should be good for a few months.</li>
            <li> The dead sea mud mask was seriously super amazing.</li>
            <li> Its hard to describe but to me its like a nice clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin and when I woke up this morning my skin was not oily and sticky like it normally is</li>
            <li> Mud masks are great for a healthy and clean looking skin especially in the summer due to sweat and dirt clogging the pores and making the skin rough.</li>
            <li> I used this mud mask the other day and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> The cream is a grey color but very smooth, and has&lt;br</li>
            <li> The appearance of pores was indeed somewhat reduced, but what I really noticed was the smooth, clear look of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 8-plus-ounce container will last a long time because you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot; it spreads willingly and with a nice smooth texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a nice treat at the end of a busy week.</li>
            <li> product is 100% pure and from the earth NOT fake or manufactured</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful with what I put on my skin since it tends to breakout very easily.</li>
            <li> It washed off easily and left my face clean, smooth, and (exciting for me and my sensitive skin) not red or oily.</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised at the noticeable results so quickly.</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> Nothing makes me feel quite as pampered as a good mud mask, usually while taking a relaxing bubble bath.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick &amp; goopy as you would expect with mud, but very easy to apply &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> The directions are simple and easy, but instead of leaving it on  for 5 minutes, I leave it on for up to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> will certainly repurchase.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure is a company that is located in Carlsbad, California (I like USA products), however they partner with companies that include Chile, Italy, France, Bulgaria, India, Morocco, and China.</li>
            <li> They claim that all products are 100% pure.</li>
            <li> I also have large pores.</li>
            <li> Once Again, I got to try out some of Majestic Pure&#x27;s product....</li>
            <li> jar is rather large</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s only half a bag of chips, lol.</li>
            <li> , I mean it was a pleasant experience to wear it for five minutes, almost like aroma therapy, I would say.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and even, is totally non-irritating, and only has a very mild, earthy scent.</li>
            <li> I found little use in these kind of products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our faces were extremely soft after the first use!</li>
            <li> Loved this mask, the smell and texture of it was smooth, applied as directed and removed as directed it left my face and neck soft and clear of all dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I either use mud masks before showering, I use a warm wet washcloth on my face for a couple of minutes then apply the mask, but not very thick.  </li>
            <li> This Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask is amazing.</li>
            <li> get inflammation and it helps with that pro else specially when it&#x27;s hot outside.</li>
            <li> This mask cleans them right out, and leaves my skin feeling very smooth without being dried out.</li>
            <li> This was an amazing dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li> It was really gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li> Are you ready for some craziness?</li>
            <li> It really cleans and shrinks my pores.</li>
            <li> really am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling revamped and also smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.  </li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The packaging and smell are very pleasing</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> my product came fast</li>
            <li> My face felt very refreshed after using this.</li>
            <li> My face felt much softer after using this.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I never paid much attention to skin.</li>
            <li> Its extremely gentle and soothing.</li>
            <li> This beneficial mud still remains a modern day phenomena.  </li>
            <li> My pores are much cleaner</li>
            <li> but this mud mask is an absolute miracle.</li>
            <li> it left my skin feeling smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure it made my pores shrink or anything, since I have only used it once so far, but I am hopeful.  </li>
            <li> So it was kind of messy in that</li>
            <li> To be honest being a male transgender into a female</li>
            <li> It came of easily, with gentle scrubs and my skin was left very soft, and my pores almost invisible!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been starting to notice little fine lines around my eyes an dsome very noticeable pores around my cheeks and forehead, though I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work a miracle or at all on my fine lines, it did made my pores shrink a lot!</li>
            <li> Easy to dry and wipe off.</li>
            <li> and I use mud masks to help deep clean my pores.</li>
            <li> I apply a nice thin mask and allow it to completely dry then wash off with warm water.</li>
            <li> This mask is surprisingly smooth and thick, but easy to apply.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone that wants to bring home the luxurious spa for less than a salon but more relaxation because you are saving money too.  </li>
            <li> Oh was I wrong, this stuff smells good, its soft, smooth and you dont need alot to apply on.</li>
            <li> Regardless, if you&#x27;re looking for an afternoon of soft skin, this stuff&#x27;s pretty bomb.</li>
            <li> to dry skin, pretty mild.</li>
            <li> it feels a  little more even (I have very combination</li>
            <li> Have only used a few times but feel that with routine use I Would see more significant results.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t smell BAD, per se, but they sure didn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> Product did not crack like I expected and was easy to peel</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a thick consistency and covers my face perfectly and evenly without feeling heavy or clogging on my skin.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft &amp; smooth</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good quality mud mask, ive used a few different kinds</li>
            <li> This mask doesn&#x27;t necessarily make me feel like it&#x27;s cleaning my skin the way salt mud ought, BUT it does leave my face feeling like smooth soft silky silk.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The mask does not dry hard like other masks I&#x27;ve used, which was kind of nice but</li>
            <li> I have been on a beauty product kick lately, and I must say that I&#x27;m glad that I got the chance to review this product!</li>
            <li> I compare this face mask to Origins ash clay mask because of the detox ingredients and high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite part other than how soft my skin is, is how well it cleans out my pores</li>
            <li> Loved that a little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to all the ladies who wants to have a young looking skin or face.</li>
            <li> This mask is an excellent combination of white clay, dead sea salts, and dead sea mud.  </li>
            <li> My skin has been kind of blah lately with summer heat and pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to receive this dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li> and I will update my review after a few more uses to let you know if I have noticed any improvement there.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s for normal</li>
            <li> Make sure to only use it every couple weeks or else your skin will dry out and acne will form.</li>
            <li> Though I almost went right to splashing water on myself, what you&#x27;re actually supposed to do is rub the mask off of your face in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very large bottle that should last for months.  </li>
            <li> I was spending a fortune on another new &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; mask just like this</li>
            <li> I will buy a new jar when mine is all</li>
            <li> my skin felt so soft and cleansed, I recommend it to anyone who wants to clear face.</li>
            <li> I received this quickly but it went on oily and didn&#x27;t dry ?</li>
            <li> I tried this mud mask because it&#x27;s 100% natural and because it came to me highly recommended.</li>
            <li> had a headache at the time, so excuse my less than thrilled expression in the photos!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My teen also tried it and she absolutely loves it also!</li>
            <li> The mud looks very perfect, not like other mud masks; it almost looks fake since the color is so defined.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister and she loves it so far!</li>
            <li> my face is super soft and less sensitive to the hot summer air.</li>
            <li> That is ok, the benefits are definitely worth it and yucky addictives are no good for your skin anyways!</li>
            <li> I have combination (mostly oily), dull, and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask and after using this my face felt as smooth as a baby&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> way of using this mask is that I steam my face first to help my pores to open up.&lt;br /&gt;You can also use a lukewarm water to wet you face and dab it later on with a clean</li>
            <li> I rarely get the chance to do a little pampering for myself, but I was very excited to try out this Dead Sea Mud Mask.  </li>
            <li> My face is clear and hydrated.</li>
            <li> So when I get the chance to review this item I am really looking forward for the same result..</li>
            <li> So it seems to be working so far (at 3 weeks of using it @ 2x a week)</li>
            <li> only use this mask once every week, and it really helped me with my acnes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin soft and smoother feeling..</li>
            <li> As far as for your skin it has been used as an over the counter treatment for psoriasis, eczema and acne.</li>
            <li> When it dries, toxins from diet, pollution, and even makeup are naturally drawn out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, slather this all over yourself to look forever young.</li>
            <li> not Dead Sea Mud Mask</li>
            <li> My 9 year old asked why I was putting mud on my face though!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> and when I washed my face it was so soft.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> It removes impurities, and makes the skin feel soft after using.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product to my sister and so far she&#x27;s liking this.</li>
            <li> and you will be surprised how baby soft</li>
            <li> My face was so soft.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my face felt.  </li>
            <li> Said it makes her skin so soft</li>
            <li> Cleared up some hormonal acne and made my skin feel unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel soft.</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old and it made my face feel like a baby&#x27;s face</li>
            <li> When I told my wife the price, she was surprised.</li>
            <li> so it stays soft, and is easier to remove.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I was worried about a reaction since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this treatment then sitting back while it dried gave me 15 minutes of relaxation.</li>
            <li> This little added touch gives me comfort that the product I&#x27;m using is fresh and a date to toss it out; how neat!</li>
            <li> It is hands down better than masks I have purchased from drug stores and does not leave the dry itchy feeling that some give you.</li>
            <li> Once I applied the mud on, theres a cool sensation with a slight tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> This mud mask by Majestic Pure is great quality and the company stands behind its product and states they will refund your money within 60 days if you are not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I received my first tub of Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask for a reduced  price through a promotional offer.  </li>
            <li> I will buy again when I finish the container - which will be a while I&#x27;m sure because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use many products on my skin because some products can cause serious skin irritation after reading  the reviews on this mud mask I decided to try it</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean and firm.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to rinse thoroughly, the mud likes to hide in the small creases in your face such as beside your nose.</li>
            <li> My main issue was milia and white heads caused by clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that even the deep pore cleaning of this Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask would help draw out the cystic acne areas, BUT it DID!!!</li>
            <li> and I am always leary on trying new facial masks</li>
            <li> I really like this mask especially since it only has to be on for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> My skin is really starting to look healthier and my pores are so much cleaner and smaller!</li>
            <li> It is a thick but creamy mud that is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The feel of you skin is soft, new, and firm, not flaky and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mid Mask for free in return to Review &amp; inform the prospective buyers of its benefits.</li>
            <li> The dead sea is full of magnesium, sodium, phosphates, bromides and other minerals thought to improve skin conditions as well as certain heart and lung conditions.  </li>
            <li> I love dead sea masks, I have tried a lot already from other brands</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> But why spend so much on beauty products when you can get the same healing benefits of Dead Sea mud from Majestic Pure for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> toddler thought I was hilarious looking the entire time this sat on my face, which I let be longer than the five minutes because after five minutes some of it was still a little wet to the touch.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what live sea mud feels like, but this Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud feels GREAAAAATTTT.</li>
            <li> I have noticed smaller looking pores and clear looking skin.</li>
            <li> This is another product I have purchased recently that my 15 year old daughter had to &amp;#34;snag&amp;#34; the moment it came into the house.  </li>
            <li> Product left skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I personally have thought that trying a Mud Mask from the dead Sea would be a very healthy product to use considering all of the minerals in the Dead Sea Mid Mask.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This mask will absorbed excess oil and remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> Most other mud mask leaves your face real tight and dry, so much</li>
            <li> consistency is rich and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask 8.8 Oz - Spa&#x27;s Premium Quality Facial Cleanser for All Skin Types - 100% Natural Formula, Absorbs Excess Oil, Removes Dead Skin Cells, Dirt and Toxins to Reveal Fresh and Soft Skin - Known to Heals Acne, Acne Scars, Pimples, Blackheads, Eczema &amp; Psoriasis -</li>
            <li> It has a decent amount of product so it&#x27;ll last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also much lighter feeling than other masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is rich and even thick, requiring no stirring or mixing of the product before use.  </li>
            <li> Before I noticed any change my husband already told me my facial skin looked clearly brighter and younger after the mud was washed off.  </li>
            <li> Here are a few things that make it outstanding and a few reasons you should try it if you are looking for this as an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this not dry it out..</li>
            <li> I used it at the end of a shower so that my pores would be nice and open, and I applied a somewhat thin layer of the facial mask- just enough to cover my entire face without piling it on.</li>
            <li> I am a new customer and I highly recommend giving this dead sea mud mask a go.</li>
            <li> I noticed within the first use that my pores (which have started to enlarge) were smaller and less</li>
            <li> This one is made from the healing mud of the dead sea, which has a higher concentration of salts and minerals to promote healing and all sorts of skin benefits.</li>
            <li> , this was my first time doing a Dead Sea mask.</li>
            <li> It feels a bit weird going on, but once it comes off, your skin feels real soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I just used my fingers and it didn&#x27;t dry completely out to where it cracked or anything I left it on for about 8 min</li>
            <li> you can really feel it pulling your skin tight as it dries.</li>
            <li> she sees me everyday at work so for her to see me without no make up at all and comment how my skin looks &amp;#34;so great&amp;#34; is certainly a compliment.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask</li>
            <li> This Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask helped to clarify my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a review of Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I am a little obsessed with taking good care of my skin, I felt it was an honor to try it out and provide my results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask has none of the bad, and all of the good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The feel of the mask when applied is cool, and invigorating and once dried, which the mask get lighter in color and slightly tighten</li>
            <li> Next I just let it sit until it starts to dry, where as my daughter lets it dry completely.  </li>
            <li> mud is very dark and rich dark gray brown in color, it&#x27;s thick but distributed very even and not to waste it, this bottle is very generous in size and will last you for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The Majestic company even dates there product</li>
            <li> One day I will fill my tub with it and relax, and when I get out I will look 10 years younger, at least that&#x27;s what happens in my dreams ;)</li>
            <li> It did not dry out my face like some face masks do (and I have dry skin.)</li>
            <li> I left it on extra long compared to the directions to see what it would do.</li>
            <li> and it comes in a BIG jar so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> So the scoop on Dead Sea mud; It&#x27;s known for its high concentrations of salts and minerals which include magnesium, sodium, potassium and calcium.</li>
            <li> I tend to leave it on 10-15 minutes because I apply it pretty thick.</li>
            <li> Such a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> mask is very dense and thick, it is also relatively scent</li>
            <li> so I know this jar will last me a very long time!</li>
            <li> I have done mud masks before, but honestly, I never cared much for them.</li>
            <li> Because it increases blood flow and circulation it keeps hair follicles oxygenated and promotes the growth of proteins, for cellulite it prevents the bumps being accentuated and enlarged by fluids trapped in skin tissues near the surface.</li>
            <li> This mud comes from the Dead Sea where it is naturally formed.</li>
            <li> I applied and even layer not too thick yet not thin either.</li>
            <li> I left it a bit longer on that the instructions stated, while I was doing other things around the house and after about 30 minutes I washed it off.</li>
            <li> She is allowed to do this as long as she helps me review the product!  </li>
            <li> then it took awhile to dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and</li>
            <li> I wanted to let it actually dry, you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like the natural ingredients and oils, and I believe the added xanthan gum gave it its weird</li>
            <li> when dry wash off,thats it</li>
            <li> I put it on and let it dry for about 5-10 minutes then washed it off with circular motions to exfoliate some.</li>
            <li> I swear, I don&#x27;t ever wear masks because they dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I let it dry then rub it off in circles with a damp washcloth for the exfoliation.</li>
            <li> but I was never a fan of the way these dry</li>
            <li> but now I can&#x27;t not live without it.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a little gritty like other mud masks that I’ve used, or really thin like other smooth masks I’ve tried.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to lead towards dry in areas other than the T-zone, its not particularly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and have been using different kinds of masks in the past several years to maintain my skin  (including Oil of Olay since I was 27).  </li>
            <li> I also white heads and black heads.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my pores seemed less visible and my skin had a definite glow.</li>
            <li> I could definitely see a difference with the amount of pores that typically show, it seemed to reduce that appearance.</li>
            <li> I know how good they are for the skin and the pores, but I hadn&#x27;t used one in a long while because I just hated feeling</li>
            <li> Sometimes I struggle with clogged pores and minor break outs due to hormonal changes.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this, having used masks in the past that dried my skin or left it reddened.</li>
            <li> and my face feels so tight and is often red afterwards</li>
            <li> It puts a little color &amp; life back in you skin.</li>
            <li> so you dont really need a very thick</li>
            <li> To begin with I&#x27;m not a very mask person.</li>
            <li> Only con was it was messy</li>
            <li> Product arrived neat and carefully packed.</li>
            <li> Because Dead Sea Mud contains all the same minerals as the Dead Sea, it has the same healing properties.  </li>
            <li> i expected a stinky cream</li>
            <li> and I didn’t pay an arm and leg like I expected</li>
            <li> The directions recommend using twice weekly , however I could use it every single day !!</li>
            <li> Also a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> but I intend to use it in other places as well.</li>
            <li> So now behind the science of this stuff, the mineral content accelerates natural exfoliation (the removing and renewing of dead skin) and restores your skin&#x27;s pH balance with regular use.</li>
            <li> Other masks I have tried</li>
            <li> purchased this product at a reduced price to facilitate this review but was not compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> Sea anything, though, is the talk of the town in terms of skin care, and other things.</li>
            <li> BEEN COMPENSATED FOR MY REVIEW BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR OR ANY OTHER ENTITY</li>
            <li> From the first use I knew I was going to be addicted!  </li>
            <li> and I have seen no adverse reactions, redness or had any other problems.  </li>
            <li> It takes at least five minutes just to file my nails and push back the cuticles.</li>
            <li> I was still hesitant when I opened the package and it looked like a dark mud to me.  </li>
            <li> They felt heavy and they never really smelled pleasing.</li>
            <li> I like when a company stands behind their product and offers the &amp;#34;No Risk&amp;#34</li>
            <li> unlike a lot of other mud masks that seem to dry to fast and are just all around unpleasant.</li>
            <li> BUT I also found some other things this mask can help with while researching the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> It really only takes a little, even if you coat it on thickly.</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult to get off in the shower, but not impossible; again probably because I put it on too thick.</li>
            <li> This jar should last me a few months, even with applying it thick.</li>
            <li> I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and applied only a thin layer in the shower.</li>
            <li> You could feel the mud mask drying and your face will feel slightly tight.</li>
            <li> I think I put it on too thick because it didn&#x27;t fully dry.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant when I saw the name of the product.</li>
            <li> i could feel a little tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> I have been at the dead sea once and tried the mud.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to go to the dead sea again just to experience this.</li>
            <li> waited about 15-20 mins or till I feel that the mask completely dried</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea boarders Jordan to the east and Israel to the west.</li>
            <li> Deionized water, Dead sea mud, kaolin, Shea butter, Sunflower oil, Aloe vera juice, Vegetable glycerin, Jojoba oil, Hickory bark extract, Calendula oil, Xanthan gum.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea mud mask cream helped relax and moisturize our faces, making us feel like we were having a spa day!I&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so harsh in your face too when you apply it.</li>
            <li> In about 3 minutes, I felt my face start to &amp;#34;tighten&amp;#34; as the mask dried.</li>
            <li> I felt it was a waste of my money.&lt;br /&gt;Refund requested.</li>
            <li> I have a few on my nose</li>
            <li> I use it everyday without any irritations.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud is one of the oldest beauty secrets around.  </li>
            <li> Scientist cannot say why dead sea mud is so beneficial for skin, but they do say that it is.  </li>
            <li> Dead Sea minerals can improve the quality of life for psoriasis patients, hydrate the skin and reduce roughness and inflammation.  </li>
            <li> In addition, Dead Sea Mud can kill the bacteria that causes acne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using twice a week for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After it dried , when I went to take it off-it didn&#x27;t pull half of my skin off!  </li>
            <li> apply a thin layer of the mask, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Immediately I noticed my skin a little softer and less dull.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try if for no other reason than that even doing it once would be cheaper than going to a spa or salon, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to feel guilty if I still didn&#x27;t like it and passed it off to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so start with a little bit!</li>
            <li> The biggest problems I run into, though, is that is has a heavy scent or just plain feels icky, or that it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed</li>
            <li> I think that might be because I&#x27;ve neglect my neck in the past  </li>
            <li> There clearly is weird fragrance added to this mask but no mentioning of such on the label.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who has only skin and big pores you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using this product correctly</li>
            <li> Cleopatra used dead sea mud in her beauty routine!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for past 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> HOLY COW!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked that my neck /chest looks like it belongs to a 30year old</li>
            <li> I haven’t noticed any negative reaction with my skin.</li>
            <li> I will say have something like a paper towel underneath or do it over the sink because when rubbing the mask off it leaves the mask along with any dead skin cells behind.</li>
            <li> I take my skincare seriously and this has earned its place on my vanity.  </li>
            <li> That is why expensive companies like AHAVA use dead sea mud in all their products.  </li>
            <li> I HAD 3 cystic acne blemishes on my face - very deep, painful and would not heal up.</li>
            <li> mud mask goes on smoothly, it&#x27;s very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not all that bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud Mask by Majestic Pure is amazing! The texture is nice and creamy, it goes on your skin very smoothly. It is very easy to get an even layer since the consistency of this mask is so nice. The smell is amazing as well. Its hard to describe but to me its like a nice clean, fresh scent. The mask does not dry hard like other masks I&#x27;ve used, which was kind of nice but not something I was used to. I have super oily skin and when I woke up this morning my skin was not oily and sticky like it normally is so I think this mask soaked up a lot of my excess oil. Overall I am loving this product and would surely recommend it to my friends. I bought this item at a promotional price and am sharing my honest and unbiased opinion about the product here with you.</li>
            <li> I have been at the dead sea once and tried the mud. So when I get the chance to review this item I am really looking forward for the same result.. Well it did.. From the comfort of your own home.. I don&#x27;t need to go to the dead sea again just to experience this.</li>
            <li> I brought this mud mask to a spa party and it was a big hit!! All my girls loved the mask, including myself! It was easy to apply and dried very nicely and evenly unless you put too much..then it took awhile to dry. It smelled really great too! You could feel the mud mask drying and your face will feel slightly tight. But guess what?! You don&#x27;t have to wash it off!!! To remove it you simply rub it off in a circular motion with your fingers and it will start to come off!!! That&#x27;s awesome because I hate water in my face! I will say have something like a paper towel underneath or do it over the sink because when rubbing the mask off it leaves the mask along with any dead skin cells behind. The result is a brighter, softer more supple skin! I was amazed! I love majestic pure products and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint either!! Highly recommend!! I purchased this item to review during a promotional period and any opinions expressed are my own unbiased opinions on the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I&#x27;ve purchased and started using the product. I use this about twice a week. I thought it would be too soon to leave a review however, when seeing one of my colleagues at the grocery store (without make up whatsoever) after the 2nd week - she commented about how great my skin looks great. Keep in mind she sees me everyday at work so for her to see me without no make up at all and comment how my skin looks &amp;#34;so great&amp;#34; is certainly a compliment.  I see it working myself but I always leave it up to run in&#x27;s like that to confirm it.  So it seems to be working so far (at 3 weeks of using it @ 2x a week) so I can&#x27;t wait to see what/how it does with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;m 49 and have been using different kinds of masks in the past several years to maintain my skin  (including Oil of Olay since I was 27).  This one is truly different.</li>
            <li> It is just wonderful, can&#x27;t away from it.</li>
            <li> To begin with I&#x27;m not a very mask person. So when I got the product offered to me for a non biased review I wasn&#x27;t really sure, cause I found little use in these kind of products.&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise the product felt great. I applied a thick layer all around my face, first of all noticing the smell as I wasn&#x27;t expecting it at all was very pleasant. The application went very smooothly and even and the texture of the mask felt light and not sticky or greasy. I left it a bit longer on that the instructions stated, while I was doing other things around the house and after about 30 minutes I washed it off. It came of easily, with gentle scrubs and my skin was left very soft, and my pores almost invisible! That&#x27;s what I liked the best, I&#x27;ve been starting to notice little fine lines around my eyes an dsome very noticeable pores around my cheeks and forehead, though I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work a miracle or at all on my fine lines, it did made my pores shrink a lot! I wore make up after and I could actually notice the difference, not abysmal, but you could still notice it. Now i&#x27;ve been trying to use it 2 or 3 times a week before bed, and so far the results have been good. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a product I would repurchase but for someone who likes masks, this is definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to give this a try since the Majestic Pure line has been so good to me. This was an amazing dead sea mud mask. Here are a few things that make it outstanding and a few reasons you should try it if you are looking for this as an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) There is no scent.&lt;br /&gt;2) It dries within 6 minutes so if you need a quick face mask, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;3) It cleans off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;4) It does what it says. I noticed within the first use that my pores (which have started to enlarge) were smaller and less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that you should test this product on your hand or a small patch of skin first. Leave it on for about 5 minutes and make sure you don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to have been chosen to try this and give my review to others. Majestic Pure is amazing and their products are always high quality.</li>
            <li> Charlie and I used this and we both liked how well it went on when we applied it. It did not have overpowering scent. It was not greasy when we applied it. I would purchase it again to give for Gifts. It is good for men and women. If you have not tried out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask you should as you will be amazed by how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I rarely get the chance to do a little pampering for myself, but I was very excited to try out this Dead Sea Mud Mask.  Pushing the big 4-0 has turned my pores into canyons and different cleansers and scrubs. Twice this week I put the mask on about 10 minutes before hopping in the shower, let it harden, and rinsed it off while showering- I have already noticed a big difference in pore size and it has improved the coloring in my face (Which I didn&#x27;t even know was off), and my skin also feels softer. I just finish it up with a light moisturizer. I will surely be purchasing it again as part of my skin care routine. I received the product at a reduced price for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I love trying new beauty products,  but it has always been important to me that the products contain no chemicals.  Having been to the Dead Sea,  I was familiar with the wonderful things the mud can do for your skin. This mask was easy to put on and had just the lightest fragrance to it.  After making sure it was safe, I even let my toddler try some. She loves to do whatever mommy is doing and this will make for great &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; days for her and I. It will leave your skin clean,  bright,  and firm after just one use. It&#x27;s a very large bottle that should last for months.  Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> I love this mud mask! My face is clear and hydrated. I have been using it for . Week I received this to review but now I can&#x27;t not live without it.</li>
            <li> I love dead sea masks, I have tried a lot already from other brands and I just cant get enough.&lt;br /&gt;This product delivers us the best of the Dead Sea in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The mask is very dense and thick, it is also relatively scent free.&lt;br /&gt;My way of using this mask is that I steam my face first to help my pores to open up.&lt;br /&gt;You can also use a lukewarm water to wet you face and dab it later on with a clean towel.&lt;br /&gt;I apply a thin layer of the mask, a little goes a long way. This mask is very potent so you dont really need a very thick layer.&lt;br /&gt;I waited about 15-20 mins or till I feel that the mask completely dried up.&lt;br /&gt;I would then feel some tightening and tingling while it&#x27;s drying. It&#x27;s another way to know that the mask is working.&lt;br /&gt;I rinse it afterwards using cold water, this will help my pores to close and also to increase blood circulation in my face.&lt;br /&gt;My skin would feel smoother and softer each and every session. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I only use this mask once every week, and it really helped me with my acnes.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and I definitely recommend it. It feels like you treat yourself to a quick spa session.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this using a promo code for testing.</li>
            <li> I take my skincare seriously and this has earned its place on my vanity.  I&#x27;ve gotten facials with similar products from spas for triple the price. I enjoy being able to save a few dollars and do it myself in the comfort of my own home. This Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask helped to clarify my skin. Sometimes I struggle with clogged pores and minor break outs due to hormonal changes. This cleared my pores (and they appeared smaller) and minimized the break out under my chin during that time.&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly repurchase. I may even buy several and add this to my bridesmaid gifts!&lt;br /&gt;I found the mask easy to remove with a damp cloth and it wasn&#x27;t drying at all. I have come to really love Majestic Pure as a brand. I&#x27;ve known them to have the freshest natural ingredients for the best price I&#x27;ve ever been able to find. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this awesome Mud Mask. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice mud mask and easy to use I have dry skin and this not dry it out..I love putting it on before a shower and then washing it off in the  shower..This product makes my skin soft and smoother feeling..I got this product at a reduced price in exchange of a review..great product..will buy again..</li>
            <li> My skin has been kind of blah lately with summer heat and pregnancy.  I wanted to try something to help it out.  I used this mud mask the other day and really liked it.  Immediately I noticed my skin a little softer and less dull.  I can&#x27;t say for sure it made my pores shrink or anything, since I have only used it once so far, but I am hopeful.  It was really gentle on my face.  I didn&#x27;t have to scrub or anything.  It went on easily and really didn&#x27;t need to use much at all to cover my face.  The smell was kind of muted so no strong odors which is nice.  I am looking forward to continued use and hopefully continued good results.  I received the product at a reduced price for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask is amazing. I used it on my face but I intend to use it in other places as well. I applied just a thin coat, relaxed and then washed it off! It left my face feeling smooth and extremely clean. It was also relaxing!</li>
            <li> I see no difference in my face after using this. I also don&#x27;t feel a difference in my skin texture after using this. This mask is definitely not a &amp;#34;pore-ridding&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;cleansing-type&amp;#34; of mask</li>
            <li> Warning: Stay away from your dogs when using this product. I think mine might not recover from the shock. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mud mask goes on smoothly, it&#x27;s very thick and creamy. It has an light, earthy scent that&#x27;s almost a non-scent. I think I put it on too thick because it didn&#x27;t fully dry. It was a little difficult to get off in the shower, but not impossible; again probably because I put it on too thick. My skin is soft afterwards and it looks nice. I had no irritations.  My daughter used it and said it worked great for her too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> So the scoop on Dead Sea mud; It&#x27;s known for its high concentrations of salts and minerals which include magnesium, sodium, potassium and calcium. It has connections with health benefits and is renowned for its healing properties. As far as for your skin it has been used as an over the counter treatment for psoriasis, eczema and acne. Cosmetically it can improve skin elasticity and minimize pores, wrinkles and lines. So now behind the science of this stuff, the mineral content accelerates natural exfoliation (the removing and renewing of dead skin) and restores your skin&#x27;s pH balance with regular use. When it dries, toxins from diet, pollution, and even makeup are naturally drawn out. Now I knew about these benefits and have been regularly using this mask, and can attest to these benefits. BUT I also found some other things this mask can help with while researching the Dead Sea. Are you ready for some craziness? It has been used as a preventative measure for hair loss, and cellulite. Because it increases blood flow and circulation it keeps hair follicles oxygenated and promotes the growth of proteins, for cellulite it prevents the bumps being accentuated and enlarged by fluids trapped in skin tissues near the surface. This mud comes from the Dead Sea where it is naturally formed. The Dead Sea boarders Jordan to the east and Israel to the west. It has been a source of health secrets for centuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, slather this all over yourself to look forever young. One day I will fill my tub with it and relax, and when I get out I will look 10 years younger, at least that&#x27;s what happens in my dreams ;)</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It really cleans and shrinks my pores. My skin feels tight and great when I use it. It helps even the texture of my skin. High quality mask for a great price.</li>
            <li> Smooth and smoothing mask! I was pleasantly surprised by this, having used masks in the past that dried my skin or left it reddened. It went on very smoothly and felt relaxing, which was an instant mark in its favor. The instructions say to rub it off after it dries in order to exfoliate before washing off your face. I did this and found it to be an excellent, gentle exfoliator. It washed off easily and left my face clean, smooth, and (exciting for me and my sensitive skin) not red or oily. The appearance of pores was indeed somewhat reduced, but what I really noticed was the smooth, clear look of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8-plus-ounce container will last a long time because you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot; it spreads willingly and with a nice smooth texture. The added shea butter, oils, and extracts really accent the effectiveness of the dead sea mud. There&#x27;s no added scent and the natural smell is very mild. I find the dark blue-grey color attractive too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> Def going to buy again. I love this mask. It leaves my skin looking younger.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this mask. Also a little goes a long way so I know this jar will last me a very long time! Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> This has done nice things to my face but the really surprising result is my neck and cleavage !!  I think that might be because I&#x27;ve neglect my neck in the past  I&#x27;m shocked that my neck /chest looks like it belongs to a 30year old and I&#x27;m 67</li>
            <li> As soon as I got this today I just had to try it, and its Awesome. First it goes on real smooth and creamy. And it doesn&#x27;t tighten your face that it feels like it will break. And when it comes time to remove it, it just rubs off and then you follow up with warm water. It leaves your face feeling sooooo smooth! Most other mud mask leaves your face real tight and dry, so much so you can&#x27;t wait to put some moisturizer on it, but not Dead Sea Mud Mask it leave it so smooth you almost forget to even put some moisturizer on it. I will be buying this product again. My teen also tried it and she absolutely loves it also!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think of this at first. I was going to be rubbing mud all over my face and it sounds like something I did while playing in my backyard as a kid. But eh, why not give it a shot eh? I have to say that I was pleased with the smell, and though the kids looked at me at first like I was a crazy person, eventually they got over that. ;) I&#x27;m teasing, it wasn&#x27;t that bad. My 9 year old asked why I was putting mud on my face though!&lt;br /&gt;My toddler thought I was hilarious looking the entire time this sat on my face, which I let be longer than the five minutes because after five minutes some of it was still a little wet to the touch. I wanted to let it actually dry, you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a headache at the time, so excuse my less than thrilled expression in the photos!&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the experience despite looking like I didn&#x27;t. This seems like the perfect thing to do while having someone give me a foot rub as I watch netflix and pretend I&#x27;m totally more awesome and pampered than I really am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face was nice and smooth after removing this too. Though I almost went right to splashing water on myself, what you&#x27;re actually supposed to do is rub the mask off of your face in a circular motion. Which causes it to shluf off similar to how skin does when you&#x27;re using an exfoliating cloth on your arms and legs. So it was kind of messy in that regards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product at a reduced price in order to facilitate my review and give my honest thoughts and opinions. I will say that this is honestly a great product and I highly recommend it even if you haven&#x27;t ever done a mud mask and are kind of thinking it&#x27;s gross. It&#x27;s really not all that bad.</li>
            <li> I just used this mask &amp; I am impressed!  After it dried , when I went to take it off-it didn&#x27;t pull half of my skin off!  Other masks I have tried-they wore me out trying to get all of it off. This comes off easily &amp; leaves your skin looking marvelous &amp; feeling great.  I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. You have to try this!  It puts a little color &amp; life back in you skin. Thank You!</li>
            <li> I love it. When I put it on my face it has a like cool effect to it which is nice and when I washed my face it was so soft. This is my first use and I&#x27;m already hooked my blackheads on my nose are almost all gone which is the reason I bough it and I love it</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this Dead Sea Mud Mask. It has a nice mild smell and a smooth texture, really covers well,  unlike a lot of other mud masks that seem to dry to fast and are just all around unpleasant. Leaves my skin extremely soft and healthy looking. Doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores or cause breakouts.  Very happy I was able to review this product for my unbiased opinion, because I typically do not try mud mask.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a reduced rate so my family could review the product&#x27;s benefits.  This is another product I have purchased recently that my 15 year old daughter had to &amp;#34;snag&amp;#34; the moment it came into the house.  She is allowed to do this as long as she helps me review the product!  I have also used this and we both like it.  We put the mask on after we remove make-up and wash our faces.  Next I just let it sit until it starts to dry, where as my daughter lets it dry completely.  I think we both get great results as we both have clean, smooth skin and my daughter is reporting that the acne she has on her forehead has improved.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this as I saw the list of ingredients: Deionized water, Dead sea mud, kaolin, Shea butter, Sunflower oil, Aloe vera juice, Vegetable glycerin, Jojoba oil, Hickory bark extract, Calendula oil, Xanthan gum. From seeing the list, I would not have dreamt of smelling anything artificial. This mask smells like a very cheap after shave lotion. I can&#x27;t even imagine putting this on my face. There clearly is weird fragrance added to this mask but no mentioning of such on the label. Such a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea mud mask cream helped relax and moisturize our faces, making us feel like we were having a spa day!I&lt;br /&gt;We purchased this product in a promotion for testing and review.  The cream is a grey color but very smooth, and has&lt;br /&gt;a nice and mild scent.  Excellent perk not to have to mix a powder, as well!</li>
            <li> I received this mask to review and I loved it. It made my skin feel rejuvenated And refreshed. I would definitely recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> That is good for cleaning</li>
            <li> Have already left a review for this but really love it so it is worth saying twice.  It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I really like this mask especially since it only has to be on for 5 minutes. It was great that it was premixed it was soothing to put on. I didn&#x27;t feel the stinging sensation some people have mentioned.  I was given this product for a review and over all my opinion is I will be buing another jar once this one runs out..</li>
            <li> I have been on a beauty product kick lately, and I must say that I&#x27;m glad that I got the chance to review this product! I was so eager to try it out that I couldn&#x27;t wait to put it on. You can see the what it looks like on my face by clicking on this link: [...]. I left it on extra long compared to the directions to see what it would do. It didn&#x27;t make my face hurt, if anything the longer it was on the better it made my face feel. When I took it off, it came off easily. It left my face feeling revamped and also smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure is a company that is located in Carlsbad, California (I like USA products), however they partner with companies that include Chile, Italy, France, Bulgaria, India, Morocco, and China. They claim that all products are 100% pure. Their products include essential oils, carrier oils, clays, toners, and botanical serums.  I tried it after seeing all of the great reviews on Amazon, and I have to say - I agree. I really like this mask.  It is a thick but creamy mud that is easy to apply. Some mud masks are thick with mud chunks and difficult to put on the face. Not this one. It is easy to apply, and tightens as it dries. After removing the mask I found that my pores were in fact smaller, which is what I was hoping for.  It removes impurities, and makes the skin feel soft after using.  Overall, a very nice mud mask that I recommend, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> You are going to fall in love with this deep cleaning mask. I love it it leaves my skin feeling fresh and cleaned. I have oily and my pores are so gross. I also white heads and black heads. This has helped me diminish those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mud mask smells so good you will feel like you are in a spa. This mask will absorbed excess oil and remove dead skin. When you finish using it you will see the difference and feel it. I promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has helped me hydrate, tighten and tone my skin. It deep cleans your pores and also helps with acne.&lt;br /&gt;I get inflammation and it helps with that pro else specially when it&#x27;s hot outside. Give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to sample, review and give you my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I have used this mask on 3 different occasions.  I love the feel when applying the mask and the results and great.  I have noticed smaller looking pores and clear looking skin. I would recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This facial mask is amazing. I gave this product to my sister and so far she&#x27;s liking this.For more than a month using this procduct, her face is much clearer and brighter.It&#x27;s not so harsh in your face too when you apply it.It doesn&#x27;t have an un- appealing smell.She would love to buy more of this.I got ths product with a discount but I won&#x27;t mind buying this product for myself.I will recommend this product to all the ladies who wants to have a young looking skin or face.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the way my face feels afterwards.  This a good product and excellent value</li>
            <li> This mask is surprisingly smooth and thick, but easy to apply. I expected it to be a little gritty like other mud masks that I’ve used, or really thin like other smooth masks I’ve tried. The mud looks very perfect, not like other mud masks; it almost looks fake since the color is so defined. The directions are simple and easy, but instead of leaving it on  for 5 minutes, I leave it on for up to 15 minutes. I really like the natural ingredients and oils, and I believe the added xanthan gum gave it its weird look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a thick consistency and covers my face perfectly and evenly without feeling heavy or clogging on my skin. It’s very gentle and has a light scent. It’s very easy to wash off and leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft, and not dry/stripped like most other masks that I have used, but I still follow with a moisturizer. I haven’t noticed any negative reaction with my skin. I have combination (mostly oily), dull, and acne prone skin. It seemed to reduce shine and oiliness, and didn’t cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is a must to have I absolutely love this product not only does it go on very smooth there is no stinging, no burning, and no nasty odor In thus proproduct. It feels so silky on my skin. 😁</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product that works!! I used it thinking it was going to be like others that I&#x27;ve tried and instead it left my face feeling clean and refreshing!!!</li>
            <li> Product left skin feeling soft. Pleasant order. Easy to dry and wipe off. I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I love this mud mask! Loved the way it left my face feeling.. Only con was it was messy but that was to be exoected</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> This mask is an excellent combination of white clay, dead sea salts, and dead sea mud.  It is rich and even thick, requiring no stirring or mixing of the product before use.  An even thick layer is allowed to dry to the touch before rinsing cleanly away.  Skin is left feeling refreshed and moisturized.  One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> i so am in love with this mud mask,it leaves my skin soft,less stressed and summer ready.just throw some on your face while you are relaxing or cleaning house and forget it for a while,when dry wash off,thats it no extra work and you will be surprised how baby soft you feel.i received a promotion for the purchase of this product to review,whew so glad i did!</li>
            <li> Cool it feels awesome</li>
            <li> This has shea butter in it, so I found out upon receiving it that I couldn&#x27;t use it. I gave it to my son who struggles with acne as well. He seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Loved pampering myself with this.  Left my skin feeling fantastic.  The packaging and smell are very pleasing and I really enjoyed using this product.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and applied only a thin layer in the shower. Worked great! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I had really bad eczema so I don&#x27;t use many products on my skin because some products can cause serious skin irritation after reading  the reviews on this mud mask I decided to try it my product came fast I tested it out on my arm no irritation I follow the I applied a thin layer of mask it works better for me after the first application my skin felt so soft and smooth before I even applied the moisturizer the second application by blemishes started to dissappear I really love this mud mask I can&#x27;t wait to finish this jar I&#x27;m definitely gonna purchase more I&#x27;m very happy with product and results I&#x27;m getting. ☺</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and very sensitive skin. I also have large pores. I&#x27;m careful with what I put on my skin since it tends to breakout very easily. I tried this mud mask because it&#x27;s 100% natural and because it came to me highly recommended. When I opened it, I first noticed the incredibly fresh smell. I used it at the end of a shower so that my pores would be nice and open, and I applied a somewhat thin layer of the facial mask- just enough to cover my entire face without piling it on. In about 3 minutes, I felt my face start to &amp;#34;tighten&amp;#34; as the mask dried. I washed it off with just my hands and warm water after about 5 minutes. I noticed that my pores seemed less visible and my skin had a definite glow. I was pretty surprised at the noticeable results so quickly. I&#x27;ve continued to use this product twice a week and my skin looks great. I enjoy the scent, it&#x27;s easy to use and it comes in a BIG jar so it will last a long time. I did receive a discount for this item but I&#x27;m very happy with it and will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this quickly but it went on oily and didn&#x27;t dry ? didn&#x27;t  exfoliate either, no difference in my skin. I felt it was a waste of my money.&lt;br /&gt;Refund requested.</li>
            <li> I was glad to receive this dead sea mud mask. arrived early and you get a nice full jar. Smells so good. I&#x27;m already  loving it. i recommend to everyone. its amazing the after results. my face is super soft and less sensitive to the hot summer air. best thing is that you can use it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received  this product for free or discount  for an honest  review as stated above</li>
            <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Omg. I cannot tell you how much i love this product. This was my first time trying a a mud mask. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. This mak has a smooth texture and goes on easy and doesnt require a large amount to be used.  Within minutes I felt tingling.  By that I know that this is working to clean out all my clogged pores. After I washed it off, my skin felt clean, fresh, and had a glow. My face was so soft.</li>
            <li> I am 33 and just started using these types of products. This product is great it left my skin looking and feeling great. I do not have huge pores but this made my skin look flawless, and I felt so soft and smooth. It was easy to apply I just used my fingers and it didn&#x27;t dry completely out to where it cracked or anything I left it on for about 8 min the directions says 5 it was easy to remove I just used water and a face brush to wash it off. I was sent this product for review but defiantly will purchase it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this mud mask! My face felt very refreshed after using this. I could definitely see a difference with the amount of pores that typically show, it seemed to reduce that appearance. I did receive this product at discount, however, I felt like I was having a spa moment when using this product. It washed well afterwards, meaning didn&#x27;t feel gritty at all. My face felt smoother and visibly looked healthier with a younger glow. I would most definitely recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> Once Again, I got to try out some of Majestic Pure&#x27;s product.... It&#x27;s the best natural products I&#x27;ve ever used.  The dead sea mud mask was seriously super amazing. I put it on (scared my toddlers a bit, which was fun) and after the 5 minutes I removed it... When I got it all off I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my face felt.  I was totally surprised with the results, and pleasantly at that.</li>
            <li> Nothing makes me feel quite as pampered as a good mud mask, usually while taking a relaxing bubble bath. It&#x27;s like boom, instant at-home spa! This one is made from the healing mud of the dead sea, which has a higher concentration of salts and minerals to promote healing and all sorts of skin benefits. What I love about it is how fabulous my skin looks and feels after using it. My pores are visibly smaller and my skin is softer to the touch and feels tightened and tingly. It really only takes a little, even if you coat it on thickly. Just be sure to rinse thoroughly, the mud likes to hide in the small creases in your face such as beside your nose. This would be a sweet gift for any lady - or guy!-  in your life, from teen to grandma, who wants gorgeous skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Great product! Definitely makes your skin smoother and clearer... unless you use it too often! Make sure to only use it every couple weeks or else your skin will dry out and acne will form.</li>
            <li> Wow! I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, this was my first time doing a Dead Sea mask. I am so shocked how well it worked! I tend to have dryness in my t zone. But the blackheads on my nose are impossible to get rid of. This took care of them! They washed away w with the mask! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> SMELLS HEAVENLY!!! HOLY COW!!! Can this PLEASE be a perfume/cologne scent!? LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels silky and though I can&#x27;t SEE a difference on my skin it feels a  little more even (I have very combination skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impressed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I was given this product at a reduced rate. In exchange I opted to give a review.</li>
            <li> I love this mask it is the best product I have ever bought for my face!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Makes my face feel firmer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!! So many masks claim to detoxify, refine, and minimize pores.  Well let me be one to say \\&quot;THIS S*** IS REAL!\\&quot;  Deep Sea Mud is the only thing that time after time that no matter what, you can rely on. The most exotic and exclusive ingredient rich products you pay a fortune for are such a gamble.  Majestic has done right by combining all the best and effective into a deep sea mud mask that does what it claims. Need I say more?</li>
            <li> To be honest being a male transgender into a female I cannot say enough to express myself on how satisfied I am with this product!!  My face is so smooth now my pores are almost gone the feeling is amazing I recommend this to anyone who has only skin and big pores you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  It is an authentic beauty product and looks like the brand it&#x27;s the key because I just tried another product from the same brand and it&#x27;s also amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Loved this mask, the smell and texture of it was smooth, applied as directed and removed as directed it left my face and neck soft and clear of all dry skin.  It felt like I had been to the spa and had one of those 200 dollar facials.  I really enjoyed this treatment then sitting back while it dried gave me 15 minutes of relaxation. Well if you can&#x27;t go to the spa you can have the spa come to you.  This was a true pleasure.  I have used this several times and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a reduced price to facilitate this review but was not compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love Love! Buy it!</li>
            <li> I was given a discount in order to provide my honest feedback on this product. Since I am a little obsessed with taking good care of my skin, I felt it was an honor to try it out and provide my results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, first off, it&#x27;s a clay face mask that ummm smells pretty much like clay! That is ok, the benefits are definitely worth it and yucky addictives are no good for your skin anyways! I compare this face mask to Origins ash clay mask because of the detox ingredients and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is rich and a little goes a long way so start with a little bit! I also want to add that there is an actual expiration date on the product! Too many times I buy beauty items and have no idea when it&#x27;ll be good until. This little added touch gives me comfort that the product I&#x27;m using is fresh and a date to toss it out; how neat!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister and she loves it so far! Said it makes her skin so soft</li>
            <li> This mask smells so good. It smells clean and fresh, which I didn&#x27;t expect from a mud mask. My face felt much softer after using this. I put it on and let it dry for about 5-10 minutes then washed it off with circular motions to exfoliate some. It smells great and moisturizes a lot. I received it discounted through AMZ Review Trader.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mask that leaves your skin feeling smooth and refreshed after each use.  Using it twice a week has not caused any irritation to my skin and I can visibly see a difference in my skin. It is hands down better than masks I have purchased from drug stores and does not leave the dry itchy feeling that some give you. It looks renewed or refreshed, and I look forward to continued results.  It is supposed to help minimize pores as well.  I have a few on my nose and I will update my review after a few more uses to let you know if I have noticed any improvement there.</li>
            <li> Awesome product . Makes my face feel refreshing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using this product correctly but I did not see any differences. I do like how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> perfect for the price. Before I noticed any change my husband already told me my facial skin looked clearly brighter and younger after the mud was washed off.  Good part for me it&#x27;s for normal to dry skin, pretty mild. I use it everyday without any irritations. This is a great product for myself.</li>
            <li> I like it! Very refreshing. Have only used a few times but feel that with routine use I Would see more significant results.</li>
            <li> I have done mud masks before, but honestly, I never cared much for them. They felt heavy and they never really smelled pleasing. They didn&#x27;t smell BAD, per se, but they sure didn&#x27;t smell good. I know how good they are for the skin and the pores, but I hadn&#x27;t used one in a long while because I just hated feeling like there was about five pound of gunk on my face that smelled weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead Sea anything, though, is the talk of the town in terms of skin care, and other things. I thought I would give it a try if for no other reason than that even doing it once would be cheaper than going to a spa or salon, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to feel guilty if I still didn&#x27;t like it and passed it off to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn&#x27;t have worried. This mask is everything I thought mud masks were NOT! First off, it smells GOOD. I don&#x27;t mean that it just doesn&#x27;t smell bad or weird, I mean it was a pleasant experience to wear it for five minutes, almost like aroma therapy, I would say. It&#x27;s also much lighter feeling than other masks I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m definitely going to incorporate this into my alternating weekend &amp;#34;pamper myself&amp;#34; routine. That should be easy. It takes at least five minutes just to file my nails and push back the cuticles. I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot, so I think I should be good for a few months. By then my birthday will have rolled around and I can drop hints to the hubster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST, FAIR AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN. I HAVE IN NO WAY BEEN COMPENSATED FOR MY REVIEW BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR OR ANY OTHER ENTITY ASIDE FROM SAID DISCOUNT*</li>
            <li> Great so far.  Smells nice. Seemed to really open up my pores!  Fast shipping.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really a fan of this mud mask! Got this product to review and sample! Easy to use and feel great on my skin during and after!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  It leaves my face looking so clear and healthy and it also leaves my skin feeling amazing and refreshed!  I received it as a trial and I absolutely love it! It really helps to minimize my pores!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this stuff. Cleared up some hormonal acne and made my skin feel unbelievably soft. Loved that a little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> I love using face masks. It&#x27;s such a nice treat at the end of a busy week. I&#x27;m really enjoying this one. My skin feels smoother and looks more toned. I&#x27;m really happy to have received this product for review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what live sea mud feels like, but this Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud feels GREAAAAATTTT. I never paid much attention to skin. I just wash my face in the shower with regular old soap, but this makes me feel moisturized and silky smooth and bright and happy.  Definitely a great and worthwhile buy . I was out having everyone feel my silky face and showing them the product. My akin is free of oils and it seems to have evened out the tone as well.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant when I saw the name of the product. Oh was I wrong, this stuff smells good, its soft, smooth and you dont need alot to apply on. Once I applied the mud on, theres a cool sensation with a slight tingly feeling. Product did not crack like I expected and was easy to peel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend this product to anyone. It left my skin feeling soft &amp; smooth</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Face felt so smooth after. Smooth feeling lasted throughout the day. I am a new customer and I highly recommend giving this dead sea mud mask a go.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this mask! I makes my skin look and feel soooo good. I was spending a fortune on another new &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; mask just like this and I can honestly say never again! I cannot say enough good things about this one! A KEEPER!!!</li>
            <li> The power of mud is amazing you can really feel it pulling your skin tight as it dries. Plus the fact it is sea mud makes it even better because the sea salt pulls out impurities also. This is a large bottle that will last you a long time. Lid easily goes on and off bottle is easy to read and directions. I was sent this product free to review and would recommend it to family and friends</li>
            <li> Wow this mask is amazing. I have extremely sensitive skin and this mask is the best one I have come across. I have always had several blackheads all over my nose which drive me nuts. This mask cleans them right out, and leaves my skin feeling very smooth without being dried out. And it smells really good too.</li>
            <li> I am an avid face mask user. I have used cheap Walmart packets ($1), Glam Glow ($70), LUSH handmade fresh face masks, and many many more. It&#x27;s in a plastic jar and there is a plastic seal between the jar and lid so nothing spilled out or anything! It is an 8.8 oz jar and it is full, not like potato chips when you buy a huge bag and there&#x27;s only half a bag of chips, lol. It&#x27;s very creamy and feels very nice on the face. I like that it doesn&#x27;t dry all the way, as most &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; masks have alcohol in them and that dries out your face! It didn&#x27;t burn, sting, or anything like that. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and keep neat. It did not dry out my face like some face masks do (and I have dry skin.) My face feels very soft and nice after application. Although always follow a face mask with moisturizer though. I looked up all the ingredients, none of them jumped out as harmful. I will buy a new jar when mine is all gone!&lt;br /&gt;(I received a discount on this item for my HONEST opinion)</li>
            <li> This is one of the smoothest &amp; best smelling mud masks I&#x27;ve found.  I try to use it about 3 times /month after a nice exfoliation. Leaves my skin feeling clean and firm.  It will draw out impurities so sometimes I will experience a breakout or two the day after using it.  It&#x27;s a Tuesday ritual so I&#x27;m glowing for the weekend!</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite face mask I&#x27;ve ever tried! While applying, it feels more like lotion than clay! I love that so much! Its extremely gentle and soothing. Surprisingly, it smells very very nice! I definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> This mud mask feels great!  It goes on so smooth and does not feel like it&#x27;s drying out your face. My skin felt like velvet after I washed it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honest review given for discount.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mud mask</li>
            <li> One of the most amazing mud masks I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> Product for review: I love this mask. It makes my face feel soft. Shipping was quick as well. Product arrived neat and carefully packed. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and i both use this. Our faces were extremely soft after the first use!</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud is one of the oldest beauty secrets around.  Cleopatra used dead sea mud in her beauty routine!  This beneficial mud still remains a modern day phenomena.  Scientist cannot say why dead sea mud is so beneficial for skin, but they do say that it is.  The dead sea is full of magnesium, sodium, phosphates, bromides and other minerals thought to improve skin conditions as well as certain heart and lung conditions.  Dead Sea minerals can improve the quality of life for psoriasis patients, hydrate the skin and reduce roughness and inflammation.  Because Dead Sea Mud contains all the same minerals as the Dead Sea, it has the same healing properties.  In addition, Dead Sea Mud can kill the bacteria that causes acne.  That is why expensive companies like AHAVA use dead sea mud in all their products.  But why spend so much on beauty products when you can get the same healing benefits of Dead Sea mud from Majestic Pure for a fraction of the cost.  I received my first tub of Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask for a reduced  price through a promotional offer.  I use it twice a week to keep my face, neck, and upper chest area clean and happy.  I will definately be buying more.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased this Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask and after using this my face felt as smooth as a baby&#x27;s face.  I called a friend of mine that had purchased this mud mask as well and I asked her if she had used hers yet and she said she hadn&#x27;t and I told her how good it felt and so she did her mud mask after we got off the phone and had the same result as I had using this mask.  I have tried the bentonite clay mask and that worked well too. I can&#x27;t complain about that, my face was not this smooth after using that product, however, my skin looked great.  This mud mask by Majestic Pure is great quality and the company stands behind its product and states they will refund your money within 60 days if you are not satisfied.  I like when a company stands behind their product and offers the &amp;#34;No Risk&amp;#34; guarantee. I am 43 years old and it made my face feel like a baby&#x27;s face and my face looked great...you can believe that I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> This mask leaves a fresh and clean feeling skin. I applied it before I took a shower and took it off after 10 minutes. It worked great. I felt my skin was smoother and clearer after the application. Mud masks are great for a healthy and clean looking skin especially in the summer due to sweat and dirt clogging the pores and making the skin rough. It has a decent amount of product so it&#x27;ll last for a long time. I would totally recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided without any obligations.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good quality mud mask, ive used a few different kinds and i prefer this one over the rest. It has a great consistency and goes on my skin so smooth. I apply a nice thin mask and allow it to completely dry then wash off with warm water. It leaves my skin feeling wonderful, i received this product to test out and i love it! Will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE!!!!! Saw a significant change in the cleanliness of my skin from the first time I used it. I have used it twice now....leaving on for an hour each time. Feels nice and cool on my skin. My pores are much cleaner and I do see the pores on the side of my nose are smaller. I will buy again when I finish the container - which will be a while I&#x27;m sure because a little goes a long way. Great face mask!&lt;br /&gt;**** I have been using for about 2 weeks now - and now I&#x27;m using it daily in the morning. I could not be more pleased at how well this works! I HAD 3 cystic acne blemishes on my face - very deep, painful and would not heal up. I wasn&#x27;t sure that even the deep pore cleaning of this Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask would help draw out the cystic acne areas, BUT it DID!!! No trip to the dermatologist this time! I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use of the mud mask perhaps I won&#x27;t get anymore cysts............that would be AWESOME! My skin is really starting to look healthier and my pores are so much cleaner and smaller!</li>
            <li> From the first use I knew I was going to be addicted!  I&#x27;ve only used this three times but I&#x27;m happy with how much brighter and smoother my face is and is it possible my neck is tighter?  I would say my skin is thrilled and it shows! I will definitely be back for more. I even just may use it on my arms and legs and . . .</li>
            <li> Smells good and effective after using it twice My face feels smooth and very clean. It&#x27;s very refreshing so I cannot wait to see the result in couple months and see the difference. By then I will update my review and possible photos.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! I&#x27;ve been using twice a week for a few weeks. I see immediate results with brightness and it&#x27;s moisturizing too.</li>
            <li> This mask doesn&#x27;t necessarily make me feel like it&#x27;s cleaning my skin the way salt mud ought, BUT it does leave my face feeling like smooth soft silky silk. That probably has something to do with all the shea butter, sunflower oil, and aloe vera juice in it. There&#x27;s no way for me to know all the proportions of everything used in the mud, but I&#x27;d bet all the added oils combined account for most of what&#x27;s in that jar. Wish it felt as though there was more just straight up salt mud in there... Regardless, if you&#x27;re looking for an afternoon of soft skin, this stuff&#x27;s pretty bomb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! It helps to clean your skin in depth as well as exfoliating. I only use it once a week but already see a great improvement!</li>
            <li> Love it so much!! The product gives it a nice feeling and its good for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! You don&#x27;t even need a moisturizer after you use it because when you take it off...your skin feels like SILK! It&#x27;s smooth, it smells good, it feels good, and it isn&#x27;t difficult to remove which is a HUGE plus. I hate messy face masks. I swear, I don&#x27;t ever wear masks because they dry out my skin and my face feels so tight and is often red afterwards but this mud mask is an absolute miracle. The directions recommend using twice weekly , however I could use it every single day !! I can&#x27;t speak enough about this, it really is amazing. My favorite part other than how soft my skin is, is how well it cleans out my pores and I can SEE a difference when I wash it off. I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I got this yesterday and tried last night on myself. Very easy to apply and clean off. Didn&#x27;t break out from it as I have never used it before and I am always leary on trying new facial masks but this worked good it left my skin feeling smooth and not oily. I got this mud mask free to review and to leave my honest feedback on and that is what I have done. Not a bad smell to it and I like how it has a shelf life of 3 years.</li>
            <li> Dope didn&#x27;t except it to be such a great product great price ☺️</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really big into any kind of mask right now, and I love anything that offers pore minimizing benefits. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with a &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; mask, but I was pleasantly surprised with it. I&#x27;ve been using it every couple days for about 2 weeks and especially right after removing it my skin feels tighter. It&#x27;s thick &amp; goopy as you would expect with mud, but very easy to apply &amp; smooth. It has a light, fresh scent that I imagine what would be like going to a spa. I tend to leave it on 10-15 minutes because I apply it pretty thick. I let it dry then rub it off in circles with a damp washcloth for the exfoliation. This jar should last me a few months, even with applying it thick. I received a discount on my purchase for testing purposes, all opinions are of my own.</li>
            <li> I personally have thought that trying a Mud Mask from the dead Sea would be a very healthy product to use considering all of the minerals in the Dead Sea Mid Mask.&lt;br /&gt;This product is 100% pure and from the earth NOT fake or manufactured so you get a wonderful benifit from using a product so pure.&lt;br /&gt;The mud is very dark and rich dark gray brown in color, it&#x27;s thick but distributed very even and not to waste it, this bottle is very generous in size and will last you for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The Majestic company even dates there product so you know when it was manufactured, so you know how fresh it is.&lt;br /&gt;The feel of the mask when applied is cool, and invigorating and once dried, which the mask get lighter in color and slightly tighten so you know it&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;The feel of you skin is soft, new, and firm, not flaky and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mid Mask for free in return to Review &amp; inform the prospective buyers of its benefits.</li>
            <li> I love a good mud mask. The biggest problems I run into, though, is that is has a heavy scent or just plain feels icky, or that it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask has none of the bad, and all of the good. It goes on smooth and even, is totally non-irritating, and only has a very mild, earthy scent. It feels awesome, too. I know that&#x27;s not very specific, but it truly does. It&#x27;s cool and soothing and well, like mud. In a good way. Seriously, it&#x27;s great. Give it a go and get your spa day on. Or you can scare your children...that&#x27;s what happened in my case. The pic will explain why, as well as showing how evenly it covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left my skin soft and smoother, and my pores diminished, which is just what I expect from a good mud mask. This is a wonderful example of such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and jumpy children are my own.</li>
            <li> My whole family loved this product. We did this together one night while watching television. It feels a bit weird going on, but once it comes off, your skin feels real soft and smooth. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price either. When I told my wife the price, she was surprised. At her salon, comparable products are premium priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for past 2 weeks. My main issue was milia and white heads caused by clogged pores. Since, I have been using this, I have not had any milia. This makes my skin smooth and clean. This jar will last me forever.</li>

            <li> I used this Mask the day after I received it and it is amazing! my skin felt so soft and cleansed, I recommend it to anyone who wants to clear face.</li>
            <li> was very skeptical about a mud mask but so glad i got this one! i expected a stinky cream but it actually has a nice scent. I applied and even layer not too thick yet not thin either. left it on for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The mask didnt crack or dry.&lt;br /&gt;When I put on the mask i could feel a little tingling sensation. It felt nice made me feel like the mask was doing its job!&lt;br /&gt;I cant wait to use it again in a couple of days&lt;br /&gt;My face already feels smoother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW</li>

            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner and was as advertized.</li>
            <li> Got this yesterday and used it last night. I am a skincare junkie but this was nothing miraculous but a nice mud mask. The product size is impressive as it&#x27;s much bigger then my glam glow masks I am used to. Will use more and post an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this free for a review.</li>
            <li> I used a coupon to purchase this and another Majestic Pure item, check the Special Offers and Product Promotions section for available codes/discounts.&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice smooth mask.  It smells good and it is creamy/thick.  I absolutely love a good mud mask and this is one of those but I was never a fan of the way these dry so I always use them them one of two ways.  I either use mud masks before showering, I use a warm wet washcloth on my face for a couple of minutes then apply the mask, but not very thick.  I let it sit for a bit and then wash it off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I also have used these after a shower, apply it and leave it on for 10-15 minutes but I don&#x27;t let it harden, I&#x27;m not fond of that feeling, so I spritz it with water so it stays soft, and is easier to remove.&lt;br /&gt;This mask works well either way and I have seen no adverse reactions, redness or had any other problems.  My skin tends to lead towards dry in areas other than the T-zone, its not particularly sensitive.  I do have enlarged pores and blackheads issue and I use mud masks to help deep clean my pores.</li>
            <li> This is a review of Majestic Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve heard a lot about putting mud on my face over the years.  You hear that the rich does it at the spa.  That I would do it myself?  NO!  That was not in my plans but I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I was still hesitant when I opened the package and it looked like a dark mud to me.  My kids laughed at me when I was putting it on.  Even asked me if I would try seaweed next.  But that didn’t stop me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smelled good and while it was on, I swear my face was tingling.  I was worried about a reaction since I have sensitive skin but that didn’t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I washed it off, my face was shiny from a glow my kids told me.  It felt so fresh and clean.  It felt like my face had tightened as well which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is rather large so I think I could get a lot of applications out of it.  I did it and I didn’t pay an arm and leg like I expected but I felt wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that wants to bring home the luxurious spa for less than a salon but more relaxation because you are saving money too.  Win Win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product in exchanged for an unbiased and truthful review.  This is 100% my thoughts.</li>
