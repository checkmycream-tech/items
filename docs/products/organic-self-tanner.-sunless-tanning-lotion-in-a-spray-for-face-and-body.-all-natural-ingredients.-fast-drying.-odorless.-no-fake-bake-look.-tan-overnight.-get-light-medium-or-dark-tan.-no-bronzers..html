    <ol>
            <li>I am impressed with the results</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying customer service is AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li>I received an email from the company after purchasing, &amp;#34;Best Organic Flawless Self Tanner&amp;#34; explaining everything about the product in detail and reminding me of my 30 day guarantee.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Bio Tech Naturals for making an awesome tanner!</li>
            <li>Best I ever tried.</li>
            <li>I would still repurchase, this is the best I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>and I found that after two applications I had reached the perfect shade which is probably the darkest I&#x27;ve ever been.  </li>
            <li>Best sunless tanner that I have tried, and belive me</li>
            <li>I apply it twice one day a week and the beautiful tan that develops lasts all week.</li>
            <li>Bio-Tech Naturals is also good about giving you pointers on how to use the spray to get the best results and sent a coupon to buy additional products at a discount.</li>
            <li>The color is great and lasted almost a week.</li>
            <li>and I also feel great for not putting any harm substances on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is great for looking tan without having the harmful rays and time it takes to lay out.  </li>
            <li>Great buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The color is very nice.</li>
            <li>What an amazing product!</li>
            <li>I guess self tanners are made more for very fair skin</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned</li>
            <li>It went on like water, was very light, and the smell wasn&#x27;t anything great</li>
            <li>okay smell and a great look on skin.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and my face gets a warm redness to it after application, which does go away after about an hour.  </li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>No smell, no stained clothing, very easy to apply, dries in seconds.</li>
            <li>Love how healthy it is for skin though!</li>
            <li>I love to use it on my face because it gives a nice sun lit look to my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great idea and will probably be great for others as every body type is different.</li>
            <li>I was impressed that I wasn&#x27;t sticky and drying time was pretty quick.</li>
            <li>have found the application fairly easy to do on my own.  </li>
            <li>I was really impressed by the super fast shipping and the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>Love the spray application as opposed to lotion.</li>
            <li>Customer Service from this company was also outstanding.</li>
            <li>Waking up today, I look a lot better.</li>
            <li>Glad its organic.</li>
            <li>Product works reasonably well, has great ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the mister instead of an aerosol</li>
            <li>I love that it;s organic</li>
            <li>Be sure to do all the prep work.  </li>
            <li>I love to be tan</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a better color as it&#x27;s fading so in the futur</li>
            <li>We put way too many chemicals on our bodies that enter our blood stream and cause diseases.  </li>
            <li>I really love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have that suntan lotion smell.  </li>
            <li>Excellent results in same day!!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite self tanning product, I am on my fifth bottle now, it&#x27;s is practically an addiction.</li>
            <li>I love that I can spray it on and go out almost immediately because it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy looking.</li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good things about this product!!</li>
            <li>I did what another customer suggested and spray it on, then rub my lotion on top.</li>
            <li>The fact that all the ingredients are natural makes it even more amazing!</li>
            <li>The only good thing is it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes because it can&#x27;t stain anything!</li>
            <li>easy to use...</li>
            <li>I get very light color after using this 3 days in a row but the color is nice and realistic, not orange.  </li>
            <li>This also dries very fast and the best part is it doesn&#x27;t break me out like all the other self tanners.  </li>
            <li>Super fine must almost needs no rubbing in at all.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Has a really nice smell and gives a very natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>I incorporated the advice of the other commenters, and this is a great product that worked well for my light skin.  </li>
            <li>I also never felt comfortable knowing that all the chemicals in sunless tanners were on my skin and absorbed by my body.</li>
            <li>It provided a nice natural tan look.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice natural color.  </li>
            <li>When I woke up the next morning, 24 hrs later, the color was excellent.  </li>
            <li>Either way I have developed a very nice natural tan.  </li>
            <li>Made a huge difference especially once my natural tan dissolved and helped me keep a great looking tan on face, arms,through November.</li>
            <li>As I said, however, I love using it on my face and neck and because it is a spray it doesn&#x27;t leave a sharp line it nicely blends into where you don&#x27;t spray.  </li>
            <li>and I jave found this is the most natural even looking area on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves shades, even if you follow the directions given, but overall  a good priduct for a fast tanning.</li>
            <li>just the right amount of caramel sun kissed.</li>
            <li>Not only is the product safe to use when you are pregnant</li>
            <li>This is the very first one that I&#x27;ve used that has absolutely zero odor.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have had other self tanners not show up very well on my medium skin tone.  </li>
            <li>This is the first organic self tanner I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pretty pleased with this product</li>
            <li>so the first application I did in the morning.  </li>
            <li>but it actually goes on pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>It also dries very quickly which is a definite plus.  </li>
            <li>At that point i began using 1-2 day and couldnt see much redults on face.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work, but it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but I really like this tanner.  </li>
            <li>Doing that worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>I was much darker.  </li>
            <li>That night I applied again but this time I did my whole body.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed it on one of my feet just to see if I can really see a difference.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely ZERO &amp;#34; sunless tanner smell&#x27; -  </li>
            <li>but this one is for real.</li>
            <li>It do not smell like most of those other tanners and it really makes you look tan.  </li>
            <li>I love that this doesn&#x27;t have the typical self tanner stink.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It goes fast, especially if you like to be really tan.</li>
            <li>It leaves me with a very natural tan and no streaking.</li>
            <li>I have extremely light skin so even a little color would show on me.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear and it didn&#x27;t stain my clothes, but I found that it didn&#x27;t provide an even tan because it rubbed off in spots, like my feet where my sandal straps were and on my thighs.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear and dries within about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have never tried a sunless tanner before except Jergens Natural Glow.</li>
            <li>It looks natural (not orange).  </li>
            <li>I have applied to my face 7-8 times so far (three to four days apart) and have had no problems with breakouts.  </li>
            <li>and I have sprayed directly to my face.  </li>
            <li>This spray matched my natural tan.  </li>
            <li>the only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because the first time I ordered this product the bottle was much larger...</li>
            <li>They email you to give you directions for proper use and even work hard to make sure you get the product really fast at no extra charge.  </li>
            <li>but I like having a glow to my skin even though I&#x27;m not super pale :).  </li>
            <li>As much dry time as clear water.</li>

            <li> but I like having a glow to my skin even though I&#x27;m not super pale :).  </li>
            <li> As much dry time as clear water.</li>
            <li> the back of both legs were not as tanned as the front, and my arms were spotted, so I wore capris and a long sleeve shirt that day.</li>
            <li> I used this every single day for over a week.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t get dark enough for my legs.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get on evenly, but I&#x27;m new to self tanners.</li>
            <li> and I went over my arms with the tanner only this time using a mitt I had from previous tanners, I did this with my legs, as well.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I never even expected it to work as well as it does; I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I wish this made me a little darker.  </li>
            <li> I followed directions to the letter and got absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> and I plan on trying other products from this line.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t tan naturally due to health reasons.  </li>
            <li> I followed the suggestions in the other reviews to put lotion on my knees, ankles, elbows and feet before.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product over any other self tanning product.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using this due to the redness this causes and the lack of effect.</li>
            <li> I have tried a bazillion different self tanners over the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad odor or strong.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous sunless tanners over the years and never liked them.  </li>
            <li> It is nothing but watered down herbs and spices and</li>
            <li> Gives a slight tan, not as dark as i want.</li>

            <li> Hard to get on evenly, but I&#x27;m new to self tanners. The color is great and lasted almost a week.</li>
            <li> the only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because the first time I ordered this product the bottle was much larger... when reordering it I received a WAY smaller bottle .. for same price .. completely disappointed. would never order again !! ScAM</li>
            <li> Was skeptical of this product initially as i purchased at the end of summer hoping to extend the appearance of my already very dark tan. At that point i began using 1-2 day and couldnt see much redults on face.  After contacting customer service they suggested i use 3 x day, which i did. Bingo! Made a huge difference especially once my natural tan dissolved and helped me keep a great looking tan on face, arms,through November. At that point I had reordered multiple times. Love the spray application as opposed to lotion. Customer Service from this company was also outstanding. Will continue to buy...as i firmly believe in going organic! Thanks.</li>
            <li> I used this every single day for over a week. I followed the directions. I even applied several times throughout the day and still nothing. I really wanted this to work, but it just didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> What an amazing product! The fact that all the ingredients are natural makes it even more amazing! I am impressed with the results and I also feel great for not putting any harm substances on my skin.</li>
            <li> Worst \\&quot;self tanner\\&quot; ever! I followed directions to the letter and got absolutely no results. On the small 4oz. bottle it does say, \\&quot;our sunless tanner doesn&#x27;t tan you, it helps your body tan itself... naturally\\&quot;.  What is that??? Then it&#x27;s NOT a self tanner!! It is nothing but watered down herbs and spices and horse s***!!  $25.95 for a 4oz. bottle of nothing. The only good thing is it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes because it can&#x27;t stain anything!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying customer service is AWESOME!!! I received an email from the company after purchasing, &amp;#34;Best Organic Flawless Self Tanner&amp;#34; explaining everything about the product in detail and reminding me of my 30 day guarantee. This is the first organic self tanner I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It went on like water, was very light, and the smell wasn&#x27;t anything great but you didn&#x27;t gag at the smell either. It&#x27;s an earthy smell. I was impressed that I wasn&#x27;t sticky and drying time was pretty quick. I had no transfer to my clothes, either. The color is very nice. However- I woke up the next day and I looked kind of insane. Understandably the following is my fault- the back of both legs were not as tanned as the front, and my arms were spotted, so I wore capris and a long sleeve shirt that day. That following night I scrubbed my spotty arms until it was faded and I went over my arms with the tanner only this time using a mitt I had from previous tanners, I did this with my legs, as well. Waking up today, I look a lot better. I am used to aerosol or lotions that have guides in them so the next time I use this tanner I will pay extra attention to what I am doing.  Overall, I am pretty pleased with this product and I will probably purchase again in the future. Thank you, Bio Tech Naturals for making an awesome tanner!</li>
            <li> Sorry, I had to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;1, It had a &amp;#34;sour&amp;#34; smell to me that did not &amp;#34;go away in a short time&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Too gold on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great idea and will probably be great for others as every body type is different.</li>
            <li> Gives a slight tan, not as dark as i want. Glad its organic. so i feel like im not putting toxins on myself which is a plus.</li>
            <li> This is great for looking tan without having the harmful rays and time it takes to lay out.  Great buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best I ever tried. No orange color....easy to use...okay smell and a great look on skin. Does not give you an unnatural looking tan. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed by the super fast shipping and the quality of the product.  I love that this doesn&#x27;t have the typical self tanner stink.  This also dries very fast and the best part is it doesn&#x27;t break me out like all the other self tanners.  The only thing is I wish this made me a little darker.  I get very light color after using this 3 days in a row but the color is nice and realistic, not orange.  To be fair, I have had other self tanners not show up very well on my medium skin tone.  I guess self tanners are made more for very fair skin but I like having a glow to my skin even though I&#x27;m not super pale :).  I would still repurchase, this is the best I&#x27;ve found and I plan on trying other products from this line.</li>
            <li> Product works reasonably well, has great ingredients.  The catch: it smells terrible! Bad enough that I had to put it on prior to going to bed and then wash my pillow cases afterward.  I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous sunless tanners over the years and never liked them.  The smell always bothered me.  I also never felt comfortable knowing that all the chemicals in sunless tanners were on my skin and absorbed by my body. Organic Sunless Tanner gave me a peace of mind because it contains organic ingredients and does not have a nasty smell. Truthfully, I never even expected it to work as well as it does; I am pleasantly surprised. I apply it twice one day a week and the beautiful tan that develops lasts all week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews but I really like this tanner.  Has a really nice smell and gives a very natural looking tan.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like the mister instead of an aerosol but it actually goes on pretty easily.  I love that it;s organic and I&#x27;m not putting a lot of chemicals or parabens on my body.  It also dries very quickly which is a definite plus.  I would recommend, as another reviewer wrote, to slather moisturizer on knees, elbows, ankles and the tops of your feet.  Doing that worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> Be sure to do all the prep work.  It does not have the &amp;#34;spray tan&amp;#34; odor.</li>
            <li> Not only is the product safe to use when you are pregnant - the customer service wth this product is above and beyond. They email you to give you directions for proper use and even work hard to make sure you get the product really fast at no extra charge.  I have olive skin and this tan color made me look just the right amount of caramel sun kissed.</li>
            <li> I incorporated the advice of the other commenters, and this is a great product that worked well for my light skin.  It doesn&#x27;t come out orange.  There is no animal testing, which is a must for me.  I&#x27;m ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to sunleess tanning.  I love to be tan but I can&#x27;t tan naturally due to health reasons.  I have never tried a sunless tanner before except Jergens Natural Glow. I read something about My Skin&#x27;s Friend and after reading reviews and the 100%&lt;br /&gt;satisfaction guaranteed policy, I decided to give it try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very nervous to try this because I was afraid of turning orange so I started out on just my legs.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it so the first application I did in the morning.  It goes on clear and it didn&#x27;t stain my clothes, but I found that it didn&#x27;t provide an even tan because it rubbed off in spots, like my feet where my sandal straps were and on my thighs.  When I woke up the next morning, 24 hrs later, the color was excellent.  I was much darker.  It provided a nice natural tan look.  My feet were a little splotchy, but otherwise it wasn&#x27;t bad.  That night I applied again but this time I did my whole body.  I did rub it in around my neck after spraying it on and I only did 2 coats instead of three and I jave found this is the most natural even looking area on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the application fairly easy to do on my own.  I am fair skinned and I found that after two applications I had reached the perfect shade which is probably the darkest I&#x27;ve ever been.  I followed the suggestions in the other reviews to put lotion on my knees, ankles, elbows and feet before.  My feet and ankles still looked a little orange.  I tried wiping some off with a tissue after as another suggested, which I think worked on my knees , elbows and wrists.  The next time I am going to cover my feet with bags.  It&#x27;s actually a better color as it&#x27;s fading so in the futur I&#x27;m going to do less coats per application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I does have a slight odor but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad odor or strong.  It smells a little like spices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this product and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> orange in color, spotty spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Leaves shades, even if you follow the directions given, but overall  a good priduct for a fast tanning.</li>
            <li> This product works!!!  It do not smell like most of those other tanners and it really makes you look tan.  I sprayed it on one of my feet just to see if I can really see a difference.  The next day I had one tan foot.  It looks natural (not orange).  I bought the product to use on my face and figured with it being organic may help reduce breakouts.  I have applied to my face 7-8 times so far (three to four days apart) and have had no problems with breakouts.  I have sprayed tanner on my palms of hands and applied to my face like a lotion and I have sprayed directly to my face.  Either way I have developed a very nice natural tan.  I am olive skin and tan well expect for my face and chest.  This spray matched my natural tan.  I would recommend this product over any other self tanning product.  Bio-Tech Naturals is also good about giving you pointers on how to use the spray to get the best results and sent a coupon to buy additional products at a discount.</li>
            <li> Streaky orange yikes!</li>
            <li> Absolutely ZERO &amp;#34; sunless tanner smell&#x27; -  and I have tried dozens that have the same claim - but this one is for real. Super fine must almost needs no rubbing in at all. No streaking. Feels like water. No greasy feel. As much dry time as clear water.</li>
            <li> I used the entire product as directed.  I have extremely light skin so even a little color would show on me.  Nothing even after finishing the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like pump bottle because it sprays unevenly out of the bottle. Wish it was aerosol. Love how healthy it is for skin though!</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it was organic.  We put way too many chemicals on our bodies that enter our blood stream and cause diseases.  I really love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have that suntan lotion smell.  It goes on as a liquid and not a cream.  I like that.  It has a nice natural color.  I love to use it on my face because it gives a nice sun lit look to my skin.  The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t get dark enough for my legs.  I have some unsightly veins and like my legs to be somewhat darker.  As I said, however, I love using it on my face and neck and because it is a spray it doesn&#x27;t leave a sharp line it nicely blends into where you don&#x27;t spray.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent results in same day!! Never expect it!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanning product, I am on my fifth bottle now, it&#x27;s is practically an addiction. No smell, no stained clothing, very easy to apply, dries in seconds. What else can I ask for? Well, maybe a bigger bottle...</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this after reading the reviews.  It takes several layers of application to make any difference and my face gets a warm redness to it after application, which does go away after about an hour.  I stopped using this due to the redness this causes and the lack of effect.</li>
            <li> Best sunless tanner that I have tried, and belive me, I have tried numerous ones.  No smell, no orange color, no streaks.  Only thing is the bottle is smaller than what I was expecting.  It goes fast, especially if you like to be really tan.</li>
            <li> I have tried a bazillion different self tanners over the past 20 years. This is the very first one that I&#x27;ve used that has absolutely zero odor. It goes on clear and dries within about 3 minutes. I have been spraying it on my face and chest area with no break outs. I love that I can spray it on and go out almost immediately because it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy looking. It leaves me with a very natural tan and no streaking. Cannot say enough good things about this product!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!! Will never buy another brand.</li>
            <li> Everyone has asked what I have been doing to look so tan! I have been sharing this with everyone! I love it! I did what another customer suggested and spray it on, then rub my lotion on top.</li>
