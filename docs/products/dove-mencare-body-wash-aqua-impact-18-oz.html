            <li>lol Thanks for the  great prices too AMAZON!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I did; the itch and dryness are gone.</li>
            <li>Because it of the syrupy consistency and the refusal to get nice and foamy, you need to squeeze out quite a bit to get a good amount of suds going for a wash.</li>
            <li>Love the Dove Men Body Washes!</li>
            <li>The results have been amazing.</li>

            <li>Refreshing, cooling, and smells good.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice smelling like a preppy SoCal guy again.  </li>
            <li>It had a nice smell and lathed well.</li>

            <li>and you will feel clean and smell great after the shower.</li>
            <li>Great item, Good price, Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and the lather-level is just right for me.  </li>
            <li>for those that don&#x27;t know, it has a very refreshing smell and leaves you feeling clean when finished.</li>
            <li>Does not require a large amount to produce a great lather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not terrible</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It appears that the geniuses at Unilever said, &amp;#34;Throw on way more of whatever makes this stuff manly-smelling!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the 6th most used ingredient in a list of 16.</li>
            <li>I put in many items on here for her and the kids.</li>
            <li>Noticed I started getting a bit more acne when I switched to this, though.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Who was I to rebel against the hetero-normative consumer paradise I had been raised to love?</li>
            <li>The boys love it and use it every day.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>What more could you want?  </li>
            <li>the smell is just ok.  </li>
            <li>so you have to use more of it.</li>
            <li>The soap is suppose to be more of a thicker substance but you can literally turn the bottle over and</li>
            <li>but it does a pretty good job as body wash.</li>
            <li>Smells great and manly and is easy on the skin and is decently foamy.</li>
            <li>This product smells good, lathers well and is easy on the body; what more could you really look for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am kind of getting exciting that I&#x27;m getting close to the end.&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought around 10 and is very satisfied with it, can&#x27;t complain too much at this price.</li>
            <li>Everything else is fine with it</li>
            <li>This product, for me, would be just fine during the non-Winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>The scent is masculine but pleasant and not overbearing.</li>
            <li>but poo water is a huge bonus out here.  </li>
            <li>However, the price is quite cheap than others.</li>
            <li>The scent on them is fantastic and gives you that manly odor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;ProTip: With free Amazon Prime Shipping, this product is about a dollar cheaper than at the store.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using Dove products.  </li>
            <li>I really, really enjoy this body wash.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if it became available with the subscribe and save option, I would consider purchasing the product here instead of at the &#x27;mart.  </li>
            <li>made for a great christmas present and stocking stuffer that morning.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes you feel great after a shower.  </li>
            <li>cant complain - came cheap with a coupon</li>
            <li>But when we started you know cuddling and stuff on the couch to watch movies, she&#x27;d frequently say how I smelled good</li>
            <li>It smells great as well and gives you an overall clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It just leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Taking a shower and using the body wash gives me a clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses this item and he loves it, I would recommend it to all men that like a clean manly smell</li>
            <li>The extra fresh scent is not too strong and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Right now as an &#x27;add-on&#x27; only item, it&#x27;s not that great of a bargain here on Amazon to have to wait for a $25 order just to even purchase this product.  </li>
            <li>I felt like a great weight had been lifted, that I was finally now starting to take control of my own life, but a hollowness still lingered.</li>
            <li>Not bad for this price.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh</li>
            <li>but I would not buy this again, mainly because I find the scent too overwhelming... almost to the point of giving me a headache.</li>
            <li>Excellent long lasting scent.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and lathers up nicely, not sure what more you could ask for in a body wash.  </li>
            <li>Nice body wash, it has little beads that make the scrubbing feel more powerful.</li>
            <li>Primarily because of its scent; but the fact of the matter is that it&#x27;s drys out my groin too much.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about using this product as my skin is sensitive to dyes and fragrances.</li>
            <li>The scent tends to last for a nice while during the day and</li>
            <li>It does the job well and also gives to me a fresh smell that I truly appreciate</li>
            <li>Soap smells nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use half the bottle to work up a good lather either.</li>
            <li>Very much considered a health need.</li>
            <li>The product I like very much.</li>
            <li>;-)&lt;br /&gt;Dove</li>
            <li>Just buy regular Dove products if you can handle the emasculating bottles and scents, they&#x27;re way better.</li>
            <li>Its subtlety refreshing prickle and soothingly generic scent</li>
            <li>I will not purchase online again as you can find similar prices in a store and have more confidence about the product you are purchasing</li>
            <li>He loved it and took the entire bottle with him when they left.  </li>
            <li>My son smelled so good after using it and the scent actually stayed for a long time.</li>
            <li>It really does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>hahahaha  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s supposed to moisturize while using it, but I wouldn&#x27;t put much stock into that.</li>
            <li>the cooling sensation is too much.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>You have to use a lot of it to use on your whole body, which makes the bottle drain faster.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all.</li>
            <li>I mean its a good body wash</li>
            <li>Lathers well smells great a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>body feels clean, smells great, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li>I tend to use this to wash my armpits and groin daily and full body scrub 3 times a week</li>
            <li>The aroma is really high quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommended by a stranger on amazon.</li>
            <li>It is a little more runny than I&#x27;d prefer.</li>
            <li>Before migrating over to Dove I was very fond of Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Dove Men and Care Body and Face Wash, Extra Fresh</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good enough for everyday use if you aren&#x27;t naturally oily.</li>
            <li>I had a relatively normal adolescence</li>
            <li>My wife took the children left me for a man with a whitened smile and an even whiter-picket fence.</li>
            <li>the entire liquid just falls right out.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ve tried a shower gel that helped prevent dry skin in the Winter time.  </li>
            <li>The little beads in the soap really go in and clean you up</li>
            <li>It was fun to go shopping on here and add allot of the things you can&#x27;t afford as a single parent to it.</li>
            <li>If you need a manly product, go buy some Nivea or Old Spice.</li>
            <li>and I personally seem to go through it a bit fast</li>
            <li>But luckily I am a professional body wash tester.</li>
            <li>From an early age I joined the clubs I thought he wanted me to join and played the sports he wished he could still play.</li>
            <li>&quot; I promptly quit my job and renounced my old lifestyle.</li>
            <li>Way to much perfume in this such that you feel like you have showered in cologne.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and leaves very little scent.</li>
            <li>I used to rely on cetaphil or some other face wash, this stuff just doesn&#x27;t clean THAT deep.</li>
            <li>After years of putting up with dry itchy skin I gave the Dove Men and Care Body and Face Wash, Extra Fresh a try.</li>
            <li>even the little kids were excited to open the goody box...</li>
            <li>My third bottle so far</li>
            <li>What with Old Spice&#x27;s recent, immensely-successful rebranding effort, Dove&#x27;s line of men&#x27;s care products comes across as an overcompensating, trying-way-too-hard effort at playing copycat.</li>
            <li>My father&#x27;s deafening silence greeted me at every family get-together and holiday and followed me back to my considerably downsized apartment, which I was sharing with Alex from Craigslist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dry skin is not a big issue for me personally, however I like very much that this product was designed specifically for me as a man.  </li>
            <li>For a long time now (as a man) I have used the normal Dove body wash (the white bottles).</li>
            <li>and it does not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Product had much lower viscosity that typical of what I buy in the store.</li>
            <li>This product makes you skin feel refreshed and clean with a natural conditioning that is hard to find in any other product on the market place.  </li>
            <li>, it smells nice, it doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry out or anything weird.  </li>

            <li> but poo water is a huge bonus out here.  </li>
            <li> However, the price is quite cheap than others.</li>
            <li> The scent on them is fantastic and gives you that manly odor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;ProTip: With free Amazon Prime Shipping, this product is about a dollar cheaper than at the store.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using Dove products.  </li>
            <li> I really, really enjoy this body wash.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if it became available with the subscribe and save option, I would consider purchasing the product here instead of at the &#x27;mart.  </li>
            <li> made for a great christmas present and stocking stuffer that morning.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes you feel great after a shower.  </li>
            <li> cant complain - came cheap with a coupon</li>
            <li> But when we started you know cuddling and stuff on the couch to watch movies, she&#x27;d frequently say how I smelled good</li>
            <li> It smells great as well and gives you an overall clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It just leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Taking a shower and using the body wash gives me a clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses this item and he loves it, I would recommend it to all men that like a clean manly smell</li>
            <li> The extra fresh scent is not too strong and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Right now as an &#x27;add-on&#x27; only item, it&#x27;s not that great of a bargain here on Amazon to have to wait for a $25 order just to even purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> I felt like a great weight had been lifted, that I was finally now starting to take control of my own life, but a hollowness still lingered.</li>
            <li> Not bad for this price.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh</li>
            <li> but I would not buy this again, mainly because I find the scent too overwhelming... almost to the point of giving me a headache.</li>
            <li> Excellent long lasting scent.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and lathers up nicely, not sure what more you could ask for in a body wash.  </li>
            <li> Nice body wash, it has little beads that make the scrubbing feel more powerful.</li>
            <li> Primarily because of its scent; but the fact of the matter is that it&#x27;s drys out my groin too much.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using this product as my skin is sensitive to dyes and fragrances.</li>
            <li> The scent tends to last for a nice while during the day and</li>
            <li> It does the job well and also gives to me a fresh smell that I truly appreciate</li>
            <li> Soap smells nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use half the bottle to work up a good lather either.</li>
            <li> Very much considered a health need.</li>
            <li> The product I like very much.</li>
            <li> ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Dove</li>
            <li> Just buy regular Dove products if you can handle the emasculating bottles and scents, they&#x27;re way better.</li>
            <li> Its subtlety refreshing prickle and soothingly generic scent</li>
            <li> I will not purchase online again as you can find similar prices in a store and have more confidence about the product you are purchasing</li>
            <li> He loved it and took the entire bottle with him when they left.  </li>
            <li> My son smelled so good after using it and the scent actually stayed for a long time.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> hahahaha  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s supposed to moisturize while using it, but I wouldn&#x27;t put much stock into that.</li>
            <li> the cooling sensation is too much.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> You have to use a lot of it to use on your whole body, which makes the bottle drain faster.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all.</li>
            <li> I mean its a good body wash</li>
            <li> Lathers well smells great a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> body feels clean, smells great, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I tend to use this to wash my armpits and groin daily and full body scrub 3 times a week</li>
            <li> The aroma is really high quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by a stranger on amazon.</li>
            <li> It is a little more runny than I&#x27;d prefer.</li>
            <li> Before migrating over to Dove I was very fond of Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Dove Men and Care Body and Face Wash, Extra Fresh</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good enough for everyday use if you aren&#x27;t naturally oily.</li>
            <li> I had a relatively normal adolescence</li>
            <li> My wife took the children left me for a man with a whitened smile and an even whiter-picket fence.</li>
            <li> the entire liquid just falls right out.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ve tried a shower gel that helped prevent dry skin in the Winter time.  </li>
            <li> The little beads in the soap really go in and clean you up</li>
            <li> It was fun to go shopping on here and add allot of the things you can&#x27;t afford as a single parent to it.</li>
            <li> If you need a manly product, go buy some Nivea or Old Spice.</li>
            <li> and I personally seem to go through it a bit fast</li>
            <li> But luckily I am a professional body wash tester.</li>
            <li> From an early age I joined the clubs I thought he wanted me to join and played the sports he wished he could still play.</li>
            <li> &quot; I promptly quit my job and renounced my old lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Way to much perfume in this such that you feel like you have showered in cologne.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and leaves very little scent.</li>
            <li> I used to rely on cetaphil or some other face wash, this stuff just doesn&#x27;t clean THAT deep.</li>
            <li> After years of putting up with dry itchy skin I gave the Dove Men and Care Body and Face Wash, Extra Fresh a try.</li>
            <li> even the little kids were excited to open the goody box...</li>
            <li> My third bottle so far</li>
            <li> What with Old Spice&#x27;s recent, immensely-successful rebranding effort, Dove&#x27;s line of men&#x27;s care products comes across as an overcompensating, trying-way-too-hard effort at playing copycat.</li>
            <li> My father&#x27;s deafening silence greeted me at every family get-together and holiday and followed me back to my considerably downsized apartment, which I was sharing with Alex from Craigslist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dry skin is not a big issue for me personally, however I like very much that this product was designed specifically for me as a man.  </li>
            <li> For a long time now (as a man) I have used the normal Dove body wash (the white bottles).</li>
            <li> and it does not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Product had much lower viscosity that typical of what I buy in the store.</li>
            <li> This product makes you skin feel refreshed and clean with a natural conditioning that is hard to find in any other product on the market place.  </li>
            <li> , it smells nice, it doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry out or anything weird.  </li>
            <li> After a shower, I&#x27;m still left with really dry skin, especially in the Winter time.  </li>
            <li> I just bought three of them and they were all runny and completely watered down.</li>
            <li> Dove went a little too far in trying to develop their line of products targeted at a male audience.</li>
            <li> Finally, it does not dry out my skin like the other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other body washes that have dried out my skin but Dove Body Wash has really helped with that.</li>
            <li> Also not too harsh on men with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Thats never happened before, and after my initial confusion, I was extremely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before I ordered this, I was using some other Dove body wash that came in a white bottle.</li>
            <li> Limited-to-no dry skin relief</li>
            <li> I bought a goody box of stuff for my daughter who is a single mom and this is one of the things in it.</li>
            <li> at least compared to Dove&#x27;s normal body wash.</li>
            <li> It does seem to help lock in more moisture in my skin than other body washes...especially in this cold weather.</li>
            <li> I got a girlfriend around the same time I started using this, not sure if related.</li>
            <li> Previously purchased at local retail store.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that soap scum feeling after using them and feel that they wash off clean with no residue left behind.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for men who suffer from dry skin due to any condition.  </li>
            <li> I never really believed in showering.</li>
            <li> No really, smelling like anything</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this product does not seem to help prevent dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with other body and face washs leaving a sticky residue on my skin and pores.</li>
            <li> The body wash arrived crammed in a box with two other items that I purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the cost compared to bar soap but the results justify the additional cost.</li>
            <li> will say though I do feel like it may be a bit watered down</li>
            <li> The product I received was watered down and not like the product you will get from the store.</li>
            <li> Not a clean feeling at all</li>
            <li> If you are reading this that means you are having trouble selecting a body wash and why in the world would you trust someone on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Who was I to try and reason with the psychological trauma residing behind my every motive?</li>
            <li> Its a waste of money just buy it from target.</li>
            <li> Not once, but twice have I purchased a three-pack and both times they turn out to be watered down products and not the thick, long-lasting one I can buy at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> brought forth images of a prepackaged life, a life my father so desperately wanted his children to live.</li>
            <li> But I still not totally satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s not easy to sell manly men on the idea of a product named &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Even the packaging, in its inoffensive grey and green, invited me to simply go with the flow and not worry about whether I had made the worst decision of my life.</li>
            <li> The smell is simply overpowering, lingering worse than those horrible body sprays.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if the product wasn&#x27;t so thick either.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even after having it all, the lawn, the Labrador, the trophy wife, the 2.5 kids, there was an unsettling emptiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two that I bought here were very thin and watery, nothing like the three pack that I bought from Costco.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m afraid the fragrance may irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Out of my 20 sex buddies, 19 of them went crazy smelling me all over my body.</li>
            <li> So convenient to order &amp; not have to go out during bad weather!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought it for my husband. He likes it and I like how it smells on him as well.</li>
            <li> Not bad for this price. But I still not totally satisfied with it. However, the price is quite cheap than others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile now. I am kind of getting exciting that I&#x27;m getting close to the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not terrible but I would not buy this again, mainly because I find the scent too overwhelming... almost to the point of giving me a headache.</li>
            <li> Soap smells nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin. I have very short hair so I use it on my head and face as well. No complaints.</li>
            <li> This is the body wash I use because the smell is great and It just leaves me feeling clean. I use dove products all the time.</li>
            <li> Product had much lower viscosity that typical of what I buy in the store. Everything else is fine with it</li>
            <li> Dove Men and Care Body and Face Wash, Extra Fresh&lt;br /&gt;cleans you as a good body wash. It has good smell also.</li>
            <li> I love it. Smells great, cleans well... and most important my girlfriend loves the scent! ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Dove products are the best.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to all!</li>
            <li> Lathers well smells great a little goes a long way. My third bottle so far</li>
            <li> Washing my face with this has helped my skin a lot.  The cooling feeling and the scent are great.</li>
            <li> Dove went a little too far in trying to develop their line of products targeted at a male audience. I mean, it&#x27;s not easy to sell manly men on the idea of a product named &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34;. It appears that the geniuses at Unilever said, &amp;#34;Throw on way more of whatever makes this stuff manly-smelling!&amp;#34;. What with Old Spice&#x27;s recent, immensely-successful rebranding effort, Dove&#x27;s line of men&#x27;s care products comes across as an overcompensating, trying-way-too-hard effort at playing copycat. The smell is simply overpowering, lingering worse than those horrible body sprays. It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if the product wasn&#x27;t so thick either. Because it of the syrupy consistency and the refusal to get nice and foamy, you need to squeeze out quite a bit to get a good amount of suds going for a wash. At that point, you feel like you&#x27;re showering inside of a douchebag&#x27;s sprayed-with-Axe-body-spray armpit. It isn&#x27;t pleasant. It&#x27;s just overpowering and fake-smelling. Just buy regular Dove products if you can handle the emasculating bottles and scents, they&#x27;re way better. If you need a manly product, go buy some Nivea or Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Great for men on the go who doesn&#x27;t want to be carrying around a body wash and a separate face soap. Also not too harsh on men with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The soup doesn&#x27;t leave a potent smell, but does smell good going on. It is a little more runny than I&#x27;d prefer.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using this product as my skin is sensitive to dyes and fragrances. After years of putting up with dry itchy skin I gave the Dove Men and Care Body and Face Wash, Extra Fresh a try. I&#x27;m very glad I did; the itch and dryness are gone. It is easy to use and leaves very little scent. The only negative is the cost compared to bar soap but the results justify the additional cost.</li>
            <li> I mean its a good body wash but it smells like you cane use this scent as a cologne. You may like it and i do too but i&#x27;m afraid the fragrance may irritate my skin. It&#x27;s the 6th most used ingredient in a list of 16.</li>
            <li> The two that I bought here were very thin and watery, nothing like the three pack that I bought from Costco.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy from Costco next time.</li>
            <li> For a long time now (as a man) I have used the normal Dove body wash (the white bottles). After switching to this I won&#x27;t ever switch back. The scent on them is fantastic and gives you that manly odor. The scent tends to last for a nice while during the day and its well just works as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though I do feel like it may be a bit watered down at least compared to Dove&#x27;s normal body wash. It&#x27;s got a jell like texture and I personally seem to go through it a bit fast but then again its only 13.5 ounces (so not that big).</li>
            <li> I never really believed in showering. I used to think that the smell of ass and sweat was what the ladies wanted. One night while praying, Jesus told me to try Dove Men Body wash. The results have been amazing. I no longer smell like poop, but instead I smell like the tears of an angel. Life is good.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Dove Men+ Care products, and this body wash does not disappoint. Does not require a large amount to produce a great lather. It does seem to help lock in more moisture in my skin than other body washes...especially in this cold weather. The extra fresh scent is not too strong and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I bought a goody box of stuff for my daughter who is a single mom and this is one of the things in it. You can&#x27;t complain about this product and the price was as good as Walmart too. It was fun to go shopping on here and add allot of the things you can&#x27;t afford as a single parent to it. She called me up and said MOM what surprise and thank you! I put in many items on here for her and the kids. She runs a child care and even the little kids were excited to open the goody box...lol Thanks for the  great prices too AMAZON!</li>
            <li> It does the job well and also gives to me a fresh smell that I truly appreciate and I fell that others do also..</li>
            <li> With subscriptions I ended up paying only $1.46 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells manly and got a feeling of face gel as well. This is definitely a product for men only because of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought around 10 and is very satisfied with it, can&#x27;t complain too much at this price.</li>
            <li> Good product, great price. I stock up, so never have to shop for them. My husband is happy with the product I am happy with price and convenience. Win win.</li>
            <li> The service came very quickly and it is a very good case.</li>
            <li> This body wash was used to wash my body and that it did.  If you are reading this that means you are having trouble selecting a body wash and why in the world would you trust someone on amazon.  But luckily I am a professional body wash tester.</li>
            <li> This product makes you skin feel refreshed and clean with a natural conditioning that is hard to find in any other product on the market place.  I recommend this product for men who suffer from dry skin due to any condition.  It really does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this wash. It smells great and a little goes a long way. The price seems competitive and 2 day shipping is great.</li>
            <li> I got a girlfriend around the same time I started using this, not sure if related. But when we started you know cuddling and stuff on the couch to watch movies, she&#x27;d frequently say how I smelled good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with other body and face washs leaving a sticky residue on my skin and pores. Not so with Dove products. Happy customer since 1999.</li>
            <li> Smell is awesome and lingers for a while after the shower, and the clean was pretty awesome. Noticed I started getting a bit more acne when I switched to this, though. I used to rely on cetaphil or some other face wash, this stuff just doesn&#x27;t clean THAT deep. But it&#x27;s good enough for everyday use if you aren&#x27;t naturally oily.</li>
            <li> Nice body wash, it has little beads that make the scrubbing feel more powerful. Plus, people actually complimented me for the smell. Thats never happened before, and after my initial confusion, I was extremely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ProTip: With free Amazon Prime Shipping, this product is about a dollar cheaper than at the store.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I still use this product but will no longer buy it on Amazon. Not once, but twice have I purchased a three-pack and both times they turn out to be watered down products and not the thick, long-lasting one I can buy at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses Dove products and I always thought they were for girls only. I used AXE products since they came out. My wife convinced me to try this body wash and I was sold and have only used this since that day. The aroma is really high quality and you don&#x27;t even need to use a cologne after washing. An amount about the size of a silver dollar will lather my entire body so I consider it a good value. Finally, it does not dry out my skin like the other products I&#x27;ve used. Great product!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using Dove products.  Taking a shower and using the body wash gives me a clean feeling.  Excellent long lasting scent.  Some people ask me if I&#x27;m using body spray, &amp; when I tell them I&#x27;m using a body wash, they are shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My body feels clean, smells great, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Smells great, good sized bottle</li>
            <li> body wash of champions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand and scent for years.  I love it.  Highly recommended by a stranger on amazon.</li>
            <li> like it, use this brand a lot these days , always a good product , hope to order more soon ,</li>
            <li> Smells great and manly and is easy on the skin and is decently foamy. I tend to use this to wash my armpits and groin daily and full body scrub 3 times a week and it does not dry out my skin at all. Before migrating over to Dove I was very fond of Old Spice. Primarily because of its scent; but the fact of the matter is that it&#x27;s drys out my groin too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled for my father&#x27;s approval. From an early age I joined the clubs I thought he wanted me to join and played the sports he wished he could still play. I had a relatively normal adolescence and I found myself in a white-collar job. I worked a job that was in a tax bracket that would make any immigrant parent proud. Immigrant parents who have had American dreams of white picket fences ever since the day I was born. Unfortunately, even after having it all, the lawn, the Labrador, the trophy wife, the 2.5 kids, there was an unsettling emptiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an episode of what my father would later call \\&quot;liberally-influenced madness\\&quot; I promptly quit my job and renounced my old lifestyle. My wife took the children left me for a man with a whitened smile and an even whiter-picket fence. I felt like a great weight had been lifted, that I was finally now starting to take control of my own life, but a hollowness still lingered. My father&#x27;s deafening silence greeted me at every family get-together and holiday and followed me back to my considerably downsized apartment, which I was sharing with Alex from Craigslist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aching from a wound I couldn&#x27;t quite identify, I scoured pop-masculinity websites, self-help books, and playboy magazine, looking for something, anything that could bridge the divide between father and son. That&#x27;s when I came across Dove Men+Care Body and Face Wash. Its subtlety refreshing prickle and soothingly generic scent brought forth images of a prepackaged life, a life my father so desperately wanted his children to live. Even the packaging, in its inoffensive grey and green, invited me to simply go with the flow and not worry about whether I had made the worst decision of my life. Who was I to rebel against the hetero-normative consumer paradise I had been raised to love? Who was I to try and reason with the psychological trauma residing behind my every motive? My father simply wanted me to be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the mornings where I stand in the shower, the scent of Dove Men+Care Body and Face Wash wafting around me, I am almost happy.ngs where I stand in the shower, the scent of Dove Men+Care Body and Face Wash wafting around me, I am almost happy.</li>
            <li> The body wash arrived crammed in a box with two other items that I purchased from Amazon. When I opened the box I realized that the body wash spilled all over the box and items inside. This is a great product, but Amazon is not the place to get it.</li>
            <li> Hubs loves this product!  Previously purchased at local retail store.  So convenient to order &amp; not have to go out during bad weather!</li>
            <li> I sat next to a beauty pageant winner while wearing this smell and she talked to me.</li>
            <li> I really, really enjoy this body wash.  Dry skin is not a big issue for me personally, however I like very much that this product was designed specifically for me as a man.  This product smells good, lathers well and is easy on the body; what more could you really look for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove&#x27;s men body wash products are the best out there in my experience. I don&#x27;t get that soap scum feeling after using them and feel that they wash off clean with no residue left behind.  Right now as an &#x27;add-on&#x27; only item, it&#x27;s not that great of a bargain here on Amazon to have to wait for a $25 order just to even purchase this product.  Perhaps if it became available with the subscribe and save option, I would consider purchasing the product here instead of at the &#x27;mart.  Regardless, the body was is perfect for men.</li>
            <li> The boys love it and use it every day.  made for a great christmas present and stocking stuffer that morning.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. Works great if you have oily skin like mine. You don&#x27;t have to use half the bottle to work up a good lather either.</li>
            <li> Refreshing, cooling, and smells good.  It definitely makes you feel great after a shower.  Girls like the smell a lot.</li>
            <li> After a day at work in Afghanistan it&#x27;s nice smelling like a preppy SoCal guy again.  hahahaha  No really, smelling like anything but poo water is a huge bonus out here.  :)</li>
            <li> This is one of the best body and face washes I&#x27;ve ever used.  Great scent and feels great on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove has the best products available.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, no residue and smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this bodywash from the store before so I knew what I was in for. It was great then and is great now. no complaints. for those that don&#x27;t know, it has a very refreshing smell and leaves you feeling clean when finished. it&#x27;s supposed to moisturize while using it, but I wouldn&#x27;t put much stock into that. still a great wash though.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling body wash.  My son smelled so good after using it and the scent actually stayed for a long time.</li>
            <li> What more could you want?  It cleans, it smells nice, it doesn&#x27;t make your skin dry out or anything weird.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and the lather-level is just right for me.  I like the container and the ease of use.  My only complaint is that this product does not seem to help prevent dry skin.  After a shower, I&#x27;m still left with really dry skin, especially in the Winter time.  To be fair, I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ve tried a shower gel that helped prevent dry skin in the Winter time.  I&#x27;ll keep searching and using lots of body lotion in the meantime.  This product, for me, would be just fine during the non-Winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Packaging, scent and lather&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Limited-to-no dry skin relief</li>
            <li> Before I ordered this, I was using some other Dove body wash that came in a white bottle. After switching to this, man did I feel the difference. The little beads in the soap really go in and clean you up and you will feel clean and smell great after the shower. Out of my 20 sex buddies, 19 of them went crazy smelling me all over my body.</li>
            <li> Way to much perfume in this such that you feel like you have showered in cologne. Not a clean feeling at all</li>
            <li> Very much considered a health need. Used by all the family. Please keep this product on the market and as a prime or subscribe option.</li>
            <li> you will use a bunch of it just to get a good lather.  the cooling sensation is too much.  the smell is just ok.  it&#x27;s also not moisturizing like it claims.</li>
            <li> It smells good and lathers up nicely, not sure what more you could ask for in a body wash.  I do not use this on my face, since I have face wash for that (and I prefer not to scrub my face with the same suds as I scrubbed my nether regions, just a personal preference).</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t produce a great lather.</li>
            <li> Very good smell. Clean and fresh</li>
            <li> The product I received was watered down and not like the product you will get from the store. I will not purchase online again as you can find similar prices in a store and have more confidence about the product you are purchasing</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to try washing my face with this but it does a pretty good job as body wash. It doesn&#x27;t lather very well so you have to use more of it. The scent is masculine but pleasant and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Bought this during the Christmas holidays in anticipation of my S-I-L and daughter&#x27;s visit.  He loved it and took the entire bottle with him when they left.  It had a nice smell and lathed well.</li>
            <li> Love the Dove Men Body Washes! I&#x27;ve used other body washes that have dried out my skin but Dove Body Wash has really helped with that. It smells great as well and gives you an overall clean feeling. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t possible to buy it in Japan. It was bought through transmission traders. The product I like very much.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Good shipping</li>
            <li> A product any man can appreciate.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this item and he loves it, I would recommend it to all men that like a clean manly smell</li>
            <li> cant complain - came cheap with a coupon</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells good&lt;br /&gt;- Works well and lathers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- You have to use a lot of it to use on your whole body, which makes the bottle drain faster.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this product, buy it from the store. I just bought three of them and they were all runny and completely watered down. The soap is suppose to be more of a thicker substance but you can literally turn the bottle over and the entire liquid just falls right out. Its a waste of money just buy it from target.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good, washes clean. Then why 3 stars? It doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all. Maybe if you&#x27;re hairless it could work, but I need a good lather.</li>
            <li> Great item, Good price, Fast shipping.</li>
