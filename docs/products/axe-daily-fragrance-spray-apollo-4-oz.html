            <li>I am so glad they are making Axe products for women too.  </li>

            <li>&gt; Grind more than your Axe</li>
            <li>/&gt;Old Spice Fiji body spray is still our fave, but this Axe is winning us over.</li>
            <li>Interesting smell but</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty good stuff</li>
            <li>Everything is fine.</li>
            <li>but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the body spray and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I got this from someone who got it and didn&#x27;t want it and had to restock because we liked the fragrance so much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light smell</li>
            <li>Its an Axe Body spray; Physically it works great, and I like the smell.</li>
            <li>Some Axe fragrances can be too powerful and overwhelming, but I do like this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Has a clean out of the shower fragrance to it, with a hint of perhaps citrus</li>
            <li>many complements about the new spray</li>
            <li>His new girlfriend sure seemed to be into it.</li>
            <li>I like&amp;#34; it very much Its like Cool</li>
            <li>I laugh when he and his friends are going out</li>
            <li>Use it right out of the shower</li>
            <li>It is hard to find this product on a consistent basis so using the Subscribe and Save service is great deal.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is not that heavy cologne smell but is nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>This has a pretty decent smell.</li>
            <li>The kid who used it for free, or the 2 older married guys who actually bought</li>
            <li>He is growing up so fast.</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;ll try this angle: I do not believe this stuff is the real thing.</li>
            <li>It all really depends on your tastes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and clean smelling, a little like freshly laundered clothes.</li>
            <li>We were shopping and wanted to check out this new scent by Axe.</li>
            <li>we come upon where he was standing, we see the can he was using was this new Axe body spray.</li>
            <li>But it actually was subtle and smelled good.</li>
            <li>Not like you can really go too wrong with Axe, I really like most of their fragrances and this one definitely got added on to my Axe go-to list!</li>
            <li>Well, thanks to the lingering cloud, we got a good whiff, and this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell half bad.</li>

            <li> Not lasting long time too</li>
            <li> This seems to last all day long, and everbody loves it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re expecting the Axe he doused himself with to waft by as he passes, and linger long after he&#x27;s gone.</li>

            <li> a different can than the one the kid just half emptied onto himself, and into the ozone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Smell Sharp</li>
            <li> Rather I like other flavors like dark temptation and twist.</li>
            <li> A cloud of fog envelopes his body as he sprays a generous amount from a little black can, circling his head, torso, and all the way down to his feet.</li>
            <li> He walks past, with a girl on his arm.</li>
            <li> There are very few axe fragrances that I can stand that dont give me a migrane, and the very few I do like usually get taken out of production.</li>
            <li> At least my wife and I think so.  </li>
            <li> I really did a crap shoot with this, since I&#x27;ve never smelled the Apollo fragrance before.</li>
            <li> , these are just getting silly. ;oD</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i got this for my brother and now he smells very nice im also in love with axe products they all smell nice</li>
            <li> My grandson loves this.  I laugh when he and his friends are going out and he spays some on.  He is growing up so fast.</li>
            <li> Smell great and it does last but the scent doesnt smell alot you can only smell it from close by would get the same or another scent</li>
            <li> Not up to the mark I can say. Rather I like other flavors like dark temptation and twist. Not lasting long time too</li>
            <li> Smells good. Just wish the fragrance would last longer but for the price I don&#x27;t mind. Will buy again. one more word required. LOL</li>
            <li> This is my favorite smell from Axe, as it is my boyfriends. This seems to last all day long, and everbody loves it.</li>
            <li> I liked it and will buy if needed. There are others that are also good as this fragrance. i&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great scent for the evening. Has a clean out of the shower fragrance to it, with a hint of perhaps citrus I&#x27;m guessing. I really did a crap shoot with this, since I&#x27;ve never smelled the Apollo fragrance before. Not like you can really go too wrong with Axe, I really like most of their fragrances and this one definitely got added on to my Axe go-to list!</li>
            <li> I am so glad they are making Axe products for women too.  I enjoy the body spray and will buy again.</li>
            <li> One of there best scent it is up there with the Anarchy which is there best seller&lt;br /&gt;get many complements about the new spray</li>
            <li> It is hard to find this product on a consistent basis so using the Subscribe and Save service is great deal.  The price is about the same and I don&#x27;t have to wander from store to store trying to find it.</li>
            <li> This has a pretty decent smell. i was impressed. I wished it was bigger and one could tell how much is left!</li>
            <li> As expected. Everything is fine.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday, guys love their axe. Lol.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review once but it was kicked back I suspect due to the use of key words, so I&#x27;ll try this angle: I do not believe this stuff is the real thing. Stay away from it.</li>
            <li> At least my wife and I think so.  I got this from someone who got it and didn&#x27;t want it and had to restock because we liked the fragrance so much.  I am actually using the shampoo and shower gel now too.</li>
            <li> We were shopping and wanted to check out this new scent by Axe. We turn our cart into the isle to see this kid dousing himself with body spray. A cloud of fog envelopes his body as he sprays a generous amount from a little black can, circling his head, torso, and all the way down to his feet. He even lifts each leg to encircle each one with a white scented cloud. He puts the can back on the shelf and struts away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we come upon where he was standing, we see the can he was using was this new Axe body spray. Well, thanks to the lingering cloud, we got a good whiff, and this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell half bad. It&#x27;s fresh and clean smelling, a little like freshly laundered clothes. It&#x27;s not overbearing, considering the amount that just got shot into the air. And it&#x27;s actually kinda pleasing, so we grab a can ...a different can than the one the kid just half emptied onto himself, and into the ozone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We keep shopping and soon cross paths with that kid again. He walks past, with a girl on his arm. We&#x27;re expecting the Axe he doused himself with to waft by as he passes, and linger long after he&#x27;s gone. But it actually was subtle and smelled good. His new girlfriend sure seemed to be into it. Meh...kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hubby and I trade a look. He grabs the Axe body spray from the cart and sprays me with it. And then himself. That kid ain&#x27;t the only one with a swag smelling hottie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, which one of us is the intended demographic? The kid who used it for free, or the 2 older married guys who actually bought it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s some potential slogans:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Axe ...Get Your Swag On&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Axe ...Smell Sharp&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Axe ...Smell the Edge&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Paying for it is just a pain in the Axe&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Grind more than your Axe&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Don&#x27;t Be an Axe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, these are just getting silly. ;oD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Spice Fiji body spray is still our fave, but this Axe is winning us over. If we keep liking it, we may get it again. Or maybe we&#x27;ll just use it in the isles of the store; we hear it&#x27;s all the rage!the isles of the store; we hear it&#x27;s all the rage!</li>
            <li> Smells Great! The Best of AXE</li>
            <li> Bought for husband.  Doesn&#x27;t like it.  Smells like teenagers trying to be adults.  Would not recommend product for anyone over age 30.</li>
            <li> Interesting smell but the ladies seem to like it. No its not a woo&#x27;er but it works just fine. I like that it is not that heavy cologne smell but is nice and fresh. Use it right out of the shower</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light smell I like&amp;#34; it very much Its like Cool You can feel all time . Just try it</li>
            <li> All my boyfriend uses is Axe products. I blame the commercials lol. But it&#x27;s pretty good stuff and I think it makes him smell good.</li>
            <li> Its an Axe Body spray; Physically it works great, and I like the smell. It all really depends on your tastes. There are very few axe fragrances that I can stand that dont give me a migrane, and the very few I do like usually get taken out of production. Some Axe fragrances can be too powerful and overwhelming, but I do like this fragrance.</li>
