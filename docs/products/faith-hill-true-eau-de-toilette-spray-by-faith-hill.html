            <li> My only complaint is that it does not last long.</li>
            <li> Many made me sick from the smell</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint though is it&#x27;s lasting power.  </li>
            <li> A Classy and Subtle Scent!</li>
            <li> The small lasts all day, but the bottle is small.</li>
            <li> I went back to the perfume dept to buy a bottle but was disappointed when I only seen that they had the tester bottle but no more in stock.</li>
            <li> too bad you cant return or exchange perfume on amazon.</li>
            <li> U will not be disappointed</li>

            <li> Great folks to deal with. They straightened everything out and handled all very well.Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and always have.  It is a very clean and light scent.  It definitely is not a statement perfume or strong scent.  It is way better priced on Amazon than at stores ex:Target, Walmart, Etc.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy cheesy celeb fragrances, but I love this, Its clean and pretty, very feminine. The small lasts all day, but the bottle is small.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this scent for a couple of years now. This is a really lovely, clean smell, and I put it on in the morning and at night my husband says he can still smell it a bit. You can make it as light or as strong as you like, I prefer it light, it is powdery fresh.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this scent, it&#x27;s a nice feminine smell.  My biggest complaint though is it&#x27;s lasting power.  After a couple of hours, it&#x27;s like I never put any perfume on.  If this lasted a little better, it would definitely become one of my go to scents!</li>
            <li> Such a simple smell but very pretty. My husband loves the way I smell when I wear this!! Would purchase this perfume again.</li>
            <li> i thought i got a good deal when i bought this but later found out there was a better price. too bad you cant return or exchange perfume on amazon. it seemed watered out. didnt smell as strong as the smaller one i have. oh well.</li>
            <li> I like light scents and this is it. The aroma lasts for quite a long time. If you like  light and clean smelling sprays, this is it. I will  continueto purchase this for as long as it is manufactured, and I do hope it stays around for a long time. I love this perfume!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is the place to purchase this perfume.</li>
            <li> So glad it was available!!  Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I have never been a big perfume wearer - do not like overpowering scents.  This is a mild, pleasant scent that I like to wear everyday.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent perfume. I was holiday shopping and needed to get a bottle of my perfume (Design) but the store didn&#x27;t have any in stock so I started checking out the testers that were available. Many made me sick from the smell but True by Faith Hill grew on me within minutes. I sprayed it on my wrist and it didn&#x27;t phase me at first, it wasn&#x27;t until i was walking around the store and kept smelling this pleasant scent. I found myself constantly smelling my wrist and knew I had to get that perfume. I went back to the perfume dept to buy a bottle but was disappointed when I only seen that they had the tester bottle but no more in stock. After I got home that night, I went online to amazon and bought a larger bottle for less than what I would have paid in the dept store. It&#x27;s a keeper and my new signature scent. Clean, crisp, pleasant scent that you love smelling all day, everyday and it works for any occasion! Love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> My current favorite. Rihanna&#x27;s was my fav. but now I love this one. love it. U will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> Just a fresh everyday fragrance . This is a great scent It is not at all offensive and can be worn everyday. I love it</li>
