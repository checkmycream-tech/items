            <li>This is the best stuff I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Do your product research and find out what works best for you!</li>
            <li>Good luck combatting that yucky cradle cap!</li>
            <li>...smells great though</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.</li>
            <li>and boy I&#x27;m so glad we did!</li>
            <li>i did however sit there combing my childs scalp for a while to make sure i was getting the most of it...</li>
            <li>When I used this product on my kids&#x27; hair, I also used a Dandruff shampoo for better results.</li>
            <li>We tried a couple other products but this one was the best.</li>
            <li>Rinsed out easily and didn&#x27;t leave his hair goopy/oily or irritate his scalp.</li>
            <li>but I can see how someone (parent or child) with sensitivities to strong smells may have an adverse reaction to it.</li>
            <li>Bought this, massaged it in during bath time and combed with a fine comb to get the flakes out.</li>
            <li>Very pleased so far!</li>
            <li>I did leave it on for quite a while and used a special rubber scalp scrubber</li>
            <li>My daughter put this on and rubbed it and brushed it in good, then washed it out</li>
            <li>I shampoo with a mild baby shampoo and it works.</li>
            <li>It usually takes about 3-4 washes to get rid of it, which is great, but it does smell quite strongly.</li>
            <li>After the first use I could tell a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>This stuff eliminated the cradle cap on my toddler the very first time and it hasn&#x27;t returned n</li>
            <li>Combined with a soft brush the cradle cap is noticeably better after using this.</li>
            <li>works very well and has more natural ingredients</li>
            <li>This is such a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>and it took off about all of it the first time.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased.</li>
            <li>We tried it several times thinking it would eventually get better but didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>but the stuff really soaked in and loosened everything so it could be lifted away.</li>
            <li>This did not help much</li>
            <li>but not much,when i shampoo flakes are still there no matter how much i scrub</li>
            <li>It would seem to look better right after his bath but be back again the next day.</li>
            <li>it was pretty new at the time</li>
            <li>Our son developed a mild case of cradle cap at around 3-4 months old.</li>
            <li>Nice feeling lotion just not sure it is the remedy for my situation.</li>
            <li>after i gave her a bath and was amazed by how much it was clear!</li>
            <li>We did end up using it a second time (2-3 days after the first use) and now it is completely gone.</li>
            <li>We did find that Baby Magic shampoo (the regular kind) really dried her hair and made the cradle cap worse.</li>
            <li>My 1 1/2 year old still has sporadic bouts of cradle cap.</li>
            <li>I am a 59 year old african-American who has had scalp sores and scaling ALL my life.</li>
            <li>this by far has done the trick.</li>
            <li>After one use my son&#x27;s cradle cap was completely gone.</li>
            <li>I have now 8 month old twins</li>
            <li>and I started using this product when they were 3 months old</li>
            <li>but their hair was so soft and easier to manage than before i started using the lotion.</li>
            <li>I used it for about 2 weeks and saw improvement, but it wasn&#x27;t completely gone.  </li>
            <li>old my granddaughter got cradle cap.</li>
            <li>My son is 3 months and we have tried every old wives miracle with no avail.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s almost 6 months old now.</li>
            <li>Both of our kids had pretty bad cradle cap after they were born for a good 3 months.</li>
            <li>but I am african american and so are my kids and this product works better than the afro baby hair care products that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>My toddler developed a moderate case of cradle cap at around two.</li>
            <li>I did this twice a week for about two weeks and at the beginning of the third week not only was the cradle cap completely gone</li>

            <li> Definitely give this a try if you&#x27;ve tried other things</li>

            <li> it just seemed to dry their hair and scalp out more and made the cradle cap even worst.</li>
            <li> and it dried out her skin pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know what is going to work on each child.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 month olds cradle cap and all it did was make it worse</li>
            <li> their cradle crap was pretty bad so the doctor prescribed a medicated dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> wrong.</li>
            <li> My daughter had HORRIBLE cradle cap.</li>

            <li> My 1 1/2 year old still has sporadic bouts of cradle cap. We use this whenever it starts building up. It usually takes about 3-4 washes to get rid of it, which is great, but it does smell quite strongly. I don&#x27;t mind but I can see how someone (parent or child) with sensitivities to strong smells may have an adverse reaction to it.</li>
            <li> My toddler developed a moderate case of cradle cap at around two. Bought this, massaged it in during bath time and combed with a fine comb to get the flakes out. I have only used it twice, a week apart and it has removed all of his cradle cap.  It has been two weeks with no reoccurrence yet.  Rinsed out easily and didn&#x27;t leave his hair goopy/oily or irritate his scalp. Very pleased so far!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 month olds cradle cap and all it did was make it worse and it dried out her skin pretty bad.  She would scratch at her head for so long and start whining.  I ended up tossing it and buying Mustela foaming shampoo, I noticed a dramatic difference after the first use.  Do NOT buy little remedies, buy the MUSTELA.</li>
            <li> i bought this product and used it as soon as i could. i thought it would take mulitple uses to get the desired effect ...wrong. it took one use... i did however sit there combing my childs scalp for a while to make sure i was getting the most of it... after i gave her a bath and was amazed by how much it was clear! there is hardly any left. I RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE!</li>
            <li> My daughter had HORRIBLE cradle cap. We tried several different home remedies, scrubbing it with a brush, using baby oil, etc. but nothing was working. We figured we&#x27;d give this a try and boy I&#x27;m so glad we did! After the first use I could tell a HUGE difference. We did end up using it a second time (2-3 days after the first use) and now it is completely gone. This is such a fantastic product! Definitely give this a try if you&#x27;ve tried other things and they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> works very well and has more natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Does not work. Used for 1 week. Switch to Vaseline and cleared up cradle cap in 2 days. Hydrocortisone also worked.</li>
            <li> I am a 59 year old african-American who has had scalp sores and scaling ALL my life. I was walking through Walgreen&#x27;s and I saw Litle Remedies Cradle cap lotion.  I began using it and the scales came off without probles.  I leave the lotion on and cover my head with a shower cap then  I do my housework or sit in the sun for 15 or so mintues. I shampoo with a mild baby shampoo and it works. YEA!!! Vivian</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I have ever used. I think I have tried every product out there and this by far has done the trick. My little one is two and still gets flair ups. A couple applications and this knocks it out. A must have!</li>
            <li> I have tried another remedy that was 3 times more expensive and didn&#x27;t work at all after several attempts This stuff eliminated the cradle cap on my toddler the very first time and it hasn&#x27;t returned n a couple of months.  I did leave it on for quite a while and used a special rubber scalp scrubber so it did take a little bit of effort to lift everything away but the stuff really soaked in and loosened everything so it could be lifted away.</li>
            <li> Nice feeling lotion just not sure it is the remedy for my situation.</li>
            <li> After one use my son&#x27;s cradle cap was completely gone. Didn&#x27;t even need to use the rest of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Its unfortunate that this product hasnt worked out for some of the people who wrote reviews on it because this product has done more than what it was expected to do. When I used this product on my kids&#x27; hair, I also used a Dandruff shampoo for better results. I have now 8 month old twins and I started using this product when they were 3 months old their cradle crap was pretty bad so the doctor prescribed a medicated dandruff shampoo. This did not help much it just seemed to dry their hair and scalp out more and made the cradle cap even worst. So my husband was browsing around the store one day and saw this product and wanted to give it a try just to see if it would help...it was pretty new at the time and i never even heard of it before. Whenever they took a bath I would continue to wash their hair with the same medicated dandriff shampoo and once I dried their hair I would massage the cradle cap lotion in their hair and run a comb through it to loosen the up the cradle cap. I did this twice a week for about two weeks and at the beginning of the third week not only was the cradle cap completely gone but their hair was so soft and easier to manage than before i started using the lotion. I still use it on their hair everyday for daily hair moisturizer. I dont know why this product hasnt worked for others but I am african american and so are my kids and this product works better than the afro baby hair care products that I have used in the past. I would definitley recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It helped get some flakes up but not much,when i shampoo flakes are still there no matter how much i scrub...smells great though</li>
            <li> I found that this product works, but it takes longer than I expected.  My son had a very minor case of cradle cap but I wanted it gone.  I started with the lotion and it did leave his hair oily feeling.  I used it for about 2 weeks and saw improvement, but it wasn&#x27;t completely gone.  I ended up getting a shampoo which worked in 2 days, but my friend swears by this lotion which is why I gave it 4 stars.  It&#x27;s hard to know what is going to work on each child.</li>
            <li> definitely helped loosen and remove the scaly skin</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. At about 1mo. old my granddaughter got cradle cap. My daughter put this on and rubbed it and brushed it in good, then washed it out and it took off about all of it the first time. It made her hair so shiney and curly, didn&#x27;t think she could be any cuter than she already was. We did find that Baby Magic shampoo (the regular kind) really dried her hair and made the cradle cap worse.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer. I recommend applying to wet hair before removing the cradle cap. But it does nothing that grape seed oil  or olive or any  other oil.</li>
            <li> Both of our kids had pretty bad cradle cap after they were born for a good 3 months. We tried a couple other products but this one was the best. Combined with a soft brush the cradle cap is noticeably better after using this.</li>
            <li> This product works, but the results are short lived. We used it every other night before we shampoo. My son is 3 months and we have tried every old wives miracle with no avail. This is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t cause a yellow crust the next day. Overall I am pleased.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all for our little one. Our son developed a mild case of cradle cap at around 3-4 months old. We tried this product, left it in his hair and even used his brush to exfoliate the scales. We used J&amp;J baby shampoo afterwards. It would seem to look better right after his bath but be back again the next day. We tried it several times thinking it would eventually get better but didn&#x27;t. We even tried applying olive oil and petroleum jelly to his scales and brushing them out to no avail. The only thing that helped his cradle cap was Mustela Foam Shampoo. After 2-3 uses, the cradle cap was gone and it hasn&#x27;t come back. He&#x27;s almost 6 months old now. Do your product research and find out what works best for you! Good luck combatting that yucky cradle cap!</li>
