            <li>Great for sensitive teeth--and good taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you take the aluminum cover off all the way.  </li>
            <li>Love it :)</li>
            <li>so I am glad that Amazon still has it.</li>
            <li>Having always been prone to cavities and having most of my teeth covered with caps and crowns, my dentist recommended using this product nightly.  </li>
            <li>Ive been using it for many years now.</li>
            <li>Works great on sensitive teeth!!  </li>
            <li>Works great on sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>Five stars because the product is fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He is happy with it, uses daily and smiles a lot.</li>
            <li>it has a pleasant mint taste, so I guess I&#x27;ll go back to buying it at CVS.</li>
            <li>sweet.  </li>
            <li>When you have sensitive teeth, and the many products available for this problem don&#x27;t work, try this stuff.  </li>
            <li>As a senior still with all my teeth but with receding gums, I have used this once a week for many years and can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but I think you need to aware, so don&#x27;t do this on your way out the door, you might need more time to finish the treatment :) It may work for some other people, but did not help me, went to the trash can this morning....</li>
            <li>It comes in various flavors, and I&#x27;m happy enough with mint.</li>
            <li>when you first put it on, then pain, then numbs out.</li>
            <li>I have used this every day for more than ten years.</li>
            <li>At first the tooth feels very sensitive but with continued use, it really does work!</li>
            <li>A bit thin/watery, so it doesn&#x27;t stay on as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this for his gums he&#x27;s been using it for years and says it works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I originally opened just enough to let the gel out, and in a couple of days, they come out smeared with aluminum--yuck!</li>
            <li>Remember, first brush your teeth with a sensitive toothpaste then brush with the GEL-KEM, slosh around and spit.  </li>
            <li>Original use was suggested years ago by my dentist,  Can not really tell if it works but will continue to use it,</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product</li>
            <li>I also put it all ver my other teeth, so maybe get some cavity protection,but the only thing I felt was that my teeth were more &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get this without a prescription in the past, so I&#x27;m so glad they have this on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>A combination of a toothpaste for sensitive teeth (which isn&#x27;t enough by itself) plus a nightly application of Gel-Kam works very well for me.</li>
            <li>This is a toothpaste once prescribed by my dentist to help with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my dentist for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why Dentist&#x27;s don&#x27;t recommend this to all their patients, well actually I do know why, it&#x27;s because we wouldn&#x27;t go the dentist nearly as much as we do now.</li>
            <li>Definitely a product that everyone with sensitive teeth or gums should have in their bathroom.</li>
            <li>My sensitive area was between my back teeth, so I put some on my dental floss before flossing each morning.</li>
            <li>only negative is the fact that I used to buy these in a two-pack for only slightly more than this one costs.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are still sensitive to cold, but hopefully it&#x27;ll work after some more days!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to receiving fluoride treatments.  I&#x27;m very happy with it so far.  Definitely helps for sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I have receeding gums and I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  When sensitivity hits, I use it for about one week maybe two and my sensitivity disappears.  Remember, first brush your teeth with a sensitive toothpaste then brush with the GEL-KEM, slosh around and spit.  DON&#x27;T RINSE or Drink for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great with the teeth sensitivity.  At first the tooth feels very sensitive but with continued use, it really does work!</li>
            <li> A bit thin/watery, so it doesn&#x27;t stay on as much as I&#x27;d like. But it has no bad taste, which I was afraid of. Teeth feel good.  Recommended by hygienist. Will see if she approves my results during next visit!  Make sure you take the aluminum cover off all the way.  I originally opened just enough to let the gel out, and in a couple of days, they come out smeared with aluminum--yuck!</li>
            <li> THIS GEL CAM IS VERY GOOD FOR YOUR TEETH..GREAT PRICE  GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> dentist recommended this and the package arrived in timely fashion</li>
            <li> The box displayed on Amazon is different than what I received - second time this happened. It was supposed to be mint flavored but the toothpaste does not have a mint flavor. In fact it has a very unusual, metallic taste and is not very pleasant.  When I buy the mint Gel-Kam at my local CVS  it has a pleasant mint taste, so I guess I&#x27;ll go back to buying it at CVS.</li>
            <li> Original use was suggested years ago by my dentist,  Can not really tell if it works but will continue to use it,</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for his gums he&#x27;s been using it for years and says it works very well. His Dennis recommended it to him and he is happy with</li>
            <li> Receive item on time and as described</li>
            <li> Five stars because the product is fine. This is a toothpaste once prescribed by my dentist to help with sensitive teeth. It does the job perfectly. It comes in various flavors, and I&#x27;m happy enough with mint. Not much else to say about toothpaste--use it and your teeth won&#x27;t be as sensitive.</li>
            <li> This did NOT work for me for sensitivity issues. I have just 2 teeth that are quite sensitive to cold at the root level where my gums receded a little and the dentin is exposed, and after using this for a month, morning and evening treatments, nothing has changed. Maybe even got worse. It feels very cold when you first put it on, then pain, then numbs out. It is numb for about half an hour, that is it.... I also put it all ver my other teeth, so maybe get some cavity protection,but the only thing I felt was that my teeth were more &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34;. It makes you drool a lot while keeping it in your mouth for the recommended 1 minute, so do this over the sink! Spit it out, do not swallow, it also made me keep spitting for another 10 minutes, due to the drooling - because you are not supposed to swallow any of this... I know, a bit TMI, but I think you need to aware, so don&#x27;t do this on your way out the door, you might need more time to finish the treatment :) It may work for some other people, but did not help me, went to the trash can this morning....</li>
            <li> I have a few teeth that are very sensitive to heat + sweet.  A combination of a toothpaste for sensitive teeth (which isn&#x27;t enough by itself) plus a nightly application of Gel-Kam works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it works or not because I&#x27;ve only started using it a few days ago. The taste is not too pleasant &amp; it makes you keep wanting to spit out the excess after since you aren&#x27;t supposed to rinse. My teeth are still sensitive to cold, but hopefully it&#x27;ll work after some more days! I do think it&#x27;ll help and after awhile, I&#x27;ve gotten used to the sour/sweet taste.</li>
            <li> Works great on sensitive teeth!!  Love it :)</li>
            <li> I recommend this to friends who have sensitivity or exposed roots...very effective.  I was having a lot of trouble with receding areas and this did the job.  I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for my sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding this product at the drugstores.  Couldn&#x27;t get this without a prescription in the past, so I&#x27;m so glad they have this on amazon.com.  Gel-Kam helps with my teeth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Definitely a product that everyone with sensitive teeth or gums should have in their bathroom. As a senior still with all my teeth but with receding gums, I have used this once a week for many years and can highly recommend it. I brush it all over my teeth and gums every Sunday night and let it sit for a minute before spitting out the residue. If I miss a week or two then I start to get twinges of sensitivity and I have to do the application a couple of nights in a row to get back to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to be getting harder to find so I am glad that Amazon still has it.</li>
            <li> When you have sensitive teeth, and the many products available for this problem don&#x27;t work, try this stuff.  My sensitive area was between my back teeth, so I put some on my dental floss before flossing each morning.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started using it about 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> Great service.  I can&#x27;t live without this product</li>
            <li> Works great on sensitive teeth.  You need to use it twice a day for a few days, but it works!</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it to prevent cavities for my little girl.</li>
            <li> Have used for years!!  Wish they still had the Cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product and it has proven to be a great product..  Ask your dentist if Gel-Kam would be beneficial for you.</li>
            <li> My husband chooses this on his dentists recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;He is happy with it, uses daily and smiles a lot. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Order arrived on time and product was as described.  Have to take fluoride treatments daily as prescribed by doctor due to radiation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Dentist&#x27;s don&#x27;t recommend this to all their patients, well actually I do know why, it&#x27;s because we wouldn&#x27;t go the dentist nearly as much as we do now. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 10 to 14 years now and have almost &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; cavities since I started using it. I brush with it twice a day and that&#x27;s it. Everybody should brush with this stuff.</li>
            <li> it helped with my sensitivity! Using every night, it taste as a mint toothpaste. I am pleast with this gel.....</li>
            <li> Having always been prone to cavities and having most of my teeth covered with caps and crowns, my dentist recommended using this product nightly.  After doing so for one year or so, I had no cavities for my annual check-up.  Since I am water picking my teeth every night, I thought that I could get by without this Gel; wrong!  On my next check-up, I had two cavities.  Not too bad, but they were under a cap and a bridge that had to be removed and replaced.  $3,000 for the repair.&lt;br /&gt;I am back using the Gel along with the water pick nightly without fail.  I will continue to do so until I die, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the fact that I used to buy these in a two-pack for only slightly more than this one costs.  On my last order, the two pack was not available.</li>
            <li> Not much to write. Its a great product. It works as promised. Ive been using it for many years now.</li>
            <li> Keeps cavities away as well as flossing and regular dentist visits. All part of a plan to keep my original teeth in great shape.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive teeth--and good taste in my mouth.  I have used this every day for more than ten years.</li>
    </ol>
