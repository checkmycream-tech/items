            <li>Perfect sized toiletry bag to hold my liquids when traveling through airport security.  </li>
            <li>What an awesome product!  </li>
            <li>bottles are perfect TSA sized 3 oz, and,</li>
            <li>(I opt for GoToobs instead - so wonderful!)</li>
            <li>The bag is wonderful and durable - I travel a lot and have lugged this thing all OVER for the couple of years I&#x27;ve had it, and it&#x27;s held up beautifully.</li>
            <li>Also - I like to fly with</li>
            <li>The bag is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the purchase</li>
            <li>Bought one six months ago and it is great.  </li>
            <li>Great quality.  </li>
            <li>It also makes a great gift for travelers.</li>
            <li>I purchaed this as a gift for someone who travels a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Good luck.    </li>
            <li>I have been using this item for over a year now for my weekly travels, and the bag still works as good as the day I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>Good zippers.</li>
            <li>The product arrived timely and in good condition.</li>
            <li>If your contents are fairly spill proof, I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li>So much better and roomier than a Ziploc bag!</li>
            <li>Super cute packaging, great quality, and even comes with ear plugs and an eye mask!  </li>
            <li>sub-100ml liquids into this, instead of the plastic baggies I had been using, is a nice permanent solution.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size to hold everything needed for the average length trip, and the quality of the build is great.</li>
            <li>Flybags are built to last, and are holding up great!  </li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the container the earplugs came in, although I have yet to use them.  </li>
            <li>It is sturdy and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This holds quite a bit -- I think it works better than a ziploc bag and holds a bit more.  </li>
            <li>I am totally pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought two more for family.</li>
            <li>What is it you put on zippers to make them work better?</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of these flight bags and this one is made better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+holds more than zip lock</li>
            <li>This sturdy bag has a pleated bottom for articles to stay upright, and works better for me.</li>
            <li>The first two held up so good that I bought another.</li>
            <li>I can see everything easily and it is more sturdy than a plastic baggie.</li>
            <li>You can also squeeze the bottle to get the contents out easily, which is helpful.</li>
            <li>Was easy to pull out of my bag and place in the bin for x-ray scanning.  </li>
            <li>They passed as they said through the tea screening and are much easy to pull in and out of your bag for screening</li>
            <li>These are good if you don&#x27;t have time to look, but if you do you will find as good as for less, or even better.  </li>
            <li>I used just one of the bottles included, and it has held up fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Quality is fine.</li>
            <li>The bag is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>No leather trim--definitely cheap vinyl.</li>
            <li>I can fit a lot of stuff in this bag and never have to worry about it tearing or accidentally opening like ziplocs do.  </li>
            <li>Getting the small things right makes traveling so much better, and this is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>I typically fill this with more items when I fly...</li>
            <li>Perfect for hard travelers.</li>
            <li>The stitching is quite solid and the plastic is good quality.  </li>
            <li>Things fit way better then a flat zip lock Baggie and this holds a lot more in it.  </li>
            <li>Well made bag and pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>Works great, but beware that it&#x27;s a tight fit without a lot of space for all of your toiletries, just essentials.  </li>
            <li>As other reviews indicate, the bag has held up great since the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it any more than the next guy, but this bag helped me get better organized.</li>
            <li>These bags are adequate but nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li>I fly an average of once a week for work.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased and glad I can reduce plastic bag waste.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the case, but I feel the contents are a complete waste.</li>
            <li>The bag is far more durable than a ziploc.</li>
            <li>This bag is far more durable.  </li>
            <li>But the bag is still worth the price even if the bottles didn&#x27;t come with it.  </li>
            <li>You can definitely fit more in than a regular quart zip lock bag because of the shape.</li>
            <li>Like some of the other reviews, the bag is great, everything else not so much.</li>
            <li>It holds all my liquids by lies pretty flat in my carryon, is TSA compliant and never gets a second look during security screening...but what REALLY got me hooked is the fact that the earplugs and eye shade are the very best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Bag has good strong seams, but the bottles are hard plastic, and will crack after a few good squeezes.  </li>
            <li>The zipper is very beefy</li>
            <li>though the zipper pull did break on the first trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hopefully, if enough people have this experience there will be a better edition.    </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough how much I love my Flybag.  </li>
            <li>Throw everything it comes with away, the bags are great and last long.  </li>
            <li>Okay if you only need bottles.</li>
            <li>It is not water-proof as many similar products are, which means if something leaks inside, it is going to be all over everything else in your luggage.</li>
            <li>The bag itself is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>but this is what I had in it from my most recent trip.</li>
            <li>I looked a lot for a TSA compliant bag that would hold the most possible.  </li>
            <li>That is ususally the first thing to break.  </li>
            <li>It seems bigger than a quart ziplock bag, so glad to read that others have taken it through security without a problem.  </li>
            <li>Simple, but outstanding in the details of the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay this higher price than buy a two dollar one and have it go to pieces while I&#x27;m trying to get on a plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and dry out, even if something in the bag leaks.  </li>
            <li>Since we can only fly with 100ml/3.4oz containers of liquids and gels, and they must all fit in a fairly small bag, you have to make some sacrifices.</li>
            <li>The containers and other extras are nice as well, but it&#x27;s all about the bag.</li>
            <li>due to the nice gusset that gives the bag depth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The FlyBag has pretty much saved my sanity.    </li>
            <li>After ordering these because I was on a tight timeline to departure and unsure when I would have time to go out and look, I ran into a drugstore and found exacty what I wanted for $5 with nice bottles.  </li>
            <li>This little bag effectively solved my problems with carry-on toiletries.</li>
            <li>This bag was promising, It fit my husband&#x27;s toiletries, however, the second time it zipped, the zipper pull shattered.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to put things in this that 1 qt plastic bags.</li>
            <li>I think the price I paid was too much for the bag quality.</li>
            <li>The plastic is very durable.</li>
            <li>This bag is very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>This bag was better quality than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li>It is made of durable materials and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my carry-on bag.</li>
            <li>I use it for my liquids every day to keep my purse organized, then it&#x27;s already ready to go when it&#x27;s time to travel.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy, especially the caps - which tend to get the most action during use.  </li>
            <li>(Four REI 3-oz bottles fit perfectly in the bag, with room to spare above them for 2 smaller REI 1-oz bottles, and still extra room on the sides for short flat containers or lotion, contact cases, etc.)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a bottom and top gusset that are over an inch wide, so bottles fit flat in the bottom of it</li>
            <li>The case itself is very nicely constructed with thick flexible clear vinyl/plastic.</li>
            <li>So I replaced the included plastic bottles with other, more pliable, bottles.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it&#x27;s better than ziplock bags.</li>
            <li>, so I tend to stuff this bag as full as I possibly can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I picked up some \\&quot;go gear\\&quot; tubes from Cool Gear International.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the main reasons I purchased this bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li>In particular, I don&#x27;t recommend &amp;#34;Plane to See&amp;#34; and the ones with a zip lock closure.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the little plastic bottles that come with it, but being able to stuff all my</li>
            <li>most importantly, DO NOT LEAK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The plastic is nice and thick.  </li>
            <li>bag itself has a solid zipper and it feels like it&#x27;s going to last quite a while and is much more useful and rugged than your typical ziplock that TSA provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As you can see, there is room for more small bottles/items.  </li>
            <li>and so I did return it, and I do not usually return things.</li>
            <li>I read the review about leakage, so filled them with water and placed upside down in the bag on my bathroom counter for a week.  </li>
            <li>The bag&#x27;s fine and another product that costs half as much will probably last 1 to 5 trips.  </li>
            <li>The zipper is metal, with large enough teeth that they do not bind nor pull apart.      </li>
            <li>Like Ziplocs the Flybag is clear; so, you can see what you&#x27;ve got where.</li>
            <li>I wish they would sell this without the sleep mask, ear plugs and clear plastic bottles and at a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The real metal zipper won&#x27;t inadvertently pry open spilling the bag&#x27;s high-altitude pressurized ingredients all over my carry-on.</li>
            <li>The FlyBag has fixed this.</li>
            <li>I naturally assume that this bag is *not* leak proof because of the zipper.  </li>
            <li>But with much tighter limits on what you can carry on on international and in foreign country flight, we thought the bags were worth it.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seal well, even under main cabin pressure but especially under cargo compartment pressure.  </li>
            <li>Would not recommend this as it is too small to fit anything.</li>
            <li>High quality on the zipper, especially, but also the general construction.  </li>
            <li>They were a hassle to fit my items into, were hard to seal, and disintegrated after about four trips.  </li>
            <li>It’s not great quality, but was better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They can be a little thick for this bag, but I can easily get whatever I need for a two week trip into the bag, assuming I&#x27;m willing to use hotel-supplied shampoo, soap, and mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Zipper doesn&#x27;t slide easily and takes up too much space, difficult to get into bottom of bag and scratches hands.</li>
            <li>The previous reviews stated a question about the quality of the bottles, but I was thinking at least this is a nice bag for travel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s held up to multiple trips so far - and as my husband frequently reminds me, I am not gentle with my items.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the zipper closure will not do for international travel - or so I&#x27;ve read.  </li>
            <li>Even recently purchased examples of my old favorites, the usually reliable TravelOn Smart Tube bottles, have been leaking (4 out 6 recently purchased did not pass the mouthwash test), so a travel bottle that stays shut and does not leak is nothing to snivel at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Already</li>

            <li> Since we can only fly with 100ml/3.4oz containers of liquids and gels, and they must all fit in a fairly small bag, you have to make some sacrifices.</li>
            <li> The containers and other extras are nice as well, but it&#x27;s all about the bag.</li>
            <li> due to the nice gusset that gives the bag depth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The FlyBag has pretty much saved my sanity.    </li>
            <li> After ordering these because I was on a tight timeline to departure and unsure when I would have time to go out and look, I ran into a drugstore and found exacty what I wanted for $5 with nice bottles.  </li>
            <li> This little bag effectively solved my problems with carry-on toiletries.</li>
            <li> This bag was promising, It fit my husband&#x27;s toiletries, however, the second time it zipped, the zipper pull shattered.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to put things in this that 1 qt plastic bags.</li>
            <li> I think the price I paid was too much for the bag quality.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very durable.</li>
            <li> This bag is very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> This bag was better quality than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> It is made of durable materials and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my carry-on bag.</li>
            <li> I use it for my liquids every day to keep my purse organized, then it&#x27;s already ready to go when it&#x27;s time to travel.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy, especially the caps - which tend to get the most action during use.  </li>
            <li> (Four REI 3-oz bottles fit perfectly in the bag, with room to spare above them for 2 smaller REI 1-oz bottles, and still extra room on the sides for short flat containers or lotion, contact cases, etc.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a bottom and top gusset that are over an inch wide, so bottles fit flat in the bottom of it</li>
            <li> The case itself is very nicely constructed with thick flexible clear vinyl/plastic.</li>
            <li> So I replaced the included plastic bottles with other, more pliable, bottles.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it&#x27;s better than ziplock bags.</li>
            <li> , so I tend to stuff this bag as full as I possibly can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I picked up some \\&quot;go gear\\&quot; tubes from Cool Gear International.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the main reasons I purchased this bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> In particular, I don&#x27;t recommend &amp;#34;Plane to See&amp;#34; and the ones with a zip lock closure.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the little plastic bottles that come with it, but being able to stuff all my</li>
            <li> most importantly, DO NOT LEAK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plastic is nice and thick.  </li>
            <li> bag itself has a solid zipper and it feels like it&#x27;s going to last quite a while and is much more useful and rugged than your typical ziplock that TSA provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As you can see, there is room for more small bottles/items.  </li>
            <li> and so I did return it, and I do not usually return things.</li>
            <li> I read the review about leakage, so filled them with water and placed upside down in the bag on my bathroom counter for a week.  </li>
            <li> The bag&#x27;s fine and another product that costs half as much will probably last 1 to 5 trips.  </li>
            <li> The zipper is metal, with large enough teeth that they do not bind nor pull apart.      </li>
            <li> Like Ziplocs the Flybag is clear; so, you can see what you&#x27;ve got where.</li>
            <li> I wish they would sell this without the sleep mask, ear plugs and clear plastic bottles and at a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The real metal zipper won&#x27;t inadvertently pry open spilling the bag&#x27;s high-altitude pressurized ingredients all over my carry-on.</li>
            <li> The FlyBag has fixed this.</li>
            <li> I naturally assume that this bag is *not* leak proof because of the zipper.  </li>
            <li> But with much tighter limits on what you can carry on on international and in foreign country flight, we thought the bags were worth it.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seal well, even under main cabin pressure but especially under cargo compartment pressure.  </li>
            <li> Would not recommend this as it is too small to fit anything.</li>
            <li> High quality on the zipper, especially, but also the general construction.  </li>
            <li> They were a hassle to fit my items into, were hard to seal, and disintegrated after about four trips.  </li>
            <li> It’s not great quality, but was better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They can be a little thick for this bag, but I can easily get whatever I need for a two week trip into the bag, assuming I&#x27;m willing to use hotel-supplied shampoo, soap, and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Zipper doesn&#x27;t slide easily and takes up too much space, difficult to get into bottom of bag and scratches hands.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews stated a question about the quality of the bottles, but I was thinking at least this is a nice bag for travel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s held up to multiple trips so far - and as my husband frequently reminds me, I am not gentle with my items.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the zipper closure will not do for international travel - or so I&#x27;ve read.  </li>
            <li> Even recently purchased examples of my old favorites, the usually reliable TravelOn Smart Tube bottles, have been leaking (4 out 6 recently purchased did not pass the mouthwash test), so a travel bottle that stays shut and does not leak is nothing to snivel at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Already</li>
            <li> The zipper is pretty stiff when new, but after a few uses it softens up a bit and works quite well.  </li>
            <li> I travel frequently and have used several other TSA compliant bags as zip-locs just can&#x27;t handle repeated use.  </li>
            <li> They are heavy, flexible clear vinyl.  </li>
            <li> Every product I have tried so far fell apart after 3-4 months of heavy use.  </li>
            <li> The one problem is that the bottles in the flybags are of low quality and the caps break off from the cap holder after minimal usage.</li>
            <li> I just put my liquids in here and keep my dry toiletries in a separate bag.</li>
            <li> I bought two because my past experience has been that travel bags fail pretty fast</li>
            <li> It came with some empty bottles to put shampoo, lotions, etc., an eye mask and some ear plugs.</li>
            <li> Going to Europe for 2 weeks in a few days and will report back on how well it worked for me.</li>
            <li> The caps literally disintegrated after minimal use.</li>
            <li> Has a big metal zipper that I don&#x27;t particularly like, as it is a little difficult to open and close.  </li>
            <li> The zipper is heavy duty, and has stood up to over two years of business trips (week long on average, traveling about every other week, opening and closing the bag daily).  </li>
            <li> I switched back to using a plain zip lock bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many plastic bags in the past few years and am tired of the waste.  </li>
            <li> Bag is too tight, not flexible enough and the bottles have such a narrow opening it is difficult to get much into them.  </li>
            <li> I have bought other TSA bags that just feel apart after a trip or two.</li>
            <li> But, what a let down.</li>
            <li> Previous to finding this product, I used zip-top bags that were meant for freezing food items.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s roomy and sturdy for every little thing I need to carry with me on my trips.  </li>
            <li> Considering its rugged durability, the eyepad for sleep, earplugs for noise, and the little bottles are a bonus.</li>
            <li> I have lots of little containers for stuff that doesn&#x27;t need a 2 or 3 oz.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Throw away the little bottles that come with it.</li>
            <li> The one minor gripe I have is that the bottles that ship with it are poor quality, as mentioned by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> big tough zipper with pull ring</li>
            <li> clear see through, thick, tough material</li>
            <li> Seems durable enough, but zipper has wide teeth--wide enough not to prevent a bad spill from going into your luggage.</li>
            <li> I got this bag because the Ziploc bag I have been using for my toiletries will get so tattered after using just a few times.  </li>
            <li> Made of heavy plastic.  </li>
            <li> Way too small.  </li>
            <li> Did not love this.</li>
            <li> (I was not interested in the bottles - yes they are poor quality, hence the loss of 1 star - so just expect to toss them):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also the bottles are very stiff so it is hard to squeeze them and get product out.  </li>
            <li> It hardly shows any wear.  </li>
            <li> The zipper is sturdy, but I find it a bit hard to get around the corners.  </li>
            <li> The lil bottles were to hard to get anything out of them.</li>
            <li> It is too small!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again in a heartbeat, and may buy another just for the no-leak bottles, which are really hard to find!  </li>
            <li> Some people have complained about the cheesy bottles leaking.  </li>
            <li> Whatever the plastic is in the Flybag, it doesn&#x27;t leave a smell and doesn&#x27;t get stiff or rubbery from being in cold or heat.</li>
            <li> You do not have to worry about my bottles or anything else inadvertently cutting through the tough plastic.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, the bottles and other items are terrible, though that is not why I bought this.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with the even the quality of even the bag</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> and I hate being without one.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this to replace one that had worn out after years of use.  This item could be much bigger and still be TSA compliant.  It is too small!</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and have used several other TSA compliant bags as zip-locs just can&#x27;t handle repeated use.  Every product I have tried so far fell apart after 3-4 months of heavy use.  Flybags are built to last, and are holding up great!  They are heavy, flexible clear vinyl.  They are stitched by machine wheras the competitors bags are welded plastic seams.  The zipper is metal, with large enough teeth that they do not bind nor pull apart.      I bought two because my past experience has been that travel bags fail pretty fast and I hate being without one.  This one is holding up so well that I gave the spare to my wife.    It might be the last bag you have to buy - unless you leave it in a bin at security.</li>
            <li> The bag is far more durable than a ziploc. You do not have to worry about my bottles or anything else inadvertently cutting through the tough plastic. The zipper is very beefy though the zipper pull did break on the first trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the bottles and other items are terrible, though that is not why I bought this. As the owner of the company indicated, they are there just an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For bottles, I recommend [[ASIN:B000KWBZPC 3-1-1 Totally Compliant Carry-on Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (4/2011):&lt;br /&gt;I have had some leaks from the above bottles using this bag, and am currently looking for alternatives.  The leading contender is one from Tom Bihn.&lt;br /&gt;Like this bag it is TSA compliant.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. It looks like it has all the elements. Organized, functional, and meeting TSA requirements. But, what a let down. The containers, as mentioned before, DON&#x27;T SEAL.    You just cannot, should not, have leaking items when traveling.    Sent it back, got my refund thank you.    Hopefully, if enough people have this experience there will be a better edition.    Good luck.    Until then, keep looking.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for over a year now for my weekly travels, and the bag still works as good as the day I purchased it.  It&#x27;s the perfect size to hold everything needed for the average length trip, and the quality of the build is great.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough how much I love my Flybag.  Getting the small things right makes traveling so much better, and this is perfect for me.  It holds all my liquids by lies pretty flat in my carryon, is TSA compliant and never gets a second look during security screening...but what REALLY got me hooked is the fact that the earplugs and eye shade are the very best I have ever used.  Ever.  The bag&#x27;s plastic and zipper feel durable.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> I got this bag because the Ziploc bag I have been using for my toiletries will get so tattered after using just a few times.  As other reviews indicate, the bag has held up great since the purchase.  It&#x27;s roomy and sturdy for every little thing I need to carry with me on my trips.  I used just one of the bottles included, and it has held up fine for me.  I put sun screen on to carry in my purse, and it has not spilled yet.  You can also squeeze the bottle to get the contents out easily, which is helpful.</li>
            <li> Throw everything it comes with away, the bags are great and last long.  Good zippers. TSA approved,</li>
            <li> This little bag effectively solved my problems with carry-on toiletries. Since we can only fly with 100ml/3.4oz containers of liquids and gels, and they must all fit in a fairly small bag, you have to make some sacrifices. I don&#x27;t like it any more than the next guy, but this bag helped me get better organized. I don&#x27;t use the little plastic bottles that come with it, but being able to stuff all my sub-100ml liquids into this, instead of the plastic baggies I had been using, is a nice permanent solution. It does what its supposed to, so 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The bag&#x27;s fine and another product that costs half as much will probably last 1 to 5 trips.  This bag is far more durable.  Don&#x27;t know why they even include all the detritus that&#x27;s inside.  It&#x27;s much easier to put things in this that 1 qt plastic bags.</li>
            <li> Like Ziplocs the Flybag is clear; so, you can see what you&#x27;ve got where. Unlike Ziplocs the Flybag&#x27;s rugged, rectangular design with sewn seams hold their shape. The real metal zipper won&#x27;t inadvertently pry open spilling the bag&#x27;s high-altitude pressurized ingredients all over my carry-on. Considering its rugged durability, the eyepad for sleep, earplugs for noise, and the little bottles are a bonus. Another plus: My wife is allergic to stuff like vinyl plastic zippers. She&#x27;s even happier than I am with the metal zipper. Whatever the plastic is in the Flybag, it doesn&#x27;t leave a smell and doesn&#x27;t get stiff or rubbery from being in cold or heat. They packed quality into this one.</li>
            <li> I fly an average of once a week for work.  The FlyBag has pretty much saved my sanity.    Previous to finding this product, I used zip-top bags that were meant for freezing food items.  They were a hassle to fit my items into, were hard to seal, and disintegrated after about four trips.  The FlyBag has fixed this. It&#x27;s got a bottom and top gusset that are over an inch wide, so bottles fit flat in the bottom of it and you don&#x27;t lose bag volume compared to a food bag.  The zipper is heavy duty, and has stood up to over two years of business trips (week long on average, traveling about every other week, opening and closing the bag daily).  It&#x27;s easy to clean and dry out, even if something in the bag leaks.  And it has never been challenged by TSA.  The one minor gripe I have is that the bottles that ship with it are poor quality, as mentioned by other reviewers.  They don&#x27;t seal well, even under main cabin pressure but especially under cargo compartment pressure.  I substituted 3 oz bottles from REI (that came with nozzle dispenser caps) at under $2 each, and have had no complaints.  (Four REI 3-oz bottles fit perfectly in the bag, with room to spare above them for 2 smaller REI 1-oz bottles, and still extra room on the sides for short flat containers or lotion, contact cases, etc.)  But the bag is still worth the price even if the bottles didn&#x27;t come with it.  I did use the earplugs until they got overly grimy, and still use the included keychain for pills etc on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This bag was promising, It fit my husband&#x27;s toiletries, however, the second time it zipped, the zipper pull shattered.  I do not recomend</li>
            <li> Okay if you only need bottles.</li>
            <li> Has a big metal zipper that I don&#x27;t particularly like, as it is a little difficult to open and close.  It is not water-proof as many similar products are, which means if something leaks inside, it is going to be all over everything else in your luggage.</li>
            <li> The bag itself is exactly what I was looking for.  (I was not interested in the bottles - yes they are poor quality, hence the loss of 1 star - so just expect to toss them):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) As for what comes in the bag, as mentioned above, the bottles are junk.  Toss them.  The earplugs I actually kept and threw in my purse.  I am pleased with the container the earplugs came in, although I have yet to use them.  I don’t use sleep masks, so I put it in our guest room amenity basket.  It’s not great quality, but was better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The bag has a zipper closure.  It is sturdy and I love it.  The zipper is pretty stiff when new, but after a few uses it softens up a bit and works quite well.  This is one of the main reasons I purchased this bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  The stitching is quite solid and the plastic is good quality.  It&#x27;s held up to multiple trips so far - and as my husband frequently reminds me, I am not gentle with my items.  It hardly shows any wear.  Also - I like to fly with carry-on only, so I tend to stuff this bag as full as I possibly can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I naturally assume that this bag is *not* leak proof because of the zipper.  Although I&#x27;ve never had any of my bottles leak (reminder that I *do not* use the bottles included w the bag) I always put my Flybag in a gallon Ziploc after security for extra protection when I fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5)  Apparently the zipper closure will not do for international travel - or so I&#x27;ve read.  I will likely take it with me on my next international trip, but will also bring the regular Ziploc bags with me as a back-up (like I always do) and check with their security when I arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture Note:  As you can see, there is room for more small bottles/items.  I typically fill this with more items when I fly... but this is what I had in it from my most recent trip.</li>
            <li> The bag is fantastic.  High quality on the zipper, especially, but also the general construction.  The plastic is nice and thick.  It will last a while.  Don&#x27;t count on using the bottles included in it, though.  Very flimsy, especially the caps - which tend to get the most action during use.  I picked up some \\&quot;go gear\\&quot; tubes from Cool Gear International.  They can be a little thick for this bag, but I can easily get whatever I need for a two week trip into the bag, assuming I&#x27;m willing to use hotel-supplied shampoo, soap, and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Zipper doesn&#x27;t slide easily and takes up too much space, difficult to get into bottom of bag and scratches hands.</li>
            <li> Bag has good strong seams, but the bottles are hard plastic, and will crack after a few good squeezes.  I think the price I paid was too much for the bag quality. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I looked a lot for a TSA compliant bag that would hold the most possible.  This holds quite a bit -- I think it works better than a ziploc bag and holds a bit more.  I think it was a lot of money however for it.</li>
            <li> The bag is great. Perfect for hard travelers. The containers and other extras are nice as well, but it&#x27;s all about the bag.</li>
            <li> I wish they would sell this without the sleep mask, ear plugs and clear plastic bottles and at a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag itself has a solid zipper and it feels like it&#x27;s going to last quite a while and is much more useful and rugged than your typical ziplock that TSA provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the purchase but I would have been even happier without the extras inside of it that I immediately took out and put in a drawer that I&#x27;ll probably forget about and end up throwing away some day during spring cleaning.</li>
            <li> Perfect sized toiletry bag to hold my liquids when traveling through airport security.  Was easy to pull out of my bag and place in the bin for x-ray scanning.  I like that I can see everything easily and it is more sturdy than a plastic baggie. It came with some empty bottles to put shampoo, lotions, etc., an eye mask and some ear plugs.</li>
            <li> Works great, but beware that it&#x27;s a tight fit without a lot of space for all of your toiletries, just essentials.  I just put my liquids in here and keep my dry toiletries in a separate bag.</li>
            <li> I now have three if these bags. The first two held up so good that I bought another. The zippers are terrific.  The plastic is very durable. I am totally pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> So I replaced the included plastic bottles with other, more pliable, bottles. The ones included in this case are just too resistent to squeezing for my satisfaction. The case itself is very nicely constructed with thick flexible clear vinyl/plastic. I am very happy with the case, but I feel the contents are a complete waste.</li>
            <li> Way too small.  My fault.  Quality is fine.</li>
            <li> Zipper broke on 1st trip</li>
            <li> Low quality, and the bottles don&#x27;t stay shut for any reason whatsoever, so prepare to open up a bag covered in lotion and soap.</li>
            <li> Bought one six months ago and it is great.  These are the largest bags that I have found that get through TSA.  The zipper has been holding up well also.  That is ususally the first thing to break.  I bought two more for family.</li>
            <li> The product arrived timely and in good condition. The one problem is that the bottles in the flybags are of low quality and the caps break off from the cap holder after minimal usage.</li>
            <li> This bag is very sturdy.  It seems bigger than a quart ziplock bag, so glad to read that others have taken it through security without a problem.  I can get TONS of stuff in here.  I have lots of little containers for stuff that doesn&#x27;t need a 2 or 3 oz. bottle.  By the way, the bottles included seem to be leak proof.  I read the review about leakage, so filled them with water and placed upside down in the bag on my bathroom counter for a week.  Nary a leak.  I hope they hold up well because my shampoo, condition, and liquid soap are now packed in them!  The zipper is sturdy, but I find it a bit hard to get around the corners.  Anyone else have this problem?  What is it you put on zippers to make them work better? Rub bar soap on them I think. I&#x27;d try it if I had bar soap.  Going to Europe for 2 weeks in a few days and will report back on how well it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Did not love this. The lil bottles were to hard to get anything out of them.</li>
            <li> Bag is too tight, not flexible enough and the bottles have such a narrow opening it is difficult to get much into them.  Also the bottles are very stiff so it is hard to squeeze them and get product out.  I threw it all away.</li>
            <li> This bag was better quality than I expected for the price.  Made of heavy plastic.  The seams appear to be well sewn.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  A simple way to organize for going through airport security.</li>
            <li> They passed as they said through the tea screening and are much easy to pull in and out of your bag for screening</li>
            <li> What an awesome product!  Super cute packaging, great quality, and even comes with ear plugs and an eye mask!  Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of these flight bags and this one is made better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried. In particular, I don&#x27;t recommend &amp;#34;Plane to See&amp;#34; and the ones with a zip lock closure. I haven&#x27;t used the bottles so can&#x27;t speak about their quality. The bag, though, has plenty of room and it relatively sturdy.</li>
            <li> Seems durable enough, but zipper has wide teeth--wide enough not to prevent a bad spill from going into your luggage. No leather trim--definitely cheap vinyl. On the other hand, it&#x27;s better than ziplock bags. If your contents are fairly spill proof, I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> For me, this is all about the bag and not the items that come with it.  It is made of durable materials and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in my carry-on bag. I can fit a lot of stuff in this bag and never have to worry about it tearing or accidentally opening like ziplocs do.  It also makes a great gift for travelers.</li>
            <li> Simple, but outstanding in the details of the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+holds more than zip lock due to the nice gusset that gives the bag depth.&lt;br /&gt;+crystal clear see through, thick, tough material&lt;br /&gt;+nice big tough zipper with pull ring&lt;br /&gt;+included bottles are perfect TSA sized 3 oz, and, most importantly, DO NOT LEAK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again in a heartbeat, and may buy another just for the no-leak bottles, which are really hard to find!  Even recently purchased examples of my old favorites, the usually reliable TravelOn Smart Tube bottles, have been leaking (4 out 6 recently purchased did not pass the mouthwash test), so a travel bottle that stays shut and does not leak is nothing to snivel at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Already been with me to Europe, China and Brazil successfully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have bought other TSA bags that just feel apart after a trip or two. I use these for travel and as a cosmetic bag daily. Sturdy zipper and construction can take the daily use. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many plastic bags in the past few years and am tired of the waste.  This sturdy bag has a pleated bottom for articles to stay upright, and works better for me.</li>
            <li> I purchaed this as a gift for someone who travels a great deal.  The previous reviews stated a question about the quality of the bottles, but I was thinking at least this is a nice bag for travel.  I was unhappy with the even the quality of even the bag and so I did return it, and I do not usually return things.</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviews, the bag is great, everything else not so much. But with much tighter limits on what you can carry on on international and in foreign country flight, we thought the bags were worth it. You can definitely fit more in than a regular quart zip lock bag because of the shape.</li>
            <li> I was traveling back and forth to Puerto Rico and needed a reusable bag for TSA. This bag has held up and there are no signs or rips of strain. I am very pleased and glad I can reduce plastic bag waste.</li>
            <li> So much better and roomier than a Ziploc bag! I use it for my liquids every day to keep my purse organized, then it&#x27;s already ready to go when it&#x27;s time to travel.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this as it is too small to fit anything. I switched back to using a plain zip lock bag.</li>
            <li> Well made bag and pretty strong.  Things fit way better then a flat zip lock Baggie and this holds a lot more in it.  Some people have complained about the cheesy bottles leaking.  I can&#x27;t comment on that because I didn&#x27;t use them.  I bought travelsize stuff that was already bottled.</li>
            <li> The bag is wonderful and durable - I travel a lot and have lugged this thing all OVER for the couple of years I&#x27;ve had it, and it&#x27;s held up beautifully. I&#x27;d rather pay this higher price than buy a two dollar one and have it go to pieces while I&#x27;m trying to get on a plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throw away the little bottles that come with it. The caps literally disintegrated after minimal use. (I opt for GoToobs instead - so wonderful!)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  These bags are adequate but nothing to write home about.  After ordering these because I was on a tight timeline to departure and unsure when I would have time to go out and look, I ran into a drugstore and found exacty what I wanted for $5 with nice bottles.  These were quite a bit pricier.  These are good if you don&#x27;t have time to look, but if you do you will find as good as for less, or even better.  I&#x27;ve retuned mine and kept the ones I found at the drugstore....</li>
