            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic foil-type electric shavers for years, and I am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Still, its a very good razor and worth buying the kit  every year for 3 year or so til battery wears out.</li>
            <li>I can get from a good razor which I still haven&#x27;t been able to get from an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d forgotten that it indeed provides a nice shave.</li>
            <li>This whole assembly is Excellent.</li>
            <li>Nice to have something work out</li>
            <li>The item was brand new and functioned perfectly.  </li>

            <li>The blades where very easy to install.</li>
            <li>Very easy to replace.</li>
            <li>I am delighted that replacement parts are still available for it.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, wasn&#x27;t as good as the original.</li>
            <li>As good as the original parts.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit and works like new!</li>
            <li>but I fugured out these would fit my older razor perfectly.</li>
            <li>My new blades worked good loved them</li>
            <li>I was no longer satisfied with the shave I was getting.</li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied with my choice.</li>
            <li>So glad to find replacement blades and shaving screen for my Panasonic Wet/Dry Razor.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been a Braun brand user most of my life and may return to it.</li>
            <li>Makes for a better and faster shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to find that Amazon carried this OEM replacement for my Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is the best shave yet...</li>
            <li>The comparison shave between the ES8243 and its great uncle the ES8043 is very close.</li>
            <li>Or more.)</li>
            <li>All of sudden $100 for a great shave and no blood - makes sense!</li>
            <li>so I was glad to find them on here.</li>
            <li>I would imagine they&#x27;re ok</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit messier, but my face always seemed to get more irritated with this electric razor.  </li>
            <li>actually enjoying shaving again now.</li>
            <li>Great quality product and my shaver works like new again!</li>
            <li>Great razor and even better when the blade and foil are new.  </li>
            <li>the original Panasonic blades lasted me 40-50 shaves !</li>
            <li>and I have a new great shave.  </li>
            <li>New blades works great.</li>
            <li>if you want a new shaver as well - then this ARC3 model at 10000 cycles is great value.</li>
            <li>More information on when to replace blades and how easy it is needed on shaver&#x27;s purchase inforation.</li>
            <li>They were also very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Wow, great investment.</li>
            <li>So there&#x27;s nothing special to say about them!</li>
            <li>Installed easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy return.</li>
            <li>The parts were easy to replace.</li>
            <li>The directions were easy to read and assisted in the installation.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>Easy to replace.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to install.  </li>
            <li>I get a nice close shave again just like when I first bought the razor.</li>
            <li>The shaver now works as good as new.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Fits fine in my shavor</li>
            <li>You can count on Panasonic for a fine product.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was fine.  </li>
            <li>Worked fine.</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than promised, no problems, works fine.</li>
            <li>The first shave said two things to me - 1) this is nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>They work fine.</li>
            <li>perfect fit, took seconds to replace old one and razor is like brand new.</li>
            <li>Took about 60 seconds to put it in, and made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>You will notice the huge difference in how well it shaves.</li>
            <li>Rather than pulling at the stubble on my face my razor glides through smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic may make a great radio, but the shavers remind me of American cars in the 1970s.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know which part helped the most (foil or blades), but this is well worth 35 dollars when you consider the cost of disposables.</li>
            <li>&quot; the foil and blades fit on the ES8077.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;ve had your razor for a year or more, definitely worth swapping them out.  </li>
            <li>someone had it on sale for $55 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Fit correctly, work well.  </li>
            <li>Got these for my honey and they fit his razor</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they popped right in to my shaver and replaced the older blades perfectly.</li>
            <li>The battery life, in particular, is amazing.  </li>
            <li>they work well and keep my shaver giving a clean cut pull free shave.</li>
            <li>I waited too long, but my Panny razor is good for a couple more years.</li>
            <li>As long as the battery is capable the Arc3 shavers are awesome.</li>
            <li>This set fitted my ES8043 perfectly and left it working like new.</li>
            <li>If you shave dry awesome - I do and it&#x27;s fast and works for me.</li>
            <li>but i have a feeling it does not work as well as the original.</li>
            <li>Does not cut as well as the original.</li>
            <li>The replacements blades work basically as well as the original blades.</li>
            <li>I also know that shaving with liquid is a unique option on these models.</li>
            <li>The Norelco required disassembly of the unit head, and removal of each cutter from its screen to clean.  </li>
            <li>and hopefully this time I&#x27;ll get a clean one.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace, this buy was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>the unit was clean and had no signs of use.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One pass, fast shaving, quieter, for the cheap price on Amazon, makes it more than worth the price just in what I&#x27;ll save in time.  </li>
            <li>These are true Panasonic parts</li>
            <li>True.</li>
            <li>I searched various stores and sites and could not find as good a price as Amazon.</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but these new blades are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It will now compete for FaceTime with the new Es8243 - clearly a descendent of a proud family.    </li>
            <li>If you have the 8043 or another fine Panasonic shaver that runs at 13000 cycles or higher</li>
            <li>I think that the company charges to much and since its a replacement and required item I guess they can charge what they want but a great item outside of that fact.</li>
            <li>The noise is different than the already noisy shaver, kind of a rattling sound.</li>
            <li>But the razor was in service for many, many years and one of the only electric razors my husband would use.</li>
            <li>Quickly shipped and as advertised.</li>
            <li>Until I put in the new blades, I forgot how good this worked when new.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than 1/3 the cost of a new razor.</li>
            <li>It comes with everything you need for an all new top end of the razor.  </li>
            <li>and also we get a better deal just buying a new one.  </li>
            <li>My shaver is just like new could not ask for better replacements</li>
            <li>My razor works like new now :-)</li>
            <li>panasonic wes9012pc men&#x27;s vortex combo was easy to install and was at a reasonable price under mfr.</li>
            <li>waste your money on a completely new shaver, just replace these parts and you will be happy!</li>
            <li>I do find Panasonic&#x27;s Linear razors to be the best on the market for my tough beard.</li>
            <li>so he really likes the smooth, non-irritable shave.  </li>
            <li>so I only shave about 2 or 3 times a week if we are not going out someplace nice.  </li>
            <li>I got to swap in the fresh foil and blade</li>
            <li>To be honest, I had no idea that the blades and outer foil were even replaceable on my Phillips ES8078.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 8 years of use, and one big drop onto the corner of the bathtub a couple of months ago,</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised at how much better your razor feels when you replace the blades.</li>
            <li>The quality is good, as in all Panasonic products; I just wish the price was reasonable and that&#x27;s why I only gave this item 3 Stars.</li>
            <li>Good performance with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>Nothing like fresh blades.</li>
            <li>Just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>No fault with this vendor, who did everything right.  </li>
            <li>Plus the price is right.  </li>
            <li>The part # is right</li>
            <li>The right part.</li>
            <li>The only thing that you can really say is that these are the real thing, I just put in my 4th set of replacement blades from here and they all work the same, flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I tried it out yesterday, worked fine, razor works and feels like new again.    </li>
            <li>Much more subdued buzz, barely noticeable compared to what it sounded like yesterday when I used</li>
            <li>New screen and blades do improve the efficiency and performance but it isn&#x27;t a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s fast, and for everyday use, a really great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much more comfortable shave when used wet as well.</li>
            <li>think 5 months is way too quick since I keep the head very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I have been happy with this shaver but the plastic parts are starting to show age and discoloration.</li>
            <li>My Panasonic 8043 is at least 5 years old and is still just awesome.</li>
            <li>After giving my razor a thorough cleaning, removing the old and replacing with new blades and screen was very easy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as well as keeping them clean between shavings.</li>
            <li>The difference with the 3 year old blades is just amazing, my shaving times cut to a half and they´re so much better.</li>
            <li>As with all things from Amazon...price, quality, packaging and delivery were all first class.</li>
            <li>Shop the web first for the price and then come here for the reliability.</li>
            <li>First chance</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s 92 and loves the fact he can use shave cream and hot water, then maybe finish off with his disposable.</li>
            <li>My first though upon seeing the disclaimer was that I hadn&#x27;t gotten the product that I ordered.</li>
            <li>Exactly as descibed.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>If it has been more than 6 months since your last blade replacement then get this now.  </li>
            <li>Exact replacement for my electric razor.</li>
            <li>Replacement items arrived earlier than estimated, undamaged, and fit perfectly...thanks!</li>
            <li>Why should this cost more than ten to fifteen dollars?</li>
            <li>cheap then it may be worth it to buy a new razor instead of new blades.  </li>
            <li>I am lucky if they stay sharp for more than 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The new blades are not sharp as the original ones and they don&#x27;t give you a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I pull out the old blades, clean and re-insert them and that makes the rattling noise go away.</li>
            <li>This shaver blows away Braun Norelco, and all others as far as a clean shave and a sturdy well built shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, with the new blades and foil the thing works exactly as it did when I first got it, hurrah!</li>
            <li>It was easy to replace the old parts with the new ones.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to get new parts for my shaver, in fact I was thinking of just buying a new shaver because I wasn&#x27;t getting as clean of a shave as when I first bought my electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Not quite as sharp as the original nano/titanium/whatever blades, but those do not seem to be available anymore.</li>
            <li>Certainly worth buying replacement blades rather than a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li>Snaps right on and works like the razor did when it was new.</li>
            <li>The unit is fine but totally overpriced.</li>
            <li>The foil is very durable and this wet or dry shaving experience is great.</li>
            <li>The old blades popped right out and the new ones right in.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t add much to what has already been said.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The cover on this one however is much thinner than any I&#x27;ve owned before.</li>
            <li>A much smoother and closer shave now.</li>
            <li>Quality replacement parts at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The Gillette razor gives me much closer shave at a fraction of the time.</li>
            <li>My Shick Hydro shaves faster, much closer, and with no irritation.</li>
            <li>I have much smoother shaves now.</li>
            <li>I really like the Panasonic shaver so after two years I got this replacement set.  </li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>These replacement blades work very well but need to be replaced every six months.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and went two to three years on one set of blades, you absolutely must do this, since you&#x27;ll rediscover the razor you purchased all that time ago.solutely must do this, since you&#x27;ll rediscover the razor you purchased all that time ago.</li>
            <li>The whole shaver and blades did not perform well at all.</li>
            <li>I replaced my son&#x27;s foil but really wanted to replace the set.</li>
            <li>and it work very well.</li>
            <li>It simply is not comparable to a Norelco, although the clean-up offers many advantages.  </li>
            <li>This particular (Vortex Combo) replacement foil and razor set has performed very well, despite that I don&#x27;t make a consistent effort to clean the shaver and might have knocked the foil against the sink a couple of times or turned on the razor before properly closing the foil contraption.</li>
            <li>These foil and blades do exactly what they should do when they&#x27;re new - cut</li>
            <li>However, take some clear aloe lotion and warm water and wet your face down every now and then for a refreshing shaving experience.    </li>
            <li>Brings back the original cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Evidently there&#x27;s \\&quot;still sharp\\&quot;, and there&#x27;s \\&quot;as sharp as they SHOULD be\\&quot;.  :)</li>
            <li>but it is different than the original</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic works like a new one, and it is in the top ten of electric shavers</li>
            <li>were 2 years old, and the new ones definitely work better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but think that they are overpriced and only able to sell at such prices because there isn&#x27;t much competition and because people are stuck buying them once they&#x27;ve found a shaver that works for them and needs the blades and foil replaced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like brand new!</li>
            <li>Now it cuts like new again!</li>
            <li>Put em in this morning; just like a new razor!</li>
            <li>My son loves his shaver so much that I ordered a new head.  </li>
            <li>Simple review..very easy to remove old parts and install new one.</li>
            <li>Some folks commented that these replacement parts cost more than half the price of the razor.</li>
            <li>Ordered these blades for an older model ES7109 electric razor.</li>
            <li>The price doesnt seem that high to me, acutally.  </li>
            <li>These are high quality made in Japan blades and foil.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you replace your foil and blades asap after one year or so of work.</li>
            <li>This being said, I can&#x27;t help but express my discontent at the high prices of these things.</li>
            <li>I started with a Remington - Moved to a high end</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit expensive at $40, but a great way to make that shaver just like new!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the cost to me over Mach 3 Turbo blades and an occasional cut or nick.</li>
            <li>I have never read a published book or, as in this case, complete work of a classical author that had as many orthographic and grammatical mistakes as had the above.</li>
            <li>, so the new blades only do so much for me, but these do their job exactly as is intended.</li>
            <li>A new shave could be bought for a few more dollars.</li>
            <li>You can simply pop off the top, brush it off and rinse it under water, towel it off, and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li>I should have gotten a new one sooner, it works much better than my old one and cuts time in half.</li>
            <li>These are Panasonic OEM parts so are expected to perform as original.  </li>
            <li>Was thinking of getting a new foil, but thought I would try this replacement set, and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the shaver is brand new.</li>
            <li>Removing and installing the new parts was a piece of cake.</li>
            <li>&amp; I thought I might as well buy a new razor till I looked at the price to replace mine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting new.  </li>
            <li>This shaving blade set made my razor work like new again.</li>
            <li>Make your razor work like brand new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We ended up buying a new travel shaver instead of replacing the blades.</li>
            <li>For this price you can almost buy a new Panasonic ES7103K ($49.47 on Amazon) shaver which includes this combo.</li>
            <li>The razor is like new -- smoother, closer shave, even quieter.  </li>
            <li>BUT, after I replaced the screen and blades, it was like getting my new shaver</li>
            <li>It removed the need to buy a new shaver and saved me quite a bit of money.  </li>
            <li>You can buy a new razor for the price of those replacement screens.</li>
            <li>My razor shaves like new.</li>
            <li>Razor shaves like new again.  </li>
            <li>The item was new in a blister.  </li>
            <li>made the razor like new.</li>
            <li>You have a choice, but a new razor at $60.00 or a replacement foil/blade set for $35.00.</li>
            <li>Why the replacement parts are almost as much as a new razor, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve done that about three times already - got a new razor instead of buying parts and this time, I decided to stick with my Panasonic Razor till the batteries die.</li>
            <li>It made it feel brand new again.  </li>
            <li>Made my razor new.</li>
            <li>Shaves like the way when i got the shaver brand new...</li>
            <li>Now the shaver cuts like when it was new.</li>
            <li>My concern about installing the new blades with my arthritis was unfounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Replacing the heads once a year is like getting a new razor.  </li>
            <li>but then I found this kit which practically makes the razor brand new.  </li>
            <li>For the price and the age of my unit, I could have purchased a new shaver.</li>
            <li>$35 may seem a bit steep for a replacement foil and blades, but installing these made my razor work like new again.  </li>
            <li>If you can get a new Panasonic wet/dry with the 13,000 rpm motor</li>
            <li>Replacing these is like making your razor seem brand new again.</li>
            <li>The end result is my electric razor now works like brand new.</li>
            <li>However, since you need the new blades, Amazon it the cheapest place I found to buy them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just one of those things you have to live with...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost like new again.</li>
            <li>It came and appeared new in all shape and manner</li>
            <li>2) immediately get new foil and blades for my ES8043.    </li>
            <li>But new Foils will be needed at some time.    </li>
            <li>It cuts like new again.  </li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to do, make your shaver feel like new on your face.</li>
            <li>just not like new, but does the job,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just not like new, but does the job</li>
            <li>/&gt;just not like new, but does the job</li>
            <li>And over the course of three or so years, it&#x27;s real easy to not notice the very slow change in performance over all that time.  </li>
            <li>Even after replacing the blades and micro screen, the Shaver&#x27;s effectiveness falls short of the original standard.      </li>
            <li>Next time I look for a razor, looking at the price of replacement parts first.  </li>
            <li>Usually we end up trying another brand because he isn&#x27;t satisfied</li>
            <li>I felt the same way 18 months into my first Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>When I am not lazy, I also use a Gillette Fusion ProGlide battery operated razor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the quality of the replacement blades are the same as what comes with the shaver when you first purchase them.</li>
            <li>I should of looked here first instead of last!</li>
            <li>So when my new razor arrived, I put the old one in the mail and started using the new one.</li>
            <li>The biggest improvement is that the shaver becomes fairly loud over time and the new screen and blades corrects this for awhile.  </li>
            <li>The blades are not anywhere near as sharp as the original set.  </li>
            <li>I got the razor a while back and the shaving was becoming rough.  </li>
            <li>The hair clipper does not work very well (and when using the clipper it makes a strange sound as if the gears etc. are slipping).</li>
            <li>Some have mentioned that a new shaver was only a little bit more than this package.</li>
            <li>Replacement blades do the job, pure and simple.</li>
            <li>Most of the newer Panasonic models can be had for $100 if you shop hard.</li>
            <li>New Foil and New Inner Blades &#x3D; new razor.</li>
            <li>It says nothing about this being a refurbished product, but it clearly is, unless it was tested or something?  </li>
            <li>WOW....</li>
            <li>I will probably order this product again when the old one needs replacing.</li>
            <li>I use them with Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver.</li>
            <li>Had no problems replacing the old parts with these.</li>
            <li>My razor is about 4 years old</li>
            <li>As far as the vendor who sold me the replacement blade goes, I can recommend this vendor.  </li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>One thing you should know is that when it cleans it makes fairly loud noise.</li>
            <li>The only real con that I can see here is that I had to deal with the plastic clamshell packaging.  </li>
            <li>I have a Panasonic ES8077 shaver that is over 4 years old.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had my razor nearly three years.  </li>
            <li>It improved the shaving quality for my young boys, even under their chins where they can&#x27;t see as well.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t felt my razor &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; my hairs, which was happening with the old blades</li>
            <li>And they cost less than a full tank of gas for your car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dull very quickly for the cost.  </li>
            <li>Just like when it was new - big difference.  </li>
            <li>But when you notice that you shave the same spot about three times and the hair still won&#x27;t come off, you probably need new blades.</li>
            <li>New blades and foil brought razor back to \\&quot;as new\\&quot; performance.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m probably gonna end up getting a new razor on the next go around just to catch one of those Amazon deals on bulk buys for a shaver and its accessories.</li>
            <li>I have a panasonic es8043 and it brought my razor back to brand new feeling again.  </li>
            <li>Why invest in a new razor unless you want a 2nd one.</li>
            <li>It was sold as NEW - Open Box.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have with them is, like so many others, the price.</li>
            <li>it did fully bring my 5 year old shaving action back to as-new performance and</li>
            <li>/&gt;They come out simply by pulling straight up on them, the new ones go in by simply pushing straight down.  </li>
            <li>Original replacement foil and cutting block made the shaver feel as new and came quickly.</li>
            <li>18 months later, I simply replaced the outer foil and blade set on the old one (now with new battery) and shipped the newer razor off for it&#x27;s battery replacement.</li>
            <li>High priced though - this one part cost about a third of what the entire shaver cost.</li>
            <li>thing I like about this razor, in general</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only is it fast again, since i&#x27;m not going over the same spots repeatedly, but it sounds totally different again too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying it again next year to keep my old shaver going.</li>
            <li>The panasonic naming game is almost as challenging to sort thru as their pricing [Some models list at $400].    </li>
            <li>Also, I picked the slow free shipping option, but I got it in 3 days because its very small and light I guess.</li>
            <li>Way overpriced I will say, however the blades will last much longer when used wet and with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I should have replaced the old ones long ago.    </li>
            <li>Generally will last only a year before they&#x27;re not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>, the design of the heads allow me to cleanly shave the thick and deep &amp;#34;folds&amp;#34; on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li>The old blade still gives me a decent shave, however, when it gets noisier than usual, I replace it.</li>
            <li>Sharp blades and an outer foil each Spring are just as critical as a new set of tires on a car with 40000 miles on the clock.  </li>
            <li>Each new blade is not as sharp as the last one.  </li>
            <li>The first set of blades I had lasted two years, easily which definitely ends up being less expensive than purchasing razor blades.</li>
            <li>Just installed these on my shaver, and holy cow, it is like new again.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one third to one half the price of a completely new razor!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great quality product and my shaver works like new again!</li>
            <li> Great razor and even better when the blade and foil are new.  </li>
            <li> the original Panasonic blades lasted me 40-50 shaves !</li>
            <li> and I have a new great shave.  </li>
            <li> New blades works great.</li>

            <li> Wow, great investment.</li>
            <li> So there&#x27;s nothing special to say about them!</li>
            <li> Installed easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy return.</li>
            <li> The parts were easy to replace.</li>
            <li> The directions were easy to read and assisted in the installation.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> Easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to install.  </li>
            <li> I get a nice close shave again just like when I first bought the razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver now works as good as new.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> Fits fine in my shavor</li>
            <li> You can count on Panasonic for a fine product.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was fine.  </li>
            <li> Worked fine.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than promised, no problems, works fine.</li>
            <li> The first shave said two things to me - 1) this is nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> They work fine.</li>
            <li> perfect fit, took seconds to replace old one and razor is like brand new.</li>
            <li> Took about 60 seconds to put it in, and made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> You will notice the huge difference in how well it shaves.</li>
            <li> Rather than pulling at the stubble on my face my razor glides through smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic may make a great radio, but the shavers remind me of American cars in the 1970s.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know which part helped the most (foil or blades), but this is well worth 35 dollars when you consider the cost of disposables.</li>
            <li> &quot; the foil and blades fit on the ES8077.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve had your razor for a year or more, definitely worth swapping them out.  </li>
            <li> someone had it on sale for $55 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Fit correctly, work well.  </li>
            <li> Got these for my honey and they fit his razor</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they popped right in to my shaver and replaced the older blades perfectly.</li>
            <li> The battery life, in particular, is amazing.  </li>
            <li> they work well and keep my shaver giving a clean cut pull free shave.</li>
            <li> I waited too long, but my Panny razor is good for a couple more years.</li>
            <li> As long as the battery is capable the Arc3 shavers are awesome.</li>
            <li> This set fitted my ES8043 perfectly and left it working like new.</li>
            <li> If you shave dry awesome - I do and it&#x27;s fast and works for me.</li>
            <li> but i have a feeling it does not work as well as the original.</li>
            <li> Does not cut as well as the original.</li>
            <li> The replacements blades work basically as well as the original blades.</li>
            <li> I also know that shaving with liquid is a unique option on these models.</li>
            <li> The Norelco required disassembly of the unit head, and removal of each cutter from its screen to clean.  </li>
            <li> and hopefully this time I&#x27;ll get a clean one.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace, this buy was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> the unit was clean and had no signs of use.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One pass, fast shaving, quieter, for the cheap price on Amazon, makes it more than worth the price just in what I&#x27;ll save in time.  </li>
            <li> These are true Panasonic parts</li>
            <li> True.</li>
            <li> I searched various stores and sites and could not find as good a price as Amazon.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but these new blades are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It will now compete for FaceTime with the new Es8243 - clearly a descendent of a proud family.    </li>
            <li> If you have the 8043 or another fine Panasonic shaver that runs at 13000 cycles or higher</li>
            <li> I think that the company charges to much and since its a replacement and required item I guess they can charge what they want but a great item outside of that fact.</li>
            <li> The noise is different than the already noisy shaver, kind of a rattling sound.</li>
            <li> But the razor was in service for many, many years and one of the only electric razors my husband would use.</li>
            <li> Quickly shipped and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Until I put in the new blades, I forgot how good this worked when new.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more than 1/3 the cost of a new razor.</li>
            <li> It comes with everything you need for an all new top end of the razor.  </li>
            <li> and also we get a better deal just buying a new one.  </li>
            <li> My shaver is just like new could not ask for better replacements</li>
            <li> My razor works like new now :-)</li>
            <li> panasonic wes9012pc men&#x27;s vortex combo was easy to install and was at a reasonable price under mfr.</li>
            <li> waste your money on a completely new shaver, just replace these parts and you will be happy!</li>
            <li> I do find Panasonic&#x27;s Linear razors to be the best on the market for my tough beard.</li>
            <li> so he really likes the smooth, non-irritable shave.  </li>
            <li> so I only shave about 2 or 3 times a week if we are not going out someplace nice.  </li>
            <li> I got to swap in the fresh foil and blade</li>
            <li> To be honest, I had no idea that the blades and outer foil were even replaceable on my Phillips ES8078.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 8 years of use, and one big drop onto the corner of the bathtub a couple of months ago,</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised at how much better your razor feels when you replace the blades.</li>
            <li> The quality is good, as in all Panasonic products; I just wish the price was reasonable and that&#x27;s why I only gave this item 3 Stars.</li>
            <li> Good performance with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> Nothing like fresh blades.</li>
            <li> Just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> No fault with this vendor, who did everything right.  </li>
            <li> Plus the price is right.  </li>
            <li> The part # is right</li>
            <li> The right part.</li>
            <li> The only thing that you can really say is that these are the real thing, I just put in my 4th set of replacement blades from here and they all work the same, flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I tried it out yesterday, worked fine, razor works and feels like new again.    </li>
            <li> Much more subdued buzz, barely noticeable compared to what it sounded like yesterday when I used</li>
            <li> New screen and blades do improve the efficiency and performance but it isn&#x27;t a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s fast, and for everyday use, a really great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much more comfortable shave when used wet as well.</li>
            <li> think 5 months is way too quick since I keep the head very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I have been happy with this shaver but the plastic parts are starting to show age and discoloration.</li>
            <li> My Panasonic 8043 is at least 5 years old and is still just awesome.</li>
            <li> After giving my razor a thorough cleaning, removing the old and replacing with new blades and screen was very easy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it as well as keeping them clean between shavings.</li>
            <li> The difference with the 3 year old blades is just amazing, my shaving times cut to a half and they´re so much better.</li>
            <li> As with all things from Amazon...price, quality, packaging and delivery were all first class.</li>
            <li> Shop the web first for the price and then come here for the reliability.</li>
            <li> First chance</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s 92 and loves the fact he can use shave cream and hot water, then maybe finish off with his disposable.</li>
            <li> My first though upon seeing the disclaimer was that I hadn&#x27;t gotten the product that I ordered.</li>
            <li> Exactly as descibed.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> If it has been more than 6 months since your last blade replacement then get this now.  </li>
            <li> Exact replacement for my electric razor.</li>
            <li> Replacement items arrived earlier than estimated, undamaged, and fit perfectly...thanks!</li>
            <li> Why should this cost more than ten to fifteen dollars?</li>
            <li> cheap then it may be worth it to buy a new razor instead of new blades.  </li>
            <li> I am lucky if they stay sharp for more than 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The new blades are not sharp as the original ones and they don&#x27;t give you a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I pull out the old blades, clean and re-insert them and that makes the rattling noise go away.</li>
            <li> This shaver blows away Braun Norelco, and all others as far as a clean shave and a sturdy well built shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, with the new blades and foil the thing works exactly as it did when I first got it, hurrah!</li>
            <li> It was easy to replace the old parts with the new ones.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get new parts for my shaver, in fact I was thinking of just buying a new shaver because I wasn&#x27;t getting as clean of a shave as when I first bought my electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Not quite as sharp as the original nano/titanium/whatever blades, but those do not seem to be available anymore.</li>
            <li> Certainly worth buying replacement blades rather than a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> Snaps right on and works like the razor did when it was new.</li>
            <li> The unit is fine but totally overpriced.</li>
            <li> The foil is very durable and this wet or dry shaving experience is great.</li>
            <li> The old blades popped right out and the new ones right in.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t add much to what has already been said.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The cover on this one however is much thinner than any I&#x27;ve owned before.</li>
            <li> A much smoother and closer shave now.</li>
            <li> Quality replacement parts at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The Gillette razor gives me much closer shave at a fraction of the time.</li>
            <li> My Shick Hydro shaves faster, much closer, and with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I have much smoother shaves now.</li>
            <li> I really like the Panasonic shaver so after two years I got this replacement set.  </li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> These replacement blades work very well but need to be replaced every six months.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and went two to three years on one set of blades, you absolutely must do this, since you&#x27;ll rediscover the razor you purchased all that time ago.solutely must do this, since you&#x27;ll rediscover the razor you purchased all that time ago.</li>
            <li> The whole shaver and blades did not perform well at all.</li>
            <li> I replaced my son&#x27;s foil but really wanted to replace the set.</li>
            <li> and it work very well.</li>
            <li> It simply is not comparable to a Norelco, although the clean-up offers many advantages.  </li>
            <li> This particular (Vortex Combo) replacement foil and razor set has performed very well, despite that I don&#x27;t make a consistent effort to clean the shaver and might have knocked the foil against the sink a couple of times or turned on the razor before properly closing the foil contraption.</li>
            <li> These foil and blades do exactly what they should do when they&#x27;re new - cut</li>
            <li> However, take some clear aloe lotion and warm water and wet your face down every now and then for a refreshing shaving experience.    </li>
            <li> Brings back the original cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Evidently there&#x27;s \\&quot;still sharp\\&quot;, and there&#x27;s \\&quot;as sharp as they SHOULD be\\&quot;.  :)</li>
            <li> but it is different than the original</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic works like a new one, and it is in the top ten of electric shavers</li>
            <li> were 2 years old, and the new ones definitely work better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but think that they are overpriced and only able to sell at such prices because there isn&#x27;t much competition and because people are stuck buying them once they&#x27;ve found a shaver that works for them and needs the blades and foil replaced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like brand new!</li>
            <li> Now it cuts like new again!</li>
            <li> Put em in this morning; just like a new razor!</li>
            <li> My son loves his shaver so much that I ordered a new head.  </li>
            <li> Simple review..very easy to remove old parts and install new one.</li>
            <li> Some folks commented that these replacement parts cost more than half the price of the razor.</li>
            <li> Ordered these blades for an older model ES7109 electric razor.</li>
            <li> The price doesnt seem that high to me, acutally.  </li>
            <li> These are high quality made in Japan blades and foil.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you replace your foil and blades asap after one year or so of work.</li>
            <li> This being said, I can&#x27;t help but express my discontent at the high prices of these things.</li>
            <li> I started with a Remington - Moved to a high end</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive at $40, but a great way to make that shaver just like new!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the cost to me over Mach 3 Turbo blades and an occasional cut or nick.</li>
            <li> I have never read a published book or, as in this case, complete work of a classical author that had as many orthographic and grammatical mistakes as had the above.</li>
            <li> , so the new blades only do so much for me, but these do their job exactly as is intended.</li>
            <li> A new shave could be bought for a few more dollars.</li>
            <li> You can simply pop off the top, brush it off and rinse it under water, towel it off, and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I should have gotten a new one sooner, it works much better than my old one and cuts time in half.</li>
            <li> These are Panasonic OEM parts so are expected to perform as original.  </li>
            <li> Was thinking of getting a new foil, but thought I would try this replacement set, and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the shaver is brand new.</li>
            <li> Removing and installing the new parts was a piece of cake.</li>
            <li> &amp; I thought I might as well buy a new razor till I looked at the price to replace mine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting new.  </li>
            <li> This shaving blade set made my razor work like new again.</li>
            <li> Make your razor work like brand new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We ended up buying a new travel shaver instead of replacing the blades.</li>
            <li> For this price you can almost buy a new Panasonic ES7103K ($49.47 on Amazon) shaver which includes this combo.</li>
            <li> The razor is like new -- smoother, closer shave, even quieter.  </li>
            <li> BUT, after I replaced the screen and blades, it was like getting my new shaver</li>
            <li> It removed the need to buy a new shaver and saved me quite a bit of money.  </li>
            <li> You can buy a new razor for the price of those replacement screens.</li>
            <li> My razor shaves like new.</li>
            <li> Razor shaves like new again.  </li>
            <li> The item was new in a blister.  </li>
            <li> made the razor like new.</li>
            <li> You have a choice, but a new razor at $60.00 or a replacement foil/blade set for $35.00.</li>
            <li> Why the replacement parts are almost as much as a new razor, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve done that about three times already - got a new razor instead of buying parts and this time, I decided to stick with my Panasonic Razor till the batteries die.</li>
            <li> It made it feel brand new again.  </li>
            <li> Made my razor new.</li>
            <li> Shaves like the way when i got the shaver brand new...</li>
            <li> Now the shaver cuts like when it was new.</li>
            <li> My concern about installing the new blades with my arthritis was unfounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replacing the heads once a year is like getting a new razor.  </li>
            <li> but then I found this kit which practically makes the razor brand new.  </li>
            <li> For the price and the age of my unit, I could have purchased a new shaver.</li>
            <li> $35 may seem a bit steep for a replacement foil and blades, but installing these made my razor work like new again.  </li>
            <li> If you can get a new Panasonic wet/dry with the 13,000 rpm motor</li>
            <li> Replacing these is like making your razor seem brand new again.</li>
            <li> The end result is my electric razor now works like brand new.</li>
            <li> However, since you need the new blades, Amazon it the cheapest place I found to buy them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just one of those things you have to live with...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost like new again.</li>
            <li> It came and appeared new in all shape and manner</li>
            <li> 2) immediately get new foil and blades for my ES8043.    </li>
            <li> But new Foils will be needed at some time.    </li>
            <li> It cuts like new again.  </li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do, make your shaver feel like new on your face.</li>
            <li> just not like new, but does the job,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just not like new, but does the job</li>
            <li> /&gt;just not like new, but does the job</li>
            <li> And over the course of three or so years, it&#x27;s real easy to not notice the very slow change in performance over all that time.  </li>
            <li> Even after replacing the blades and micro screen, the Shaver&#x27;s effectiveness falls short of the original standard.      </li>
            <li> Next time I look for a razor, looking at the price of replacement parts first.  </li>
            <li> Usually we end up trying another brand because he isn&#x27;t satisfied</li>
            <li> I felt the same way 18 months into my first Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> When I am not lazy, I also use a Gillette Fusion ProGlide battery operated razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the quality of the replacement blades are the same as what comes with the shaver when you first purchase them.</li>
            <li> I should of looked here first instead of last!</li>
            <li> So when my new razor arrived, I put the old one in the mail and started using the new one.</li>
            <li> The biggest improvement is that the shaver becomes fairly loud over time and the new screen and blades corrects this for awhile.  </li>
            <li> The blades are not anywhere near as sharp as the original set.  </li>
            <li> I got the razor a while back and the shaving was becoming rough.  </li>
            <li> The hair clipper does not work very well (and when using the clipper it makes a strange sound as if the gears etc. are slipping).</li>
            <li> Some have mentioned that a new shaver was only a little bit more than this package.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades do the job, pure and simple.</li>
            <li> Most of the newer Panasonic models can be had for $100 if you shop hard.</li>
            <li> New Foil and New Inner Blades &#x3D; new razor.</li>
            <li> It says nothing about this being a refurbished product, but it clearly is, unless it was tested or something?  </li>
            <li> WOW....</li>
            <li> I will probably order this product again when the old one needs replacing.</li>
            <li> I use them with Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver.</li>
            <li> Had no problems replacing the old parts with these.</li>
            <li> My razor is about 4 years old</li>
            <li> As far as the vendor who sold me the replacement blade goes, I can recommend this vendor.  </li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> One thing you should know is that when it cleans it makes fairly loud noise.</li>
            <li> The only real con that I can see here is that I had to deal with the plastic clamshell packaging.  </li>
            <li> I have a Panasonic ES8077 shaver that is over 4 years old.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my razor nearly three years.  </li>
            <li> It improved the shaving quality for my young boys, even under their chins where they can&#x27;t see as well.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t felt my razor &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; my hairs, which was happening with the old blades</li>
            <li> And they cost less than a full tank of gas for your car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dull very quickly for the cost.  </li>
            <li> Just like when it was new - big difference.  </li>
            <li> But when you notice that you shave the same spot about three times and the hair still won&#x27;t come off, you probably need new blades.</li>
            <li> New blades and foil brought razor back to \\&quot;as new\\&quot; performance.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m probably gonna end up getting a new razor on the next go around just to catch one of those Amazon deals on bulk buys for a shaver and its accessories.</li>
            <li> I have a panasonic es8043 and it brought my razor back to brand new feeling again.  </li>
            <li> Why invest in a new razor unless you want a 2nd one.</li>
            <li> It was sold as NEW - Open Box.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have with them is, like so many others, the price.</li>
            <li> it did fully bring my 5 year old shaving action back to as-new performance and</li>
            <li> /&gt;They come out simply by pulling straight up on them, the new ones go in by simply pushing straight down.  </li>
            <li> Original replacement foil and cutting block made the shaver feel as new and came quickly.</li>
            <li> 18 months later, I simply replaced the outer foil and blade set on the old one (now with new battery) and shipped the newer razor off for it&#x27;s battery replacement.</li>
            <li> High priced though - this one part cost about a third of what the entire shaver cost.</li>
            <li> thing I like about this razor, in general</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only is it fast again, since i&#x27;m not going over the same spots repeatedly, but it sounds totally different again too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying it again next year to keep my old shaver going.</li>
            <li> The panasonic naming game is almost as challenging to sort thru as their pricing [Some models list at $400].    </li>
            <li> Also, I picked the slow free shipping option, but I got it in 3 days because its very small and light I guess.</li>
            <li> Way overpriced I will say, however the blades will last much longer when used wet and with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I should have replaced the old ones long ago.    </li>
            <li> Generally will last only a year before they&#x27;re not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> , the design of the heads allow me to cleanly shave the thick and deep &amp;#34;folds&amp;#34; on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> The old blade still gives me a decent shave, however, when it gets noisier than usual, I replace it.</li>
            <li> Sharp blades and an outer foil each Spring are just as critical as a new set of tires on a car with 40000 miles on the clock.  </li>
            <li> Each new blade is not as sharp as the last one.  </li>
            <li> The first set of blades I had lasted two years, easily which definitely ends up being less expensive than purchasing razor blades.</li>
            <li> Just installed these on my shaver, and holy cow, it is like new again.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s one third to one half the price of a completely new razor!</li>
            <li> might have purchased a new shaver, but the Vortex is a wet and dry shaver.</li>
            <li> The cost for the replacement blades and foil was over half of what I paid for the entire razor new.</li>
            <li> Although, a practically brand new razor for less than $35?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost half the cost of a new shaver.</li>
            <li> either knockoffs or Panasonic has decided to boost their sales of blades by making them last only so long</li>
            <li> i didnt realize the old blades were so dull until i installed the new ones.</li>
            <li> Next time I won&#x27;t wait so long to swap them out.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> I read a review from a gentleman who soaks the blades in alcohol to make them last a long time.     </li>
            <li> They arrived in a few days, were affordable, and make my razor function like new.</li>
            <li> Too expensive but otherwise just fine.</li>
            <li> My razor is a little over 3 years old &amp; I have never replaced these.  </li>
            <li> As long as my razor will hold a charge I will continue to buy replacement foils and blades from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Replacing the foil and blades on my Panasonic razor was long overdue.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea if their service life will be as long, but time will tell.</li>
            <li> that I was unaware it was ever any other way.  </li>
            <li> I only have to shave every other day now.</li>
            <li> Expensive set of blades, but it restores a clean cut, no pulling or irritation, and quicker shaves.</li>
            <li> Set out to dry.</li>
            <li> Once I received it I was more angry than guilty; way too much money for a piece of plastic and a couple of blades.  </li>
            <li> As a few have pointed out, the cost of this \\&quot;renew\\&quot; kit is rather disconcerting at almost half the cost for my electric razor new (model ES8077).  </li>
            <li> how dull my blades were until I put in a new set about a year ago.</li>
            <li> Also the shaving foil is a little larger due to the extra blade in the head.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can have a dry shave for a &amp;#34;Quickie&amp;#34; or with the wet lather application it just gives you that smoother shave.</li>
            <li> So few electronic products last as long as we expect them to.  </li>
            <li> and I get a closer, less hassle shave than with a regular razor and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> It looks like the set will last me about a year, as have similar sets in the past (they are supposed to last less than that,</li>
            <li> I use my razor dry and wet.</li>
            <li> Bad advertising, wasn&#x27;t sure it had 2 blades until it arrived, picture showed 1 blade.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy and difficult beard and like it shaved smoothly.</li>
            <li> careful  </li>
            <li> Gotta be careful with this one.</li>
            <li> This product works as expected.</li>
            <li> When I remove it and tap it against the sink to clean, I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to break.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but inside this very tightly sealed package, I can see several human whisker hairs on the surface of the foil.</li>
            <li> I have had several panasonic razors in the past.</li>
            <li> They do not last but a few shaves !</li>
            <li> but i think they are &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; due to the look.</li>
            <li> Life is too short to burn your face with dull blades.</li>
            <li> only complaint was the price.</li>
            <li> This was at least our second re-order of blades/foil for the Panasonic electric razor.</li>
            <li> I shave daily and have a thick beard.  </li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed when I received it and replaced my original blade and foil with the new combo pack.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem as sharp as the 1st one I bought!</li>
            <li> It may seem a little expensive compared to the price of the whole razor, but it will make it shave like the day you bought it.</li>
            <li> They give away the razor to get you to spend almost half the price for replacement foil and blades.  </li>
            <li> B000VKV28S Panasonic ES7103K Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Triple Head Shaver, Black]]</li>
            <li> Paid half the price for the replacement blade on here rather than $60 plus tax from the store.</li>
            <li> They take less time too.</li>
            <li> I usually have a wet shave.</li>
            <li> forget the fancy new razors that are as complicated as your IPhone.</li>
            <li> Sadly though, the razor itself died a few months ago and it is not easy to find the same model (on the last venture searching).</li>
            <li> Of course, if your shaver is a broken down wreck it will only improve your shave a little.</li>
            <li> Little costly but wish I had done sooner.</li>
            <li> From now on it&#x27;s an annual thing, especially since I&#x27;m shaving my head and a very thick</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think there was anything wrong with the old set.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look broken or any different from the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I was spending an inordinate amount of time going over my face multiple times, getting poor shaves regardless of the time, and a lot of irritation from my Panasonic, so I thought it was the age (1.5 years) of the blade.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the replacement blade and foil, and after installing them I can say that I still get poor shaves and irritation, only it&#x27;s now cost me an additional $35.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and after 8 months, I need to replace the blades and outer foil.  </li>
            <li> Might not fit my razor.</li>
            <li> They are not cheap, but, come on, it´s</li>
            <li> My husband has has this razor for a few years now and we never replaced the blades until now.</li>
            <li> The outer foil does not fit.</li>
            <li> (they are not cheap by any means.)  </li>
            <li> but that is the back bone of the shaving game.</li>
            <li> I got a ripped package which was missing the blades.  </li>
            <li> Shaver&#x27;s cutting performance now works like new!  </li>
            <li> Wet and dry shavers are still expensive.</li>
            <li> The difference in shaving was a dramatic improvement; I shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long - over two years - to replace them.</li>
            <li> only drawback is this is too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for the past month.</li>
            <li> should these become difficult to find in the future.</li>
            <li> Whoever edited theese works could not have been German and did a lousy job..</li>
            <li> Instead they usually cost between thirty to forty dollars.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that the replacements are expensive, but unfortunately in my case, they are necessary.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic part numbers are hard to decipher.</li>
            <li> I was four years too late.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t actually do the cutting does it?</li>
            <li> My complaint is that the replacement set is quite costly compared to the cost of the shaver.</li>
            <li> I hate being just a \\&quot;me too\\&quot; post, but I know that I really like seeing a preponderance of 5 stars when I&#x27;m looking for something, so at least the \\&quot;me too\\</li>
            <li> Usually change the screen once a year and the blades every two years!</li>
            <li> To me this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> A little too expensive.</li>
            <li> But the shave was getting poor</li>
            <li> This combo is over 30% of the cost of the entire shaving system including the cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> I was getting to the point where I&#x27;d only shave my head every two or three days because it was getting annoying...</li>
            <li> I stopped using this razor after my base charger/cleaning unit finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> Cost is absurd.  </li>
            <li> Sent wrong ones for my model.</li>
            <li> I felt guilty paying almost $40 for this.  </li>
            <li> ** expensive, anyway?</li>
            <li> I was unable to locate this in any stores.  </li>
            <li> The razor&#x27;s battery is stating to fail, however.</li>
            <li> Somehow ordered the wrong one.</li>
            <li> Brand name replacement parts are always way too expensive (think OEM car parts), but when you need them you buy them anyway.</li>
            <li> Then I finish difficult areas with the Panasonic to prevent cutting myself.</li>
            <li> The picture may show one cutting blade but there are two in the package.</li>
            <li> I wish i could compare but for the price its not too bad.</li>
            <li> But $35 for a couple of years of use isn&#x27;t too bad considering the cost of disposable razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price stinks!  </li>
            <li> Plus the blood, I hated the blood.  </li>
            <li> This is simply outrageous.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wow, great investment. Made my razor as good as the day it was purchased.</li>
            <li> I was no longer satisfied with the shave I was getting. Was thinking of getting a new foil, but thought I would try this replacement set, and WOW....that was it. It&#x27;s like the shaver is brand new. I am more than satisfied with my choice. Removing and installing the new parts was a piece of cake. As with all things from Amazon...price, quality, packaging and delivery were all first class.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can have a dry shave for a &amp;#34;Quickie&amp;#34; or with the wet lather application it just gives you that smoother shave.</li>
            <li> I have been surprised by some of the bitter system-beating cheapskates out there...good tools always cost good money and need maintenance.  Sharp blades and an outer foil each Spring are just as critical as a new set of tires on a car with 40000 miles on the clock.  And they cost less than a full tank of gas for your car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These items renew your shaving experience and the decision to invest in a razor with a high-rev motor and exceptional battery life.  Life is too short to burn your face with dull blades.</li>
            <li> My razor is a little over 3 years old &amp; I have never replaced these.  I&#x27;m retired so I only shave about 2 or 3 times a week if we are not going out someplace nice.  But the shave was getting poor so I looked into it.  Walgreens sold these individually (not as a set) but it was like $65 &amp; I thought I might as well buy a new razor till I looked at the price to replace mine $100+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found this on Amazon for $40 which is a good price compared to others.  The old blades popped right out and the new ones right in.  These are true Panasonic parts and I can not believe how good a shave I&#x27;m getting new.  Just like when it was new - big difference.  I guess I forgot over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Picture shows only one blade but it does come with two.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> This shaving blade set made my razor work like new again. I will probably order this product again when the old one needs replacing.</li>
            <li> Great replacement Blade system.  Make your razor work like brand new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price and great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John F</li>
            <li> Great razor and even better when the blade and foil are new.  But, $35 for the set?  That&#x27;s more than 1/3 the cost of a new razor.</li>
            <li> Great replacement works great and I have a new great shave.  I think that the company charges to much and since its a replacement and required item I guess they can charge what they want but a great item outside of that fact.</li>
            <li> only drawback is this is too expensive.  We ended up buying a new travel shaver instead of replacing the blades.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the favorable reviews here on Amazon.  I can&#x27;t add much to what has already been said.  I&#x27;ve had my Panasonic ES8077 for about 4 years and I replace the blade and foil just once per year.  This shaver still works like the day I bought it. The quality of the blades is exceptional and the shaver unit itself it impressive.  The battery life, in particular, is amazing.  I didn&#x27;t expect this product to be as durable as it has been.  So few electronic products last as long as we expect them to.  This is an exception.</li>
            <li> This is really a great set of blades.  I use them with Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver. The first set of blades I had lasted two years, easily which definitely ends up being less expensive than purchasing razor blades. Nonetheless, sometimes I do like the close shave I can get from a good razor which I still haven&#x27;t been able to get from an electric shaver.  But it&#x27;s fast, and for everyday use, a really great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this combo replacement for the Panasonic ES8077.  I shave daily and have a thick beard.  This is the 2nd foil and blade replacement in 3 years.  I can say without a doubt that the Panasonic is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned and I get a closer, less hassle shave than with a regular razor and shaving cream.  As long as my razor will hold a charge I will continue to buy replacement foils and blades from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Cost is absurd.  They give away the razor to get you to spend almost half the price for replacement foil and blades.  Still, its a very good razor and worth buying the kit  every year for 3 year or so til battery wears out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Be careful  Amazon often has the same items sold by various dealers at surprisingly different prices.  Shop the web first for the price and then come here for the reliability.</li>
            <li> This was just a replacement part.  Installed easily.  High priced though - this one part cost about a third of what the entire shaver cost.</li>
            <li> Way overpriced I will say, however the blades will last much longer when used wet and with shaving cream.  It&#x27;s a much more comfortable shave when used wet as well.</li>
            <li> Sent wrong ones for my model. Easy return.</li>
            <li> I bought these replacements for my husbands Panasonic shaver. Had no problems replacing the old parts with these. Been using it for the past month.</li>
            <li> For this price you can almost buy a new Panasonic ES7103K ($49.47 on Amazon) shaver which includes this combo. [[ASIN:B000VKV28S Panasonic ES7103K Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Triple Head Shaver, Black]]</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but these new blades are fantastic.  It comes with everything you need for an all new top end of the razor.  Took about 60 seconds to put it in, and made a huge difference.  The razor is like new -- smoother, closer shave, even quieter.  My razor is about 4 years old so I guess I was way overdue.  I will do this annually now.  The price doesnt seem that high to me, acutally.  I assume I would be paying $35 in just a couple months for regular blades.  These are high quality made in Japan blades and foil.  Also, I picked the slow free shipping option, but I got it in 3 days because its very small and light I guess.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get new parts for my shaver, in fact I was thinking of just buying a new shaver because I wasn&#x27;t getting as clean of a shave as when I first bought my electric shaver.  BUT, after I replaced the screen and blades, it was like getting my new shaver back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on a completely new shaver, just replace these parts and you will be happy!</li>
            <li> Paid half the price for the replacement blade on here rather than $60 plus tax from the store. First chance I got to swap in the fresh foil and blade, it makes a world of a difference. I highly recommend that you replace your foil and blades asap after one year or so of work.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent purchase!  It removed the need to buy a new shaver and saved me quite a bit of money.  The item was brand new and functioned perfectly.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased the above for my razor.The unit is fine but totally overpriced. You can buy a new razor for the price of those replacement screens.</li>
            <li> Replacing the foil and blades on my Panasonic razor was long overdue.  Rather than pulling at the stubble on my face my razor glides through smoothly.  It was easy to replace the old parts with the new ones.  Next time I won&#x27;t wait so long to swap them out.  My razor shaves like new.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades do the job, pure and simple. I get a nice close shave again just like when I first bought the razor. Certainly worth buying replacement blades rather than a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> Razor shaves like new again.  Yes, they are costly, but thats the way it always is with shaving products.  I use the razor to shave my head.  It&#x27;s well worth the cost to me over Mach 3 Turbo blades and an occasional cut or nick.</li>
            <li> My new blades worked good loved them thay cut good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic foil-type electric shavers for years, and I am very pleased with them. I prefer them to the rotary electric razors. This particular (Vortex Combo) replacement foil and razor set has performed very well, despite that I don&#x27;t make a consistent effort to clean the shaver and might have knocked the foil against the sink a couple of times or turned on the razor before properly closing the foil contraption. It looks like the set will last me about a year, as have similar sets in the past (they are supposed to last less than that, but I find that I can use them for a year without problems). This being said, I can&#x27;t help but express my discontent at the high prices of these things. I can&#x27;t help but think that they are overpriced and only able to sell at such prices because there isn&#x27;t much competition and because people are stuck buying them once they&#x27;ve found a shaver that works for them and needs the blades and foil replaced.</li>
            <li> I purchase replacement blades for my Panasonic Vortex shaver.  Prior to replacing the blades, there was a decline in the effectiveness of the Shaver that required shaving the same areas over and over again to get an acceptable shave.  Even after replacing the blades and micro screen, the Shaver&#x27;s effectiveness falls short of the original standard.      I have used this Shaver for about 4 years now.  It simply is not comparable to a Norelco, although the clean-up offers many advantages.  You can simply pop off the top, brush it off and rinse it under water, towel it off, and let it air dry.  The Norelco required disassembly of the unit head, and removal of each cutter from its screen to clean.  So, the trade off for using the Panasonic is that it takes longer to shave in the morning, and the shave itself falls well short of the Norelco.    As far as the vendor who sold me the replacement blade goes, I can recommend this vendor.  The replacement blades shipped within 48 hours of the placement of the order.  The item was new in a blister.  No fault with this vendor, who did everything right.  So, 100% recommendation for the Amazon vendor.    Panasonic may make a great radio, but the shavers remind me of American cars in the 1970s.  They were also very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> i didnt realize the old blades were so dull until i installed the new ones. made the razor like new.</li>
            <li> This combo is over 30% of the cost of the entire shaving system including the cleaning base.  This is simply outrageous.</li>
            <li> I have had several panasonic razors in the past. They last a long time. The cover on this one however is much thinner than any I&#x27;ve owned before. When I remove it and tap it against the sink to clean, I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to break. Gotta be careful with this one.</li>
            <li> So glad to find replacement blades and shaving screen for my Panasonic Wet/Dry Razor. After giving my razor a thorough cleaning, removing the old and replacing with new blades and screen was very easy. The difference in shaving was a dramatic improvement; I shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long - over two years - to replace them. A much smoother and closer shave now. Quality replacement parts at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I waited too long, but my Panny razor is good for a couple more years.</li>
            <li> panasonic wes9012pc men&#x27;s vortex combo was easy to install and was at a reasonable price under mfr. price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but inside this very tightly sealed package, I can see several human whisker hairs on the surface of the foil. It says nothing about this being a refurbished product, but it clearly is, unless it was tested or something?  Either way, I don&#x27;t want some dude&#x27;s whiskers on my face when I&#x27;m shaving. Gross.  I sent it back for a replacement and hopefully this time I&#x27;ll get a clean one.</li>
            <li> You have a choice, but a new razor at $60.00 or a replacement foil/blade set for $35.00. Why the replacement parts are almost as much as a new razor, I don&#x27;t know. But I&#x27;ve done that about three times already - got a new razor instead of buying parts and this time, I decided to stick with my Panasonic Razor till the batteries die. This foil/blade set make a big difference. I use my razor dry and wet. But when you notice that you shave the same spot about three times and the hair still won&#x27;t come off, you probably need new blades. And for the price the Amazon offered, it&#x27;s the cheapest out there.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Good value</li>
            <li> If you have the panasonic shaver, this is the replacement cutter and foil. Works fine.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly.  New blades and foil brought razor back to \\&quot;as new\\&quot; performance.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t listed on the Amazon site at the time of purchase, but this works with the ES7109.  I went to Panasonics site to confirm that this would work on the ES7109.  I tried it out yesterday, worked fine, razor works and feels like new again.    I felt guilty paying almost $40 for this.  Once I received it I was more angry than guilty; way too much money for a piece of plastic and a couple of blades.  Next time I look for a razor, looking at the price of replacement parts first.  I gave the product/purchase 5 stars....but the price I&#x27;d give 1 star.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic works like a new one, and it is in the top ten of electric shavers</li>
            <li> My son loves his shaver so much that I ordered a new head.  Usually we end up trying another brand because he isn&#x27;t satisfied and also we get a better deal just buying a new one.  Not this time!  He has sensitive skin so he really likes the smooth, non-irritable shave.  I like the self cleaning, cause it wouldn&#x27;t get done unless I did it.</li>
            <li> Had the razor for YEARS - didn&#x27;t know that \\&quot;they\\&quot; recommend to replace blades and foil every 5-6 months - even by subscription.&lt;br /&gt;I think 5 months is way too quick since I keep the head very clean.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, with the new blades and foil the thing works exactly as it did when I first got it, hurrah!</li>
            <li> The replacement kit was a perfect fit for my panasonic shaver.  It made it feel brand new again.  One item to note, even though the picture only shows one replacement blade, you do get two replacement blades and one replacement foil in the package.</li>
            <li> Shaver works great. I love it. The hair clipper does not work very well (and when using the clipper it makes a strange sound as if the gears etc. are slipping). One thing you should know is that when it cleans it makes fairly loud noise.</li>
            <li> Some folks commented that these replacement parts cost more than half the price of the razor. True. I felt the same way 18 months into my first Panasonic.  So I simply bought another of the same razor.  However, the razor has a two-year warrenty, and the battery performance starts to wane at about 18 months.  So when my new razor arrived, I put the old one in the mail and started using the new one. 18 months later, I simply replaced the outer foil and blade set on the old one (now with new battery) and shipped the newer razor off for it&#x27;s battery replacement. Thus, no interruption in shaving!</li>
            <li> Made my razor new. I&#x27;d forgotten that it indeed provides a nice shave. Good price.</li>
            <li> This is the second replacement of Vortex Combo pack (blade &amp; screen) in about two years that I have owned my Panasonic ES8077 Wet/Dry shaver. The old blade still gives me a decent shave, however, when it gets noisier than usual, I replace it. The noise is different than the already noisy shaver, kind of a rattling sound. Sometimes I pull out the old blades, clean and re-insert them and that makes the rattling noise go away. I read a review from a gentleman who soaks the blades in alcohol to make them last a long time.     Overall, I have been happy with this shaver but the plastic parts are starting to show age and discoloration. I have been a Braun brand user most of my life and may return to it. When I am not lazy, I also use a Gillette Fusion ProGlide battery operated razor. The Gillette razor gives me much closer shave at a fraction of the time. Then I finish difficult areas with the Panasonic to prevent cutting myself. I have a heavy and difficult beard and like it shaved smoothly.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not doing yourself any favors by running out the clock on the blades you have. I had no idea how dull my blades were until I put in a new set about a year ago. I didn&#x27;t think there was anything wrong with the old set. I just figured after five years I &amp;#34;should&amp;#34; swap them out. I can tell you I was four years too late. From now on it&#x27;s an annual thing, especially since I&#x27;m shaving my head and a very thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I like about this razor, in general, the design of the heads allow me to cleanly shave the thick and deep &amp;#34;folds&amp;#34; on the back of my neck. They were always a problem.</li>
            <li> perfect fit, took seconds to replace old one and razor is like brand new. Little costly but wish I had done sooner. Makes for a better and faster shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my shaver for over a year now.  I&#x27;ve replaced the blades a couple of times, but can someone tell me why I should replace the foil?  It doesn&#x27;t look broken or any different from the day I bought it.  I doesn&#x27;t actually do the cutting does it?</li>
            <li> I was spending an inordinate amount of time going over my face multiple times, getting poor shaves regardless of the time, and a lot of irritation from my Panasonic, so I thought it was the age (1.5 years) of the blade.  I ordered the replacement blade and foil, and after installing them I can say that I still get poor shaves and irritation, only it&#x27;s now cost me an additional $35.  My Shick Hydro shaves faster, much closer, and with no irritation.</li>
            <li> New blades works great. Brings back the original cut. Should have done this sooner.</li>
            <li> Just a great product...no issues. Shaves like the way when i got the shaver brand new...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Dad... he&#x27;s 92 and loves the fact he can use shave cream and hot water, then maybe finish off with his disposable. These blades seem to wear out faster than they used to, and I&#x27;m seeing the same thing with my shaver too. Why are they so da** expensive, anyway?</li>
            <li> Fits fine in my shavor but i have a feeling it does not work as well as the original. I wish i could compare but for the price its not too bad.</li>
            <li> The only thing that you can really say is that these are the real thing, I just put in my 4th set of replacement blades from here and they all work the same, flawlessly.</li>
            <li> What a difference a change of blades makes. Now the shaver cuts like when it was new. Changing the blades and comb were very easy. My concern about installing the new blades with my arthritis was unfounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was the price. But $35 for a couple of years of use isn&#x27;t too bad considering the cost of disposable razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might have purchased a new shaver, but the Vortex is a wet and dry shaver. I usually have a wet shave. Wet and dry shavers are still expensive.</li>
            <li> Just installed these on my shaver, and holy cow, it is like new again. My last blades were the originals with two years on them. I guess I had gotten use to the extra passes I was making to get the job done. Don&#x27;t know which part helped the most (foil or blades), but this is well worth 35 dollars when you consider the cost of disposables. Some have mentioned that a new shaver was only a little bit more than this package. That was not the case for me. The difference would be about 100 dollars. Also, like others have noted the package includes two blades not one like in the picture.</li>
            <li> Replacing the heads once a year is like getting a new razor.  I highly recommend it as well as keeping them clean between shavings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to find that Amazon carried this OEM replacement for my Panasonic shaver.  I was unable to locate this in any stores.  Great quality product and my shaver works like new again!</li>
            <li> good replacement parts, excellent price</li>
            <li> You can count on Panasonic for a fine product.  So convenient to purchase this set via Amazon.  Give this a try.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I had no idea that the blades and outer foil were even replaceable on my Phillips ES8078.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 8 years of use, and one big drop onto the corner of the bathtub a couple of months ago, the razor starting leaving searing red cuts on my face.  I thought it was fine.  My fiancee thought otherwise.  So off I went to Amazon drop $110 on another Phillips razor with a cleaning system, but then I found this kit which practically makes the razor brand new.  Plus the price is right.  The only real con that I can see here is that I had to deal with the plastic clamshell packaging.  Although, a practically brand new razor for less than $35?  I dealt.  I&#x27;ve already bought a second pack should these become difficult to find in the future.</li>
            <li> Affordable on Amazon and shipped promptly. Worked fine.</li>
            <li> It may seem a little expensive compared to the price of the whole razor, but it will make it shave like the day you bought it.</li>
            <li> This whole assembly is Excellent. My shaver is just like new could not ask for better replacements</li>
            <li> I should have replaced the old ones long ago.    I have much smoother shaves now. They take less time too.</li>
            <li> I have never read a published book or, as in this case, complete work of a classical author that had as many orthographic and grammatical mistakes as had the above. You would find them at almost every page. In one case, whole pages were missing from a story. Whoever edited theese works could not have been German and did a lousy job..</li>
            <li> Although the packaging says \\&quot;for use with ES8813, 8078, 8044, 8043, 7109, 7102, 7101, 7058, 7038, 7036, 6003, 6002,\\&quot; the foil and blades fit on the ES8077. My first though upon seeing the disclaimer was that I hadn&#x27;t gotten the product that I ordered. Not the case. My razor works like new now :-)</li>
            <li> The order was processed promptly. The parts were easy to replace. The shaver now works as good as new.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and after 8 months, I need to replace the blades and outer foil.  The replacement was as advertised and arrived in a timely manner.  I agree with other reviewers that the replacements are expensive, but unfortunately in my case, they are necessary.  For lighter beards, I would recommend going longer than 6 or 8 months before replacing blades and foil (despite what the manufacturer recommends).</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a replacement combo blade and foil for my Panasonic shaver and I was very disappointed when I received it and replaced my original blade and foil with the new combo pack. The new blades are not sharp as the original ones and they don&#x27;t give you a clean shave. I don&#x27;t think the quality of the replacement blades are the same as what comes with the shaver when you first purchase them.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace, this buy was definitely worth it. Snaps right on and works like the razor did when it was new. 4 stars cuz I&#x27;m not big on electrics, so the new blades only do so much for me, but these do their job exactly as is intended. Note: there are two inner blades and one outer foil in this package, even tho theres only one blade in the pic</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a razor that is listed on the site, but it didn&#x27;t work. The details should be reviewed for this item..</li>
            <li> Expensive set of blades, but it restores a clean cut, no pulling or irritation, and quicker shaves. The razor&#x27;s battery is stating to fail, however.</li>
            <li> i have these on standing order. they work well and keep my shaver giving a clean cut pull free shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive at $40, but a great way to make that shaver just like new! But I&#x27;m probably gonna end up getting a new razor on the next go around just to catch one of those Amazon deals on bulk buys for a shaver and its accessories. Those Vortex cleaning cartridges are starting to add up at retail price.    Amazon still has the best price w/ free shipping all around.</li>
            <li> This product works as expected. The only drawback to it is the price. For the price and the age of my unit, I could have purchased a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Simple review..very easy to remove old parts and install new one. This shaver blows away Braun Norelco, and all others as far as a clean shave and a sturdy well built shaver. Way to go, Panasonic!!</li>
            <li> Generally will last only a year before they&#x27;re not sharp enough. I end up replacing the outer foil and blades at the same time to keep the close shave.</li>
            <li> $35 may seem a bit steep for a replacement foil and blades, but installing these made my razor work like new again.  If you can get a new Panasonic wet/dry with the 13,000 rpm motor cheap then it may be worth it to buy a new razor instead of new blades.  The picture may show one cutting blade but there are two in the package.</li>
            <li> I really like the Panasonic shaver so after two years I got this replacement set.  It works very well but I feel it is slightly more expensive than it should be.  That is why I gave it 4 stars.  It&#x27;s almost half the cost of a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Might not fit my razor.</li>
            <li> This was at least our second re-order of blades/foil for the Panasonic electric razor. Replacing these is like making your razor seem brand new again. Sadly though, the razor itself died a few months ago and it is not easy to find the same model (on the last venture searching). But the razor was in service for many, many years and one of the only electric razors my husband would use. We&#x27;re off to another purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Panasonic razor since 2003. I use it daily. I am delighted that replacement parts are still available for it.  They arrived in a few days, were affordable, and make my razor function like new.</li>
            <li> Exactly as descibed. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Original replacement foil and cutting block made the shaver feel as new and came quickly. Overall I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Does not cut as well as the original.</li>
            <li> They do not last but a few shaves ! the original Panasonic blades lasted me 40-50 shaves ! these are either knockoffs or Panasonic has decided to boost their sales of blades by making them last only so long</li>
            <li> The blades where very easy to install. The end result is my electric razor now works like brand new. Very happy.</li>
            <li> These are Panasonic OEM parts so are expected to perform as original.  I have a Panasonic ES8077 shaver that is over 4 years old.  New screen and blades do improve the efficiency and performance but it isn&#x27;t a huge improvement.  The biggest improvement is that the shaver becomes fairly loud over time and the new screen and blades corrects this for awhile.  From a performance standpoint the screen and blades are good for a couple of years.  From a noise standpoint they are good for about a year.  Contrary to Panasonic&#x27;s recommendations, it makes no improvement to performance or noise to replace either screen or blades separately.  They need to go in as a set.  My complaint is that the replacement set is quite costly compared to the cost of the shaver.</li>
            <li> The foil is very durable and this wet or dry shaving experience is great. There is a location for a third blade, but haven&#x27;t seen it, yet. Overall, this is the best shave yet...</li>
            <li> This set fitted my ES8043 perfectly and left it working like new. The difference with the 3 year old blades is just amazing, my shaving times cut to a half and they´re so much better. They are not cheap, but, come on, it´s only once every couple of years!</li>
            <li> I am lucky if they stay sharp for more than 6 weeks.  Dull very quickly for the cost.  The razor has the speed, but the blades just do not tend to hold the edge.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than promised, no problems, works fine. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but nobody is perfect.; well except One</li>
            <li> Two blades and cover. You&#x27;ll be surprised at how much better your razor feels when you replace the blades.</li>
            <li> These replacement blades work very well but need to be replaced every six months. Very easy to replace. It takes longer to open the package.</li>
            <li> My husband has has this razor for a few years now and we never replaced the blades until now. It&#x27;s like brand new! Even I use it.</li>
            <li> Somehow ordered the wrong one.</li>
            <li> Whew I needed these.  Just what the Doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> I hate being just a \\&quot;me too\\&quot; post, but I know that I really like seeing a preponderance of 5 stars when I&#x27;m looking for something, so at least the \\&quot;me too\\&quot; posts can be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my razor nearly three years.  I&#x27;ve never changed the blades before.  I don&#x27;t shave my face with this razor, I just shave my head.  And over the course of three or so years, it&#x27;s real easy to not notice the very slow change in performance over all that time.  Until I put in the new blades, I forgot how good this worked when new.  I&#x27;ve become so used to having to go over the same area three or four times to try to get rid of all the hair, that I was unaware it was ever any other way.  And whenever I pulled it apart for cleaning, when I&#x27;d run my finger over the blades here, I&#x27;d still feel them tug at the skin, so I knew they were still sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evidently there&#x27;s \\&quot;still sharp\\&quot;, and there&#x27;s \\&quot;as sharp as they SHOULD be\\&quot;.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As pointed out by others, there are both blades in this purchase despite the photo showing only one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come out simply by pulling straight up on them, the new ones go in by simply pushing straight down.  Took all of 30 seconds to swap them out and close it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After changing them out, I fired it up and shaved my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And was totally amazed when I was done in literally about 20% of the time it had been taking me lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it fast again, since i&#x27;m not going over the same spots repeatedly, but it sounds totally different again too.  Much more subdued buzz, barely noticeable compared to what it sounded like yesterday when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One pass, fast shaving, quieter, for the cheap price on Amazon, makes it more than worth the price just in what I&#x27;ll save in time.  I was getting to the point where I&#x27;d only shave my head every two or three days because it was getting annoying...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;ve had your razor for a year or more, definitely worth swapping them out.  If you&#x27;re like me and went two to three years on one set of blades, you absolutely must do this, since you&#x27;ll rediscover the razor you purchased all that time ago.solutely must do this, since you&#x27;ll rediscover the razor you purchased all that time ago.</li>
            <li> I have a panasonic es8043 and it brought my razor back to brand new feeling again.  And I got in two days from amazon.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> The outer foil does not fit. The part # is right but it is different than the original foil.&lt;br /&gt;If I send it back, how do I know that I won&#x27;t just get the same thing. The #s are correct!!!</li>
            <li> The blades are not anywhere near as sharp as the original set.  I have used this and another Panasonic electric razor for years and I have changed the foil (no problem) and blades annually. (they are not cheap by any means.)  Each new blade is not as sharp as the last one.  This may be my last replacement...!!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an electric razor to shave legs, this works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Gotta say, great kit at a great price.  Use it every day!</li>
            <li> Shaver&#x27;s cutting performance now works like new!  More information on when to replace blades and how easy it is needed on shaver&#x27;s purchase inforation.</li>
            <li> If it has been more than 6 months since your last blade replacement then get this now.  You will notice the huge difference in how well it shaves.</li>
            <li> good razor replacements but i think they are &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; due to the look.</li>
            <li> Item came in time,and was as described</li>
            <li> Gave up on this unit. The whole shaver and blades did not perform well at all.</li>
            <li> The replacements blades work basically as well as the original blades. I have no idea if their service life will be as long, but time will tell. The only complaint I have with them is, like so many others, the price. The cost for the replacement blades and foil was over half of what I paid for the entire razor new. To me this is ridiculous. However, since you need the new blades, Amazon it the cheapest place I found to buy them.</li>
            <li> Purchased this hoping it would improve the shaving ability of my razor. For some reason, wasn&#x27;t as good as the original.</li>
            <li> I should have gotten a new one sooner, it works much better than my old one and cuts time in half.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. Gives a good shave. As good as the original parts. A little too expensive. A new shave could be bought for a few more dollars.</li>
            <li> Brand name replacement parts are always way too expensive (think OEM car parts), but when you need them you buy them anyway. The Panasonic Replacement Outer Foil and Inner Blade Set is no exception. The quality is good, as in all Panasonic products; I just wish the price was reasonable and that&#x27;s why I only gave this item 3 Stars. It&#x27;s just one of those things you have to live with...</li>
            <li> Exact replacement for my electric razor. Now it cuts like new again! I should buy extra to keep on hand...</li>
            <li> Good performance with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> Ordered these blades for an older model ES7109 electric razor. It improved the shaving quality for my young boys, even under their chins where they can&#x27;t see as well. I will reorder these blades!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and works like new!</li>
            <li> I got the razor a while back and the shaving was becoming rough.  After I got the replacements it&#x27;s almost like new again.</li>
            <li> If you have the 8043 or another fine Panasonic shaver that runs at 13000 cycles or higher then you have one of the finest of electric shavers made. Why invest in a new razor unless you want a 2nd one. After three years on the Foil and Cutters on mine I will upgrade them immediately.    New Foil and New Inner Blades &#x3D; new razor. As long as the battery is capable the Arc3 shavers are awesome. That being said I opted this time for an Open Box ES8243 someone had it on sale for $55 with free shipping. It was sold as NEW - Open Box. It came and appeared new in all shape and manner the unit was clean and had no signs of use. On that I give it an A+. The first shave said two things to me - 1) this is nice smooth shave. 2) immediately get new foil and blades for my ES8043.    The comparison shave between the ES8243 and its great uncle the ES8043 is very close. But there is something about the extra blade on the head of the ES8243 that gives it the edge. Also the shaving foil is a little larger due to the extra blade in the head. So if you are shopping and have the funds get an Arc4. If you have an Arc3 - just get the Foils and cutters.    The FINAL PRICING WORD - Spend the $40 and get another year (or Three). Yes, it is a lot of money for Panasonic Parts - but that is the back bone of the shaving game. It is marketing 101 to discount the razor to get the blade business. WIth electrics the cutters and the foils last along time depending on care and face chemistry. Some folks have skin oil that causes the blades and foils to age quicker. Or FIND a GREAT DEAL on an ARC4 model. Most of the newer Panasonic models can be had for $100 if you shop hard. But new Foils will be needed at some time.    I am keeping both - I travel for work and wanted a 2nd road model to leave in the travel bag - so I \\&quot;don&#x27;t leave home without it\\&quot; (Again - LOL). I also know that shaving with liquid is a unique option on these models. If you shave dry awesome - I do and it&#x27;s fast and works for me. However, take some clear aloe lotion and warm water and wet your face down every now and then for a refreshing shaving experience.    Panasonic forever. I started with a Remington - Moved to a high end Braun (had two over a multiyear period) - and I have been a Panasonic fan for some time now. It is a superior product. There is a great comparison of a Panasonic to Braun on the web. He picks the Braun. He wanted to pick the Braun. You do not need the cleaning stations. Shoot a drop of shampoo into and turn it on ultra mode. Operate in palm of you hand. Rinse. Set out to dry. Or go for the station - I don&#x27;t and won&#x27;t. My Panasonic 8043 is at least 5 years old and is still just awesome. It will now compete for FaceTime with the new Es8243 - clearly a descendent of a proud family.    if you want a new shaver as well - then this ARC3 model at 10000 cycles is great value. ($52)  [...]  &lt;-- Panasonic ES-RT51-S.  The panasonic naming game is almost as challenging to sort thru as their pricing [Some models list at $400].    This versus BIC shaving at $4 for 12 razors or about $20 a year for shaving. Plus the blood, I hated the blood.  Or stepping up to MACH3 blades for $24 or $108 dollars a year. (I think you go thru about one a week as I recall. Or more.) All of sudden $100 for a great shave and no blood - makes sense!</li>
            <li> Replacement blade and screen fit perfectly. The directions were easy to read and assisted in the installation.&lt;br /&gt;Mine were 2 years old, and the new ones definitely work better.</li>
            <li> Third time buying these replacements for my husband. No problems , would order again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Panasonic electric razors for the last twenty years and have never had a problem out of them.  Usually change the screen once a year and the blades every two years!</li>
            <li> The parts I needed to renew my razor.  It cuts like new again.  Panasonic part numbers are hard to decipher. but I fugured out these would fit my older razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> Bought the replacement kit and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they popped right in to my shaver and replaced the older blades perfectly. Nice to have something work out just like it should!!!</li>
            <li> Fit correctly, work well.  Not quite as sharp as the original nano/titanium/whatever blades, but those do not seem to be available anymore.</li>
            <li> I got a ripped package which was missing the blades.  I replaced my son&#x27;s foil but really wanted to replace the set.</li>
            <li> They work fine. Haven&#x27;t felt my razor &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; my hairs, which was happening with the old blades</li>
            <li> Nothing like fresh blades.</li>
            <li> As a few have pointed out, the cost of this \\&quot;renew\\&quot; kit is rather disconcerting at almost half the cost for my electric razor new (model ES8077).  Hence the three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it did fully bring my 5 year old shaving action back to as-new performance and no longer do I get that tugging sensation with my worn out blades/foil.</li>
            <li> I only have to shave every other day now.</li>
            <li> Replacement items arrived earlier than estimated, undamaged, and fit perfectly...thanks!</li>
            <li> Bad advertising, wasn&#x27;t sure it had 2 blades until it arrived, picture showed 1 blade. Great product !!! Pic should show 2 blades.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do, make your shaver feel like new on your face. Of course, if your shaver is a broken down wreck it will only improve your shave a little.</li>
            <li> Got these for my honey and they fit his razor he likes it</li>
            <li> The store I bought my shaver from didn&#x27;t have any of the replacement parts for it so I was glad to find them on here.</li>
            <li> forget the fancy new razors that are as complicated as your IPhone. Ive had this for years, . I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The right part. Easy to replace.</li>
            <li> I searched various stores and sites and could not find as good a price as Amazon. I should of looked here first instead of last!</li>
            <li> Easy to replace and it work very well.</li>
            <li> Too expensive but otherwise just fine. Fits perfectly. I&#x27;ll be buying it again next year to keep my old shaver going.</li>
            <li> Quickly shipped and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Made a great difference to razor.</li>
            <li> These foil and blades do exactly what they should do when they&#x27;re new - cut well. So there&#x27;s nothing special to say about them! I think all replacement blades are way overpriced. Why should this cost more than ten to fifteen dollars? Instead they usually cost between thirty to forty dollars. That&#x27;s one third to one half the price of a completely new razor! I do find Panasonic&#x27;s Linear razors to be the best on the market for my tough beard.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem as sharp as the 1st one I bought!</li>
            <li> I would imagine they&#x27;re ok I just bought an extra set in case I couldn&#x27;t get them again, same time as I bought the razor...</li>
            <li> Put em in this morning; just like a new razor!</li>
            <li> just not like new, but does the job,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just not like new, but does the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just not like new, but does the job</li>
            <li> Price stinks!  Fairly easy to install.  I stopped using this razor after my base charger/cleaning unit finally gave out.  Just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  So after six years I am back to a Gillette Mach3 and shaving gel.  My face doesn&#x27;t get quite the close shave (not noticeable to anyone)and it&#x27;s a bit messier, but my face always seemed to get more irritated with this electric razor.  actually enjoying shaving again now.</li>
