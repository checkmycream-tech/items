            <li>As to wakening me up a bit, I dont notice it, but, caffiene on the skin will help tighten the skin and help reduce the look of cellulite. :)</li>
            <li>or caffeine tingling more than 2 uses.</li>
            <li>So, its actually caffeinated according to my experiment, and it arrived on time for my assignment, which was perfect.  </li>
            <li>and I do feel more awake after my shower..</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>However, if you do buy this, make sure it is from Chemical Evolutions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I enjoyed it and it smells nice and minty and the later was good, so</li>
            <li>I feel good as new!</li>
            <li>It felt nice the first time or two used</li>
            <li>Good, smooth and clear soap.  </li>
            <li>If I knew absorbing caffeine through your skin was this effective, I would have started bathing in coffee years ago.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>(pretty sure that is all bogus)</li>
            <li>I did not get any sort of caffeine buzz from this soap, but it leaves my skin feeling nice and tight and smells really good.  </li>
            <li>leaves you feeling clean and energized</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s as good or better than my other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the soap has a nice scent &amp; lathers up rather nicely.</li>
            <li>, I certainly felt much better after using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it based on good reviews, and I am pretty sensitive to caffeine</li>
            <li>It gives a good tingly feeling that makes me believe that it is actually doing something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use it just for the tightening effect and the \\&quot;super awake\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>Decent, but I&#x27;ve had better caffeinated soaps.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool stuff.</li>
            <li>I took a bath after tonight,a night of skating and woke me RIGHT UP</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell was nice, soap was smooth, and in my mind I could feel a slight buzz from the caffeine.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well</li>
            <li>I used it first thing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how stimulating it is, but the smell is really pleasant</li>
            <li>This soap lathers very well with my shower poof, washes off clean and leaves my skin very soft..</li>
            <li>Bath Buzz Soap, The scent is very pleasnt and wakens you a bit.  </li>
            <li>After thinking about it, I decided that it really didn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>Also, the peppermint smell is nice enough to actually convince me to eventually use it as soap. ^_^</li>
            <li>I abuse caffeine, guarana &amp; ephedra, so just because this isn&#x27;t stimulating for me, doesn&#x27;t mean it isnt stimulating at all.&lt;br /&gt;Caffeine on the skin is good.</li>
            <li>The shipping cost was a lot more than I would usually pay for, but I was placing a large Amazon order and wasn&#x27;t really paying attention to which items had shipping fees</li>
            <li>When I first tried to use this soap i didnt really notice the difference, but after continued use i found that it gives me a tiny jolt in the mornings and at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old, so I couldn&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li>I made sure to use up the entire bar before I came to the conclusion that either it&#x27;s just a plain bar of soap or caffeinated soap has ZERO effect on me.</li>
            <li>The soap is very soft, and is constantlying malleable, and the mint smell barely holds to me skin.</li>
            <li>and now I barely need it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Speaking of a caffeinated buzz, that soap that you gave me for Christmas is crazy good.</li>

            <li> Got Bath Buzz and started useing! Espcially under arms area! It does give one a PERK! GREAT! Dr. Edson Andre&#x27; Johnson D.D. Huntington Beach, Ca.</li>
            <li> caused allergic reaction</li>
            <li> forget about Folgers this is way better than coffee. helps wake you up and get your going. leaves you feeling clean and energized</li>
            <li> I did not get any sort of caffeine buzz from this soap, but it leaves my skin feeling nice and tight and smells really good.  I&#x27;d use it just for the tightening effect and the \\&quot;super awake\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this soap is anymore stimulating than any other soap in the shower. BUT, caffeine on the skin is actually a means of protection from skin cancer. I abuse caffeine, guarana &amp; ephedra, so just because this isn&#x27;t stimulating for me, doesn&#x27;t mean it isnt stimulating at all.&lt;br /&gt;Caffeine on the skin is good. See also:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000V7B8QW Bath Buzz Caffeinated Lotion]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to say it, but I purchased this on eBay. There are more sellers and they lower the prices for competition.</li>
            <li> My family members have been complaining about my caffeine issue, but now I think I found a solution. This product perfectly replaces my daily cups of coffee. If you are looking for an energizing morning, this is your problem solver. I’ve been addicted to coffee my whole life and now I barely need it. It’s like the caffeine without the caffeine but with the caffeine. It makes my hairs stick up every time I use it, while I feel the soap travel through my pores. It gives a good tingly feeling that makes me believe that it is actually doing something. Although sometimes it leaves my skin feeling sticky and rubbery.</li>
            <li> «:::P:::» «:::E:::» «:::R:::» «:::F:::» «:::E:::» «:::C:::» «:::T:::»</li>
            <li> If I could give 0 stars I would, but I guess it gets a star for smelling good. This soap is just regular soap, there is no &amp;#34;effect&amp;#34; from any caffeine that is in it. I bought it based on good reviews, and I am pretty sensitive to caffeine so I thought it might work. Felt nothing, it is just regular soap. I made a homemade coffee-coconut scrub (with ground coffee) after this soap failed my expectations and there is still no &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; effect from caffeine (pretty sure that is all bogus) but it does work well to exfoliate and tighten skin (this soap does not).</li>
            <li> Good, smooth and clear soap.  I&#x27;m old, so I couldn&#x27;t smell&lt;br /&gt;the mint, but it&#x27;s as good or better than my other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;I did go for a walk after showing and cleaned house, did&lt;br /&gt;my laundry and raked the yard!  Hmmmm, I wonder?</li>
            <li> I got this for my brother who might be addicted to caffeine, and this is what he said about it:  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Speaking of a caffeinated buzz, that soap that you gave me for Christmas is crazy good. If I knew absorbing caffeine through your skin was this effective, I would have started bathing in coffee years ago.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t but this product again. The lather is very thin and doesn&#x27;t last, I often have to reat lather my washcloth mid shower. The soap is very soft, and is constantlying malleable, and the mint smell barely holds to me skin.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I saw this concept of caffeinated soap in a airplane magazine flight. I decided to google it when we got home and surprise him with a gift set for V-Day. The soap really suds up, I was impressed. I do think it wakes you up a little as well. I took a shower this morning and then put on the lotion. I feel good as new!</li>
            <li> I have both the soap and the body lotions and I love them. They smell great and very high quality I would love to see more products from this line on amazon. They are so wonderful.</li>
            <li> When I first tried to use this soap i didnt really notice the difference, but after continued use i found that it gives me a tiny jolt in the mornings and at night. I also love the smell. The biggest downside is the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of maybe energizing feeling after using in the shower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin feeling rubbery, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. Maybe it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> Bath Buzz Soap, The scent is very pleasnt and wakens you a bit.  This soap lathers very well with my shower poof, washes off clean and leaves my skin very soft.. As to wakening me up a bit, I dont notice it, but, caffiene on the skin will help tighten the skin and help reduce the look of cellulite. :)</li>
            <li> It felt nice the first time or two used but it did not after that.&lt;br /&gt;The were no visible differences from use, no sensation on application , and did not smell great or make you feel clean. Kind of disappointed with this one, I was not expecting it to work, but was hoping for tthe&lt;br /&gt;effect or caffeine tingling more than 2 uses.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well I can definitely tell when I use it. If I drink a cup of coffee in addition to using the soap I can definitely notice a difference. Pretty cool stuff. I like the scent too.</li>
            <li> I actually haven&#x27;t used the soap as soap because I bought it to analyze in lab.  We were doing an experiment analyzing caffeine content, you see.  So, its actually caffeinated according to my experiment, and it arrived on time for my assignment, which was perfect.  Also, the peppermint smell is nice enough to actually convince me to eventually use it as soap. ^_^</li>
            <li> I suspect this is just a gimmick. I made sure to use up the entire bar before I came to the conclusion that either it&#x27;s just a plain bar of soap or caffeinated soap has ZERO effect on me.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nice soap with great lather and good minty feeling, this is your soap. Just do not expect this to replace your morning coffee...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how stimulating it is, but the smell is really pleasant and I do feel more awake after my shower..it cleanses well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.I took a bath after tonight,a night of skating and woke me RIGHT UP,COFFEE COFFEE  COFEEE COFFEEE</li>
            <li> Decent, but I&#x27;ve had better caffeinated soaps. It IS a gimmick, don&#x27;t buy it thinking that all of a sudden it will jazz you up in your shower. It does tingle a little but that could be the mint too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I enjoyed it and it smells nice and minty and the later was good, so I would recommend anyone who likes a gourmet soap with a little tingle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a review for the product as I bought it for a stocking stuffer, (she seemed to love it though). However, if you do buy this, make sure it is from Chemical Evolutions. Shortly after I had bought the product I noticed that estimated delivery date was the 27th, obviously this wouldn&#x27;t work. I contacted them about my concerns and they let me know that they would take care of me. They upped the shipping and got it here December 24th.... BEAUTIFUL. They even sent a hand written note \\&quot;Hope you got it in time, Happy Holidays from Chemical Evolutions\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was wary that this might be more in the reviewers head than in actual effectiveness.  After thinking about it, I decided that it really didn&#x27;t matter.  Placebo effect or not, I certainly felt much better after using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell was nice, soap was smooth, and in my mind I could feel a slight buzz from the caffeine.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews. My skin does not feel different after I use this soap. I was expecting it to leave a tingling feeling or some evidence of the caffeine or peppermint so I was very disappointed. On the other hand, the soap has a nice scent &amp; lathers up rather nicely. The shipping cost was a lot more than I would usually pay for, but I was placing a large Amazon order and wasn&#x27;t really paying attention to which items had shipping fees so that&#x27;s my fault. Giving the product a 2.5 rating.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife. She loved them. Gave one to another relative as well with same results.  Probably will order again.</li>
            <li> I used it first thing In the morning and felt alert, however I think it was a placebo affect....also the pepperment made my skin tingle and burn, which in its self made me alert. But as soon as the burning and tingling sensation left my alertness went away and I was tired again.</li>
