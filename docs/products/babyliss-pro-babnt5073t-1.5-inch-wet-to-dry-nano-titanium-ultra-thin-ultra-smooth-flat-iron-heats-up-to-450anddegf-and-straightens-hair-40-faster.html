            <li>Excellent product, I recommend it to the whole world and it is much better than was waiting, and the product I come very rapidly to my house..</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as good if you blowdried the hair first.</li>
            <li>it heats quickly, straightens my hair nicely, controls are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>It straightens so easily.  </li>
            <li>but I know that my own hair does not cooperate with heat styling unless the item gets REALLY HOT.</li>
            <li>It came nicely packaged and is exactly as described by the seller.</li>
            <li>it getts very hot but never seems to burn my hair :)</li>
            <li>I received my product in just a few days very happy with it</li>
            <li>With this product you go over the hair once and it it as smooth as can be.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy a cheap one-</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I had my daughter try it too, figuring if hers breaks, this one is so much cheaper and super effective.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived on time and in original packaging.</li>
            <li>It has a long cord which is great.</li>
            <li>It is great for med to long hair.  </li>
            <li>this brand is so worth the money!</li>
            <li>The best flat iron ever  doesn&#x27;t get better than this flat iron, really straightens hair nicely and does a great job even when your hair is wet, Call me a convert</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is true for all the women of my hair type</li>
            <li>I think it has an automatic shut off, which is great since I always forget to turn my other one off.</li>
            <li>The plates are very long and heat up quickly, but as with any straightener or heat styling product always use a heat protectant and you should be good to go.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great after use and I am finished in half the time.  </li>
            <li>Its really too strong for my hair</li>
            <li>So I figured it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It gets super hot; you don&#x27;t want to damage your hair.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is amazing.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>As far as heating, yes it does just fine.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener especially for the price!</li>
            <li>The blue is so shiny and cute.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>but when I put the right setting for my hair type, it stays straight even in humid weather</li>
            <li>I bought this item and actually it was good, but I have a very short hair</li>
            <li>Gets so hot so fast, straightens your hair like nothing else.</li>
            <li>Its fast, extremely hot and there is no pull/tug on your hair because of  the titanium plates.</li>
            <li>Love that you can use it on damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li>I should have gotten either the 1/2&amp;#34; or the 1.&amp;#34; This one (1.5) is rather large.</li>
            <li>The best in wet to dry flat irons!  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t prepared to see that much steam come off my hair</li>
            <li>By itself without a blow dryer  the hair does get straight</li>
            <li>You can change the heat settings from 1-10 and it heats up so fast.</li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t take much to straighten it.</li>
            <li>This was the main reason I purchsed it.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest buying this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but this product was authentic although a little older.  </li>
            <li>The Babyliss Pro Wet to Dry flat iron heats up quickly and is very light!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use it for a few months since I cut my hair pretty short</li>
            <li>I wish I could trade it in and get a new one.</li>
            <li>chi user, I have friends who live by Paul Mitchell</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I love the blue color even though I wanted to get pink.</li>
            <li>Makes every style look professionally done.</li>
            <li>and they are supposed to be professional irons.</li>
            <li>And I can spend less time blow drying first since hair can be damp and this iron does the trick.  </li>
            <li>As far as flat irons go, it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, it&#x27;s just on the pricey side.</li>
            <li>They will let you know right away if it&#x27;s not authentic.</li>
            <li>I had heard both good and bad reviews about this product and decided to give it a shot anyway.</li>

            <li> I wish I could trade it in and get a new one.</li>
            <li> chi user, I have friends who live by Paul Mitchell</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> I love the blue color even though I wanted to get pink.</li>

            <li> They will let you know right away if it&#x27;s not authentic.</li>
            <li> I had heard both good and bad reviews about this product and decided to give it a shot anyway.</li>
            <li> It says &amp;#34;wet to dry&amp;#34; I can only say I have only used it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener in the hopes of smoothing out the little flips that seem to have found new residence in my shortened tresses.</li>
            <li> These flat irons are everything!</li>
            <li> I do have to admit the location of the on/off button makes it kind of impossible to know whether or not you have turned it off during operation.</li>
            <li> and I do not really plan to since I am more of a casual straightener user.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, somewhat coarse hair &amp; this straightener makes it silky &amp; completely straight with one pass.  </li>
            <li> No longer do you need to blow dry your hair and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The cord is long and the fact that the straightener&#x27;s cord connection allows for swivel and thus avoiding dreaded cord coiling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a long time</li>
            <li> My daughter used this on her wet hair at a fairly low temperature and it burnt her hair.</li>
            <li> I used to have long hair.</li>
            <li> looooove the wet to dry feature especially since im a swimmer</li>
            <li> So I decided to look at all the wet to dry flat irons out there and read the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it only a few times, and the coating (blue color) is already chipping..</li>
            <li> We had used a few others and had to go over the same piece of hair countless times and it still was not straight.</li>
            <li> This seems to have done the trick at only half way mark on the heat settings, which was a shock to me.</li>
            <li> Works so well with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> she didnt think she would nbeed the wet dry...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s from wet to dry</li>
            <li> In the past, I only bought the Chi Wet to Dry flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curling and  it is hard to find a product that works.  </li>

            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it, it&#x27;s the best hair straightener she&#x27;s had yet</li>
            <li> A diva&#x27;s must have!!! These flat irons are everything! Gets so hot so fast, straightens your hair like nothing else. Makes every style look professionally done. LOVE  IT!!</li>
            <li> So, I am no leading authority on straighteners but I have used a few in my day. I have Asian hair, but due to an overzealous barber 5-6\\&quot; was sheared off leaving my hair which was almost waist length highly confused and a little below my shoulders. To say the least things have not been working out with layers and shortened hair. I bought this straightener in the hopes of smoothing out the little flips that seem to have found new residence in my shortened tresses. I had heard both good and bad reviews about this product and decided to give it a shot anyway. I don&#x27;t know if this is true for all the women of my hair type but I know that my own hair does not cooperate with heat styling unless the item gets REALLY HOT. This seems to have done the trick at only half way mark on the heat settings, which was a shock to me. It came nicely packaged and is exactly as described by the seller. I had read reviews saying there was a gap between the plates, mine does not have that gap. I do have to admit the location of the on/off button makes it kind of impossible to know whether or not you have turned it off during operation. The cord is long and the fact that the straightener&#x27;s cord connection allows for swivel and thus avoiding dreaded cord coiling. The plates are very long and heat up quickly, but as with any straightener or heat styling product always use a heat protectant and you should be good to go. I have not used this on wet hair and I do not really plan to since I am more of a casual straightener user. However, in the event that I should I will try and update this product review.</li>
            <li> The Babyliss Pro is fantastic - I am a Chi defector and do not regret it at all - works great - heats up fast - fantastic !!</li>
            <li> Best Flat Iron I have ever used!! Works so well with wet or dry hair. Wasn&#x27;t prepared to see that much steam come off my hair so make sure you angle it right so you don&#x27;t burn yourself!! It&#x27;s works amazing thank you!</li>
            <li> Works great...best flatiron I&#x27;ve ever used!! I have wavy hair...straightens my hair with ease.  Would DEFINITELY purchase another Babyliss Pro, if needed, in the future!</li>
            <li> The paint started coming off of it. I wish I could trade it in and get a new one.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and in original packaging. I&#x27;ve used it only a few times, and the coating (blue color) is already chipping.. It has a long cord which is great. I should have gotten either the 1/2&amp;#34; or the 1.&amp;#34; This one (1.5) is rather large. As far as heating, yes it does just fine. I&#x27;m not really impressed though. I&#x27;ve read where some of them have serial#s, mines did not, so I don&#x27;t know if its a knockoff or not. It says &amp;#34;wet to dry&amp;#34; I can only say I have only used it on dry hair. Would I buy again? I would get a smaller size, and if it was cheaper. As far as flat irons go, it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, it&#x27;s just on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> The best feature is the ability to control the temp. This was the main reason I purchsed it. It is light weight and does the job!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I recommend it to the whole world and it is much better than was waiting, and the product I come very rapidly to my house.. I recommend the seller!</li>
            <li> The best in wet to dry flat irons!  I absolutely love this product.  My hair looks great after use and I am finished in half the time.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I wasnt impressed with this product. i read a alot of reviews,and  looked it up on youtube. but once i got the product and actually used it. i wasnt impressed. i dont think it works well on african american hair. will try another brand.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this straightener.  I have long, thick, somewhat coarse hair &amp; this straightener makes it silky &amp; completely straight with one pass.  I was wondering how this price was $40 less than retail.  The only thing I can figure out is that it was made in November of 2012.  I purchased in November of 2013.  I was afraid of getting a knock-off but this product was authentic although a little older.  No difference to me.  It works great.</li>
            <li> i like the product...it heats quickly, straightens my hair nicely, controls are easy to use.  however, it pulls my hair ocassionally, which is why i am only giving it 4stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> In the past, I only bought the Chi Wet to Dry flat iron.  However, between my daughter and myself, 3 of them just stopped working (seemed to be a broken cord).  So I wanted to try another brand.  My daughter got a 1.5 inch Hana which I liked, but when I tried to order one, they were out and asked if I would try the 1 inch instead.  I decided to try it, but it wasn&#x27;t great at straightening (better for curling).  And the one my daughter had was so expensive.  So I decided to look at all the wet to dry flat irons out there and read the reviews.  This Babyliss one had some really great reviews and I couldn&#x27;t beat the price (less than half of what my daughter paid for the Hana).  So I figured it was worth trying.  This iron is just terrific!  It straightens so easily.  And I can spend less time blow drying first since hair can be damp and this iron does the trick.  I loved it so much I went online and bought a second one to have a spare in the house.  I had my daughter try it too, figuring if hers breaks, this one is so much cheaper and super effective.  She thought it did a great job straightening too.  I give this iron 5 stars for both the awesome job it does on my hair as well as the price which is much better than irons that don&#x27;t do as a good a job.</li>
            <li> Works Great! It is great for med to long hair.  My hair is naturally curling and  it is hard to find a product that works.  This is IT!</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist This is this best flatiron ever better the most top name brands I have used. I have been in the business for 26 Years so I have used quite a few.I received my product in just a few days very happy with it and I&#x27;m going to order the 1inch next.</li>
            <li> Great straightener!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a long time chi user, I have friends who live by Paul Mitchell but I love this one most of all!&lt;br /&gt;And it was recommended by a hair dresser</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I bought it for my mom who has very thick and coarse hair with a slight wave. We had used a few others and had to go over the same piece of hair countless times and it still was not straight. With this product you go over the hair once and it it as smooth as can be. I knew I would be impressed but had no idea this impressed. I would highly suggest buying this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for personal use of this product as it was bought as a gift but the receiver is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> she didnt think she would nbeed the wet dry...but she has used it many time and is extremely happy with it!</li>
            <li> My daughter used this on her wet hair at a fairly low temperature and it burnt her hair. We could actually smell her hair burning!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best straightening iron I have ever owned.  In less than 10 minutes I walk out of the house looking like I spent an hour on my hair.</li>
            <li> Happy Customer Item just like discribed, My girlfriend loves It</li>
            <li> When you hear the work Babyliss, you know you have a great product before you. This flat iron is amazing. It increases the process by 60% in speed. That is amazing. Less heat damage to the hair. Clients are happy.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with this flat iron that I bought for my granddaughters. I bought two and they are supposed to be professional irons. I have been a Spa owner and stylist for 39 years and these do not close all the way on the hair and the hair catches in them. I returned both.</li>
            <li> Love it.  My only negative comment is that it does not have an automatic shut off.  While it is good to unplug, there may be that one moment when you are rushing and forget.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love that you can use it on damp or dry hair. I only have to slide it down my hair once compared to my old straightener where I had to run it back over a few times which is so unhealthy to your hair! So I&#x27;m a believer and  definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this bad boy. I was skeptical at first because i have really thick curly hair. But, this baby straightened it in a jiffy. It no longer takes me close to two hours to straighten my hair. I can do it in 30 minutes. Its fast, extremely hot and there is no pull/tug on your hair because of  the titanium plates. Its great. Just be sure to use a heat protectant on your hair to protect your ends. It gets super hot; you don&#x27;t want to damage your hair.</li>
            <li> The Babyliss Pro Wet to Dry flat iron heats up quickly and is very light! Only requires one sweep.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> The baby bliss is very light weight!!! It also straightens your hair with salon quality. This is definitely a must have!!!!</li>
            <li> The best flat iron ever  doesn&#x27;t get better than this flat iron, really straightens hair nicely and does a great job even when your hair is wet, Call me a convert</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy a cheap one- this brand is so worth the money!</li>
            <li> it does its job. By itself without a blow dryer  the hair does get straight but it&#x27;s not as good if you blowdried the hair first. It&#x27;s from wet to dry but I still would rather not do it like that.</li>
            <li> It is really good! I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this item and actually it was good, but I have a very short hair and I was getting uncomfortable to use it because of its plate. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> withstands salon abuse and keep going. would recommend this to everyone. No issues</li>
            <li> I love this straightener especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightener. I haven&#x27;t been able to use it for a few months since I cut my hair pretty short and it&#x27;s too thick but once my hair grows back out I will be using it again! I read that this is one of the best straighteners out there right now for the price which is why I purchased it. I think it has an automatic shut off, which is great since I always forget to turn my other one off. I love the blue color even though I wanted to get pink. The blue is so shiny and cute. You can change the heat settings from 1-10 and it heats up so fast. I always turn it on to 10 and it seems like I can straighten my hair in about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Over priced but my daughter loves them</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. Worth every penny.  No longer do you need to blow dry your hair and flat iron.  I used to have long hair. Now I have mid length hair.  It takes about 10 minutes or so and I&#x27;m out the door. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It used to take me over an hour to straighten my hair. Now it takes 10 minutes! I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> stopped working within 2 months</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether the Amazon warehouse that also mails other vendors products accidentally shipped the knockoff from a vendor. The fact remains I bought this from Amazon and I&#x27;m very disappointed. The only way to tell definitively if you have bought a knockoff is to call the mfg.at 1-800-3266247 and give them your serial #. It&#x27;s located on the outside of the metal prong that plugs into the wall outlet. They will let you know right away if it&#x27;s not authentic.</li>
            <li> I love my hair straightener! Its really too strong for my hair but when I put the right setting for my hair type, it stays straight even in humid weather I live in Florida so what does that tell you. I have very fine hair and it really doesn&#x27;t take much to straighten it. But I would recommend to still use a heat protector no matter what. However, it is a great hair straightener and I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> The best straightener</li>
            <li> I love this straightner alot! it getts very hot but never seems to burn my hair :) looooove the wet to dry feature especially since im a swimmer</li>
