            <li>Great use for oily skin and acne</li>
            <li>This is a good cleansing gel for combination skin.</li>
            <li>All good with the product.</li>
            <li>I use it with my electric face brush and it feels really good.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good</li>
            <li>Works perfectly if you use it right</li>
            <li>i was so excited because its really good...</li>
            <li>I love this facesoap.</li>
            <li>I prefer the La Roche-Posay Effaclar better.</li>
            <li>The whole Sebium series is great.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>If you have oily &amp; sensitive skin or rosacea, this is a great alternative to the CeraVe&#x27;s &amp; Cetaphil&#x27;s of the world</li>
            <li>Great cleanser for this aging woman who used to have combination skin and acne as a young girl.  </li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>Easy.  </li>
            <li>with the original one just ones...</li>
            <li>With that i have to clean up my face three times</li>
            <li>so i can feel that it&#x27;s clean...</li>
            <li>and i must say it didnt clean well</li>
            <li>However, it is too mild for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I didnt really feel like it was original</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a very very neutral face cleanser.</li>
            <li>it barely foams , even though i love the company so much</li>
            <li>so I was only able to order it online.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li>I had the first breakouts I&#x27;ve had in years, thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic facial cleanser!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many other products that have either not worked or over did it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin with that deep clean feeling.</li>
            <li>When I try it i realize that its a different product, the same name and details but not even close to the original one...</li>
            <li>Although it says oil skin and normal if you have dry skin is still gentle with you.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the skin, yet cleanses the pores deeply and when used daily</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t used any acne cream in years just by using this cleanser every night or every other night depending on how dry your skin gets, totally worth it!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve never like the smell, or non/smell of either product); yes a little pricey but a much nicer experience than drug store varienties (altho you can find this in some drug stores).</li>

            <li> I had the first breakouts I&#x27;ve had in years, thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I love this facesoap. I have problematic skin, and this soap does not hurt when it gets in to my eyes, it does an average job at removing makeup but it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout... it&#x27;s just a very very neutral face cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have oily/sensitive skin.  This product didnâ€™t break me out and the foam was generous.  However, it is too mild for my skin.  I prefer the La Roche-Posay Effaclar better.</li>
            <li> I was buying this product from europe and when i find it in amazon i was so excited because its really good... When I try it i realize that its a different product, the same name and details but not even close to the original one... With that i have to clean up my face three times so i can feel that it&#x27;s clean...with the original one just ones... Its away much different. Sorry for girls who do make up every day thats product it&#x27;s not working....</li>
            <li> Fantastic facial cleanser! Very gentle on the skin, yet cleanses the pores deeply and when used daily keeps the skin clear and less oily overall. The whole Sebium series is great.</li>
            <li> If you have oily &amp; sensitive skin or rosacea, this is a great alternative to the CeraVe&#x27;s &amp; Cetaphil&#x27;s of the world (I&#x27;ve never like the smell, or non/smell of either product); yes a little pricey but a much nicer experience than drug store varienties (altho you can find this in some drug stores). Treat yourself!</li>
            <li> Best ever! All there products bu the way!</li>
            <li> I didnt really feel like it was original i have used bioderma from a chain drug store in canada since it&#x27;s not available in the US and i must say it didnt clean well it barely foams , even though i love the company so much but i dont think im buying this from amazon again .</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser for acne. Although it says oil skin and normal if you have dry skin is still gentle with you. It is just great!</li>
            <li> This is a good cleansing gel for combination skin. But has a tendency to dry out my face.</li>
            <li> Great use for oily skin and acne</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve used so many other products that have either not worked or over did it. You can&#x27;t find this product in the states so I was only able to order it online. I will definitely be purchasing more of this. I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks and I can already tell it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> All good with the product. Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I initially thought this would work on my oily skin, but after a month I noticed break outs. It seemed like it cleaned my skin, but I also think it broke me out...I tried :-(  Didn&#x27;t work for me...hopefully I can give it away, as it&#x27;s too late to return.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser for this aging woman who used to have combination skin and acne as a young girl.  I use it with my electric face brush and it feels really good.  Easy.  My husband can use it as well for shaving.  Not bad!</li>
            <li> This product will definitely be repurchased. It smells so good but it is also an awesome cleanser. It leaves your skin with that deep clean feeling. I am in love with this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pharmacist and I recommend this gel to all my patients. Works perfectly if you use it right, I haven&#x27;t used any acne cream in years just by using this cleanser every night or every other night depending on how dry your skin gets, totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Marvelous delivery and excellent oroduct</li>
