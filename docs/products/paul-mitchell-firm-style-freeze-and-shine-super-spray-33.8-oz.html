            <li>This is the best hair spray - especially for fine hair - holds well but isn&#x27;t &#x27;hard&#x27; or sticky.  </li>
            <li>Good to find it a little cheaper than what the beauty and retail shops sale for.  </li>
            <li>Lasts quite a while, though exactly</li>
            <li>but this refill didn&#x27;t seem quite as &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; as the smaller off-the-shelf variety sold at most stores like Target, Walmart, etc.  </li>
            <li>It is a better deal to buy and refill than what he was paying for the single bottles at the salon.</li>

            <li>It leaves no residue once brushed out, If her hair gets wet from rain it doesn&#x27;t get gummy like so many other sprays.</li>

            <li> Product took a lot longer to deliver than promised but the worst part was that about 1/3 of the product had leaked out of the top cap and saturated the cardboard box.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but find it hard to get around here for some reason so that is why I got it online.  </li>

            <li> This is the only hair care product the hubby cannot do without. It is a better deal to buy and refill than what he was paying for the single bottles at the salon. Lasts quite a while, though exactly how long I couldn&#x27;t say. Almost a year, since he has a short doo.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair care products I have used.  Always does what is advertised.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for more years than I care to remember.  It just works, period.  It&#x27;s not overly sticky, you can layer it and still brush it out, and, last but for me certainly not least, it doesn&#x27;t SMELL.  I hate hair products whose fragrances are so strong that they are all you can smell all day long and totally interfere with any other fragrance you wear.  This one never has.  I highly recommend this - and I&#x27;m someone who loves doing my hair in every imaginable hairstyle. It works for everything.</li>
            <li> Very subjective but this refill didn&#x27;t seem quite as &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; as the smaller off-the-shelf variety sold at most stores like Target, Walmart, etc.  However, still does the job and much lass expensive.</li>

            <li> Would not use anything but Paul Mitchell spray on my hair!  Cheaper to buy by this size and refill the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> Product took a lot longer to deliver than promised but the worst part was that about 1/3 of the product had leaked out of the top cap and saturated the cardboard box.  The cap was loose so I guess that&#x27;s what happened.  Better packaging is needed by this vendor.  I thought about sending it back but didn&#x27;t want to hastle with getting it repackaged and I needed (wanted) what was left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this non-aerosol finishing spray.  Just a couple of sprays &amp; it holds without stiffness.  Use this to refill the pump sprayer for excellent savings.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair in place without being stiff or sticky.  Washes out easily leaving no residue.  This is for a pump spray, not an aerosol, so no harm to the ozone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this large bottle and refill a pump spray bottle for best value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but find it hard to get around here for some reason so that is why I got it online.  It is just perfect for my thinning hair because it keeps it in place for the whole day.</li>
            <li> I always use Paul Mitchell products and especially the freeze and shine.  Tried to get it cheaper on amazon but this product is not like the others I have used the scent is even different.</li>
            <li> Great product and pleasant scent.  For someone with fine and completely unmanageable hair, it&#x27;s the ONLY product that holds my hair in place without looking like I use a ton of product.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair spray - especially for fine hair - holds well but isn&#x27;t &#x27;hard&#x27; or sticky.

            <li> Been using this product since it came on the market. Its light, not sticky and brushes out if desired.&lt;br /&gt;What more can a girl ask for? Cannot find it in my area so I order it from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, used this for years, best hairspray I have found that leave hair feeling soft and not sticky, holds up all day and night</li>
            <li> Great hair control with soft feeling. Makes hair shine.</li>
