            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s color when a top cot is applied.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy doing my nails now!</li>
            <li>Love all the variety.</li>
            <li>Was able to create a beatific design with them.</li>
            <li>but I love the variety.</li>
            <li>but I love to at around with my friend&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love love the package everything is fabulous..but the tape.</li>
            <li>also there isnt as many gems as you think it says 1,200</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Everything is how I expected it to be and thats wonderful.</li>
            <li>3 stripper brushes are soft and great quality.</li>
            <li>Thank you for shipping it so fast and the good quality of your items.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>but I assume they will work just fine.</li>
            <li>and it works fine.</li>
            <li>Came quick too!</li>
            <li>Very nice kit, have a lot more items that I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go ahead and buy it anyway if you are patient and looking for making fun designs on your nails!</li>
            <li>having fun with my nail design tools!</li>
            <li>Fun to play around with!</li>
            <li>I do NOT have a very steady hand, so the longer bristle brushes work a lot better for me.</li>
            <li>Good quality, they last.</li>
            <li>So if you can wait not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li>I use the dotting tools the most, I love the different sizes.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>everything came as exact!</li>
            <li>So much for so cheap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love it thanks so much</li>
            <li>All in all it seems like it&#x27;s worth it based on what you get.</li>
            <li>When you do use it, rip it off right away.</li>
            <li>I bought this for someone as part of an xmas gift and the shipping took forever (like a month, kind of expected though).</li>
            <li>And yes the top coat is necessary otherwise the tape won&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li>I had none of these items and individually it would have cost a lot more to acquire them.</li>
            <li>The dotting tools, gems, and tape all appear to be the same ones I could buy at Sally&#x27;s for a lot more.</li>
            <li>So many different things in this pack.</li>
            <li>and you get so much!</li>
            <li>Once or was finally received, I love it.</li>
            <li>Comes exactly as in picture</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Other than that, Love it!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Make sure your nails are almost completely dry before using the tape or you&#x27;ll rip off the polish.</li>
            <li>The price was awesome, but waiting this long for delivery was ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I received my order really fast, I got it January 22nd.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much I rec&#x27;d.  </li>
            <li>Wow wow wow as in pictures even better</li>
            <li>Good quality product but shipping was slow.</li>
            <li>the tools are great, however their was dirt in the pearls with glitter stars and the tape was somewhat damaged as a few where wet, I didnt expect much from this</li>
            <li>Love everything but the pearls advertised were missing from this set</li>
            <li>I think the only thing that makes it worth it is the tools alone.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, everything was new and just like the picture.</li>
            <li>I think its old or something because it does not stick whatsoever.</li>
            <li>4 stars because the jewels was a little smaller then expected but overall really good setüëç</li>
            <li>its jus bot worth it only because it took 2 in a half months to arrive and with it did i got everything but the dotting tools and i contact the seller about this</li>
            <li>Although the shipping is slow, the product is worth the wait!</li>

            <li> its jus bot worth it only because it took 2 in a half months to arrive and with it did i got everything but the dotting tools and i contact the seller about this</li>
            <li> Although the shipping is slow, the product is worth the wait!</li>
            <li> The tape is much smaller than expected, and takes a bit of practice to work with, but it came weeks before the date it said it would come so that gives it 5 stars</li>
            <li> but the envelope is hard to open but as a plus it came 3 weeks early!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait until your polish starts to dry.</li>
            <li> Everything that is in the package (5 dotting tools, three brushes, nail art) all are exactly as described and pictured except when mine arrived one of the brushes was broken (hence the 3 stars and not 4).</li>
            <li> just as how i expected.</li>
            <li> It came arrived in 2 weeks, which was quicker than the expected time.</li>
            <li> And arrived even before expected time</li>
            <li> and I received it on 12/24/14 when the Expected delivery: Tuesday, January 6, 2015 - Thursday, January 22, 2015 by 8pm</li>
            <li> The silver part with the brush broke off from the black handle.</li>
            <li> so I kept a few for myself.</li>
            <li> ;  the striping brushes are a little small for me.  </li>
            <li> Thinner than what i expected and very hard to use.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way and messed up my nails.</li>
            <li> If I had one complaint...</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!!</li>
            <li> True, it did come 2 days into the estimated time frame but waiting a month was terrible.</li>
            <li> One con was that one brush came broken.</li>
            <li> Also because it&#x27;s so thin</li>
            <li> it took awhile to do one nail because lining it up was difficult.</li>

            <li> I love my product! everything came as exact! Buy it it&#x27;s worth the money. 4 stars because the jewels was a little smaller then expected but overall really good setüëçüèº</li>
            <li> Good stuff for a good price!</li>
            <li> came with everything that was in the picture as promised. i love it and can&#x27;t wait to try everything!  Just have to figure out how to get the jewels to actually stick and stay on  **edit;  the striping brushes are a little small for me.  I do NOT have a very steady hand, so the longer bristle brushes work a lot better for me.</li>
            <li> I love it thanks so much</li>
            <li> This was a great buy for the price! i Love this set!</li>
            <li> Daughter is happy with this item.</li>
            <li> everything as described and none of my nail tapes were repeats! love all of it can&#x27;t complain and came very quickly and well packaged!</li>
            <li> Arrived within the time frame given and in good condition. Although the shipping is slow, the product is worth the wait! So many ribbon colors and gems!  Very happy.</li>
            <li> Great products, but delivery did take a while</li>
            <li> Everything that is in the package (5 dotting tools, three brushes, nail art) all are exactly as described and pictured except when mine arrived one of the brushes was broken (hence the 3 stars and not 4). The silver part with the brush broke off from the black handle. I haven&#x27;t used any of the tools yet so I can&#x27;t speak to that but I assume they will work just fine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful service! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I received my order really fast, I got it January 22nd. I got all the materials and they were in great shape and I just love them. Thank you for shipping it so fast and the good quality of your items.</li>
            <li> Lots of goodies. Makes it so you can do all sorts of nail art designs. Good quality, they last.</li>
            <li> 4 star because the brushes aren&#x27;t glued all the way. I had to reglue the tops.</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone as part of an xmas gift and the shipping took forever (like a month, kind of expected though). All in all it seems like it&#x27;s worth it based on what you get. There were so many of those striper tape things so I kept a few for myself. One con was that one brush came broken. I&#x27;d go ahead and buy it anyway if you are patient and looking for making fun designs on your nails!</li>
            <li> So much for so cheap. Came quick too!</li>
            <li> Love this item. Totally an amazing buy. If I had one complaint...and it could be me (operater error)...would be that the tape looses it&#x27;s color when a top cot is applied. And yes the top coat is necessary otherwise the tape won&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> Nice product for price</li>
            <li> I received muy stuff thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all good. Would definitely buy again. But I don&#x27;t think I will ever run out of striping tape lol</li>
            <li> Good variety.  I can&#x27;t believe how much I rec&#x27;d.  A good value.</li>
            <li> The tape is much smaller than expected, and takes a bit of practice to work with, but it came weeks before the date it said it would come so that gives it 5 stars</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy doing my nails now! Love this set!</li>
            <li> Very nice kit, have a lot more items that I expected. good quality.</li>
            <li> Great nail art set! I use the dotting tools the most, I love the different sizes. Great for all kinds of art!</li>
            <li> for the price,everything is said it would be cant complain,haven&#x27;t used the bedazzled pieces yet but everything else is solid.  Only thing I took away a star for was shipping time,took three weeks over the longest estimated date. So if you can wait not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased on Jun 02 and it finally arrived on Jun 17. Everything which was listed came with no damages and I can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li> Very nice nail art kit. Arrived on time, everything was new and just like the picture. I will definately  buy from them again</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great for the price but its jus bot worth it only because it took 2 in a half months to arrive and with it did i got everything but the dotting tools and i contact the seller about this and i got no reply .. Dont waste your money!! If i can give this no star trust i would</li>
            <li> Love this set! One of the brushes tops came off, but just glued it back on and it works fine. Love all the variety.</li>
            <li> just as how i expected. having fun with my nail design tools!</li>
            <li> Love everything but the pearls advertised were missing from this set</li>
            <li> I bought for my wife and she likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> Luv the dotting tools the best. But it&#x27;s an awesome deal</li>
            <li> Great starter set! I had none of these items and individually it would have cost a lot more to acquire them. The dotting tools, gems, and tape all appear to be the same ones I could buy at Sally&#x27;s for a lot more.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the package and already tested ‚ò∫Ô∏è</li>
            <li> This was a great buy all the stuff u need to diy your nails at a great price and got then within two weeks</li>
            <li> Great buy, even better price!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and the dotter! Was able to create a beatific design with them. Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the tape but I love the variety.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my order</li>
            <li> It came arrived in 2 weeks, which was quicker than the expected time. It has everything included and seems to be of great quality.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome deal! Arrived quickly. Will get a lot of beautiful manicures out of this set. So glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> Very nice. Will order from this Seller again.</li>
            <li> very good product. strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> So many different things in this pack. I don&#x27;t do my nails often but I love to at around with my friend&#x27;s nails. All the tools in this pack are on the cheap side but for just messing around is perfect.</li>
            <li> Wow wow wow as in pictures even better I love it so you ladies order its a must have for nail doers. And arrived even before expected time</li>
            <li> I love it. True, it did come 2 days into the estimated time frame but waiting a month was terrible. Everything is how I expected it to be and thats wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love love the package everything is fabulous..but the tape. I think its old or something because it does not stick whatsoever. And ive tried a bunch of the rolls that came. One of them was completely see through as if it had been wet and it stuck to the package. Kinda bummed because i was looking forward to using them.</li>
            <li> Everything was just perfect</li>
            <li> the tools are great, however their was dirt in the pearls with glitter stars and the tape was somewhat damaged as a few where wet, I didnt expect much from this also there isnt as many gems as you think it says 1,200 but their isnt even 700... and yes I counted... I think the only thing that makes it worth it is the tools alone.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to receive these items, i used them the minute i got them!!! super happy with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Everything arrived! Nice things!</li>
            <li> Great set, great price, thank you</li>
            <li> Amazing Deal for the price and you get so much!</li>
            <li> Good quality product but shipping was slow. If you don&#x27;t mind the wait, the nail kit is a great addition to your nail supplies. The brushes are great for detail work and the nail tape comes in a great variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Great product I recomend it</li>
            <li> I will totally buy again. Loved it</li>
            <li> This took a month to get to me instead of 5-7 business days. Once or was finally received, I love it. It has everything included and seems to be of good quality. The price was awesome, but waiting this long for delivery was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this and I received it on 12/24/14 when the Expected delivery: Tuesday, January 6, 2015 - Thursday, January 22, 2015 by 8pm</li>
            <li> Multi color rhinestone pack. Different sized white pearl pack. Silver rhinestone pack. 14 solid color tape rolls. 14 holographic color tape rolls. 2 multi color stripped rolls. Dotters are 10 different sizes. 3 stripper brushes are soft and great quality.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the product, so many robins!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful every bring is there and nicely packaged a great gift and a great buy! Definitely a steal. Comes exactly as in picture but the envelope is hard to open but as a plus it came 3 weeks early!</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured. Every thing works great!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Great quality products. Fun to play around with! Excellent bang for your buck. Shipping took a while. I forgot I ordered it so when I got it, it was like a present! :) but I was in no hurry so it didn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
            <li> Love this kit! The dotting pens are great, the rhinestones, great! The brushes, great!! The striping tape, not so great. It was very, very thin. Thinner than what i expected and very hard to use. Also because it&#x27;s so thin it took awhile to do one nail because lining it up was difficult. Make sure your nails are almost completely dry before using the tape or you&#x27;ll rip off the polish. When you do use it, rip it off right away. Don&#x27;t wait until your polish starts to dry. I learned the hard way and messed up my nails. I ordered this product on January 28th and received it on March 2nd. So anticipate waiting awhile. Other than that, Love it!</li>
            <li> It came WAY before delivery time, and it was really great! All of it works well and is TOTALLY worth the cost!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Great Value.</li>
            <li> I absoluty love these !!!!</li>
            <li> Items received as described.  It dies what it is supposed to do</li>
