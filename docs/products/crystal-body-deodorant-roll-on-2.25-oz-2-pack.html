            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I like when a product surprises me and does more than it says.  </li>
            <li>but I find it breaks out of its packaging really easily</li>
            <li>you have a tendency towards developing strong body odors</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest.</li>
            <li>It works fine for me and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand&#x27;s original crystal version</li>
            <li>I had tried making my own natural deodorant and was not liking the ones I made.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>but luckily it dries up quickly</li>
            <li>Not as effective as the stick from the same brand.</li>
            <li>My main concerns about deodorants are parabens, aluminum, and strong</li>
            <li>It drys quickly and really</li>
            <li>I also like the price here on Amazon as it was better than our local health food store or the mall.</li>
            <li>THANKS, KENNY K.</li>

            <li>Feels so much better than heavy scented or sticky deodorants.</li>
            <li>Chemical free and long lasting.</li>
            <li>NO HARSH CHEMICALS.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately I feel the stick is actually more convenient because I only use it every other day whereas I use this twice a day with less results.</li>
            <li>Other than that I highly recommend this deodorant.</li>

            <li> , really works.  </li>

            <li> Other than that I highly recommend this deodorant.</li>
            <li> But overall I like what ingredients are in it and how dry I stay.</li>
            <li> No more stains on my clothes from the product and no harsh metals entering my body!!  </li>
            <li> It also eliminates white marks that other deodorants leave on dark clothing and it eliminates the yellow stains on white clothing.</li>
            <li> It also takes quite awhile to dry</li>
            <li> Had been using the stone, and w/the roll on liquid we don&#x27;t have to get our hands wet each time.  </li>
            <li> I have read some of the other reviews on this, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> Even though it goes on very wet, it is not like it is dripping down your arm.  </li>
            <li> It completely eliminates odor, but it does not clog up the pores with unhealthy aluminum.  </li>
            <li> I had a little trouble getting used to the wet feeling when I applied this.</li>
            <li> A little sticky maybe, but still works and is safer than others.</li>
            <li> you have a tendency to perspire heavily, this product won&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> This product works for people who do not perspire heavily and who are seeking alternatives to deodorant.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> and my spits are dried out anymore from using products like Secret Degree or Sauce etc</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>

            <li> Loveable love this stuff and how it works it took a while for my body to adjust but now it works well and my spits are dried out anymore from using products like Secret Degree or Sauce etc</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to keep reapplying this stuff throughout the day to actually do anything. It also takes quite awhile to dry</li>
            <li> Great for between the toes too. Cures athlete&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  WORKS WELL. NO STINK. NO HARSH CHEMICALS.  THANKS, KENNY K.</li>
            <li> This is the best deoderanut ive ever bought. Great because it is actually good for you!</li>
            <li> Not as effective as the stick from the same brand. Ultimately I feel the stick is actually more convenient because I only use it every other day whereas I use this twice a day with less results.</li>
            <li> Love this. I had tried making my own natural deodorant and was not liking the ones I made. I had a little trouble getting used to the wet feeling when I applied this. But overall I like what ingredients are in it and how dry I stay.</li>
            <li> Great producto, not sticky at all, doesn&#x27;t make you feel wet, great protection and safe to use!!!! thank youuuuu!!!!!!! i definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s great! Anti-perspirant was staining my shirts and leaving a smell...even after washes. This Crystal product doesn&#x27;t do that to my shirts, and still works great as a deodorant. It&#x27;s not antiperspirant, but I&#x27;m ok without that.</li>
            <li> we really like this. Had been using the stone, and w/the roll on liquid we don&#x27;t have to get our hands wet each time.  Totally deodorizes, but of course it&#x27;s not an anti perspirent, so we still sweat</li>
            <li> Awful! Does not work at all. Might as well just wash your armpits with soap and water and keep your fingers crossed. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have read some of the other reviews on this, but it works for me. I cannot use the commercial stuff with aluminum in it and I don&#x27;t need anti-perspirant so this really works for me. I also like the price here on Amazon as it was better than our local health food store or the mall. Thanx</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. No breast cancer for this girl. Works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 5 years since I&#x27;ve used regular deodorant. My main concerns about deodorants are parabens, aluminum, and strong fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced deodorant with a crystal body deodorant roll-on. I also use the body stick. I decided to try the roll-on since I was very happy with the crystal stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on clear.&lt;br /&gt;Really does control odor.&lt;br /&gt;Does not contain parabens or aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;Does not stain clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;If you have a tendency to perspire heavily, this product won&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a tendency towards developing strong body odors this product may not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I use this product again? Yes this will continue to be my product of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who should use this product? This product works for people who do not perspire heavily and who are seeking alternatives to deodorant.</li>
            <li> Great product. Chemical free and long lasting. Feels so much better than heavy scented or sticky deodorants.</li>
            <li> I like it, I can stay stink free and dry all day and night. I gave one to my daughter n law and she said it worked for about a week.</li>
            <li> eodorant and it works for me. It gives me the protection I desire. However I did not get mine on amazon simply because it cost a fortune. I only paid $2.79 on Puritan. Other than that I highly recommend this deodorant. I can but thee at the price listed here</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for years.  It completely eliminates odor, but it does not clog up the pores with unhealthy aluminum.  It also eliminates white marks that other deodorants leave on dark clothing and it eliminates the yellow stains on white clothing.</li>
            <li> Advertised as 2-pack but only received 1. Had to return.</li>
            <li> Very good product..I strongly suggest.</li>
            <li> this is not for heavy sweaters and more for the light non physical person and the thing leaks but luckily it dries up quickly</li>
            <li> Like it!  Does the job without any irritation!  A little sticky maybe, but still works and is safer than others.</li>
            <li> We only use natural deodorant and this is our favorite one yet. I&#x27;ve used this brand&#x27;s original crystal version but I find it breaks out of its packaging really easily so I switched to this roll on version which works just as good.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Even though it goes on very wet, it is not like it is dripping down your arm.  It drys quickly and really, really works.  I am amazed.  No more stains on my clothes from the product and no harsh metals entering my body!!  I don&#x27;t detect any body odor when using this product; something I was not expecting.  I like when a product surprises me and does more than it says.  I&#x27;ve recommended this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is getting more difficult to find in local stores.  It works fine for me and have been using it for years.  Nothing sticky about it, nor does it leave a residue on your clothes.  Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> great product and great service!</li>
