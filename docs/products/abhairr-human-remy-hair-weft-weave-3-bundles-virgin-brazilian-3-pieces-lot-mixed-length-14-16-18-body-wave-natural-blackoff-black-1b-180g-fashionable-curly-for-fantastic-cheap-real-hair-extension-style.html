            <li>i love the hair</li>
            <li>Ok hair for the price</li>
            <li>the hair felt amazing, i was like is this a cheap hair or what???</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like 8, 10, 12 inches.</li>
            <li>the hair tangle a lot it was ok</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere else and spend more money because there is no point.  </li>
            <li>I brought this hair a month ago .. &amp; just ordered more today ..</li>
            <li>it was good for a quick cheap hairdo</li>
            <li>hair is kind of cool.</li>
            <li>but if your looking for something long term then I would tell you to do more research!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The hair is really soft, and it holds curls beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to need to leave out most of my real hair out to make it look good.</li>
            <li>Very full</li>
            <li>I Like these extensions a lot especially for this price, it is a really good deal!  </li>
            <li>This was so easy to put in.</li>
            <li>very quick shipping as well.</li>
            <li>Nice when you first install, But</li>
            <li>Used it for a sew in and it seemed fine.</li>
            <li>good thing is that it came super fast</li>
            <li>A bit light in weight needed another bundle and there were a bit of streaks in it..........</li>
            <li>The hair is smooth for now..</li>
            <li>It was good, but you can tell when it gets old.</li>
            <li>This is good hair, matched my natural hair</li>
            <li>Iam very disatisfied, It didnt met my expectations!!!</li>
            <li>i searched around for days r&#x3D;trying to find cheap but some what of a good quality hair that can maybe last two to four weeks without looking a mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the hair is good quality for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t installed yet but it looks as if its the right size!</li>
            <li>The hair came WAY sooner than I expected, which was great.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty good hair so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, and soft that&#x27;s the good thing, it feels like real hair.</li>
            <li>For it to have a full look</li>
            <li>it was good however, there was some red strings.</li>
            <li>It should last a month or two if you take extremely good care of it.</li>
            <li>but the hair is manageable and is only good for two weeks</li>
            <li>Not bulky but its good quanlity am yet to have it dyed..if you can add alittle bulkiness and just make it a few more certimeters longer</li>
            <li>i think next time i&#x27;ll hv to purchase more bundles if i&#x27;ll purchase hair to this seller again,and it wass ok for the price,very cheap.over all i satisfy with the product</li>
            <li>The hair seems to be very pretty at first and they were full bundles.but</li>
            <li>The Hair Is Amazing &#x27; 3 Bundles Was Enough</li>
            <li>but nothing to be turned off about so far I&#x27;m not in love with this hair</li>
            <li>this wasn&#x27;t worth 70 bucks</li>
            <li>I received this hair today when I took it out of the package right out the bat</li>
            <li>came really quickly, nice and soft, shedding, no tangling, but its kind of thin, get more than three</li>
            <li>The lengths really didn&#x27;t look true either although it is a wave pattern.</li>
            <li>far.bt hey big head people do not purchase this product it wont fit your head unless u hv a 5 bundles.i had to make a way to make it fit mine.</li>
            <li>Totally amazing coming from someone who has bought the expensive kind and this kind I would totally buy again</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s quality of hair is ten times better to me then when i have purchased hair from stores.</li>
            <li>Ok so I got my hair and the length of this hair is very short when its curly and when you straighten it you will start to see the length that you asked for.</li>
            <li>washed the hair first before installing it and it lost the curls</li>
            <li>I received it within two days of ordering and I must say, it&#x27;s what exactly what I played for.</li>
            <li>Wen I first got it had</li>
            <li>1416 18 is pretty long but the hair is good and it soft.</li>
            <li>The texture of this hair is very soft and light weight and blended very well with my hair.</li>
            <li>It was installed and as I stated earlier it&#x27;s soft and nice to play with.</li>
            <li>Spend double and get the good stuff or send it back like I should&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li>Hair seems soft true to length.</li>
            <li>Hair receive very fast more faster than what I expected.</li>
            <li>This hair is very high quality.</li>
            <li>I used clips to attach when getting ready to go out this weekend.</li>
            <li>but if you want good quality hair next time i would spend a few dollars more on different hair</li>
            <li>I stacked it and made halo extensions with it, but since it&#x27;s wefted very well you could probably do anything with it - sew in, clips, even diy u or i tip extensions.  </li>
            <li>It straightens really well</li>
            <li>and since my hair is that awkward texture between wavy and straight, if I run my straighter through the extensions a few times it&#x27;s a perfect match to my own hair.</li>
            <li>3 bundles did my whole head</li>
            <li>üòçüòçüòç bundles a bit thin but hair is great</li>
            <li>it&#x27; really.</li>
            <li>i was very dissapointed</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t hold a curl really nappy</li>
            <li>I have all 3 bundles installed and the hair just isn&#x27;t very full/thick like I&#x27;m used to .</li>
            <li>Item came as described with fast shipping...</li>
            <li>thanks again</li>
            <li>/&gt;it holds the curls very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it really didn&#x27;t workout for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li>And Mine Lost Its Luster Fast.</li>
            <li>pack hair smells the bundles were light not enough hair in the bundles and once you shampoo the hair</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more in the near future.</li>
            <li>but I would not recommend this for a full full sew in because the bundles are definitely small and not enough if your the type of person who loves super full hair which would be me</li>
            <li>hair came super fast, packaging was regular.</li>
            <li>Also I dont trust and believe it was a true 18 inches as the longest length, the bundles seems short</li>
            <li>and if i didnt have a closure that i bought separately would not have been enough to do a full head.</li>
            <li>however you&#x27;ll need to have 2-3 orders to have enough to do a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>and I definitely like my hair to be full</li>
            <li>a nice wave bundles was a lil small does not shed.</li>
            <li>When I first received the hair it was soft and did not have a smell</li>
            <li>But overall not bad for the price</li>
            <li>The disadvantage is it sheds alot in the beginning, and the edged are not full, very light</li>
            <li>The hair looked more brown than black or even off blk.</li>
            <li>; is more like 12&amp;#34; or less the 16&amp;#34; Is 14&amp;#34; or less and the 18&amp;#34; is most defiantly not 18&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>so if you do get this hair use it for short term purposes like quick weaves</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still pretty, feels soft and natural.</li>
            <li>it was a nice thickness &amp; had a little left</li>
            <li>The hair is such high quality and gives me so much body!  </li>
            <li>So i wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>i dont fancy hair extensions, however i decided that i wanted to try a new hair, but dont want to spend alot of money.</li>
            <li>The hair was very soft.  </li>
            <li>it was very soft from root to tip no tangle</li>
            <li>Hair Is Very Soft</li>
            <li>The hair is soft , no shedding but</li>
            <li>Its good hair just very thin</li>
            <li>it was too light and thin to be real human hair and started tangling and shedding the very first day it was installed.</li>
            <li>well, true to length, I&#x27;ve had it for a a little while</li>
            <li>/&gt;it takes heat very well too.&lt;br /&gt;it does shed abit, but not much, maybe like a two to three strands or so...</li>
            <li>I am completely unsatisfied I did not use the hair in the process if sending it back paid over70 for no reasonüò†</li>
            <li>so far i installed it today and it make me look good,but the only complain i have for now is that the bundles were very small and not true to lenght and the hair is very thin,but its ok with me</li>
            <li>But When I curled it the curls just fail honestly</li>
            <li>But after about a week and a half started to tangle up just like all the other cheap hair.</li>
            <li>Hair has split ends and after the first wash mattes up a little at the nape.</li>
            <li>the hair is very thin at the bottom and it matts up very easy</li>
            <li>Although it is not black, it is a dark brown which matches my natural hair color.</li>

            <li> it was good however, there was some red strings.</li>
            <li> It should last a month or two if you take extremely good care of it.</li>
            <li> but the hair is manageable and is only good for two weeks</li>
            <li> Not bulky but its good quanlity am yet to have it dyed..if you can add alittle bulkiness and just make it a few more certimeters longer</li>
            <li> i think next time i&#x27;ll hv to purchase more bundles if i&#x27;ll purchase hair to this seller again,and it wass ok for the price,very cheap.over all i satisfy with the product</li>
            <li> The hair seems to be very pretty at first and they were full bundles.but</li>
            <li> The Hair Is Amazing &#x27; 3 Bundles Was Enough</li>
            <li> but nothing to be turned off about so far I&#x27;m not in love with this hair</li>
            <li> this wasn&#x27;t worth 70 bucks</li>
            <li> I received this hair today when I took it out of the package right out the bat</li>
            <li> came really quickly, nice and soft, shedding, no tangling, but its kind of thin, get more than three</li>
            <li> The lengths really didn&#x27;t look true either although it is a wave pattern.</li>
            <li> far.bt hey big head people do not purchase this product it wont fit your head unless u hv a 5 bundles.i had to make a way to make it fit mine.</li>
            <li> Totally amazing coming from someone who has bought the expensive kind and this kind I would totally buy again</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s quality of hair is ten times better to me then when i have purchased hair from stores.</li>
            <li> Ok so I got my hair and the length of this hair is very short when its curly and when you straighten it you will start to see the length that you asked for.</li>
            <li> washed the hair first before installing it and it lost the curls</li>
            <li> I received it within two days of ordering and I must say, it&#x27;s what exactly what I played for.</li>
            <li> Wen I first got it had</li>
            <li> 1416 18 is pretty long but the hair is good and it soft.</li>
            <li> The texture of this hair is very soft and light weight and blended very well with my hair.</li>
            <li> It was installed and as I stated earlier it&#x27;s soft and nice to play with.</li>
            <li> Spend double and get the good stuff or send it back like I should&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li> Hair seems soft true to length.</li>
            <li> Hair receive very fast more faster than what I expected.</li>
            <li> This hair is very high quality.</li>
            <li> I used clips to attach when getting ready to go out this weekend.</li>
            <li> but if you want good quality hair next time i would spend a few dollars more on different hair</li>
            <li> I stacked it and made halo extensions with it, but since it&#x27;s wefted very well you could probably do anything with it - sew in, clips, even diy u or i tip extensions.  </li>
            <li> It straightens really well</li>
            <li> and since my hair is that awkward texture between wavy and straight, if I run my straighter through the extensions a few times it&#x27;s a perfect match to my own hair.</li>
            <li> 3 bundles did my whole head</li>
            <li> üòçüòçüòç bundles a bit thin but hair is great</li>
            <li> it&#x27; really.</li>
            <li> i was very dissapointed</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t hold a curl really nappy</li>
            <li> I have all 3 bundles installed and the hair just isn&#x27;t very full/thick like I&#x27;m used to .</li>
            <li> Item came as described with fast shipping...</li>
            <li> thanks again</li>
            <li> /&gt;it holds the curls very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it really didn&#x27;t workout for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> And Mine Lost Its Luster Fast.</li>
            <li> pack hair smells the bundles were light not enough hair in the bundles and once you shampoo the hair</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more in the near future.</li>
            <li> but I would not recommend this for a full full sew in because the bundles are definitely small and not enough if your the type of person who loves super full hair which would be me</li>
            <li> hair came super fast, packaging was regular.</li>
            <li> Also I dont trust and believe it was a true 18 inches as the longest length, the bundles seems short</li>
            <li> and if i didnt have a closure that i bought separately would not have been enough to do a full head.</li>
            <li> however you&#x27;ll need to have 2-3 orders to have enough to do a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> and I definitely like my hair to be full</li>
            <li> a nice wave bundles was a lil small does not shed.</li>
            <li> When I first received the hair it was soft and did not have a smell</li>
            <li> But overall not bad for the price</li>
            <li> The disadvantage is it sheds alot in the beginning, and the edged are not full, very light</li>
            <li> The hair looked more brown than black or even off blk.</li>
            <li> ; is more like 12&amp;#34; or less the 16&amp;#34; Is 14&amp;#34; or less and the 18&amp;#34; is most defiantly not 18&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> so if you do get this hair use it for short term purposes like quick weaves</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still pretty, feels soft and natural.</li>
            <li> it was a nice thickness &amp; had a little left</li>
            <li> The hair is such high quality and gives me so much body!  </li>
            <li> So i wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> i dont fancy hair extensions, however i decided that i wanted to try a new hair, but dont want to spend alot of money.</li>
            <li> The hair was very soft.  </li>
            <li> it was very soft from root to tip no tangle</li>
            <li> Hair Is Very Soft</li>
            <li> The hair is soft , no shedding but</li>
            <li> Its good hair just very thin</li>
            <li> it was too light and thin to be real human hair and started tangling and shedding the very first day it was installed.</li>
            <li> well, true to length, I&#x27;ve had it for a a little while</li>
            <li> /&gt;it takes heat very well too.&lt;br /&gt;it does shed abit, but not much, maybe like a two to three strands or so...</li>
            <li> I am completely unsatisfied I did not use the hair in the process if sending it back paid over70 for no reasonüò†</li>
            <li> so far i installed it today and it make me look good,but the only complain i have for now is that the bundles were very small and not true to lenght and the hair is very thin,but its ok with me</li>
            <li> But When I curled it the curls just fail honestly</li>
            <li> But after about a week and a half started to tangle up just like all the other cheap hair.</li>
            <li> Hair has split ends and after the first wash mattes up a little at the nape.</li>
            <li> the hair is very thin at the bottom and it matts up very easy</li>
            <li> Although it is not black, it is a dark brown which matches my natural hair color.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far besides the bundles are very thin and you loose the body wave fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;the amount of hair seemed small, i thought maybe i should have bought four bundles, but i got a full head from it, with a little piece left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like it once u take care of it ,it will last a long time</li>
            <li> Did not last long at all</li>
            <li> This hair so was thin and it seem like it wasnt even a full bundle when they were all put together.</li>
            <li> The hair is full at the weft and thin at the ends</li>
            <li> ITS THE MOST DISAPPOINTING PURCHASE I&#x27;VE EVER MADE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE..</li>
            <li> Upon arrival I thought the hair was soft silly smooth but not full.</li>
            <li> Had for over a month hard to keep straight but dosnest tangled so I like it</li>
            <li> but the hair lacks density and the color is not natural.</li>
            <li> I just need a few bundles to complete my hairstyle</li>
            <li> when i took the hair out, i saw some grey hairs which i popped out.</li>
            <li> I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t be long durable hair</li>
            <li> the waves were not natural</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the same as Milky Way or any of the other products you buy in the beauty supply store that are about $24 $35 a pack.</li>
            <li> The hair looks full but other than that the hair is hard to get stringy straight and putting expensive products in it</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s really soft and the bundles are small May need two.</li>
            <li> But  it lasted only about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> The hair is soft, it doesn&#x27;t tangle, it&#x27;s very thin but manageable, it looks very natural on me.</li>
            <li> This hair is very thin but it is very pretty when you curl the hair.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get d length I expected</li>
            <li> Hair came as expected</li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly no complaints on that part but as soon as I open the package I could tell it wasn&#x27;t Brazilian</li>
            <li> the disappointing thing is it is so thin and looks obviously cheap!!</li>
            <li> i am EXTREMELY picky with everything</li>
            <li> I just received my order today, but when I took it out the packaging, I immediately noticed that it is not natural black or off black as the description started.</li>
            <li> Overall these are a total waste of hard working money!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like too much of thick hair but just in case I ordered an extra bundle.</li>
            <li> This is not real Brazilian please don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish it was a little thicker.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not true to length .</li>
            <li> I had to go to my local beauty supply to grab a 20inch bundle because the hair was a Little thin</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted $60.00</li>
            <li> only makes it worse</li>
            <li> Hair was too thin even though it was three bundles and texture only lasted a few days..</li>
            <li> No good hair at all wish I can return the other pack I purchase</li>
            <li> When I did it was terrible my hair tangled and shedding and it felt very cheap.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if that is from the shipping.</li>
            <li> Its decent I I ordered from abhair before so its not too bad just sheds a bit.</li>
            <li> quick,&lt;br /&gt;It was disappointing to open the package.</li>
            <li> Not a good grade of hair.</li>
            <li> but it still matted and looked like a bad synthetic that&#x27;s been in too long.</li>
            <li> but it is a lil thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin .</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s fairly thin</li>

            <li> Shedding, tangling, this is the worst hair ever do not purchase you&#x27;ll be highly upset.</li>
            <li> Terrible product very bad hair vendors not as described really wish I could get my money back</li>
            <li> Terrible hair matts after washing it and loses wave pattern after being flat ironed.</li>
            <li> The hair was very thin and wasnt quite what I expexpected but the price fits the product no great value.</li>
            <li> but since I have a small head it shouldn&#x27;t be so bad</li>
            <li> I will not purchase this brand again 2 bags was not enough and it tangles terribly.</li>
            <li> It became matted and knotted up, and was kinda difficult to detangle.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, and soft that&#x27;s the good thing, it feels like real hair. The disadvantage is it sheds alot in the beginning, and the edged are not full, very light tips.but I think it&#x27;s not that bad, I could wear this hair again</li>
            <li> I will not purchase this brand again 2 bags was not enough and it tangles terribly.</li>
            <li> This was so easy to put in. I used clips to attach when getting ready to go out this weekend. It was great and added great texture to my hair</li>
            <li> Bought this hair and got it the next day. I received three bundles. The hair is soft , no shedding but the disappointing thing is it is so thin and looks obviously cheap!! For it to have a full look I&#x27;d have to buy two more bundles. It was installed and as I stated earlier it&#x27;s soft and nice to play with. Will try and dye it and see the result.</li>
            <li> Very full and I love it! I recommend that you buy two packs to do your hair!</li>
            <li> Terrible hair matts after washing it and loses wave pattern after being flat ironed.</li>
            <li> This hair so was thin and it seem like it wasnt even a full bundle when they were all put together. The texture of the hair was okay but I wouldnt recommond this hair at all. Ladies you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m needed to find some cheap hair that will do and still look as good as a bundle for $100 &amp; I&#x27;m pleased! 1416 18 is pretty long but the hair is good and it soft.</li>
            <li> Its a good quality hair for the price but it is a lil thin but since I have a small head it shouldn&#x27;t be so bad nd I don&#x27;t like too much of thick hair but just in case I ordered an extra bundle. The hair does have a lil smell to it but not too bad I co washed it nd it was perfectlyfine. I will post pics when I install nd color it.</li>
            <li> It was good, but you can tell when it gets old.</li>
            <li> I Like these extensions a lot especially for this price, it is a really good deal!  The hair is so soft and I dyed it to match my color which worked out great!  Very good value for the money</li>
            <li> This hair is very high quality. The texture of this hair is very soft and light weight and blended very well with my hair. It was very easy to curl and straighten. When I dyed the hair it still looked great.</li>
            <li> Iam very disatisfied, It didnt met my expectations!!!</li>
            <li> Its decent I I ordered from abhair before so its not too bad just sheds a bit. I had to go to my local beauty supply to grab a 20inch bundle because the hair was a Little thin But overall not bad for the price</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE!!! WAS MATTED &amp; TANGLED AFTER THE SECOND DAY! DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> This is not brazilian hair and seems synthetic bc of its feel and weight and smell out of the package. it was too light and thin to be real human hair and started tangling and shedding the very first day it was installed. Also I dont trust and believe it was a true 18 inches as the longest length, the bundles seems short and if i didnt have a closure that i bought separately would not have been enough to do a full head. I wont buy this hair again. it was good for a quick cheap hairdo but if you want good quality hair next time i would spend a few dollars more on different hair</li>
            <li> Used it for a sew in and it seemed fine. But  it lasted only about a month and a half. It became matted and knotted up, and was kinda difficult to detangle. I wouldn&#x27;t order again !!</li>
            <li> It was terrible!! It kept getting tangled to the point where it was a ball of hair. Hair kept shedding. When you wash it it still got tangled. I would never by this hair again.</li>
            <li> The hair feels really nice however you&#x27;ll need to have 2-3 orders to have enough to do a full head of hair. I&#x27;m going to need to leave out most of my real hair out to make it look good.</li>
            <li> The hair became like a bird&#x27;s nest after I washed it.</li>
            <li> hair is kind of cool. came really quickly, nice and soft, shedding, no tangling, but its kind of thin, get more than three and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem, ill be ordering again!</li>
            <li> This is good hair, matched my natural hair well, true to length, I&#x27;ve had it for a a little while and it&#x27;s still pretty, feels soft and natural. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Had for over a month hard to keep straight but dosnest tangled so I like it</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really good quality hair. It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. The hair looked more brown than black or even off blk. The lengths really didn&#x27;t look true either although it is a wave pattern. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> This hair was a RIPOFF . It&#x27;s thin . And it&#x27;s not true to length . I won&#x27;t be using it . Just a waste of money .</li>
            <li> Totally amazing coming from someone who has bought the expensive kind and this kind I would totally buy again I love it</li>
            <li> ITS THE MOST DISAPPOINTING PURCHASE I&#x27;VE EVER MADE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE..The 18&amp;#34; 16&amp;#34; and 14&amp;#34; looks like a 12&amp;#34;10&amp;#34;and 8&amp;#34;..Total rip off..My friend needed to purchase the same hair and I told her not to because the length are not as described,they are soooo short..What u see on the picture as the length is not what you receive..The hair is way shorter..disappointing purchase and money wasted..TOTAL RIP OFF!!!!</li>
            <li> I received my hair I was so happy I installed it looks GREAT .... But When I curled it the curls just fail honestly I wouldn&#x27;t buy this hair again I&#x27;m gonna try and dye this &amp;#34;100% Brazilian hair&amp;#34; &amp; I&#x27;ll post another review after it&#x27;s done</li>
            <li> The hair was very thin and wasnt quite what I expexpected but the price fits the product no great value.</li>
            <li> Hair receive very fast more faster than what I expected. Hair seems soft true to length. think I&#x27;m going to buy again.</li>
            <li> Hair has split ends and after the first wash mattes up a little at the nape.</li>
            <li> I have ordered hair from Amazon and everytime I have ordered hair, I have never been disappointed. Amazon&#x27;s quality of hair is ten times better to me then when i have purchased hair from stores. I love it and I will continue to purchase hair from Amazon</li>
            <li> The first day I put the hair in, it was absolutely beautiful. I don&#x27;t know if it was my fault, or the hair is not that good quality. But after about a week and a half started to tangle up just like all the other cheap hair. It&#x27;s about the same as Milky Way or any of the other products you buy in the beauty supply store that are about $24 $35 a pack.</li>
            <li> The hair was very soft.  Looked really good after being sewn into my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> The hair came WAY sooner than I expected, which was great.  It&#x27;s very good quality for the price, and 180 g is a LOT of hair.  I stacked it and made halo extensions with it, but since it&#x27;s wefted very well you could probably do anything with it - sew in, clips, even diy u or i tip extensions.  It straightens really well and since my hair is that awkward texture between wavy and straight, if I run my straighter through the extensions a few times it&#x27;s a perfect match to my own hair.</li>
            <li> Hair was okay for the price. It sheds a lot and tangles.</li>
            <li> Nice when you first install, But very cheap hair you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Hair is FAKE!! It tangles a lot. I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this hair. Not only are the ends sparse but the hair lacks density and the color is not natural. I would discourage anyone from purchasing from this vendor</li>
            <li> Upon arrival I thought the hair was soft silly smooth but not full. The hair is full at the weft and thin at the ends but I still gave it a try. I wanted to dye it and see how it took and the dye took as well and one thing I will say good is that it does keep the wave pattern but this hair is still horrible. I had it in 1 week and threw it in the trash. I treated it like my own but it still matted and looked like a bad synthetic that&#x27;s been in too long. Im generous for 2 stars - 1 for keeping its pattern and 1 for actually dyeing. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Spend double and get the good stuff or send it back like I should&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li> Lovely ! 3 bundles did my whole head n it was a nice thickness &amp; had a little left over - THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Great hair they are perfect look exactly like mines. Curl perfect and most of all they do not shread.</li>
            <li> When I got my hair it was good however, there was some red strings. DO NOT DYE THIS HAIR! When I did it was terrible my hair tangled and shedding and it felt very cheap.</li>
            <li> A bit light in weight needed another bundle and there were a bit of streaks in it..........</li>
            <li> This is not quality hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair üòçüòçüòç bundles a bit thin but hair is great</li>
            <li> I HATE it I should have listened to the reviews I learned my lesson to never buy online hair again it&#x27; really. Thin. And not18&#x27;</li>
            <li> Like it once u take care of it ,it will last a long time</li>
            <li> NOT Remy hair! Looks and feel like plastic.</li>
            <li> The hair is soft, it doesn&#x27;t tangle, it&#x27;s very thin but manageable, it looks very natural on me. Its good quality for the price...</li>
            <li> No did like hair at all didn&#x27;t last a week</li>
            <li> Although I got the hair quick,&lt;br /&gt;It was disappointing to open the package. The measurements are off! The 14&amp;#34; is more like 12&amp;#34; or less the 16&amp;#34; Is 14&amp;#34; or less and the 18&amp;#34; is most defiantly not 18&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;The ends of the hair or so thin! Literally 4 strands! The hair is smooth for now.. I&#x27;ll write another report if I ever choose to install these depressing extensions on! Overall these are a total waste of hard working money! Don&#x27;t pay them! And don&#x27;t even think about it!</li>
            <li> Not bulky but its good quanlity am yet to have it dyed..if you can add alittle bulkiness and just make it a few more certimeters longer</li>
            <li> The hair seems to be very pretty at first and they were full bundles.but about two weeks hair began to tangled a lot some shading as well .the good thing is that it came super fast</li>
            <li> The hair is ok  not my fav and I definitely like my hair to be full so 3 bundles wasn&#x27;t enough for me. I&#x27;d need like 5 if all the bundles are only going to be 60g verses 100g that plays a big part.</li>
            <li> I received this hair today when I took it out of the package right out the bat it was very soft from root to tip no tangle I did not cowash or wash this hair so I don&#x27;t know with everybody else&#x27;s comments saying that it tangles after you wash it but it did shed a llittle when i put my fingers through it but nothing to be turned off about so far I&#x27;m not in love with this hair but I like it I just need a few bundles to complete my hairstyle I have hair that I ordered from a different site and blends well but I would not recommend this for a full full sew in because the bundles are definitely small and not enough if your the type of person who loves super full hair which would be me Lol but all in all It&#x27;s a good sixty something dollar investment it your looking for something temporary then this is the hair for you but if your looking for something long term then I would tell you to do more research!!!!!!! And find some better hair</li>
            <li> Love the texture and length.</li>
            <li> Hair was too thin even though it was three bundles and texture only lasted a few days..</li>
            <li> Item was not real Human Remind hair. It was synthetic and burned off in the curlers.. I&#x27;ve wasted $60.00</li>
            <li> I give 3 stars to the seller because the shipping was great i got my product in the days giving which was 3 days,to b honest i love the hair so far i installed it today and it make me look good,but the only complain i have for now is that the bundles were very small and not true to lenght and the hair is very thin,but its ok with me i think next time i&#x27;ll hv to purchase more bundles if i&#x27;ll purchase hair to this seller again,and it wass ok for the price,very cheap.over all i satisfy with the product so far.bt hey big head people do not purchase this product it wont fit your head unless u hv a 5 bundles.i had to make a way to make it fit mine.</li>
            <li> I dyed the hair and that was the worse mistake ever the color came out well but matting and shedding was horrible  i was very dissapointed</li>
            <li> the hair is very thin at the bottom and it matts up very easy so you need to constantly brush your hair throughout the day. I do not like this hair.</li>
            <li> Worst hair in the world.. It tangled. It sheds really bad. Dull looking horrible. Won&#x27;t hold a curl really nappy</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get d length I expected n it&#x27;s really thin</li>
            <li> No good hair at all wish I can return the other pack I purchase it was a waist of money</li>
            <li> The hair is really soft, and it holds curls beautifully. (I roll the hair with flexi rods every night) My only complaint is that I wish it was a little thicker. I have all 3 bundles installed and the hair just isn&#x27;t very full/thick like I&#x27;m used to .</li>
            <li> Terrible product very bad hair vendors not as described really wish I could get my money back this wasn&#x27;t worth 70 bucks</li>
            <li> Item came as described with fast shipping...thanks again</li>

            <li> Ok so I got my hair and the length of this hair is very short when its curly and when you straighten it you will start to see the length that you asked for.I really haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far besides the bundles are very thin and you loose the body wave fast and I have not had any tangling or shedding! But this is not grade A Brazilian hair!</li>
            <li> Ok hair for the price, it&#x27;s fairly thin and I added a 12 bundle with mine. But it&#x27;s pretty good hair so far</li>
            <li> I just received my order today, but when I took it out the packaging, I immediately noticed that it is not natural black or off black as the description started. It also has a lot of blonde strands, which is unlike any Brazilian I have ever seen! It does seem to be frizzy already and I am not sure if that is from the shipping. Although it is not black, it is a dark brown which matches my natural hair color. We will see! I will post another review when I have used the product!</li>
            <li> So i wanted to try something new. i dont fancy hair extensions, however i decided that i wanted to try a new hair, but dont want to spend alot of money. i searched around for days r&#x3D;trying to find cheap but some what of a good quality hair that can maybe last two to four weeks without looking a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair came super fast, packaging was regular. when i took the hair out, i saw some grey hairs which i popped out. the hair felt amazing, i was like is this a cheap hair or what??? i am EXTREMELY picky with everything so....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the amount of hair seemed small, i thought maybe i should have bought four bundles, but i got a full head from it, with a little piece left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed the hair first before installing it and it lost the curls somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;it holds the curls very well.&lt;br /&gt;it takes heat very well too.&lt;br /&gt;it does shed abit, but not much, maybe like a two to three strands or so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the hair is good quality for such a cheap price. i will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> The hair is not 14, 16, 18 inches it&#x27;s more like 8, 10, 12 inches. But it&#x27;s really soft and the bundles are small May need two.</li>
            <li> the weaf were too thick(hard for my needle to go through),  and the ends were way too too too thin</li>
            <li> This hair sheds really bad it really didn&#x27;t workout for my granddaughter. I will not buy this hair again. Not a good grade of hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t straighten at all. Very thin bundles also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good hair for the most part. I received it within two days of ordering and I must say, it&#x27;s what exactly what I played for. I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t be long durable hair but I ordered anyway. It&#x27;s a great purchase. It should last a month or two if you take extremely good care of it. You can tell by the way it feels that it wouldn&#x27;t hold if you dyed it. Also It came looking short so I ran my finger through it and it expanded. I haven&#x27;t installed yet but it looks as if its the right size! Saying this, I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The Hair Is Amazing &#x27; 3 Bundles Was Enough I Sewd It In And It Looks And Feel Great.&lt;br /&gt;good deal for 60 bucks LADYS.</li>
            <li> This is not real Brazilian please don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly no complaints on that part but as soon as I open the package I could tell it wasn&#x27;t Brazilian the waves were not natural it looks nothing like the picture and it also smells like process hair....the length are also wrong it measures up to 12 14 16 I am completely unsatisfied I did not use the hair in the process if sending it back paid over70 for no reasonüò†</li>
            <li> This hair is very thin but it is very pretty when you curl the hair. The hair looks full but other than that the hair is hard to get stringy straight and putting expensive products in it only makes it worse</li>
            <li> the hair tangle a lot it was ok so I give it 3 stars</li>
            <li> Pro: Hair Is Very Soft When You Get It, Bouncy &amp; Shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Sheds Aloooot, And Mine Lost Its Luster Fast. Not Shiny How It Was.</li>
            <li> Hair came as expected</li>
            <li> I have bought a lot of hair extensions in my day and these are the best!  The hair is such high quality and gives me so much body!  They are healthy and beautiful and an amazing buy for the price.  I wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere else and spend more money because there is no point.  I would recommend this product and seller any day...very quick shipping as well. A+++</li>
            <li> I brought this hair a month ago .. &amp; just ordered more today .. Wen I first got it had a nice wave bundles was a lil small does not shed., I think it&#x27;s good quality hair for the price your buying it for Ive curled it and straighten it and it look very nice . Sometimes it&#x27;s gets matted thou</li>
            <li> When I first received the hair it was soft and did not have a smell well it smelled like it had been processed like pack hair smells the bundles were light not enough hair in the bundles and once you shampoo the hair the curl pattern is gone and it tangled a lot and the ends became frizzy after about a week but the hair is manageable and is only good for two weeks so if you do get this hair use it for short term purposes like quick weaves</li>
            <li> This hair is horrible. EVERYTHING about it is horrible. Shedding, tangling, this is the worst hair ever do not purchase you&#x27;ll be highly upset.</li>
            <li> Its good hair just very thin</li>
            <li> Did not last long at all</li>
