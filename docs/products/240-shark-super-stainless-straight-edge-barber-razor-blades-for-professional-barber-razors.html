            <li>Great deal.</li>
            <li>Very much a great value for these blades, and</li>
            <li>Great blades.</li>
            <li>Great value vs disposable cartridges.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they work great.  </li>
            <li>Great blades for the price.</li>
            <li>These blades are good for 2 to 3 shaves on my wimpy face.  </li>
            <li>but afterwards they give a good close shave</li>
            <li>First shave is excellent.    </li>
            <li>These blades are nice.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered my Parker Shavette, it came with 4 or 5 Shark Barber razors that I liked, so I decided to give them another try.</li>
            <li>I paid $20 for at most 30 blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite satisfied with these.</li>
            <li>these were ok.  </li>
            <li>a dragging a Gillette razor across my face, but it isn&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li>When researching, these were not the highest recommended product, but we love them.</li>
            <li>I have referred friends to this vendor, as I am more than pleased with the ordering/shipping promptness and the value.</li>
            <li>Thank you! :)</li>
            <li>My husband is mostly pleased with these razors.  </li>
            <li>Interestingly, these semi-sharp blade turn out to be a pretty good value.    </li>
            <li>I had never used a straight razor before but fondly recalled memories of watching my Dad or my first barber masterfully wield one to make razor-stubbled skin turn baby&#x27;s-bottom smooth.  </li>
            <li>These Shark blades are of a better quality than the Dovo blades and the price is absurdly cheap.</li>
            <li>The 240 Shark super stainless straight edge barber razor blades are great!</li>
            <li>The razor blades are just fine</li>
            <li>and they work just fine.</li>
            <li>They start smooth and don&#x27;t pull or tug at your face.  </li>
            <li>Good combo with the SR1 stainless steel straight edge razor.</li>
            <li>These blades are great for the first use, second use</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The second and third are nice and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had great sucess shaving tight spots on my face, neck and ears.  </li>
            <li>Product was Exactly what I wanted, and the Description was right on point!</li>
            <li>Fast ship, cheap price, close shave.</li>
            <li>If I really push it I can get 4-5 shaves out of each blade, but 3 is about the limit for a really smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I stocked up on these babies seeing as the price is right</li>
            <li>get the full stainless steel one.</li>
            <li>Not much to say, just an outstanding deal on straight razor blades, what more can be said?  </li>
            <li>2nd is OK.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used disposable straight edge blades before and have had a 50/50 success ratio on whether or not I hack myself up on my shave.  </li>
            <li>This razor performs very well and is just what I was looking for to us in my craft work.  </li>
            <li>Blades very from person to person and for me</li>
            <li>My husband just switched to a straight blade for shaving.</li>
            <li>This will keep my husband in supply for a while, and he loves the closeness of the shave with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Old School is making a comeback!!!</li>
            <li>The blades are extremely sharp and keep there edge, they are good for multiple shaves.</li>
            <li>The razors stay sharper than most other ones I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>Decent blade for starters</li>
            <li>I purchased these blades not knowing what to really expect but after using about 30 of them, I have been pleasantly surprised to the point of recommending them to friends.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s had a few issues using them, but he thinks it&#x27;s mostly the lather, not the blade.</li>
            <li>blade are great very sharp heavy beard</li>
            <li>I purchased these razors for the new razor I bought</li>
            <li>My husband likes his straight razor a lot &amp; these are super sharp, he says.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t massacer your face its good to use with the parker blade and don&#x27;t get the one that has the plastic back to it because it is no good</li>
            <li>Normally the first shave is rough.  </li>
            <li>I switched to a straight razor based on a recommendation from my dermatologist to help preclude razor bumps and any further scarring of the skin on my neck area.  </li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of disposable straight razor blades.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these to anyone that is looking for a disposable blade to use with their straight edge razor.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hold much of an edge for long, but then again there are 240 of them.</li>
            <li>I can only get two shaves out of each normally, but if you do the math you&#x27;re saving quite a bit of money on the store bought gillets, schicks, and so forth.      </li>
            <li>Super sharp and can be used two times, possibly three but with the price why risk it.</li>
            <li>These razors are not nearly as sharp as I remember.</li>
            <li>Their \\&quot;not-so-sharp\\&quot; edge is actually a little safer to use than some higher quality products.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first shave is rough due to sharpness</li>

            <li> Yet being the key word, I mean, you are putting a extremely sharp blade against your skin, but these make it a little more forgiving if you&#x27;re a novice like me.  </li>
            <li> Like the fact that these blades are cut in half far safer than snapping a double blade in half bu hand.</li>
            <li> I use them in the straight razor and use the double edge in my De razor can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I use one blade every other shave.</li>
            <li> These are no better or worse than any other disposable straight blade.</li>
            <li> They are VERY sharp and packaged so you don&#x27;t cut yourself when changing out the blade.</li>
            <li> Bought two packs of these after starting to slice my face with razors instead of paying outrageous prices for the latest 3,4,5,55 bladed gizmos at the store.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit dull but still works.</li>
            <li> The four boxes in this purchase, plus the 100 blade box I already have mean I DO NOT spend big bucks for the next few years on stupid razors!  </li>
            <li> Some poor schmo in Egypt has a job and is doing it well making these blades.</li>
            <li> Tried a fourth with very painful results.</li>
            <li> Using these blades isn&#x27;t as bad</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t terrible, but go with Feather instead, I think you&#x27;ll be happier.</li>

            <li> I have purchased Dovo straight-edge disposable blades at Macy&#x27;s. I paid $20 for at most 30 blades. These Shark blades are of a better quality than the Dovo blades and the price is absurdly cheap.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, these semi-sharp blade turn out to be a pretty good value.

            <li> Not much to say, just an outstanding deal on straight razor blades, what more can be said?  I stocked up on these babies seeing as the price is right and they work great.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great blades for the price. Super sharp and can be used two times, possibly three but with the price why risk it. This package will allow you to shave for over a year and your cost is 17 bucks. Suck on that Gillette.</li>
