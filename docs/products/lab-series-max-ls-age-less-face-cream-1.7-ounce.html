            <li>I really do not believe that any creams on the market are going to make my face younger , BUT this product does work the best for men which it will give a feel of firmness and a non greasy nice glow to the skin.............and its the cheapest price anywhere i can find it is on amazon with front door service</li>

            <li>Its more of a paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may not buy this particular product from LAB series anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this face cream for any guy trying to get better looking skin.</li>
            <li>I love this new skin cream.</li>
            <li>It leaves his skin feeling very smooth and soft and I have noticed a difference in the way his skin looks.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband along with some other skin care products and he says this is his favorite!  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I can clearly tell the difference after the first full day of use.</li>
            <li>If you do purchase this product make sure to follow directions and apply on dry skin.</li>
            <li>my skin is very oily and i noticed the oiliness is gone too.</li>
            <li>Gave me smooth skin, but that was the only thing I noticed after 3 weeks of using the product.  </li>
            <li>My uncle wants to buy this</li>
            <li>I just buy for my uncle , but speed is fast.</li>
            <li>Works great for my skin - not too oily, not too thin.</li>
            <li>personal favorite currently is the Kyoku Moisturizer for men.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used dozens of high end face lotions for men over the years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and started to notice an immediate healthy looking difference for my face.</li>
            <li>But he was allergic to this product and usually he is not allergic to any skin care products.  </li>
            <li>during the year I have tried many other products and keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive and in the past some of the other effective face creams would make me tear up for some reason.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really say how good it works, but so far I do believe a small change in my skin is appearing, a few less lines</li>
            <li>I use only LAB products on my face, and the regular (cheaper) age-reducing lotion from LAB works exactly the same.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> You will have nicer skin, but you can get that with other products that don&#x27;t cost as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for less than a month, but I can see a improvement on my face already where I&#x27;ve had sun damage in the past.</li>
            <li> Seems to help and goes a long way with small amounts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s particularly useful in cold weather when my face dries out.</li>
            <li> This one is up there, but value per dollar its not really worth it.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy it on the Grooming Lounge website and then found it on Amazon for much less.  </li>
            <li> Cream lasts for about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> Works well, i was just disappointed to open the bottle and see that it wasnt as big as what the bottle looked like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually have to go to Sephora to buy it.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s definitely not magical or anything.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> Used it for about 2 months every night almost without fail - saw not even a slight improvement over what the product claims to do...</li>
            <li> It is expensive though.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s in this product.  :-(</li>
            <li> As a guy, that&#x27;s uncomfortable for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cream works. I apply them in the morning and at nights. my skin is very oily and i noticed the oiliness is gone too. I can clearly tell the difference after the first full day of use. It is expensive though. The way I use it, this will probably last me no more than a months but I am applying it twice a day so...&lt;br /&gt;I am very very happy with this product and HIGHLY recommend it. Your result may vary as the skin types are different.</li>
            <li> Gave me smooth skin, but that was the only thing I noticed after 3 weeks of using the product.  If you do purchase this product make sure to follow directions and apply on dry skin.</li>
            <li> my face feels smoother... also i like it&#x27;s light feeling and non-greasiness...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband along with some other skin care products and he says this is his favorite!  It leaves his skin feeling very smooth and soft and I have noticed a difference in the way his skin looks.</li>
            <li> I started using this face cream from Lab Series about a week ago. I am already seeing great results with reduced lines and skin tightening. I highly recommend this face cream for any guy trying to get better looking skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it as gift for my dad. But he was allergic to this product and usually he is not allergic to any skin care products.  Not sure what&#x27;s in this product.  :-(</li>
            <li> Works well, i was just disappointed to open the bottle and see that it wasnt as big as what the bottle looked like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing i didnt like, was the fact that its not a lotion... Its more of a paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may not buy this particular product from LAB series anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum and the all-in-one for the win!</li>
            <li> Have used for years. Seems to help and goes a long way with small amounts.</li>
            <li> Used it for about 2 months every night almost without fail - saw not even a slight improvement over what the product claims to do...won&#x27;t fall for that one again!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. It&#x27;s particularly useful in cold weather when my face dries out. I usually have to go to Sephora to buy it. As a guy, that&#x27;s uncomfortable for me. So I prefer to order it online.</li>
            <li> The only thing the man of the house will use</li>
            <li> Well I have been using this product for a year now. during the year I have tried many other products and keep coming back to this one. I really do not believe that any creams on the market are going to make my face younger , BUT this product does work the best for men which it will give a feel of firmness and a non greasy nice glow to the skin.............and its the cheapest price anywhere i can find it is on amazon with front door service</li>
            <li> My uncle wants to buy this and I noticed that he love this production. I do not know the quality cause I just buy for my uncle , but speed is fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice lotion, but not as nice as the price would indicate.  I&#x27;ve used dozens of high end face lotions for men over the years.  This one is up there, but value per dollar its not really worth it.  And it&#x27;s definitely not magical or anything.  It&#x27;s good quality lotion, nothing more.  No wrinkles will disappear and you won&#x27;t look younger.  You will have nicer skin, but you can get that with other products that don&#x27;t cost as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal favorite currently is the Kyoku Moisturizer for men.  I used to buy it on the Grooming Lounge website and then found it on Amazon for much less.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product is over-priced for what it accomplishes.  I use only LAB products on my face, and the regular (cheaper) age-reducing lotion from LAB works exactly the same. I&#x27;ll continue to try more products from this company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for less than a month, but I can see a improvement on my face already where I&#x27;ve had sun damage in the past. I will recommend this product to others that want healthier skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t-Doesn&#x27;t do anything. Was expecting some difference after using. Could feel some tightening of the skin but nothing else. Would never buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great for my skin - not too oily, not too thin. Within a couple hours, makes my face feel really nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I used this product about a year ago and stopped for what ever reason. I began using the face cream and within a couple of weeks i started getting complements regarding my skin,its noticeably smoother and softer. This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Great cream. No oily residue. No breakouts. You&#x27;ll notice a difference in a week.  Deceptive packaging.  Cream lasts for about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> Excellent my husband love this!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad and he likes this product.</li>
            <li> It works great for me! This is a very nice and easy to use product! 2 thumbs up. Buy it now!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this new skin cream. Heard about from Men&#x27;s Health. I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and started to notice an immediate healthy looking difference for my face. My skin is pretty sensitive and in the past some of the other effective face creams would make me tear up for some reason. I don&#x27;t have any allergies so I&#x27;m not sure why. The Lab series product is working great all around so 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, great for aging skin, helps with dry spots on the face.  I have had women ask what I was using!</li>
            <li> Only been using this for a month so can&#x27;t really say how good it works, but so far I do believe a small change in my skin is appearing, a few less lines but my facial skin does seem fresher!! I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if I had been using it longer.</li>
