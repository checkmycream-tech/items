            <li>This product seemed watery and did not seem to clean as well as Dr Bronner&#x27;s liquid castile soap</li>

            <li>This was much appreciated.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand.</li>
            <li>Some Castile soaps are really drying to the skin</li>
            <li>and wow, all my makeup came right off.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller as the packaging was insufficient to protect the neck of the bottle from becoming crushed and compressed into the body of the bottle and causing a leak.</li>
            <li>This brand of castile soap is the only TRUELY unscented soap I have used.</li>
            <li>but with a pleasant subtle natural smell.  </li>

            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> We use it on our Cocker Spaniel with allergies to detergents .So far it is helping hm.</li>
            <li> FanfreakingTastic!!! Oh the sensitive skin issues in this house abound.  Usually even trying a new &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; soap can still cause issues.  I can&#x27;t buy anything scented, and every winter leaves me in search of new products... Mostly because I&#x27;m a junkie!  I try everything, then everyone saves their money and comes to me to ask &amp;#34;What do I use on my kid&#x27;s eczema?&amp;#34; Or &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve got chapped skin.. Help!&amp;#34; My pediatrician asks what products I use on my child because He will share with his patients.. My little one had horrible eczema.  Well!!!! I&#x27;ve finally found the product that may end my search.  It&#x27;s awesome.  We use it as shampoo too, result.. Shiny beautiful hair! I&#x27;m buying the gallon to try it for house cleaning.  Seriously.. Try it!  Thanks Carolina Castile.  Thank YOU!</li>
            <li> A nice castile soap without a scent so that I can add my own scent with essential oils.  Very useful to have on hand for making homemade items that call for a castile soap.  This is a great brand!</li>
            <li> Too runny and does not suds well.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This does what it does, however it does have an unpleasant smell, but I guess its supposed to</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. I add a few essential oils to it, which unexpectedly thickened it up and use it in my liquid soap dispensers in the bathrooms. The lack of scent makes it easy for me to create unique scents in each dispenser.</li>
            <li> This product seemed watery and did not seem to clean as well as Dr Bronner&#x27;s liquid castile soap</li>
            <li> A tad over-drying, also a bit watery.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Truly unscented, unlike some unscented castile soaps I have purchased with awful smells. I&#x27;ve been making foaming hand soap with it for my son who has sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t hurt or affected his hands.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;d been trying to find a castile soap that didn&#x27;t exacerbate my eczema. I tried using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but it left my skin&lt;br /&gt;feeling dry. Last April I tried a bottle of Carolina Castile Soap, and I was elated with the results. Within a couple of weeks, there was a noticeable improvement in my skin and the eczema was gone. This soap has a rich lather and leaves my&lt;br /&gt;skin feeling smooth and supple. I also use it to wash my hair, cleaning the house, as a laundry detergent, etc. Although this&lt;br /&gt;review is for the unscented, I&#x27;ve also used all of their scented soaps as well.</li>
            <li> Very light and smooth. Highly recommend this product.  I have only used it for making dog shampoo so far, but will certainly find more uses.</li>
            <li> Excellent product without a lot of added chemicals.</li>
            <li> Great! Very mild. Makes good suds. I use this to make my own shampoo and  bath soap. for my little dog. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a good soap base but I like their lavender and kukui oil version better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as I&#x27;d like.  It makes it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, clean soap.  Works great for mixing with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I have severe reactions to scents and chemicals.  This is a great soap you can use for cleaning and I don&#x27;t have any reactions at all and I have severe MCS.</li>
            <li> The soap was watered down just a little to much.  Wasn&#x27;t as concentrate as im used to having from Dr. Bronner.</li>
            <li> I found this soap in my quest to rid my home of toxic chemicals and fell in love with it. I especially love that it rinses off my skin quickly. I use it to wash my face, my body and my hair, plus I use it as my hand soap (in a container with a foam pump). Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  I use this to wash cloth diapers and for house cleaning - very  effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this soap! I&#x27;ve been using it on myself and my sons and for cleaning and I love knowing it&#x27;s free of so many of the chemicals that abound in modern soaps and body washes and shampoos. I like the scent and find it pretty neutral and inoffensive, but my husband dislikes it so I&#x27;ll try a different scent or add some essential oils in the future. My only complaint is that I wish they would&#x27;ve mentioned that it stings a LOT if it gets in your eyes (I wasn&#x27;t careful enough one shower, but no lasting damage, just hurts at the time).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy this brand of Castile soap again.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my extremely dry, eczema infected skin.  Milder and much less drying than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised at how well this soap works. I tried it because I can&#x27;t seem to get my mascara off. I was washing my face twice, using makeup cleansing clothes etc and still I would have mascara on. I lathered up my wash cloth with this soap and wow, all my makeup came right off. No scrubbing repeatedly or using makeup removing cloths. Just this soap, some water and a cloth is all you need. I won&#x27;t use anything else now!</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Unscented but with a pleasant subtle natural smell.  Works well with a foaming dispenser.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t love this soap more. In the past I&#x27;ve used Dr. Bonner&#x27;s and it started feeling a little harsh on my skin. Carolina is made with olive oil, and you can definitely tell.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it moisturizes or makes my skin smoother, but it dries my skin out less than Dr. Bonner&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> We found this soap while looking for an alternative to scented soaps. We couldn&#x27;t be happier! It is great to be able to use a product that doesn&#x27;t leave you or your things scented and still is a great cleaner. I use it around the house, for my kids, everything! Organic, unscented &amp; awesome!</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller as the packaging was insufficient to protect the neck of the bottle from becoming crushed and compressed into the body of the bottle and causing a leak. A replacement bottle was promptly sent out with a kind apology.  It is so rare to have the personal touch in e-commerce. This was much appreciated.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  I use it as shampoo.  It&#x27;s gentle, lathers lavishly, and rinses cleanly and quickly.  My hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> I use this soap in my kitchen and bathroom for washing my hands, i have dry, sensitive skin, and this soap doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin at all, though I wash my hands constantly. I also like the orange-scented version, and the smaller bottles make excellent gifts!</li>
            <li> Soap is high quality and works well in shampoos, conditioners, and foaming soaps with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Foams well, feels smooth and has really helped with my daughters dry skin on her hands from using other soaps.</li>
            <li> The soap gives me a very clean feeling. I like that it does not dry out my skin like the other unscented soaps. I have been looking for an natural unscented soap, that is still moisturizing, so my skin feels good after using it. It looks like, I have found it.</li>
            <li> This brand of castile soap is the only TRUELY unscented soap I have used.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand. There is no scent so I can add my essential oils for shower gels or liquid soaps. Some Castile soaps are really drying to the skin but this one isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m anxious to try more of this brand.</li>
            <li> I love love love this Castile soap, I make my own shampoo and I first tried Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and it left my hair dry.  One of the reasons I chose this one is because the main oil used is olive oil and from my understanding this is how Castile soap was originally made.  If you have dry or damaged hair, I would recommend giving this one a try, I am very satisfied with my purchase, I got a nice big bottle for the price.  You can google them and I would recommend going to their website.  For me, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is better for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great soap! My 1st experience with castile soap. I even went back and got the gallon size</li>
