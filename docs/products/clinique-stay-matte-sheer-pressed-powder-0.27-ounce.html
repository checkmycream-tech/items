            <li> I suffer from acne and very oily skin and started to see a new dermatologist that told me to stop using MAC blot powder Deep Dark because it was too heavy and to switch to Neutrogena or Clinique.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, and other products have sometimes burned or turned my skin red.  </li>
            <li> Skins looks natural even when sweaty as the powder doesn&#x27;t cake with sweat unlike other products.</li>
            <li> stuck with it, this is the only reason i´m givin it a single star rate.</li>
            <li> My unique problem is the price... to expensive for me...</li>
            <li> I am generally a loose powder type, but this Clinique pressed powder convinced me otherwise!</li>
            <li> I love Clinique product, nothing bad to say about this item.</li>
            <li> This product came through with crushed powder.  </li>
            <li> It has medium coverage and lasts me about 3-4 hours on average until I need to reapply... and even then, it&#x27;s only slight touch-ups that need to be done.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It has helped keep my skin looking less oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This powder is not too heavy, and the coverage is buildable.  </li>
            <li> Not sure where this price is coming from</li>
            <li> However the past two times, the compact breaks at the hinges.</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time looking for a pressed powder that&#x27;s compatible to my skin.</li>
            <li> This powder is on of my favorites to hide the wrinkles that have been showing up lately.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with powder broken inside of case, making it hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> My item arrived broken....</li>
            <li> When I opened it the makeup was broken into pieces.</li>
            <li> I get it from the military base for $20.00.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> Too expensive..</li>
            <li> parecido de excelente calidad, tanto que ahora decidi completar la linea con la base liquida</li>

            <li> This product came through with crushed powder.  It was not packaged well at all.  I&#x27;ve ordered direct from Clinque, so I know it can be done.  There is no way I can use this.</li>
            <li> No complaints. They sent me the correct product in the time estipulated. I love the brand. Is excellent for my delicated skin.</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time looking for a pressed powder that&#x27;s compatible to my skin. I have switched products multiple times, until a friend recommended this product.  What&#x27;s great about it is it looks natural on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t make my face itch, and I never encountered any breakouts at all. I also like it&#x27;s green marble look, very sleek, classy, and durable too.  If your face is oily and a bit sensitive like mine, you&#x27;ll be happy with this product.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my summer wedding because I heard it was good for covering the shine in hot weather. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, and I&#x27;ve been out in 100 degree weather, and my face isn&#x27;t shiny at all! It covers better, and more evenly than any powder I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> My item arrived broken.... White can I do!</li>
            <li> I love Clinique product, nothing bad to say about this item.</li>

            <li> I should have know better than buying this product on line. When I opened it the makeup was broken into pieces. Sad. I will go to the store from here on out.</li>
            <li> Excellent shop and head</li>
            <li> excellent seller, very good product, all according to the description recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clinique products almost since I started using make up, mostly because my skin would break-down really easily with any other brand, it would get so bad I ended up going to the dermatologist and he recommended me Clinique products. And I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them, this powder really blends well with my skin and it looks very natural, the tone is as it looks in the picture (I use No. 02 and my skin is a light-to-medium shade of brown).</li>
            <li> I found it a good product and recommend delivery arrive on time and if fulfilled my expectations were met with quality of supply</li>
            <li> wife happy, Clinique quality product.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with powder broken inside of case, making it hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;Love the product but advise to purchase at store where you can make sure&lt;br /&gt;it isn&#x27;t in pieces.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. But I prefer younique brand (the one with the 3D mascara) from [...] I think its better, plus its 100% natural with no fillers or chemicals and the same prices pretty much.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Clinique products especially their powders.  Provides good coverage. Skins looks natural even when sweaty as the powder doesn&#x27;t cake with sweat unlike other products.</li>
            <li> Ya lo había usado y es un excelente producto, de calidad, solo algo seco, pero cubre bastante el rostro, y se nota que es libre de grasa.-</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. I used to use a liquid foundation + urban decay mineral powder + pressed powder. Now I do my liquid foundation and Stay Matte (stay neutral). It gives good coverage and feels really lightweight. It has helped keep my skin looking less oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute go-to face powder! I am generally a loose powder type, but this Clinique pressed powder convinced me otherwise! I have somewhat oily skin, especially in the summer. I&#x27;m glad to have found a powder that not only matches my skin-tone well, but that also lasts long without having to be reapplied all the time. It has medium coverage and lasts me about 3-4 hours on average until I need to reapply... and even then, it&#x27;s only slight touch-ups that need to be done.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge it super easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or marks either.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, is fragance and oil free so is really good for the skin, and the color was just the same of my skin so every time I wear it have a natural look that I just love. I use it with foundation before it, so I dont know if it does work as good without foundation.  5 stars</li>
            <li> Just excelent! Original product in perfect conditions!</li>
            <li> good quality but received it broken</li>
            <li> lo recomiendo al aplicarse el polvo compacto deja la piel como una porcelana, dura en la piel y es facil de retirar de la piel junto con el maquillaje</li>
            <li> Clinique Stay Matte Sheer Pressed Powder Oil-Free Stay Neutral 02 llego en mal estado la compra de los dos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mariela perez</li>
            <li> very good benefit/price ratio excellent deal good product. Design and quality are great, so far very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have always love this brand of powder.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Clinique for years and have never seen the pressed powder for $28.00. I buy every 3 months and the most I&#x27;ve paid was $22.00. I buy at Macy&#x27;s in the mall. Or if I&#x27;m with my grandmother I get it from the military base for $20.00. I do love the product and the first time I bought it it was $16.00. So I&#x27;ve been a faithful customer for over 20 years. Not sure where this price is coming from but you can get it cheaper. Have a great day!</li>
            <li> I love product. However the past two times, the compact breaks at the hinges. Macy&#x27;s will replace, but at 28$, it&#x27;s unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Excellent recommend 100%</li>
            <li> Clinique is the best out there!!  This powder is on of my favorites to hide the wrinkles that have been showing up lately.</li>
            <li> Too expensive.. Too light,,,</li>
            <li> very good product! and arrived on the agreed date! I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my wife，she was very like it .It&#x27;s a good gift, and it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
            <li> I love it is the only brand I use that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin!</li>
            <li> Great my girlfriend cant be happier</li>
            <li> very pleased with Clinique products</li>
            <li> Es un producto muy bueno lo pueden comprar tranquilamente el tono es exactamente el indicado un producto cien por ciento original</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne and very oily skin and started to see a new dermatologist that told me to stop using MAC blot powder Deep Dark because it was too heavy and to switch to Neutrogena or Clinique. I am brown skin, like the same brown as Oprah and Gabrielle Union and I got Stay Brandy. Goes on amazingly smooth , not heavy at all. It gives great coverage, its a light/medium coverage and helps very well with my oily nose and forehead. With MAC I used to apply every hour and with Clinique I go about two hours in the middle of applications. This stuff is great, and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The powder is a very good product. I totally recommended it because I love how my face look with this product.</li>
            <li> good product, offer matches what I like and what I wanted, I hope to have better deals in the future</li>
            <li> Clinique stay-matte makeup is my favorite, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I use this powder in combo with the foundation, and the look is flawless and natural.  This powder is not too heavy, and the coverage is buildable.  Great stuff by far.</li>
            <li> Great!...I have been using them for a while.</li>
            <li> llevo mucho tiempo usando esta marca y siempre me ha parecido de excelente calidad, tanto que ahora decidi completar la linea con la base liquida</li>
            <li> todo salio perfecto, tanto el envio como el paquete recibido, estan esplendidas, la hora de llegada fue la establecida por el vendedor</li>
            <li> the product completely meets my expectations in terms of price, comfort and use, it certainly was a good investment for me</li>
            <li> Muy bueno el producto igual al ofrecido llegando al tiempo estipulado de muy buena calidad en realidad muy complacido espero volver hacer negocios los recomiendo ampliamente</li>
            <li> Everything perfect! !!!</li>
            <li> I love Clinique products.  My skin is sensitive, and other products have sometimes burned or turned my skin red.  Not Clinique.  It&#x27;s fragrance free, too.</li>
            <li> My favorite powder makeup actually seems to make my skin healthier. Just seems to disappear pretty quick, I don&#x27;t use a whole lot.</li>
            <li> good product, good and excellent quality</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and in perfect conditions. It was perfectly wrapped and it was exactly as it was advertised. Congratulations! I liked it very much!</li>
            <li> this powder is very well made and looks great after applying.</li>
            <li> the reason I need to reapply is because I have Oily skin</li>
