            <li>I enjoyed this product!</li>
            <li>It is better if you get them from their website!</li>
            <li>I love Hairfinity!</li>
            <li>I love what hairfinity has done and continues to do for my hair!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>And bottle is so cute!</li>
            <li>Top notch, never stop selling this product!</li>
            <li>These work like magic!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love these supplements!</li>
            <li>But this product was amazing.</li>
            <li>this is an amazing product</li>
            <li>Simply amazing...</li>
            <li>Amazing product</li>
            <li>Amazing, just amazing.</li>
            <li>Then I started my own.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t even know what to say, take them at your own risk didn&#x27;t work for me but might work for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking this for about a week now, and I can honestly say that I already see results.</li>
            <li>It was perfect thank you so much</li>
            <li>and I was glad to see them on Amazon from a good seller.</li>
            <li>But not on its own.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is collar length and growing nicely.</li>
            <li>Came in good condition:)</li>
            <li>To each&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t remember having that kind of pain.  </li>
            <li>You do have to take care of your hair, so do not expect the vitamin to do all of the work on its own.</li>
            <li>a lot cheaper on their own website.</li>
            <li>I would rather stick to my own hair regimen, than take these pills.</li>
            <li>I believe I need more time to give a fair review so I will be ordering the vitamins again.</li>
            <li>but honestly its just your hair growing...</li>
            <li>Honestly, i dont see any changes or difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I heard so many good reports about this product before I started using it.  </li>
            <li>Great product have using it for 6 months now and have seen significant growth hair and nails.</li>
            <li>Very good for the first month.  </li>
            <li>Excellent have lots of new growth</li>
            <li>I recommend it; It is very good and the seller is responsible</li>
            <li>I have clear beautiful skin!!!</li>
            <li>mine grew very quickly !</li>
            <li>I was really excited about trying this product because of all the good reviews; however, after finishing my 1-month supply I saw no changes with my hair.</li>
            <li>The seller was also great because there was no hassle and the shipment was fast!</li>
            <li>Still taking but loved the price, no bad breakouts</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Please DO NOT take these vitamins if you want a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product. ..</li>
            <li>I love my amazon, just not for this.</li>
            <li>Love it love it.......</li>
            <li>used hairfinity for 4 weeks and my hair grew 4inches and looked more healthy than ever.</li>
            <li>my hair became better</li>
            <li>Also make sure you keep hair moisturized as it can increase dandruff.</li>
            <li>Being pleased by this, I took the serving size of 2 capsules a day for about a month.</li>
            <li>However, hairfinity makes hair healthier and fuller therefore allowing the newlygrown hair to be healthy and not susceptible to falling out immediately.</li>
            <li>an satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I just ordered more after my daughter (17yo)</li>
            <li>Rather be safe and just stick with taking biotin.</li>
            <li>I am writing about this product because their are many women like myself which will benefit from this product but will be discouraged because inaccurate reviews.  </li>
            <li>With any supplement you are taking you must maintain a healthy diet.</li>
            <li>I keep a healthy diet</li>
            <li>Eat healthy for maximum results, God Bless in your hair restoration journey.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s healthy</li>
            <li>What a lot of people are failing to realize with this product, is that it is not a miracle pill for hair growth, it is designed to promote healthy hair which will then lead to hair growth.</li>
            <li>Hairfinity has a combination of the vitamins needed for healthy hair NOT just biotin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my pills so upset I couldn&#x27;t get my supply this month</li>
            <li>Even touching scalp with just finger tips could be felt for mins after</li>
            <li>say maybe my hair was more tangled than before .About</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!it works wonders</li>
            <li>They where for my daughter she said that where ok</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a magic</li>
            <li>Read more</li>
            <li>Also, it isn&#x27;t cheap!</li>

            <li>I have since ordered two more bottle.  </li>
            <li>Bought these for my wife and she is already satisfied and seeing the results.</li>
            <li>I am glad I joined the Hairfinity Family.</li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>What is most noticeable to me is that my.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>(but I love drinking water also).  </li>
            <li>AND she felt her hair was shedding more than normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Maybe I should&#x27;ve drank more?)</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>So much better.</li>
            <li>Glad I use Hairburst now.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked and felt more healthy.</li>
            <li>I discontinued  as of today, because  I can&#x27;t risk getting any more bald spots..  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>but as I started feeling more and more thirsty, I started taking one.</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied....</li>
            <li>I have noticed its thicker and is so much more manageable.</li>
            <li>Okay product.</li>
            <li>For this reason I will continue to take the vitamins as my hair is much better controlled.</li>
            <li>Love the supplements.</li>
            <li>and I must say that it has made my hair healthy and grew ..</li>
            <li>Love this product, see results already.</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks healthy</li>
            <li>and I could not look at light!</li>
            <li>GNC biotin supplements have a healthy quantity of Bioton, that will not weaken your hair over time.  </li>
            <li>Take it into consideration :)</li>
            <li>so glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the result.</li>
            <li>I would never expect a pill to give me healthy hair, and yet this pill is doing just that.  </li>
            <li>so I am sure that plays a part as well.  </li>
            <li>I received better results from GNC HAIR NOURISH without the side effects of pimples.</li>
            <li>Love it and buy two bottles often, one for me and my daughter.</li>

            <li>One day I was browsing the internet looking for the best brand of biotin pills to help my hair grow back</li>
            <li>Read more</li>
            <li>Will post more updates in a month.</li>
            <li>My sisters love the vitamins.</li>
            <li>I will do a 3-month supply :)</li>
            <li>it really works!!!!</li>
            <li>Very exciting!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try using this product and I followed all the instructions did everything I was supposed to do</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>Now my beautiful skin is ruined so now instead of focusing on my hair journey I now have to focus on getting my skin clear again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product,  after the first month I started to see a difference</li>
            <li>I just want to add, I can grow my own hair and have been blessed to have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good growth aid if used consistently.</li>
            <li>I took of my hair before and after the results was amazing 2 inches in 2 weeks this product is amazing thanks.</li>
            <li>I would like my hair to grow itself healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll work fine for me .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing beautiful results in a short time that I have been using Hairfinity Healthy Hair Vitamins Supplements.</li>
            <li>my daughter loves it though I can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s a good product or not you have to try for yourself</li>
            <li>This product is good it really works</li>
            <li>I still purchase them because it DOES work, but I have started taking breaks because I don&#x27;t feel good after 10 days of taking them straight.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t really know if I&#x27;ve experienced tremendous hair growth.</li>
            <li>but my hairfinity was packaged properly excited to try and see if it work :)</li>
            <li>They are easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>Hair growth, softer hair, easy to take supplements.</li>
            <li>nails are stronger, and do not beak easily.</li>
            <li>But it is easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>IT LEFT ME WITH A FACE FULL OF ACNE &amp; BLACKHEADS!!!!</li>
            <li>amazing this grew my hair and my nails out in the first week.</li>
            <li>so I wash my hair and a hand full came out more than ever before I wrote that off</li>
            <li>Thank you for this wonderful product I bought for my daughter, she saw it on YouTube last  year and her hair grew a lot and is much softer looks extremely healthy and</li>
            <li>Drink LOTS of water and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>It worked fine.</li>
            <li>I will say that ever since I stopped taking them my scalp has been fine</li>
            <li>I am sure my body liked the vitamins, but I saw no change in my normal growth of hair</li>
            <li>These really work and I couldn&#x27;t be anymore pleased!</li>
            <li>It grows pretty fast on its own, but I thought it would be nice to get some help.</li>
            <li>The very first thing she said was, &amp;#34;Oh my god, Tarra!</li>
            <li>But, I am given a low dose of replacement therapy just to keep me happy.</li>
            <li>this is the second time we ordered it my family happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great actually feel a difference in my hair...</li>
            <li>Even taking the vitamins once daily I have experienced growth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been only 3 weeks since I have been using this product, but others I know who have used it said it works great.</li>
            <li>Hair growth &amp; looking fabulous</li>
            <li>and I notice light bleeding as I started these.</li>
            <li>Experienced lots of itching initially.  </li>
            <li>This product is a great product for those who can actually use it.</li>
            <li>the shipping is free so it all evened out.</li>
            <li>To be honest I haven&#x27;t noticed much in the way of growth but from the day after I took the pills</li>
            <li>So far good...</li>
            <li>8/17 So far so good, hair is growing.  </li>
            <li>HairFinity Healthy Hair Complex is wonderful.  </li>

            <li>I can defiantly see a change in length within the first month!!</li>
            <li>Do not buy this product, and please do not use it on younger children, and if anything says it has no side effects, and it is too good to be true, do not believe it!</li>
            <li>I resorted to all kinds of hair extentions for my original look.  </li>
            <li>First couple weeks skin broke our, I put toothpaste on the pimples and my hair and skin is getting better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try this</li>
            <li>Mostly when I first get out of bed in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I noticed  significant hair  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased with my first purchase that I purchased another bottle.  </li>
            <li>but I originally purchased it thinking it will regrow a receding hairline</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m seeing significant improvement.</li>
            <li>A few of my co-workers used this product and there hair look good and mine is more healthy looking and growing.</li>
            <li>a lot cheaper on original cite.</li>
            <li>I saw a significant difference in my hair length.</li>
            <li>had to clean it all one by one.</li>
            <li>Eat right!</li>
            <li>My hair has grown tremendously but ordering them from the original site will save u money.</li>
            <li>RECEIVED IN ORDER, WILL POST MY RESULTS WHEN IT&#x27;S FINISH AND SEE IF IT&#x27;S WISE TO PURCHASE A SECOND BOTTLE.</li>
            <li>Cause this product worked to it full expectation.</li>
            <li>I tried everything i could, deep conditionded and took REALLY good care of my hair with protective styles and all.</li>
            <li>I love that getting longer, thicker, healthier hair this product really works</li>
            <li>this is a lifesaver I am in love with this product I would recommend it to all my friends and family it really works.  </li>
            <li>Oh yes, I recall that my hair did very well, too :)</li>
            <li>I will not state a full review for her...</li>
            <li>but I have a full head of baby hair on the fronts that I haven&#x27;t seen in years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suggestion: ManeChoice! (Been using for almost a month and hair is already getting full, no chipping nails and my skin is</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, and I recommend it to anyone looking to hide some bald spots. :)</li>
            <li>Love it so so sooooooooo much</li>
            <li>full bc</li>
            <li>Gas, and nauxia, also feeling drowsy throughout the day, but so far so good I will complete my first month and of results very and become more effective</li>
            <li>Received QUICKLY...</li>
            <li>I had moderate fitting on the top of my head</li>
            <li>Received order quickly,</li>
            <li>Shipped to me quickly.  </li>
            <li>Happy to find such a fast shipper too.</li>
            <li>Arrival was quick.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing quickly with this product.</li>
            <li>had mild breakage</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now a loyal customer</li>
            <li>My hair was blading in the top in the top of my head and in a month it  was growing back</li>
            <li>but I have to say that so far I&#x27;ve been able to notice a huge difference in my hair growth.</li>
            <li>I took the whole month supply and got such great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first bottle,I haven&#x27;t notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my hairfinity vitamins I&#x27;ve immediately saw results in the 2nd week of use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also important to note that I have had tons of BREAKOUTS from this product on my first week of use.</li>
            <li>But she felt her hair was shedding more than normal as well.</li>
            <li>Now they are super strong and grow fast.</li>
            <li>Protective styles are best as well where you&#x27;ll see much of a difference, due to the fact you won&#x27;t be combing your hair as much causing breakage .</li>
            <li>I am however hoping to see some results, and when I do, I will gladly write a new review.</li>
            <li>I used to have nails that were really flexible and would break easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and my hair grew 2inches so fast!!</li>
            <li>Believe me this stuff really works!!</li>
            <li>you can tell after just the first week in the condition of your hair!</li>
            <li>My hair grew back in no time &amp; it also helped my nails grow strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>Came really fast, works fine</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m really excited to the see the outcome since my cousin has had positive results</li>
            <li>B00PWQTG8E Omegaboost Biotin for Stronger Hair and Nails]], and the combined effect of both pills is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>My daughter was the one who persuaded me to try it as she has been using it for a few months with great results.</li>
            <li>but I want to know for my own personal experience on what took place for my hair.</li>
            <li>After reading through several reviews and doing some research on my own I decided to order</li>
            <li>I started with freshly clipped ends, split ends will cause breakage and you will not see growth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth your money and time.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it so grateful for these pills</li>
            <li>(Each bottle contains a month&#x27;s worth of pills).</li>
            <li>So far I am definitely satisfied my hair is stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li>It got my hair really full the first month.</li>
            <li>I am now taking it for a third month and is honestly feel like there is no change.</li>
            <li>Hairfinity is like a hair growth multi, it contains many different ingredients to help your hair grow, which is why I recommend taking it with a straight biotin supplement as biotin is the most important supplement that most people are short on.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really been able to tell much of a difference in GROWTH</li>
            <li>I began taking these pills along with my psoriasis treatment to hit it from the inside and outside, and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>So far I have seen okay improvement (3weeks).</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t worth the money if you just plan on buying it once so either stick to it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this at a better price than other places.</li>
            <li>They were shipped super fast!</li>
            <li>and I still waiting for the right.</li>
            <li>I got these in the mail right on time</li>
            <li>Also you have to eat right , drink water and workout</li>
            <li>Will not see results right away.</li>
            <li>and it came right on schedule</li>
            <li>I will admit at first my hair seemed to be shedding more but the new growth is coming in much faster.</li>
            <li>Although this product works, it made me ridiculously thirsty - to a point where I didn&#x27;t feel good!</li>
            <li>This product really works and is amazing but only if you want your hair thicker not longer.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping....</li>
            <li>I would not have experienced physical distress if this vitamin only did that.</li>
            <li>I cut my hair down to the natural curl and it was beautiful,</li>
            <li>the shipping on the website is very fast</li>
            <li>I have soft curly, fine hair</li>
            <li>That causes a little dryness, so I also use Jamaican oils that got good ratings from Amazon.com</li>
            <li>It is natural hair with no dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a light mousse for styling.</li>
            <li>Amazon, WHY so much?!</li>
            <li>My hair started shedding and breaking alot after the first month.</li>
            <li>First started taking it, and I broke out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it have a different effect on everyone</li>
            <li>For some reason, out of all of the hair pills I have tried these were the only ones that I had satisfying results with.</li>
            <li>Some of my pills were opened in my first package but ordered again</li>
            <li>Will write a review once I finish with first botle</li>
            <li>Love this, wife&#x27;s hair has finally started growing with this product.</li>
            <li>Sadly, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of ordering the hair skin nails from Amazon the first time and paid $60 for the product.</li>
            <li>Definitely will try 1 more bottle to see what happens if not</li>
            <li>It came just in time even though the first time there was a mistake with shipping.</li>
            <li>I noticed hair growth my first week.</li>
            <li>I took it almost every day for those first two months.</li>
            <li>Just started using it, hoping to see results after the first  month.</li>
            <li>After taking it the first month my hair was thicker, fuller and had grown almost an inch.</li>
            <li>My hair is really growing!</li>
            <li>First things first - do not buy from this seller ...</li>
            <li>have had a MUCH better experience with Nature&#x27;s Bounty Hair Skin &amp; Nails Extra Strength.</li>
            <li>I truly believe it&#x27;s the higher dose of Biotin in the Nature&#x27;s Bounty that makes the hair stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am definitely getting over that problem, but there is more work to do.</li>
            <li>I just finish my first bottle of hair infinity and it seems to be growing my hair.</li>
            <li>The first month I noticed a change in thickness.  </li>
            <li>Within the first two weeks of using Hairfinity my hair started to grow.</li>
            <li>This was for my sister and she love it her hair actually growing</li>
            <li>I ordered two bottles &amp; it really works!</li>
            <li>but they really do!</li>
            <li>Anyone whose wanting to try these please do they really work!</li>
            <li>makes your hair grow so fast!</li>
            <li>This is not a 1 time trial you must stick with the product will definitely be purchasing more on a monthly basis</li>
            <li>You still need to apply necessary protecting products in order for your hair to grow healthy.</li>
            <li>I really think this is overrated, because prior to this I was taking regular multi vitamins and experienced increased hair growth.</li>
            <li>cant wait till my 2nd bottle is done :)</li>
            <li>My hair grew 3 inches with the first bottle.</li>
            <li>** but get my hair fuller the first month.</li>
            <li>They were $11.99  and same ingredients -more</li>
            <li>Since then I started drinking more water for overall health.</li>
            <li>I have almost completed my first month using Hairfinity.</li>
            <li>I was told that I must use it consistently by my hair dresser.</li>
            <li>I have pics on my Facebook page for those interested.</li>
            <li>, I eat healthily and consume plenty of vegetables and fruits daily.</li>
            <li>Second bottle and my hair is longer and more manageable</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; cause I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 8 days</li>
            <li>I just started using this product for the first time.</li>
            <li>Hairfinity is making my hair grow so much!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure I will go back to using my GNC hair skin and nails formula.</li>
            <li>First bottle seems to be working well.  </li>
            <li>I started noticing results after I had almost finished my first bottle.</li>
            <li>At first, I took the two pills a day</li>
            <li>what I did notice was better manageability of the short hairs around my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try a different brand and see if I get better results with that one.</li>
            <li>It caused me to have itching and a rash when I first started taking them.  </li>
            <li>I am white but my hair is more frizzy kinky than most white girls.</li>
            <li>They changed my normal body smell and made my lady parts super fishy.</li>
            <li>she said my hair is Very soft and full of life compared to before.</li>
            <li>Through Instagram I found a distributor&#x27;s website kmstarks.myitworks.com and am now paying only $33 for the product (worth EVERY penny!!).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an amazing product especially if you are going natural and drinking plenty if water.  </li>
            <li>I honestly think it took some of my hair out and brought back an old scalp condition ( psoriasis).</li>
            <li>This is my third bottle and I am loving the results so far.</li>
            <li>I see that it works good on African American hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hairfinity is NOT a bad product, it&#x27;s an OKAY product with a high price point, and it&#x27;s certainly not a miracle product.</li>
            <li>It really works I saw the difference in my hair after the first day I started using them</li>
            <li>Firstly, I&#x27;d like to say that I am not the one to do reviews unless I absolutely need to as in this</li>
            <li>I notice a difference in how full and soft my hair has become.</li>
            <li>the receding is not noticeable any bald spots are now filled in w/ new growth &amp; I can see new hair growing, baby bangs etc.</li>
            <li>and I had irritation-not sure of its related to the vitamins or the product, but I will go back to the Original Proactiv and stay on Country Life Maxi Hair.  </li>
            <li>I knew it was the vitamins because it was the only thing different from my very healthy diet and exercise routine over the three month period.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend them to anyone who wants to grow long healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really seen much improvement but my hair has grown about 2-3 inches in the first month taking it .</li>
            <li>They had a strong odor that the others did not have and they looked different.</li>
            <li>The pills made my hair thicker in certain places.</li>
            <li>Hair grows healthy based upon your diet on a normal basis without any supplement, so if you use a supplement the results are on an individualized basis because everyone hair growth is different and your state of health determine how fast your hair grows.  </li>
            <li>me try waste money many people does work for them furious for me!</li>
            <li>These supplements did not agree with my body and upon the first week of taking them, it caused me to experience my menstrul cycle early and took an entire month before it stopped and became better regulated.</li>
            <li>Most products do make your hair longer to an extent, but then the newly added length quickly falls out due to its frailness.</li>
            <li>My previous experience was very positive: My fingernails had phenomenal improvement and growth.</li>
            <li>I expected way more results since the results on the official hairfinity site gives positive comments .</li>
            <li>For me, the first thing I notice was that my edges filled in right away, not much length</li>
            <li>But if you use it like me and many other people, stop doing the things that broke your hair off in the first place or modify it.</li>
            <li>Not sure about my hair growing (although I think it is longer in the month I&#x27;ve been taking this supplement) but nails are super strong now!  </li>
            <li>Using this product my hair has not grown at all and my blood pressure has been very high.  </li>
            <li>Some say natrol biotin works well for them, but im sticking with omegaboost as its 5,000MCG and seems to be very high quality.</li>
            <li>That may be due to the fact that my hair is already pretty healthy (thanks to my stylist).</li>
            <li>this product is amazing I could show inches in just a few weeks</li>
            <li>I ordered another bottle because I noticed how much thicker my hair has become</li>
            <li>My hair is longer and thicker and doesn&#x27;t fall out as much as it used to.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>Thanks for tiger speedy delivery</li>
            <li>I took the pills for two months, &amp; I had gotten much itchiness in my Scalp.</li>
            <li>I used this product for 2 months and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I studied photos of real testimonies followed by people&#x27;s journey with their day to day, month to month journeys.</li>
            <li>and it really grew my hair</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen so much improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>Phenylalanine is 50% aspartame - which is carcinogenic and can cause cellular damage if consumed too much.</li>
            <li>Your hair is growing so fast</li>
            <li>ordered a six-month supply and continued to astound my hairdresser about how much healthier and longer my hair was.</li>
            <li>I hope to notice a real difference in a month or so..</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>It really is growing my hair.</li>
            <li>My mom also takes them and I can really see the difference in her hair.</li>
            <li>Not trying to grow fast hair with a mustache.</li>
            <li>Really I would advise everyone to use it</li>
            <li>Now its time to see if it really works</li>
            <li>I was very elated to have found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the product, but it got here really fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But my body hair haven&#x27;t been growing fast at all ...</li>
            <li>This product have really improved my hair shredding.</li>
            <li>I used them for about 2 months and didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t believe it my real hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s growing fast too.</li>
            <li>friend who was very worried about me asked me if there&#x27;s any medicine im taking everyday,i told him none except for my hair vitamins.</li>
            <li>This is a real review.</li>
            <li>These really work.</li>
            <li>made my BIGCHOP much easier....</li>
            <li>i was very hesitant to trying this..</li>
            <li>looks very</li>
            <li>but i really works</li>
            <li>so much so that I wear headbands all the time.  </li>
            <li>I started getting really discouraged</li>
            <li>its much cheaper</li>
            <li>no matter how much I conditioned and oiled it.</li>
            <li>and she said that they really make your hair grow</li>
            <li>I really wish I would have done my homework before buying these.</li>
            <li>See how much my hair has grown.  </li>
            <li>nails grew fast</li>
            <li>HAIRFINITY HAS REALLY WRK FOR ME</li>
            <li>Thanks Hairfinity.</li>
            <li>It scared me so much, that I refuse to take these pills anymore.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper buying it from hairfinity.com:/&lt;br</li>
            <li>did not work made me eat too much the B vitamins in it.</li>
            <li>Now I have acne on the whole side of my face.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I am going to give it another 60 days to really tell a difference before I give the 5 star review</li>
            <li>My hair shedded so much after I comb it and get it out the sink</li>
            <li>With Amazon Prime I&#x27;ll get it in 2 days which is much quicker.</li>
            <li>suffered a lot of hair loss around my hairline 6 months after giving birth, and since taking the pills the shorts hairs are sitting in place in the direction they should be instead of straight up on end and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I know it will because I have seen real results in all my friends hair.</li>
            <li>After about a month I really noticed a difference in the fullness and texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>My shedding had almost completely stopped and was so amazed that rarely I would lose even one strand of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair began to break off much easier and appeared to be weaker.</li>
            <li>I purchased these from the HairFinity website where they are much cheaper...</li>
            <li>They work very well</li>
            <li>Much cheaper</li>
            <li>so therefore I can&#x27;t say if it really has worked or not.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t finish the whole bottle</li>
            <li>These pills really work.</li>
            <li>Ice been taking the pills for about a month and can really see the growth and my thickness is returning.  </li>
            <li>I was told this product really works.</li>
            <li>But thanks</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen results</li>
            <li>thanks for the hair infinity</li>
            <li>This product is the BOMB, it really really works.</li>
            <li>really like the taste of the pill.</li>
            <li>or just don&#x27;t buy it because you won&#x27;t really see any improvements.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much for my hair</li>
            <li>My hair growth is substantial, my nails are long and strong, and my hair is also thicker.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that my hair did grow faster than my normal hair growth pace !</li>
            <li>I took this religiously for a full month...did not see much or any growth.  </li>
            <li>I bought a two month supply and with in the first 2 weeks I had improvement in my hair as far as the condition of it as well as the bald spot was showing signs of growth at the end of the two month supply</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 23 and have a head full of hair..</li>
            <li>I just love the results after 60 days of hairfinity vitamins, now starting my 3rd bottle, thanks infinity.</li>
            <li>It took most of my adolescent years to get my hair to even reach down to my shoulders.</li>
            <li>It seems a little soon to be rating, so I can&#x27;t be completely honest in my review; so far Hairfinity does seem to be making my hair thicker.</li>
            <li>I read so many reviews about this product, good and bad, and decided to try it for myself.  </li>
            <li>I checked the customer reviews and YouTube videos for more options also to see if it had any serous side effects, saw some good and bad reviews so to try it</li>
            <li>anyone who isn&#x27;t getting the results they want with these comb/brush your hair less and drink more water.&lt;br /&gt;Buy from the site...</li>
            <li>My hair is stronger, sheds less, looks as if i have more shine and moisture...</li>
            <li>Actually made my hair grow quick</li>
            <li>I know thye said your hair can grow slower as you get older, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure each individual has different results.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll be starting my second bottle and hope I to see more growth.</li>
            <li>This bottle arrived in a decent time frame.</li>
            <li>I got an MRI and had 3 unidentified spots on my brain, and they considered brain surgery, but they waited and a year later they were stable, but the thing is when I stopped taking hairfinity all the symptoms went away, and then I decided to try it one more time, and the symptoms came back!</li>
            <li>Acne was my main concern from reviews.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited and looking forward to the long term results.</li>
            <li>Biotin is the active ingredient in tgis pill, and cost less in any retail store and give better results!!</li>
            <li>From someone who has literally tried every hair growth pill that is offered, I highly recommend hairfinity.</li>
            <li>I do have acid reflux and high blood pressure</li>
            <li>the cost on here is way to high, it&#x27;s cheaper everywhere else</li>
            <li>Highly  recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Granted, this is not a controlled experiment because I started some other things, too, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a critical element in the process.</li>
            <li>So far I really like it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and my hair is growing out much faster.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s my normal growth.</li>
            <li>Is this normal?</li>
            <li>A waste cuz more damage to my hair</li>
            <li>I will try to update in a few more months.</li>
            <li>I normally can&#x27;t get pass shoulder.  </li>
            <li>when normally my hair grows soooo slooooow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair normally takes forever to grow</li>
            <li>This product definitely helped the overall appearance of my hair, As far as being shiny And more body.</li>
            <li>In accordance with me using a few more others products..</li>
            <li>I would like this product so much more if it weren&#x27;t as heavily endorsed by celebs who never use it, and convince us of growth through clip-ins and hair extensions.</li>
            <li>and I normally have think hair.</li>
            <li>and my hairline was standing in the left and right corners.</li>
            <li>I used it for maybe 2 weeks when I noticed my new mustache, I was done with the product.</li>
            <li>I STARTED TAKING HAIRNAMICS, a new hair vitamin that has iron in it, and I got over 6 inches of new growth.</li>
            <li>Plus it is windy where i live and that can damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I will be finishing product and searching for a new product....</li>
            <li>After the 1st month there was a lot of new growth &amp;</li>
            <li>When you stop taking the pills and your new growth starts to come in, you will notice the difference in texture from when you&#x27;ve been taking supplements.</li>
            <li>My hair is thicker, longer, fuller, and the bald spots show new growth.  </li>
            <li>Came on time, have notice new growth</li>
            <li>My hairdresser said I have so much new growth</li>
            <li>Also drink water everyday see better results if you do abs no breakouts for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sought out many miracle hair pills or treatments that had very little if and results.</li>
            <li>At first it appeared to be getting longer but definitely thinner.</li>
            <li>Not only did they significantly make my hair longer, but my hair actually felt a lot stronger and healthier that it ever has.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been consistent, but haven&#x27;t noticed anything different as of yet.</li>
            <li>I am three weeks into my first bottle and i notice my edges starting to fill in</li>
            <li>but this is only the first bottle</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what they have in hairfinity that causes this, but they need to take it off the market or something cuz it makes no sense to keep selling it when so many people report it causes excessive shedding #ijs - Google Hairfinity side effects or shedding</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful hair and vitamin supplement, I have been using it for 2 years and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle, I have three pills left.</li>
            <li>but so far I can see it&#x27;s looking healthier!</li>
            <li>The biotin is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>and I have not consumed any more water than usual.</li>
            <li>Got the product in a timely manner without any problems and so far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it!</li>
            <li>and I already see my hair starting to grow at first I was using Rogaine but didn&#x27;t get any results.</li>
            <li>Im usually not the type to write any reviews for any product</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and the first bottle that I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li>When they arrived in the mail I noticed that although they did seem larger that the average hair growth pill, they didn’t have the foul odor that most of these products tend to have.</li>
            <li>I wash and deep condition my hair once per week, moisturize my braids and scalp every other day and take my hairfinity, making sure to drink at least 3 bottled waters a day and sometimes more.</li>
            <li>What I think is the true difference between hairfinity and other biotin based hair growth products</li>
            <li>I suggest that they buy certain amounts and only reorder when they are out to ensure that the product does not sit for a while.</li>
            <li>I also kept my hair clean and oiled, I do not put my hair in a ponytail and keep it down or wrapped with a silk scarf at all times.</li>
            <li>I have noticed significant growth and less shedding since I began using Hairfinity.</li>
            <li>I live in NYC and consider myself in decent physical shape.</li>
            <li>I bought this product from Brock beauty clearly cheaper than here</li>
            <li>If they don&#x27;t respond, steer clear.</li>
            <li>( at least my friends are telling me this), so far I can not tell. :)</li>
            <li>I have been using the product since November and have clearly seen an improvement in the growth and strength of my hair.</li>
            <li>Did not grow hair as fast as expected (this was after using them for 2 months straight).</li>
            <li>I am nearly 60 years old</li>
            <li>They told me now I have to wash my hair with a medicated shampoo because it developed a fungus in my scalp, and because I decided to stop taking the pills within those two months I did experience some hair loss around my edges.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see an obvious difference with the use of this product.</li>
            <li>I studied the actual growth of real testimonies before I invested in this product.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li>I have not purchased this from amazon, but from hairfinity site directly.</li>
            <li>I only used it once haven&#x27;t seen much difference</li>
            <li>My Order Came In Early</li>
            <li>Overall god product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thought I was getting a deal, but was Cheaper  on direct website</li>
            <li>Wow, I am amazed on the on how Hairfinity transform my hair.</li>
            <li>my bald spot is completely gone.</li>
            <li>The expiration date has been rubbed off of product, could be old product.</li>
            <li>My hair has become thicker and and grown considerably.</li>
            <li>How old do you have to be to use it?</li>
            <li>you could tell the product was old.</li>
            <li>and I used MSM before which was in a natural joint med</li>
            <li>I have not had any problems with Hairfinity so far.</li>
            <li>Buy from the actual website it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>As far as the acne breakout...</li>
            <li>I look like a 13 year old hitting puberty again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 9½ months  </li>
            <li>it is working so far.</li>
            <li>this our 2nd bottle we will be put in another order soon Thank you so much....</li>
            <li>For two weeks straight, I took the recommended dose of two pills daily.</li>
            <li>and I already have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Since I started taking these pills my face has cleared completely up</li>
            <li>and I must say, I&#x27;m surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li>So far it has been a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>They also appear healthier as they have a natural &amp;#34;sheen&amp;#34; to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hairdresser even asked me if I were doing anything different to my hair in between visits because it was growing so fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural</li>
            <li>Pills appeared old and dust covered the inside of bottle.</li>
            <li>If you have unhealthy hair, do not expect this to work for you by itself, you really need to have a healthy hair regime.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was not worth the health risks and  face and chest full of pimples.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical to try this product because I was already taking 5,000 mcg of Biotin and saw that this product also contained biotin (good for hair, skin and nails).</li>
            <li>My hair has not grown in length, and it does continue to have shedding (even when I trimmed my ends), but my edges appear to be growing back in, which was one of my main concerns.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion and from experience, I HIGHLY suggest you to try Nature&#x27;s Bounty Hair Skin &amp; Nails Extra Strength instead of Hairfinity.</li>
            <li>I am starting  on my second bottle,  and so far I have not seen much difference.  </li>
            <li>Stopped taking them, back to normal.</li>
            <li>My hair does NOT grow at all and this product actually helped with new growth and my already existing hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hairfinity for  about 6 months now I believe, and I&#x27;m starting to see new growth around my edges, and some thickness.</li>
            <li>I actually have to get my braids redone because of the new growth.</li>
            <li>Compared pills to a earlier batch and the new pills were darker in color and smelled.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t normally touch of my roots but every 6-8 weeks and and within less than a month I have a lot of new growth!!</li>
            <li>I have very thin hair at the very top of my head,</li>
            <li>and I see a major difference in length .</li>
            <li>Major acne.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and so far, so geeat!</li>
            <li>I have bought a two-months supply directly from the supplier for a total of 48$</li>
            <li>To me they barely did sh</li>
            <li>All the posts about two inch difference in one month aren&#x27;t possible unless your hair naturally does this.</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;ve seen a different in my hair roots already</li>
            <li>Maybe  one or more  are broken  in the  bottle.</li>
            <li>I was using these for a little while, but then I decided to stop since it didn&#x27;t sit right with me.</li>
            <li>My pills arrived within 2 days, with no loose powder.</li>
            <li>My hair is growning but not as fast as other women  stated in their video.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for a month and have just ordered a second month&#x27;s supply only because not only I, but my hairdresser has noticed new growth.  </li>
            <li>Its letters and design on the bottle was coming off and some of the product in the bottle was starting to leak inside the causing it to change from clear to sandy white within a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure taking Biotin and MSM will yield the same results without the unnecessary junk.</li>
            <li>My sister don&#x27;t have the same issues that I have as far as hair goes, and has very pretty thick hair.</li>
            <li>At first I could not believe the strength of this formerly vitamins my hair was not growing at all, and now after using these pills it grow 2 inches in less than one month</li>
            <li>Have spent a small fortune on a lot of other stuff, nice to see something actually works.</li>
            <li>Apparently the MSM in it flushes out toxins and without enough water to flush those toxins</li>
            <li>(no it&#x27;s not grey yet)</li>
            <li>And also my month supply bottle actually came with a few days extra worth of pills....</li>
            <li>My hair was so Full and thick.</li>
            <li>My ends were really shedding and I have seen less breakage</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very insucure about my hair for some odd reason</li>
            <li>Been taking it almost a month now and starting to notice a little improvement; my first bottle from Amazon, I only got 59 capsules...</li>
            <li>(sorry if that offends anyone, me saying &amp;#34;black girl&amp;#34;) and for me its extremly hard to grow nice length and volume hair.</li>
            <li>These vitamins are a little large and gel caps.</li>
            <li>I do not flat iron anymore</li>
            <li>You can get similar results if not better with the right vitamins at a cheaper price too.</li>
            <li>Did not notice much growth but only used for a month and half.</li>
            <li>it is really working I have only been using for a little over a month now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read several reviews on the good &amp; bad for Hairfinity</li>

            <li> I ignored the possibility that these pills were the reason for the improvement in my hair and just assumed that the cooler weather was having a good affect on my hair.</li>

            <li> While the expiration date meant that the supplements were still good, the inside of the  bottle was powdery.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, it is a good product.</li>

            <li> I love Hairfinity!</li>
            <li> I love what hairfinity has done and continues to do for my hair!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> And bottle is so cute!</li>
            <li> Top notch, never stop selling this product!</li>
            <li> These work like magic!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love these supplements!</li>
            <li> But this product was amazing.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product</li>
            <li> Simply amazing...</li>
            <li> Amazing product</li>
            <li> Amazing, just amazing.</li>
            <li> Then I started my own.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t even know what to say, take them at your own risk didn&#x27;t work for me but might work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for about a week now, and I can honestly say that I already see results.</li>
            <li> It was perfect thank you so much</li>
            <li> and I was glad to see them on Amazon from a good seller.</li>
            <li> But not on its own.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is collar length and growing nicely.</li>
            <li> Came in good condition:)</li>
            <li> To each&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t remember having that kind of pain.  </li>
            <li> You do have to take care of your hair, so do not expect the vitamin to do all of the work on its own.</li>
            <li> a lot cheaper on their own website.</li>
            <li> I would rather stick to my own hair regimen, than take these pills.</li>
            <li> I believe I need more time to give a fair review so I will be ordering the vitamins again.</li>
            <li> but honestly its just your hair growing...</li>
            <li> Honestly, i dont see any changes or difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I heard so many good reports about this product before I started using it.  </li>
            <li> Great product have using it for 6 months now and have seen significant growth hair and nails.</li>
            <li> Very good for the first month.  </li>
            <li> Excellent have lots of new growth</li>
            <li> I recommend it; It is very good and the seller is responsible</li>
            <li> I have clear beautiful skin!!!</li>
            <li> mine grew very quickly !</li>
            <li> I was really excited about trying this product because of all the good reviews; however, after finishing my 1-month supply I saw no changes with my hair.</li>
            <li> The seller was also great because there was no hassle and the shipment was fast!</li>
            <li> Still taking but loved the price, no bad breakouts</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Please DO NOT take these vitamins if you want a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product. ..</li>
            <li> I love my amazon, just not for this.</li>
            <li> Love it love it.......</li>
            <li> used hairfinity for 4 weeks and my hair grew 4inches and looked more healthy than ever.</li>
            <li> my hair became better</li>
            <li> Also make sure you keep hair moisturized as it can increase dandruff.</li>
            <li> Being pleased by this, I took the serving size of 2 capsules a day for about a month.</li>
            <li> However, hairfinity makes hair healthier and fuller therefore allowing the newlygrown hair to be healthy and not susceptible to falling out immediately.</li>
            <li> an satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I just ordered more after my daughter (17yo)</li>
            <li> Rather be safe and just stick with taking biotin.</li>
            <li> I am writing about this product because their are many women like myself which will benefit from this product but will be discouraged because inaccurate reviews.  </li>
            <li> With any supplement you are taking you must maintain a healthy diet.</li>
            <li> I keep a healthy diet</li>
            <li> Eat healthy for maximum results, God Bless in your hair restoration journey.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s healthy</li>
            <li> What a lot of people are failing to realize with this product, is that it is not a miracle pill for hair growth, it is designed to promote healthy hair which will then lead to hair growth.</li>
            <li> Hairfinity has a combination of the vitamins needed for healthy hair NOT just biotin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my pills so upset I couldn&#x27;t get my supply this month</li>
            <li> Even touching scalp with just finger tips could be felt for mins after</li>
            <li> say maybe my hair was more tangled than before .About</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!it works wonders</li>
            <li> They where for my daughter she said that where ok</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a magic</li>
            <li> Read more</li>

            <li> I Love ❤</li>
            <li> NOT recommended if you are not in the habit of drinking 8 glasses of water or more a day.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling healthy, must drink lots of water.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have since ordered two more bottle.  </li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife and she is already satisfied and seeing the results.</li>
            <li> I am glad I joined the Hairfinity Family.</li>
            <li> This product is ok.</li>
            <li> What is most noticeable to me is that my.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> (but I love drinking water also).  </li>
            <li> AND she felt her hair was shedding more than normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Maybe I should&#x27;ve drank more?)</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> So much better.</li>
            <li> Glad I use Hairburst now.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked and felt more healthy.</li>
            <li> I discontinued  as of today, because  I can&#x27;t risk getting any more bald spots..  </li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> but as I started feeling more and more thirsty, I started taking one.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied....</li>
            <li> I have noticed its thicker and is so much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Okay product.</li>
            <li> For this reason I will continue to take the vitamins as my hair is much better controlled.</li>
            <li> Love the supplements.</li>
            <li> and I must say that it has made my hair healthy and grew ..</li>
            <li> Love this product, see results already.</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks healthy</li>
            <li> and I could not look at light!</li>
            <li> GNC biotin supplements have a healthy quantity of Bioton, that will not weaken your hair over time.  </li>
            <li> Take it into consideration :)</li>
            <li> so glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the result.</li>
            <li> I would never expect a pill to give me healthy hair, and yet this pill is doing just that.  </li>
            <li> so I am sure that plays a part as well.  </li>
            <li> I received better results from GNC HAIR NOURISH without the side effects of pimples.</li>
            <li> Love it and buy two bottles often, one for me and my daughter.</li>
            <li> and I love the results  </li>
            <li> Im in love with this pills..</li>
            <li> im going to order more until i reach my desired lenght</li>
            <li> Great product and it really works.</li>
            <li> One day I was browsing the internet looking for the best brand of biotin pills to help my hair grow back</li>
            <li> Read more</li>
            <li> Will post more updates in a month.</li>
            <li> My sisters love the vitamins.</li>
            <li> I will do a 3-month supply :)</li>
            <li> it really works!!!!</li>
            <li> Very exciting!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try using this product and I followed all the instructions did everything I was supposed to do</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this.  </li>
            <li> Now my beautiful skin is ruined so now instead of focusing on my hair journey I now have to focus on getting my skin clear again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product,  after the first month I started to see a difference</li>
            <li> I just want to add, I can grow my own hair and have been blessed to have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good growth aid if used consistently.</li>
            <li> I took of my hair before and after the results was amazing 2 inches in 2 weeks this product is amazing thanks.</li>
            <li> I would like my hair to grow itself healthy and strong.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll work fine for me .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing beautiful results in a short time that I have been using Hairfinity Healthy Hair Vitamins Supplements.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it though I can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s a good product or not you have to try for yourself</li>
            <li> This product is good it really works</li>
            <li> I still purchase them because it DOES work, but I have started taking breaks because I don&#x27;t feel good after 10 days of taking them straight.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t really know if I&#x27;ve experienced tremendous hair growth.</li>
            <li> but my hairfinity was packaged properly excited to try and see if it work :)</li>
            <li> They are easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> Hair growth, softer hair, easy to take supplements.</li>
            <li> nails are stronger, and do not beak easily.</li>
            <li> But it is easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> IT LEFT ME WITH A FACE FULL OF ACNE &amp; BLACKHEADS!!!!</li>
            <li> amazing this grew my hair and my nails out in the first week.</li>
            <li> so I wash my hair and a hand full came out more than ever before I wrote that off</li>
            <li> Thank you for this wonderful product I bought for my daughter, she saw it on YouTube last  year and her hair grew a lot and is much softer looks extremely healthy and</li>
            <li> Drink LOTS of water and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> It worked fine.</li>
            <li> I will say that ever since I stopped taking them my scalp has been fine</li>
            <li> I am sure my body liked the vitamins, but I saw no change in my normal growth of hair</li>
            <li> These really work and I couldn&#x27;t be anymore pleased!</li>
            <li> It grows pretty fast on its own, but I thought it would be nice to get some help.</li>
            <li> The very first thing she said was, &amp;#34;Oh my god, Tarra!</li>
            <li> But, I am given a low dose of replacement therapy just to keep me happy.</li>
            <li> this is the second time we ordered it my family happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great actually feel a difference in my hair...</li>
            <li> Even taking the vitamins once daily I have experienced growth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been only 3 weeks since I have been using this product, but others I know who have used it said it works great.</li>
            <li> Hair growth &amp; looking fabulous</li>
            <li> and I notice light bleeding as I started these.</li>
            <li> Experienced lots of itching initially.  </li>
            <li> This product is a great product for those who can actually use it.</li>
            <li> the shipping is free so it all evened out.</li>
            <li> To be honest I haven&#x27;t noticed much in the way of growth but from the day after I took the pills</li>
            <li> So far good...</li>
            <li> 8/17 So far so good, hair is growing.  </li>
            <li> HairFinity Healthy Hair Complex is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good though.</li>
            <li> i ordered right from the site.. and shipping to Canada is MORE than the pills.. 1 month &#x3D; $24, shipping&#x3D; $29.99....</li>
            <li> Thank you so much...!!!</li>
            <li> yessss they really do work ladies . !!!</li>
            <li> Never fails what it does!! 😍</li>
            <li> I can defiantly see a change in length within the first month!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product, and please do not use it on younger children, and if anything says it has no side effects, and it is too good to be true, do not believe it!</li>
            <li> I resorted to all kinds of hair extentions for my original look.  </li>
            <li> First couple weeks skin broke our, I put toothpaste on the pimples and my hair and skin is getting better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try this</li>
            <li> Mostly when I first get out of bed in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I noticed  significant hair  </li>
            <li> I was so pleased with my first purchase that I purchased another bottle.  </li>
            <li> but I originally purchased it thinking it will regrow a receding hairline</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing significant improvement.</li>
            <li> A few of my co-workers used this product and there hair look good and mine is more healthy looking and growing.</li>
            <li> a lot cheaper on original cite.</li>
            <li> I saw a significant difference in my hair length.</li>
            <li> had to clean it all one by one.</li>
            <li> Eat right!</li>
            <li> My hair has grown tremendously but ordering them from the original site will save u money.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED IN ORDER, WILL POST MY RESULTS WHEN IT&#x27;S FINISH AND SEE IF IT&#x27;S WISE TO PURCHASE A SECOND BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> Cause this product worked to it full expectation.</li>
            <li> I tried everything i could, deep conditionded and took REALLY good care of my hair with protective styles and all.</li>
            <li> I love that getting longer, thicker, healthier hair this product really works</li>
            <li> this is a lifesaver I am in love with this product I would recommend it to all my friends and family it really works.  </li>
            <li> Oh yes, I recall that my hair did very well, too :)</li>
            <li> I will not state a full review for her...</li>
            <li> but I have a full head of baby hair on the fronts that I haven&#x27;t seen in years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suggestion: ManeChoice! (Been using for almost a month and hair is already getting full, no chipping nails and my skin is</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, and I recommend it to anyone looking to hide some bald spots. :)</li>
            <li> Love it so so sooooooooo much</li>
            <li> full bc</li>
            <li> Gas, and nauxia, also feeling drowsy throughout the day, but so far so good I will complete my first month and of results very and become more effective</li>
            <li> Received QUICKLY...</li>
            <li> I had moderate fitting on the top of my head</li>
            <li> Received order quickly,</li>
            <li> Shipped to me quickly.  </li>
            <li> Happy to find such a fast shipper too.</li>
            <li> Arrival was quick.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing quickly with this product.</li>
            <li> had mild breakage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now a loyal customer</li>
            <li> My hair was blading in the top in the top of my head and in a month it  was growing back</li>
            <li> but I have to say that so far I&#x27;ve been able to notice a huge difference in my hair growth.</li>
            <li> I took the whole month supply and got such great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first bottle,I haven&#x27;t notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my hairfinity vitamins I&#x27;ve immediately saw results in the 2nd week of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also important to note that I have had tons of BREAKOUTS from this product on my first week of use.</li>
            <li> But she felt her hair was shedding more than normal as well.</li>
            <li> Now they are super strong and grow fast.</li>
            <li> Protective styles are best as well where you&#x27;ll see much of a difference, due to the fact you won&#x27;t be combing your hair as much causing breakage .</li>
            <li> I am however hoping to see some results, and when I do, I will gladly write a new review.</li>
            <li> I used to have nails that were really flexible and would break easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and my hair grew 2inches so fast!!</li>
            <li> Believe me this stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> you can tell after just the first week in the condition of your hair!</li>
            <li> My hair grew back in no time &amp; it also helped my nails grow strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> Came really fast, works fine</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m really excited to the see the outcome since my cousin has had positive results</li>
            <li> B00PWQTG8E Omegaboost Biotin for Stronger Hair and Nails]], and the combined effect of both pills is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> My daughter was the one who persuaded me to try it as she has been using it for a few months with great results.</li>
            <li> but I want to know for my own personal experience on what took place for my hair.</li>
            <li> After reading through several reviews and doing some research on my own I decided to order</li>
            <li> I started with freshly clipped ends, split ends will cause breakage and you will not see growth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth your money and time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it so grateful for these pills</li>
            <li> (Each bottle contains a month&#x27;s worth of pills).</li>
            <li> So far I am definitely satisfied my hair is stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li> It got my hair really full the first month.</li>
            <li> I am now taking it for a third month and is honestly feel like there is no change.</li>
            <li> Hairfinity is like a hair growth multi, it contains many different ingredients to help your hair grow, which is why I recommend taking it with a straight biotin supplement as biotin is the most important supplement that most people are short on.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really been able to tell much of a difference in GROWTH</li>
            <li> I began taking these pills along with my psoriasis treatment to hit it from the inside and outside, and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> So far I have seen okay improvement (3weeks).</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t worth the money if you just plan on buying it once so either stick to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this at a better price than other places.</li>
            <li> They were shipped super fast!</li>
            <li> and I still waiting for the right.</li>
            <li> I got these in the mail right on time</li>
            <li> Also you have to eat right , drink water and workout</li>
            <li> Will not see results right away.</li>
            <li> and it came right on schedule</li>
            <li> I will admit at first my hair seemed to be shedding more but the new growth is coming in much faster.</li>
            <li> Although this product works, it made me ridiculously thirsty - to a point where I didn&#x27;t feel good!</li>
            <li> This product really works and is amazing but only if you want your hair thicker not longer.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping....</li>
            <li> I would not have experienced physical distress if this vitamin only did that.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair down to the natural curl and it was beautiful,</li>
            <li> the shipping on the website is very fast</li>
            <li> I have soft curly, fine hair</li>
            <li> That causes a little dryness, so I also use Jamaican oils that got good ratings from Amazon.com</li>
            <li> It is natural hair with no dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a light mousse for styling.</li>
            <li> Amazon, WHY so much?!</li>
            <li> My hair started shedding and breaking alot after the first month.</li>
            <li> First started taking it, and I broke out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it have a different effect on everyone</li>
            <li> For some reason, out of all of the hair pills I have tried these were the only ones that I had satisfying results with.</li>
            <li> Some of my pills were opened in my first package but ordered again</li>
            <li> Will write a review once I finish with first botle</li>
            <li> Love this, wife&#x27;s hair has finally started growing with this product.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of ordering the hair skin nails from Amazon the first time and paid $60 for the product.</li>
            <li> Definitely will try 1 more bottle to see what happens if not</li>
            <li> It came just in time even though the first time there was a mistake with shipping.</li>
            <li> I noticed hair growth my first week.</li>
            <li> I took it almost every day for those first two months.</li>
            <li> Just started using it, hoping to see results after the first  month.</li>
            <li> After taking it the first month my hair was thicker, fuller and had grown almost an inch.</li>
            <li> My hair is really growing!</li>
            <li> First things first - do not buy from this seller ...</li>
            <li> have had a MUCH better experience with Nature&#x27;s Bounty Hair Skin &amp; Nails Extra Strength.</li>
            <li> I truly believe it&#x27;s the higher dose of Biotin in the Nature&#x27;s Bounty that makes the hair stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am definitely getting over that problem, but there is more work to do.</li>
            <li> I just finish my first bottle of hair infinity and it seems to be growing my hair.</li>
            <li> The first month I noticed a change in thickness.  </li>
            <li> Within the first two weeks of using Hairfinity my hair started to grow.</li>
            <li> This was for my sister and she love it her hair actually growing</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles &amp; it really works!</li>
            <li> but they really do!</li>
            <li> Anyone whose wanting to try these please do they really work!</li>
            <li> makes your hair grow so fast!</li>
            <li> This is not a 1 time trial you must stick with the product will definitely be purchasing more on a monthly basis</li>
            <li> You still need to apply necessary protecting products in order for your hair to grow healthy.</li>
            <li> I really think this is overrated, because prior to this I was taking regular multi vitamins and experienced increased hair growth.</li>
            <li> cant wait till my 2nd bottle is done :)</li>
            <li> My hair grew 3 inches with the first bottle.</li>
            <li> ** but get my hair fuller the first month.</li>
            <li> They were $11.99  and same ingredients -more</li>
            <li> Since then I started drinking more water for overall health.</li>
            <li> I have almost completed my first month using Hairfinity.</li>
            <li> I was told that I must use it consistently by my hair dresser.</li>
            <li> I have pics on my Facebook page for those interested.</li>
            <li> , I eat healthily and consume plenty of vegetables and fruits daily.</li>
            <li> Second bottle and my hair is longer and more manageable</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; cause I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 8 days</li>
            <li> I just started using this product for the first time.</li>
            <li> Hairfinity is making my hair grow so much!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure I will go back to using my GNC hair skin and nails formula.</li>
            <li> First bottle seems to be working well.  </li>
            <li> I started noticing results after I had almost finished my first bottle.</li>
            <li> At first, I took the two pills a day</li>
            <li> what I did notice was better manageability of the short hairs around my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try a different brand and see if I get better results with that one.</li>
            <li> It caused me to have itching and a rash when I first started taking them.  </li>
            <li> I am white but my hair is more frizzy kinky than most white girls.</li>
            <li> They changed my normal body smell and made my lady parts super fishy.</li>
            <li> she said my hair is Very soft and full of life compared to before.</li>
            <li> Through Instagram I found a distributor&#x27;s website kmstarks.myitworks.com and am now paying only $33 for the product (worth EVERY penny!!).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an amazing product especially if you are going natural and drinking plenty if water.  </li>
            <li> I honestly think it took some of my hair out and brought back an old scalp condition ( psoriasis).</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle and I am loving the results so far.</li>
            <li> I see that it works good on African American hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hairfinity is NOT a bad product, it&#x27;s an OKAY product with a high price point, and it&#x27;s certainly not a miracle product.</li>
            <li> It really works I saw the difference in my hair after the first day I started using them</li>
            <li> Firstly, I&#x27;d like to say that I am not the one to do reviews unless I absolutely need to as in this</li>
            <li> I notice a difference in how full and soft my hair has become.</li>
            <li> the receding is not noticeable any bald spots are now filled in w/ new growth &amp; I can see new hair growing, baby bangs etc.</li>
            <li> and I had irritation-not sure of its related to the vitamins or the product, but I will go back to the Original Proactiv and stay on Country Life Maxi Hair.  </li>
            <li> I knew it was the vitamins because it was the only thing different from my very healthy diet and exercise routine over the three month period.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend them to anyone who wants to grow long healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen much improvement but my hair has grown about 2-3 inches in the first month taking it .</li>
            <li> They had a strong odor that the others did not have and they looked different.</li>
            <li> The pills made my hair thicker in certain places.</li>
            <li> Hair grows healthy based upon your diet on a normal basis without any supplement, so if you use a supplement the results are on an individualized basis because everyone hair growth is different and your state of health determine how fast your hair grows.  </li>
            <li> me try waste money many people does work for them furious for me!</li>
            <li> These supplements did not agree with my body and upon the first week of taking them, it caused me to experience my menstrul cycle early and took an entire month before it stopped and became better regulated.</li>
            <li> Most products do make your hair longer to an extent, but then the newly added length quickly falls out due to its frailness.</li>
            <li> My previous experience was very positive: My fingernails had phenomenal improvement and growth.</li>
            <li> I expected way more results since the results on the official hairfinity site gives positive comments .</li>
            <li> For me, the first thing I notice was that my edges filled in right away, not much length</li>
            <li> But if you use it like me and many other people, stop doing the things that broke your hair off in the first place or modify it.</li>
            <li> Not sure about my hair growing (although I think it is longer in the month I&#x27;ve been taking this supplement) but nails are super strong now!  </li>
            <li> Using this product my hair has not grown at all and my blood pressure has been very high.  </li>
            <li> Some say natrol biotin works well for them, but im sticking with omegaboost as its 5,000MCG and seems to be very high quality.</li>
            <li> That may be due to the fact that my hair is already pretty healthy (thanks to my stylist).</li>
            <li> this product is amazing I could show inches in just a few weeks</li>
            <li> I ordered another bottle because I noticed how much thicker my hair has become</li>
            <li> My hair is longer and thicker and doesn&#x27;t fall out as much as it used to.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> Thanks for tiger speedy delivery</li>
            <li> I took the pills for two months, &amp; I had gotten much itchiness in my Scalp.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 months and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I studied photos of real testimonies followed by people&#x27;s journey with their day to day, month to month journeys.</li>
            <li> and it really grew my hair</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen so much improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> Phenylalanine is 50% aspartame - which is carcinogenic and can cause cellular damage if consumed too much.</li>
            <li> Your hair is growing so fast</li>
            <li> ordered a six-month supply and continued to astound my hairdresser about how much healthier and longer my hair was.</li>
            <li> I hope to notice a real difference in a month or so..</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> It really is growing my hair.</li>
            <li> My mom also takes them and I can really see the difference in her hair.</li>
            <li> Not trying to grow fast hair with a mustache.</li>
            <li> Really I would advise everyone to use it</li>
            <li> Now its time to see if it really works</li>
            <li> I was very elated to have found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the product, but it got here really fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> But my body hair haven&#x27;t been growing fast at all ...</li>
            <li> This product have really improved my hair shredding.</li>
            <li> I used them for about 2 months and didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t believe it my real hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s growing fast too.</li>
            <li> friend who was very worried about me asked me if there&#x27;s any medicine im taking everyday,i told him none except for my hair vitamins.</li>
            <li> This is a real review.</li>
            <li> These really work.</li>
            <li> made my BIGCHOP much easier....</li>
            <li> i was very hesitant to trying this..</li>
            <li> looks very</li>
            <li> but i really works</li>
            <li> so much so that I wear headbands all the time.  </li>
            <li> I started getting really discouraged</li>
            <li> its much cheaper</li>
            <li> no matter how much I conditioned and oiled it.</li>
            <li> and she said that they really make your hair grow</li>
            <li> I really wish I would have done my homework before buying these.</li>
            <li> See how much my hair has grown.  </li>
            <li> nails grew fast</li>
            <li> HAIRFINITY HAS REALLY WRK FOR ME</li>
            <li> Thanks Hairfinity.</li>
            <li> It scared me so much, that I refuse to take these pills anymore.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper buying it from hairfinity.com:/&lt;br</li>
            <li> did not work made me eat too much the B vitamins in it.</li>
            <li> Now I have acne on the whole side of my face.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I am going to give it another 60 days to really tell a difference before I give the 5 star review</li>
            <li> My hair shedded so much after I comb it and get it out the sink</li>
            <li> With Amazon Prime I&#x27;ll get it in 2 days which is much quicker.</li>
            <li> suffered a lot of hair loss around my hairline 6 months after giving birth, and since taking the pills the shorts hairs are sitting in place in the direction they should be instead of straight up on end and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I know it will because I have seen real results in all my friends hair.</li>
            <li> After about a month I really noticed a difference in the fullness and texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> My shedding had almost completely stopped and was so amazed that rarely I would lose even one strand of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair began to break off much easier and appeared to be weaker.</li>
            <li> I purchased these from the HairFinity website where they are much cheaper...</li>
            <li> They work very well</li>
            <li> Much cheaper</li>
            <li> so therefore I can&#x27;t say if it really has worked or not.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t finish the whole bottle</li>
            <li> These pills really work.</li>
            <li> Ice been taking the pills for about a month and can really see the growth and my thickness is returning.  </li>
            <li> I was told this product really works.</li>
            <li> But thanks</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen results</li>
            <li> thanks for the hair infinity</li>
            <li> This product is the BOMB, it really really works.</li>
            <li> really like the taste of the pill.</li>
            <li> or just don&#x27;t buy it because you won&#x27;t really see any improvements.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for my hair</li>
            <li> My hair growth is substantial, my nails are long and strong, and my hair is also thicker.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that my hair did grow faster than my normal hair growth pace !</li>
            <li> I took this religiously for a full month...did not see much or any growth.  </li>
            <li> I bought a two month supply and with in the first 2 weeks I had improvement in my hair as far as the condition of it as well as the bald spot was showing signs of growth at the end of the two month supply</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 23 and have a head full of hair..</li>
            <li> I just love the results after 60 days of hairfinity vitamins, now starting my 3rd bottle, thanks infinity.</li>
            <li> It took most of my adolescent years to get my hair to even reach down to my shoulders.</li>
            <li> It seems a little soon to be rating, so I can&#x27;t be completely honest in my review; so far Hairfinity does seem to be making my hair thicker.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews about this product, good and bad, and decided to try it for myself.  </li>
            <li> I checked the customer reviews and YouTube videos for more options also to see if it had any serous side effects, saw some good and bad reviews so to try it</li>
            <li> anyone who isn&#x27;t getting the results they want with these comb/brush your hair less and drink more water.&lt;br /&gt;Buy from the site...</li>
            <li> My hair is stronger, sheds less, looks as if i have more shine and moisture...</li>
            <li> Actually made my hair grow quick</li>
            <li> I know thye said your hair can grow slower as you get older, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure each individual has different results.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll be starting my second bottle and hope I to see more growth.</li>
            <li> This bottle arrived in a decent time frame.</li>
            <li> I got an MRI and had 3 unidentified spots on my brain, and they considered brain surgery, but they waited and a year later they were stable, but the thing is when I stopped taking hairfinity all the symptoms went away, and then I decided to try it one more time, and the symptoms came back!</li>
            <li> Acne was my main concern from reviews.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited and looking forward to the long term results.</li>
            <li> Biotin is the active ingredient in tgis pill, and cost less in any retail store and give better results!!</li>
            <li> From someone who has literally tried every hair growth pill that is offered, I highly recommend hairfinity.</li>
            <li> I do have acid reflux and high blood pressure</li>
            <li> the cost on here is way to high, it&#x27;s cheaper everywhere else</li>
            <li> Highly  recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Granted, this is not a controlled experiment because I started some other things, too, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a critical element in the process.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and my hair is growing out much faster.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s my normal growth.</li>
            <li> Is this normal?</li>
            <li> A waste cuz more damage to my hair</li>
            <li> I will try to update in a few more months.</li>
            <li> I normally can&#x27;t get pass shoulder.  </li>
            <li> when normally my hair grows soooo slooooow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair normally takes forever to grow</li>
            <li> This product definitely helped the overall appearance of my hair, As far as being shiny And more body.</li>
            <li> In accordance with me using a few more others products..</li>
            <li> I would like this product so much more if it weren&#x27;t as heavily endorsed by celebs who never use it, and convince us of growth through clip-ins and hair extensions.</li>
            <li> and I normally have think hair.</li>
            <li> and my hairline was standing in the left and right corners.</li>
            <li> I used it for maybe 2 weeks when I noticed my new mustache, I was done with the product.</li>
            <li> I STARTED TAKING HAIRNAMICS, a new hair vitamin that has iron in it, and I got over 6 inches of new growth.</li>
            <li> Plus it is windy where i live and that can damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I will be finishing product and searching for a new product....</li>
            <li> After the 1st month there was a lot of new growth &amp;</li>
            <li> When you stop taking the pills and your new growth starts to come in, you will notice the difference in texture from when you&#x27;ve been taking supplements.</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker, longer, fuller, and the bald spots show new growth.  </li>
            <li> Came on time, have notice new growth</li>
            <li> My hairdresser said I have so much new growth</li>
            <li> Also drink water everyday see better results if you do abs no breakouts for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sought out many miracle hair pills or treatments that had very little if and results.</li>
            <li> At first it appeared to be getting longer but definitely thinner.</li>
            <li> Not only did they significantly make my hair longer, but my hair actually felt a lot stronger and healthier that it ever has.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been consistent, but haven&#x27;t noticed anything different as of yet.</li>
            <li> I am three weeks into my first bottle and i notice my edges starting to fill in</li>
            <li> but this is only the first bottle</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they have in hairfinity that causes this, but they need to take it off the market or something cuz it makes no sense to keep selling it when so many people report it causes excessive shedding #ijs - Google Hairfinity side effects or shedding</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair and vitamin supplement, I have been using it for 2 years and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle, I have three pills left.</li>
            <li> but so far I can see it&#x27;s looking healthier!</li>
            <li> The biotin is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> and I have not consumed any more water than usual.</li>
            <li> Got the product in a timely manner without any problems and so far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it!</li>
            <li> and I already see my hair starting to grow at first I was using Rogaine but didn&#x27;t get any results.</li>
            <li> Im usually not the type to write any reviews for any product</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and the first bottle that I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> When they arrived in the mail I noticed that although they did seem larger that the average hair growth pill, they didn’t have the foul odor that most of these products tend to have.</li>
            <li> I wash and deep condition my hair once per week, moisturize my braids and scalp every other day and take my hairfinity, making sure to drink at least 3 bottled waters a day and sometimes more.</li>
            <li> What I think is the true difference between hairfinity and other biotin based hair growth products</li>
            <li> I suggest that they buy certain amounts and only reorder when they are out to ensure that the product does not sit for a while.</li>
            <li> I also kept my hair clean and oiled, I do not put my hair in a ponytail and keep it down or wrapped with a silk scarf at all times.</li>
            <li> I have noticed significant growth and less shedding since I began using Hairfinity.</li>
            <li> I live in NYC and consider myself in decent physical shape.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Brock beauty clearly cheaper than here</li>
            <li> If they don&#x27;t respond, steer clear.</li>
            <li> ( at least my friends are telling me this), so far I can not tell. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using the product since November and have clearly seen an improvement in the growth and strength of my hair.</li>
            <li> Did not grow hair as fast as expected (this was after using them for 2 months straight).</li>
            <li> I am nearly 60 years old</li>
            <li> They told me now I have to wash my hair with a medicated shampoo because it developed a fungus in my scalp, and because I decided to stop taking the pills within those two months I did experience some hair loss around my edges.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see an obvious difference with the use of this product.</li>
            <li> I studied the actual growth of real testimonies before I invested in this product.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li> I have not purchased this from amazon, but from hairfinity site directly.</li>
            <li> I only used it once haven&#x27;t seen much difference</li>
            <li> My Order Came In Early</li>
            <li> Overall god product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting a deal, but was Cheaper  on direct website</li>
            <li> Wow, I am amazed on the on how Hairfinity transform my hair.</li>
            <li> my bald spot is completely gone.</li>
            <li> The expiration date has been rubbed off of product, could be old product.</li>
            <li> My hair has become thicker and and grown considerably.</li>
            <li> How old do you have to be to use it?</li>
            <li> you could tell the product was old.</li>
            <li> and I used MSM before which was in a natural joint med</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with Hairfinity so far.</li>
            <li> Buy from the actual website it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> As far as the acne breakout...</li>
            <li> I look like a 13 year old hitting puberty again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 9½ months  </li>
            <li> it is working so far.</li>
            <li> this our 2nd bottle we will be put in another order soon Thank you so much....</li>
            <li> For two weeks straight, I took the recommended dose of two pills daily.</li>
            <li> and I already have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Since I started taking these pills my face has cleared completely up</li>
            <li> and I must say, I&#x27;m surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li> So far it has been a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> They also appear healthier as they have a natural &amp;#34;sheen&amp;#34; to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hairdresser even asked me if I were doing anything different to my hair in between visits because it was growing so fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural</li>
            <li> Pills appeared old and dust covered the inside of bottle.</li>
            <li> If you have unhealthy hair, do not expect this to work for you by itself, you really need to have a healthy hair regime.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was not worth the health risks and  face and chest full of pimples.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical to try this product because I was already taking 5,000 mcg of Biotin and saw that this product also contained biotin (good for hair, skin and nails).</li>
            <li> My hair has not grown in length, and it does continue to have shedding (even when I trimmed my ends), but my edges appear to be growing back in, which was one of my main concerns.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion and from experience, I HIGHLY suggest you to try Nature&#x27;s Bounty Hair Skin &amp; Nails Extra Strength instead of Hairfinity.</li>
            <li> I am starting  on my second bottle,  and so far I have not seen much difference.  </li>
            <li> Stopped taking them, back to normal.</li>
            <li> My hair does NOT grow at all and this product actually helped with new growth and my already existing hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hairfinity for  about 6 months now I believe, and I&#x27;m starting to see new growth around my edges, and some thickness.</li>
            <li> I actually have to get my braids redone because of the new growth.</li>
            <li> Compared pills to a earlier batch and the new pills were darker in color and smelled.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t normally touch of my roots but every 6-8 weeks and and within less than a month I have a lot of new growth!!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair at the very top of my head,</li>
            <li> and I see a major difference in length .</li>
            <li> Major acne.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and so far, so geeat!</li>
            <li> I have bought a two-months supply directly from the supplier for a total of 48$</li>
            <li> To me they barely did sh</li>
            <li> All the posts about two inch difference in one month aren&#x27;t possible unless your hair naturally does this.</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;ve seen a different in my hair roots already</li>
            <li> Maybe  one or more  are broken  in the  bottle.</li>
            <li> I was using these for a little while, but then I decided to stop since it didn&#x27;t sit right with me.</li>
            <li> My pills arrived within 2 days, with no loose powder.</li>
            <li> My hair is growning but not as fast as other women  stated in their video.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for a month and have just ordered a second month&#x27;s supply only because not only I, but my hairdresser has noticed new growth.  </li>
            <li> Its letters and design on the bottle was coming off and some of the product in the bottle was starting to leak inside the causing it to change from clear to sandy white within a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure taking Biotin and MSM will yield the same results without the unnecessary junk.</li>
            <li> My sister don&#x27;t have the same issues that I have as far as hair goes, and has very pretty thick hair.</li>
            <li> At first I could not believe the strength of this formerly vitamins my hair was not growing at all, and now after using these pills it grow 2 inches in less than one month</li>
            <li> Have spent a small fortune on a lot of other stuff, nice to see something actually works.</li>
            <li> Apparently the MSM in it flushes out toxins and without enough water to flush those toxins</li>
            <li> (no it&#x27;s not grey yet)</li>
            <li> And also my month supply bottle actually came with a few days extra worth of pills....</li>
            <li> My hair was so Full and thick.</li>
            <li> My ends were really shedding and I have seen less breakage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very insucure about my hair for some odd reason</li>
            <li> Been taking it almost a month now and starting to notice a little improvement; my first bottle from Amazon, I only got 59 capsules...</li>
            <li> (sorry if that offends anyone, me saying &amp;#34;black girl&amp;#34;) and for me its extremly hard to grow nice length and volume hair.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are a little large and gel caps.</li>
            <li> I do not flat iron anymore</li>
            <li> You can get similar results if not better with the right vitamins at a cheaper price too.</li>
            <li> Did not notice much growth but only used for a month and half.</li>
            <li> it is really working I have only been using for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews on the good &amp; bad for Hairfinity</li>
            <li> first few days of taking these pills, my body felt strange...</li>
            <li> I had lost all of my temple areas, and was very thin in the top.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen near the results that other&#x27;s testify to.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much grow I&#x27;ve gotten because I stopped relaxing before I started the pills.</li>
            <li> Not sure why Amazon is charging so much for this product.</li>
            <li> But it seems the hair has grown  much faster than usual from feeling between my braids underneath the sew-in.  </li>
            <li> and they are definitely a smarter investment than buying endless bottles of cheaper hair growth pills that barely make any difference to your hair.</li>
            <li> If they didn&#x27;t cause me long lasting headaches and nausea, I&#x27;d continue to take them.  </li>
            <li> It has not been long enough to comment.</li>
            <li> Flat ironing is not your friend ladies.</li>
            <li> I can tell from the grey roots that I have dyed a week before starting those supplements.</li>
            <li> Meaning is it for 18 and up or can be younger long as they can swallow.</li>
            <li> I believe these pills work but only for women who have medium to long length of hair.</li>
            <li> Only benefit is my nails grow really long</li>
            <li> I also decided to stop using the flat iron and keep my hair pinned up</li>
            <li> First let me start off by saying my hair is curly and HAD a thick texture.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses these and not only has her hair grown like crazy, it is incredibly healthy.</li>
            <li> Im 16 year old black girl,</li>
            <li> , my part was widening &amp; my hair was becoming very thin.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s a little too early to tell.</li>
            <li> Considering the Standard American Diet is already rich in aspartame (sodas, artificial sweeteners), I wouldn&#x27;t want to take a daily supplement that also consists of these toxins.</li>
            <li> The scalp did itch a little during the first few days however that went away.  </li>
            <li> If you are getting strange side effects don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I had heard about these pills long before I bought themand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 60, still wear my hair long</li>
            <li> (As long as you don&#x27;t mind the smell.)</li>
            <li> has my hair thick and growing very rapidly.</li>
            <li> two weeks maybe a little less my scalp begin to feel really tender and sore</li>
            <li> and i barely gained a half an inch.</li>
            <li> Someone had said it was way more expensive buying on Amazon, not true.</li>
            <li> When I reached out to the owner via social media she immediately shot down the information shared and deleted my message.  </li>
            <li> The rest of my hair is very long.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, damaged hair or split ends don&#x27;t assume that taking this will fix your hair, that is your hair regime that you need to work on.</li>
            <li> My hair was brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> so far my hair is stronger, the thickness is starting slow</li>
            <li> Although I was fighting every urge to buy one of these products ever again, while scrolling down my instagram feed I would constantly see the Kardashians or other celebrities endorsing hairfinity pills and claiming that they actually work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive to order them online specially with the Tennessee, state tax.</li>
            <li> pills were darker than usual and old.</li>
            <li> There was a lot of loose powder inside the bottle, the capsules somehow came loose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t lie down, lean back, or roll my hair without a silky or satiny fabric protecting my hair.</li>
            <li> and now it is down my back and it has not been over 2 months.  </li>
            <li> I read a few reviews where a few other people have said this and didn&#x27;t think much of it..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also usually way more expensive on here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black male with mpb.</li>
            <li> and I recently got it cut too short, so I decided to try these pills, I&#x27;ve been using them for the past month and my hair has never been healthier or thicker.</li>
            <li> The vitamins combined with the biotin in this product actually did thicken and slightly lengthen my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair grew one and a half inch to two inches (i should have measured) but the growth is so obvious!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very dry.</li>
            <li> I also experienced the worst case of acne taking these pills.</li>
            <li> I am not sure have not used this long enough to know if it works.</li>
            <li> I never really write reviews.</li>
            <li> Although they are quite expensive, the price is worth it</li>
            <li> Let me explain I carefully read the ingredients about this product, 2.</li>
            <li> I have only been taking this vitamin for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It definitely didn&#x27;t not meet my expectations.. Waste...</li>
            <li> not even excedrin extra strength won&#x27;t help and it also cause your hair to brake everyday</li>
            <li> Order was just as I expected.</li>
            <li> arrived FIVE hours before the expected time....</li>
            <li> So I came across this supplement on instagram and was curious to see if it would work for me.</li>
            <li> Just be careful ladies.</li>
            <li> It would be a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I gave gained some length but not much</li>
            <li> a few months later I went to my stylist to put in a relaxer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for 2 months aftr birth control taking the center of my hair out &amp; micros taking my hairline out.</li>
            <li> I take this daily with a strong biotin supplement: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Overall hairfinity  is down graded to 2 stars-for less shedding.    </li>
            <li> since, I had to cut my hair extremely short due to harsh perm damaged.</li>
            <li> In less than a year, my hair has gone from being about 3 cm long to being long enough to come down past my shoulders, about ...</li>
            <li> Forget rogaine and empty promises from other hair products as this one will provide proof within days if used correctly</li>
            <li> a southern black American and my hair grows slowly without help.</li>
            <li> Over the years my thick, long hair had been damaged by my over processing and constant pressing.</li>
            <li> Had to stop because the break outs were getting so bad it was becoming annoying/painful.</li>
            <li> i used it for 2 months, my hair grew a lot, but it is pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I was suffering from thining hair due to surgery .  </li>
            <li> But I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical and ignored the site.</li>
            <li> I took the vitamins twice and both time had extreme chest pains after.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if the chest pains were from heartburn the vitamin caused or heart related</li>
            <li> i saw some reviews (hair goes in other places etc.)</li>
            <li> I am trying to thicken and grow hair in a couple of areas where I lost hair due to a weave.</li>
            <li> hairfinity.com where you can also get points, discounts, and other hair growth products</li>
            <li> But going up stairs proved to be difficult for me; in fact I had shortness of breath for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> but I would suggest you speak to a doctor before taking these pills or take extreme caution.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes you breakout like none other.</li>
            <li> one capsule opened so when i got it, powder all over the other capsules are there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard other females that have taken these pills say they had heart troubles</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s only one month not sure yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What proceeded to happen next was a hard lesson</li>
            <li> Not worth it...</li>
            <li> Never had a problem growing hair, it will get long, but long and sparse is not good.</li>
            <li> This is just not worth messing up your skin for.</li>
            <li> These vitamins went from doing nothing to making my hair fall out worse than it did when I had a perm (my hair is natural).  </li>
            <li> But this time around I was able to add an additional base braid.  </li>
            <li> I had hair loss around the edges due to tight braids.  </li>
            <li> And, overall, it&#x27;s thin, dry and brittle.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve grown my hair down to bra-strap length in a year.</li>
            <li> not only is it growing quicker than usual - but even my Hairdresser stopped and asked me what i was doing!</li>
            <li> Made scalp extremely itchy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure what to take on this, so I definitely do not want to give this a bad review because my excessive split ends and weak hair could be for endless reasons.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I am just surprised, because usually I never have bad experiences with any product I take.</li>
            <li> Your hair grows on average half an inch a month.</li>
            <li> Biotin works just as well and for half the price</li>
            <li> And even the previously relaxed hair I am growing off seems to have stopped breaking off like it was before.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but from reading previous reviews I think that it will be 100% satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I will stick with the previous supplier or buy off the hairinfinity site.</li>
            <li> My hair is stronger with less breakage after just one month of using it.</li>
            <li> I probably took the pill for less than two weeks and all of this has happened.</li>
            <li> and I have WAY less shedding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a lot less breakage...</li>
            <li> a lot less hair in the shower/</li>
            <li> My hair grew a half an inch within one month.</li>
            <li> I can say that after about 1 1/2 I started noticing less shedding in the shower and when I would brush my hair.</li>
            <li> Her hair is fuller and the strands are growing in stronger thus less breakage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for 3 weeks and have noticed a slight growth in my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the prices here are way too high.  </li>
            <li> I advise drinking at least 64-80 ounces of water a day (as long as you have no adverse advice from your Physician).</li>
            <li> It makes my sister&#x27;s hair thick and long</li>
            <li> Packaged tightly..</li>
            <li> I have new growth and unfortunately it makes my permed hair look \\&quot;poofy\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My skin had a little reaction but that went away week 3.</li>
            <li> Little bit of scalp itching</li>
            <li> My hair do look a little fuller.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m rocking little ponytails now.</li>
            <li> i grew a little</li>
            <li> but I also wash my face with Ambi so that my be helping me out a little bit</li>
            <li> I have been using this a little over a week.</li>
            <li> it still works, just a little slower.</li>
            <li> and it DID grow my hair a little.</li>
            <li> I could not smile!  </li>
            <li> She struggled with her growing since she was little and this product did what all the OTC products couldn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been taking these for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> I noticed a little shed</li>
            <li> To my disappointment I couldn&#x27;t take it long enough to see results because it induced the most horrible break out I have ever seen on my face and thats after only ONE week of using it.</li>
            <li> Not very pleased with results.</li>
            <li> and I could barely put in enough of the base braids to make a decent hairstyle without using a scarf to cover the thin patch.  </li>
            <li> Too much biotin is dangerous.</li>
            <li> I shampoo every week, give or take a few days.</li>
            <li> Before I started my hairline was thin, I have been using Hairfinity for 3 months and my edges and hairline looks like it did when I was younger.</li>
            <li> Have been taking these for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> A few things I need to let u know. 1.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for a few months now</li>
            <li> Ehh, i took these everyday for the month as prescribed</li>
            <li> 80% of my thinning sides broken off from extensions, has grown back</li>
            <li> He asked me to try and stop taking for a few days and see if there&#x27;s improvement on my health,To my surprise,as soon as i stopped taking those pills,migraine  and fever</li>
            <li> It worked for a few months</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t so it&#x27;s a waste of my money</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already referred my mom, Aunt, and a few girls from work to try.</li>
            <li> My daughter noticed my thinning hair a few months ago and ordered me two bottles.  </li>
            <li> and I never write revised but even with taking a few times a week</li>
            <li> I understand vitamins take a while to absorb into your system, but this product seems like a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tired it for 2 months and at the end of the 2nd I started weening off and taking Country Life Maxi Hair vitamins.</li>
            <li> it does what it says just don&#x27;t get your hopes up if your balding or have trouble spots.</li>
            <li> Hair grew back thin</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money because of the Celebrity endorsements.</li>
            <li> Honestly made my nails grow but had no change to my hair growth horrible break outs</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first esp when I saw the price</li>
            <li> After taking for a few days, I felt tingling in my legs, so I stopped taking them.</li>
            <li> my pee is lime green.</li>
            <li> I literally had patches of missing hair</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have 60 pills as promised product previously openend!</li>
            <li> my hair grew half up to an inch every month!</li>
            <li> Each time I took just one pill, half the recommended dose), I was ill for the next day.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time, and it&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> My hair has NEVER been this thin as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Shedding did slow down alot.</li>
            <li> The same thin, dull looking hair are here...</li>
            <li> It constantly broke off so badly that my shower drain regularly got clogged.</li>
            <li> and I have at least a one half inch of growth.</li>
            <li> but at least I&#x27;m no longer looking bald from years of braids and tight pony tails.</li>
            <li> and it broke me out in large painful pimples that took months to go away</li>
            <li> At least for a little bit.</li>
            <li> Although being extremely skeptical and having almost no faith that they would have any effect on me, I almost felt obligated to try these and give hair growth pills one last chance.</li>
            <li> usually by my pills thru the company that make them .The</li>
            <li> Not sure yet.  </li>
            <li> I usually take it with breakfast and before bed.</li>
            <li> My hair feels fuller but one bottle is too expensive from Amazon next time</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure).  </li>
            <li> Even though I noticed my hair was becoming thin, I stupidly decided to purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> I usually drink 2 per day for a week and take 2 weeks off...</li>
            <li> Not sure on the growth yet because I have had a sew-in done since I began taking the pills.</li>
            <li> Still take them no sure yet</li>
            <li> Stop working not sure why.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether this product worked for me or not.&lt;br /&gt;I was one of the unlucky ones and had a negative skin reaction to these capsules</li>
            <li> has grown at least an inch if not more.</li>
            <li> My hair grew thick and a lot of small baby hairs started coming out.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way...</li>
            <li> I also have been using Dr. Miracle temple and nape balm which may also be helping, so it&#x27;s hard to tell which has attributed to my edges coming</li>
            <li> I did not have any breakouts or negative side effects from this, but I have also never had an issue with acne.</li>
            <li> One complaint..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair so short for quite some time</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about the product and</li>
            <li> My complaint is about the content of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Only disappointment at this point is the bottle did not have 60 capsules as stated.  </li>
            <li> My hair was shedding like crazy and my scalp was starting to show.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow</li>
            <li> My hair has never been thick in my life.  </li>
            <li> my hair is longer, thicker and has very little shedding!</li>
            <li> I mean the list goes on yall.</li>
            <li> I developed a serious migraine and even took sick time off from work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair grows very slow and when it does grow, I usually have to get it cut off because of damage and split ends.</li>
            <li> It works, my hair grows at a ridiculous rate and doesn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It was a little expensive though.</li>
            <li> I recently had a bad haircut and they cut my shoulder lenght hair to almost a bob cut.</li>
            <li> the only bad part is I am encountering the side effects which are:</li>
            <li> Not a good price</li>
            <li> and I was one of them due to so mant hair dyes and bleach which caused me to keep cutting my hair and hasn&#x27;t grown ever since, before buying this</li>
            <li> ,i was slowly dieing,i bought all sorts of fever pills and migraine pills ,they only helped for a few hours until the fever and terrible migraine returns.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it had 59 pills when it should&#x27;ve had 60 :(</li>
            <li> It is a very slow process, so</li>
            <li> My hair had always been thin and did not grow.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed some thickness in areas that were thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thin</li>
            <li> But the ends which was the hair that was there before I took HAIRFINITY is so thin.</li>
            <li> Not happy about receiving a product with no expiration date .I</li>
            <li> My hair is semi thin</li>
            <li> Vitamin capsules were broken never order from here again</li>
            <li> I have not experienced it yet and hope I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> My face and chest broke out so much, I am embarrassed at how terrible my face and chest look.</li>
            <li> By the end of this bottle, I noticed my hair began to thin out</li>
            <li> My hair is so thin not, it&#x27;s embarrasing.</li>
            <li> and my acne was worse than ever.</li>
            <li> My hair was thin from extensions</li>
            <li> you could tell that my hair was thin to my hair falling out.</li>
            <li> You have to drink a lot and plenty of water of you will get bad headaches, other than that</li>
            <li> Oh well at least I tried this crazy fad.</li>
            <li> I stop taking the medication because my scalp begin to develop a very bad rashand I had to go back to the doctor and explain to them that I was taking these pills.</li>
            <li> but this pill used to give me VERY bad head aches and they would last all day !</li>
            <li> anyways I started feeling really sick, half of my face stopped moving!</li>
            <li> My hairstylist told me about this product after I had suffered from hair loss due to stress and grief.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that hairfinty didn&#x27;t work out haven&#x27;t grew or different styles</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see any growth or any change in my hair.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I schedule and emergency dermatologist  </li>
            <li> I am unable to take them twice a day because I do break out sometimes.</li>
            <li> Nothing weird.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about them working</li>

            <li> Before I bought hairfinity, it seemed like there was no catch besides the expensive price.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is great! Within 2months of taking this vitamin I noticed a big difference in my hair. My hair was so Full and thick. I will continue to take this product,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that hairfinty didn&#x27;t work out haven&#x27;t grew or different styles nothing of them help I thought give chance me try waste money many people does work for them furious for me! I&#x27;m put ZERO star review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and I still waiting for the right.</li>
            <li> It IS cheaper at the at the Brock Beauty, Inc. website. I got 4 bottles for about $100. I took it faithfully for 4 months; one capsule in the morning and one in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get pimples but I managed those. I am nearly 60 years old so I wasn&#x27;t expecting pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 4 months, I skipped getting my hair trimmed. I only used heat for blow-drying after shampoos. I shampoo every week, give or take a few days. I don&#x27;t lie down, lean back, or roll my hair without a silky or satiny fabric protecting my hair. It is natural hair with no dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a light mousse for styling. That causes a little dryness, so I also use Jamaican oils that got good ratings from Amazon.com users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I started using this product, I was concerned that my hair was very short at the back of my head and wouldn&#x27;t grow there. My hair lines were thinned from having used perms when I was younger. When my hair grows, it gets thinner and thinner towards the ends and has to be trimmed. So, I am generally back at the same length I already had once I get a trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 months of using this product, I have the same concerns. Seeing no changes, I went in to get my trim. My beautician said, &amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know WHY your hair won&#x27;t grow.... And, overall, it&#x27;s thin, dry and brittle.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might wonder how my hormones are doing. &amp;#34;Fine for my age&amp;#34;, my doctor says. But, I am given a low dose of replacement therapy just to keep me happy.</li>
            <li> Amazon, WHY so much?! This product is way cheaper on Hairfinity&#x27;s site!&lt;br /&gt;Problems with breakouts is common girls!!! Drink LOTS of water and you&#x27;ll be fine. My hair does NOT grow at all and this product actually helped with new growth and my already existing hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> These vitamins went from doing nothing to making my hair fall out worse than it did when I had a perm (my hair is natural).  I took these vitamins for three months and even my hair stylist was amazed at the damage and condition of my hair.  My hair started shedding and breaking alot after the first month. At first it appeared to be getting longer but definitely thinner. Then by the third month of taking them breakage, thinning and visibly damaged hair.  I knew it was the vitamins because it was the only thing different from my very healthy diet and exercise routine over the three month period.  Please DO NOT take these vitamins if you want a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! My daughter uses these and not only has her hair grown like crazy, it is incredibly healthy.</li>
            <li> Personally, this product is not working for me.  First started taking it, and I broke out.  Stopped using it.  Tried again a month later and same thing.  I&#x27;m done.  Something in it&#x27;s make up is not agreeing with my system/chemistry.</li>
            <li> Love this product. ..does wonder for my hair no complaints here</li>
            <li> Received QUICKLY...product perfect.  Thank you so much...!!!</li>
            <li> My hair grew alot.. this product is good.</li>
            <li> I ordered another bottle because I noticed how much thicker my hair has become</li>
            <li> Not seeing any results as of yet. Looking forward to the next month to see where it takes me</li>
            <li> Worked great! My hair is longer and thicker and doesn&#x27;t fall out as much as it used to.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T get this from amazon. I&#x27;ve gotten it twice now from amazon and it&#x27;s NOT the same. It&#x27;s also usually way more expensive on here.  When I got it from the website itself, my hair grew an inch in a month and nothing about me changed. From here, both times, my hair grew like a centimeter. I think that&#x27;s my normal growth. The pills were a different color and had a smell to them. They changed my normal body smell and made my lady parts super fishy. I got extra moody taking them.  Stopped taking them, back to normal. maybe on amazon is where they dump the sub-par or bad patches... I&#x27;m only buying them from hairfinity.com.  I love my amazon, just not for this.</li>
            <li> ordered them. Love them! If they aren&#x27;t helping I&#x27;ll tell ya they sure as heck aren&#x27;t hurting either! Haha I&#x27;m happy with the results... 5 stars. They also arrived in two days!</li>
            <li> My hair had grown maybe a 3 inches since I have started Taking these almost a month now. So i gave it three stars.My skin had a little reaction but that went away week 3.</li>
            <li> this is the second time we ordered it my family happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love it love it.......used hairfinity for 4 weeks and my hair grew 4inches and looked more healthy than ever. You have to drink a lot and plenty of water of you will get bad headaches, other than that its great. I took one in the a.m. and one at bed time.</li>
            <li> These pills definitely work, however it is cheaper through the actual hairfinity site. I paid 140.00 for a 6 month supply.  One bottle is like 24.99 plus shipping.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see any growth or any change in my hair. I&#x27;m sure it have a different effect on everyone and I am not one of them it helped. Oh well at least I tried this crazy fad. Good luck to those how do wanna try and hope u see results.</li>
            <li> I have taken these vitamins for about 6 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair. If they didn&#x27;t cause me long lasting headaches and nausea, I&#x27;d continue to take them.  I don&#x27;t know if 6 weeks is enough time to see improvement but physically, I just can&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> I just started taking this vitamin today. Can&#x27;t wait to see results.</li>
            <li> Not worth it... This product made me break out so bad all over my body, cystic acne almost and I&#x27;ve never had acne like that my entire life!!! Did not notice much growth but only used for a month and half. Had to stop because the break outs were getting so bad it was becoming annoying/painful.</li>
            <li> Actually made my hair grow quick</li>
            <li> my hair became better</li>
            <li> Thanks for tiger speedy delivery</li>
            <li> Totally Works!!! I saw results in the 1st month. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product increased hair growth, body and volume. Will cause skin outbreaks but this can.l be prevented if you only take one pill a day as opposed to the recommended two. Also make sure you keep hair moisturized as it can increase dandruff. But again I noticed great results in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Heard about this product.Looking forward to the results</li>
            <li> I never really write reviews. But this product was amazing. I saw results in four days. I had moderate fitting on the top of my head and my hairline was standing in the left and right corners. Within four days can you believe it my hair growing thicker I keep my hair cut really short this is an amazing product</li>
            <li> I have noticed there is no seal. I&#x27;m concerned.  Is this normal?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews on the good &amp; bad for Hairfinity but I want to know for my own personal experience on what took place for my hair. I just received my order for 1 month supply. Will definitely see what happens but I am taking a multivitamin as well so that I can assure the best results for me. 2 ppl will have 2 different results. Everyone&#x27;s body is different ..bottom line</li>
            <li> i used it for 2 months, my hair grew a lot, but it is pretty expensive</li>
            <li> Great actually feel a difference in my hair...awesome... Have get a new order!!!</li>
            <li> I noticed the result after 15-30 days.. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> After spending almost two years gullibly buying every type of hair growth pill, hair growth shampoo, or hair growth serum that I could find, I had come to the conclusion that any product on the market suggesting that it can miraculously help my hair grow was lying to me. Although I was fighting every urge to buy one of these products ever again, while scrolling down my instagram feed I would constantly see the Kardashians or other celebrities endorsing hairfinity pills and claiming that they actually work. I then clicked on the hairfinity instagram hashtag to find a countless amount of people posting pictures of the progress they have made with this product. Although being extremely skeptical and having almost no faith that they would have any effect on me, I almost felt obligated to try these and give hair growth pills one last chance. After all, the Kardashians do have great hair. When they arrived in the mail I noticed that although they did seem larger that the average hair growth pill, they didn’t have the foul odor that most of these products tend to have. Being pleased by this, I took the serving size of 2 capsules a day for about a month. At the end of the month I realized that my hair was starting to look healthier and a bit longer. I ignored the possibility that these pills were the reason for the improvement in my hair and just assumed that the cooler weather was having a good affect on my hair. But after two months, I could no longer deny the fact that these pills were actually working. Not only did they significantly make my hair longer, but my hair actually felt a lot stronger and healthier that it ever has. What I think is the true difference between hairfinity and other biotin based hair growth products is the way that hairfinity grows your hair. Most products do make your hair longer to an extent, but then the newly added length quickly falls out due to its frailness. However, hairfinity makes hair healthier and fuller therefore allowing the newlygrown hair to be healthy and not susceptible to falling out immediately. From someone who has literally tried every hair growth pill that is offered, I highly recommend hairfinity. For some reason, out of all of the hair pills I have tried these were the only ones that I had satisfying results with. Although they are quite expensive, the price is worth it and they are definitely a smarter investment than buying endless bottles of cheaper hair growth pills that barely make any difference to your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is growning but not as fast as other women  stated in their video.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from thining hair due to surgery .  I used hair finity and i an satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Vitamins work great! I&#x27;ve seen growth</li>
            <li> It has not been long enough to comment. So far good... It&#x27;s only been one week.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED IN ORDER, WILL POST MY RESULTS WHEN IT&#x27;S FINISH AND SEE IF IT&#x27;S WISE TO PURCHASE A SECOND BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> Some of my pills were opened in my first package but ordered again and I&#x27;m still happy with this product</li>
            <li> These work. I just ordered more after my daughter (17yo) and I both tried these.</li>
            <li> I started taking the pills as stated on the directions. I even called to see if there were any side effects and if it was actually made for all women. What they do not tell you is that if you have eczema or sensitivity to some things within the pills, then you should not take them. I took the pills for two months, &amp; I had gotten much itchiness in my Scalp. I could see a difference as to my hair being a bit thicker. I stop taking the medication because my scalp begin to develop a very bad rashand I had to go back to the doctor and explain to them that I was taking these pills. They told me now I have to wash my hair with a medicated shampoo because it developed a fungus in my scalp, and because I decided to stop taking the pills within those two months I did experience some hair loss around my edges. So instead of Hairfinity helping me, it has ruined my hair. Do not buy this product, and please do not use it on younger children, and if anything says it has no side effects, and it is too good to be true, do not believe it!</li>
            <li> It works, my hair grows at a ridiculous rate and doesn&#x27;t break but sometimes I get headaches.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the product! I have relaxed hair and I don&#x27;t normally touch of my roots but every 6-8 weeks and and within less than a month I have a lot of new growth!! The key is to drink a lot of water with this product!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I took this religiously for a full month...did not see much or any growth.  :((</li>
            <li> My face broke out terribly all over my face! Rather be safe and just stick with taking biotin. I never had breakouts to my entire face having bumps!!! 😔</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see an obvious difference with the use of this product. That may be due to the fact that my hair is already pretty healthy (thanks to my stylist).</li>
            <li> Using this product my hair has not grown at all and my blood pressure has been very high.  There is something in your product that makes my pressure go up.</li>
            <li> Had not effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome product . Been using for 2months and I see a major difference in length .</li>
            <li> Will write a review once I finish with first botle</li>
            <li> Helps with my hair and skin. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet. I am going to keep trying.</li>
            <li> Love this, wife&#x27;s hair has finally started growing with this product. Have spent a small fortune on a lot of other stuff, nice to see something actually works.</li>
            <li> On time delivery. Please with the product.</li>
            <li> Biotin works just as well and for half the price</li>
            <li> Sadly, I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I used this product for 2 months and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. After reading through several reviews and doing some research on my own I decided to order It Works Hair Skin Nails - THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING! My hair growth is substantial, my nails are long and strong, and my hair is also thicker. I made the mistake of ordering the hair skin nails from Amazon the first time and paid $60 for the product. Through Instagram I found a distributor&#x27;s website kmstarks.myitworks.com and am now paying only $33 for the product (worth EVERY penny!!).</li>
            <li> I have read the reviews about Hairfinity which has compelled me to write my  review about this product.  I am writing about this product because their are many women like myself which will benefit from this product but will be discouraged because inaccurate reviews.  1. Let me explain I carefully read the ingredients about this product, 2. I studied the actual growth of real testimonies before I invested in this product. Then I invested into buying it for myself.  Any testimonies telling you to use any additional supplement of biotin are women who are going to cause you to cause yourself severe side effects. Too much biotin is dangerous. The supplements in Hairfinity are balanced out specifically to repair cell damage and grow the hair at the same time.  With any supplement you are taking you must maintain a healthy diet. Hair grows healthy based upon your diet on a normal basis without any supplement, so if you use a supplement the results are on an individualized basis because everyone hair growth is different and your state of health determine how fast your hair grows.  If you are going to use Hairfinity I can attest it works, here is my testimony: Over the years my thick, long hair had been damaged by my over processing and constant pressing. Flat ironing is not your friend ladies. It look good but it is a hair cell damager. My hair became thinner and broke off to shorter than shoulder length. I resorted to all kinds of hair extentions for my original look.  I have sought out many miracle hair pills or treatments that had very little if and results. I searched the internet and found Hairfinity. But I was skeptical at first. I waited months before I was convinced. I did my research about the product and ingredients I didn&#x27;t want to make myself sick or shorten my hair anymore than what it is.  I studied photos of real testimonies followed by people&#x27;s journey with their day to day, month to month journeys. Then I started my own.  After my supplies was ordered I started taking the pills 2 each day as recommended on the bottle. I eat before I take the hair pills. I keep a healthy diet I brush my hair daily. I do not flat iron anymore I relax my hair once a month.  Before I started my hairline was thin, I have been using Hairfinity for 3 months and my edges and hairline looks like it did when I was younger. My hair has a different texture I have noticed from the product but it works. The results are there you see it in the mirror.  Maintain your hair, ladies this product works. It is the answer for me. I can&#x27;t guarantee it will work for you because not ever thing works for everyone. If you are getting strange side effects don&#x27;t use it. But if you use it like me and many other people, stop doing the things that broke your hair off in the first place or modify it. Eat healthy for maximum results, God Bless in your hair restoration journey.  7/15/15 I am giving an update on Hairfinity it&#x27;s been 5 months and I am still happy and amazed with this product. Your hair grows stronger and my ponytail is awesome, I haven&#x27;t had hair like this in years.</li>
            <li> Did make my hair grow a 1/2 inch within 1 month. Don&#x27;t know if that good or if it should have grown longer. Definitely will try 1 more bottle to see what happens if not then it&#x27;s over</li>
            <li> My hair grew 4inches in 2 monthsand it&#x27;s healthy</li>
            <li> I noticed the results from taking hairfinity after about two weeks of taking two pills daily. My hair started to grow faster than before, and became thicker as well. What a lot of people are failing to realize with this product, is that it is not a miracle pill for hair growth, it is designed to promote healthy hair which will then lead to hair growth. Hairfinity has a combination of the vitamins needed for healthy hair NOT just biotin. If you have unhealthy hair, do not expect this to work for you by itself, you really need to have a healthy hair regime. I started with freshly clipped ends, split ends will cause breakage and you will not see growth. I also kept my hair clean and oiled, I do not put my hair in a ponytail and keep it down or wrapped with a silk scarf at all times. If you have dry, damaged hair or split ends don&#x27;t assume that taking this will fix your hair, that is your hair regime that you need to work on. I did not have any breakouts or negative side effects from this, but I have also never had an issue with acne. My water intake varies, so I didn&#x27;t increase with that either.</li>
            <li> Came really fast, works fine</li>
            <li> Love its helping my hair alot...will be ordering some more!!</li>

            <li> I wish I could give this product zero stars !!!!!!!!!!!! I bought this product from Brock beauty clearly cheaper than here , I started taking these pill hoping for the best I did length checks and also took before pictures to document my growth .around two weeks maybe a little less my scalp begin to feel really tender and sore ouch !!!! Even touching scalp with just finger tips could be felt for mins after but I wrote it off as maybe it was time for a wash so I wash my hair and a hand full came out more than ever before I wrote that off say maybe my hair was more tangled than before .About the beginning on middle of week 3 I took pictures and made a side by side comparison and OMG !!!!!! my 3week pic look as if I started balding I almost cried !!! Needless to say I schedule and emergency dermatologist  Appointment  and they found nothing wrong ,even ran many test as I show the doctor he was astonished at the sudden hair loss . I couldn&#x27;t even finish month supply To wrap this up I will NEVER AND I REPEAT NEVER TAKE HAIRFINITY AGAIN !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have taken 2 bottles of these vitamins for the hair with Biotin too and my hair is still the same so I don&#x27;t even know what to say, take them at your own risk didn&#x27;t work for me but might work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for about a week now, and I can honestly say that I already see results. My hair is looking healthier and healthier every day!</li>
            <li> It came just in time even though the first time there was a mistake with shipping. I&#x27;m so happy. I&#x27;ve used this product once before and it really grew my hair</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this product!it works wonders</li>
            <li> Can not rate this product yet until I&#x27;m done the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen amazon results,this product has saved my hair....</li>
            <li> I ordered this bottle of Haifinity and I was glad to see them on Amazon from a good seller. These vitamins are a little large and gel caps. They are easy to swallow. Hairfinity vitamins work. I am unable to take them twice a day because I do break out sometimes. I advise drinking at least 64-80 ounces of water a day (as long as you have no adverse advice from your Physician). Even taking the vitamins once daily I have experienced growth. I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Did a great job i love this prodcut</li>
            <li> A waste cuz more damage to my hair</li>
            <li> This product really works.  I&#x27;ve seen so much improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> They where for my daughter she said that where ok</li>
            <li> Are you kidding me?? There&#x27;s Phenylalanine in this product. Phenylalanine is 50% aspartame - which is carcinogenic and can cause cellular damage if consumed too much. Considering the Standard American Diet is already rich in aspartame (sodas, artificial sweeteners), I wouldn&#x27;t want to take a daily supplement that also consists of these toxins. NO THANK YOU. I&#x27;m sure taking Biotin and MSM will yield the same results without the unnecessary junk.</li>
            <li> I noticed hair growth my first week. A few things I need to let u know. 1. This isn&#x27;t a magic pill-- don&#x27;t act like it is! Yes it works! But don&#x27;t expect to treat your body like crap and take this pill to make your hair grow. This pill will work best when u do. Go out and excersize! Eat right! And take showers! This does work. But not on its own.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has been taking these for 2 months and we are starting to see results. It is a very slow process, so we don&#x27;t know how good it is yet. It seems to be working so far. I will try to update in a few more months.</li>
            <li> My hair had always been thin and did not grow. Seriously. It took most of my adolescent years to get my hair to even reach down to my shoulders. It constantly broke off so badly that my shower drain regularly got clogged. After searching for tips on how to grow my hair longer online, I came across the makers of this product. At first, I was skeptical and ignored the site. But I kept coming back to it and thinking, well the worst that could happen is that my hair stays the way it is. So I ordered a three-month supply. I took it almost every day for those first two months. And then I went back to my hair stylist after being away for four months. The very first thing she said was, &amp;#34;Oh my god, Tarra! Your hair is growing so fast now!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a six-month supply and continued to astound my hairdresser about how much healthier and longer my hair was. In less than a year, my hair has gone from being about 3 cm long to being long enough to come down past my shoulders, about ... Read more</li>
            <li> I took them one time w/ the recommended 10,000 biotin. I did notice my edges growing and a thickness in my hair. I am reordering but taking over the counter biotin. Drink plenty of water to help flush the system,  even fruit/veggie infused water, lemon or apple cider vinegar water. They have detoxing benefits. I also take iron to help with my blood levels, got that from a youtuber. I do smoothies in the morning to get extra vitamins and fruits and veggies I wouldn&#x27;t get my regular serving on. It&#x27;s an inside out process. Check with your doctor if you&#x27;re nervous to have blood levels checked so that you can stay balanced.</li>
            <li> Just started using it, hoping to see results after the first  month. I bought it because my mother has been using it for six months already and it has worked for her. Received order quickly,</li>
            <li> I have not purchased this from amazon, but from hairfinity site directly. These vitamins worked for both me and my sister. After taking it the first month my hair was thicker, fuller and had grown almost an inch. My hair grows very slow and when it does grow, I usually have to get it cut off because of damage and split ends. My sister don&#x27;t have the same issues that I have as far as hair goes, and has very pretty thick hair. After a month of her using hairfinity, her hair grew over an inch, and is healthier looking. Both of our hair is still growing with let&#x27;s breakage and damage, but hers is just growing faster. The cons of using it is that it grows hair back EVERYWHERE faster and thicker. Also, it isn&#x27;t cheap! That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow but I have noticed some thickness in areas that were thin.</li>
            <li> It was ok when I tried it here are my results https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ne9VMiSl0fU&lt;br /&gt;when I transitioned youtube NBnaturalbeauty to see my results.</li>
            <li> Did not like them at all! My hair sheds more than ever!  Not happy :(</li>
            <li> I love this! My hair is really growing!</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work!  I already have a lot of hair, but I wanted to get it growing, as I feel like it has been breaking..so I stopped the hair straightener and bought these vitamins...my hair seems like it has grown already.. I hope to notice a real difference in a month or so..no side effects at all!</li>
            <li> good product bought it for my daughter she is satisfy</li>
            <li> It actually works!! I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and my hair grew 2inches so fast!!</li>
            <li> It really works.  Shipped to me quickly.  Second bottle.  I love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this work for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! You definitely will see growth!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the delivery as promised when ordering.&lt;br /&gt;The product it self is amazing!</li>
            <li> its okay I only used it once haven&#x27;t seen much difference my daughter loves it though I can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s a good product or not you have to try for yourself</li>
            <li> Love this product. It worked wonderfully for me</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my hairfinity vitamins I&#x27;ve immediately saw results in the 2nd week of use.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of these and have been taking them fairly regularly but see no difference in my hair growth. Same thickness, same amount of daily hair loss.</li>
            <li> I like the product, it stands by its word about letting your hair grow, will purchase it again</li>
            <li> I have a question more than a comment. Has anyone experienced chest pains after taking this? I took the vitamins twice and both time had extreme chest pains after. I do have acid reflux and high blood pressure and I&#x27;m not sure if the chest pains were from heartburn the vitamin caused or heart related but I know it was the vitamin causing it.</li>
            <li> I took the entire bottle for a month. It seemed to have an improve the on my hair. Gave it some life.</li>
            <li> Halfway through my second bottle my edges seem to be growing back from damaging relaxers and color. Not sure how much grow I&#x27;ve gotten because I stopped relaxing before I started the pills. I guess I should have taken pics or a length test but hey my nails and edges look great so I will stick with them until July that we be my 6 month mark!</li>
            <li> They were shipped super fast! And I see my hair getting thicker and stronger already</li>
            <li> Help! I&#x27;ve ordered from the hairinifinity site and love the pills they DEFINITLY work. I&#x27;m trying to avoid paying shipping since I have prime. To the people who have ordered from both sites- Are these the legit pills?</li>
            <li> 5 Stars All The Way .!!! My Order Came In Early And The Package Was In Great Shape . Im Going To Order The Two Month Supply As Soon As I Finish This Review lol . 💊💊💊💊</li>
            <li> Only been a week and already seen about 7/16 of an inch in growth. No nausea from this pill. Nothing weird. Little bit of scalp itching but I think that&#x27;s prob a good sign. Just wish they&#x27;d lower the bit A content in these vitamins as that can actually cause hair LOSS.  Overall god product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> yessss they really do work ladies . !!!</li>
            <li> This Product Has Made My Hair Grow 7 Inches In Just ONE MONTH !!!</li>
            <li> I have only been taking this vitamin for a few weeks but I already see a difference with my nails!</li>
            <li> Excellent. I have started using it and my gr a nddaughter. Waiting to see the results.</li>
            <li> I ordered two (2) bottles of Hair Finity for $39.95.  I only received one bottle.  Please send second bottle.</li>
            <li> Very great product...</li>
            <li> Of course, I order these twice per year just to boost my hair growth...and I got nail growth, beautiful skin and 2 inches of hair growth within 2 months.</li>
            <li> First things first - do not buy from this seller ...I have bought a two-months supply directly from the supplier for a total of 48$ + shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the review, I have just finished a bottle and I can tell you that my hair did grow faster than my normal hair growth pace ! I can tell from the grey roots that I have dyed a week before starting those supplements. From my experience, I must say, it ONLY grew my hair longer but DID NOT make them stronger ! The same thin, dull looking hair are here... but longer !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a MUCH better experience with Nature&#x27;s Bounty Hair Skin &amp; Nails Extra Strength. I truly believe it&#x27;s the higher dose of Biotin in the Nature&#x27;s Bounty that makes the hair stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hairfinity is NOT a bad product, it&#x27;s an OKAY product with a high price point, and it&#x27;s certainly not a miracle product. I think everyone will react differently to this product. It&#x27;s also important to note that I have had tons of BREAKOUTS from this product on my first week of use. But I drank A LOT of water the rest of the month and my face was back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion and from experience, I HIGHLY suggest you to try Nature&#x27;s Bounty Hair Skin &amp; Nails Extra Strength instead of Hairfinity.</li>
            <li> Just got the item but i&#x27;m really excited to the see the outcome since my cousin has had positive results</li>
            <li> Best product ever created. I&#x27;m a black male with mpb. Male pattern baldness. Or maybe I should who has had mpb. Cause this product worked to it full expectation. I would buy again and recommend to any one. You&#x27;ve try the rest now try the best. Drink lots of water. I had no pimples with the use of this product. Cause I stayed with water. My barber noticed the difference after two weeks. He said my hair was fuller and thicker. Ps it&#x27;s worth your money and time. Cause you will be more then satisfied</li>
            <li> It really is growing my hair. I had lost all of my temple areas, and was very thin in the top.  I cut my hair down to the natural curl and it was beautiful, but then I wanted a change and my hair lost wouldn&#x27;t allow for that.  Now my hair is collar length and growing nicely. Never had a problem growing hair, it will get long, but long and sparse is not good. I am definitely getting over that problem, but there is more work to do. I would and I have recommended this product to others. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any effects. I tried it for one month and I do not know if it made my hair grow faster than it already does. I did notice my hair shined a bit more.</li>
            <li> I got these in the mail right on time it said it would get here! I&#x27;ve been taking these for a few months now but I decided to order them from Amazon for a change. I was very pleased with packaging and they came in great condition! I&#x27;ve definitely seen a difference in my hair since starting these vitamins. I take them twice a day and my hair is way thicker and stronger! My mom also takes them and I can really see the difference in her hair. These really work and I couldn&#x27;t be anymore pleased! So if you&#x27;re looking to have thicker, stronger hair that grows faster, take these!</li>
            <li> Great product, I have had good su hair growthccess with my</li>
            <li> I noticed that it works well in  short amount of time. I used it for maybe 2 weeks when I noticed my new mustache, I was done with the product. Not trying to grow fast hair with a mustache.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether this product worked for me or not.&lt;br /&gt;I was one of the unlucky ones and had a negative skin reaction to these capsules and so I stopped using it. I prefer taking Biotin vitamins over these. You can get similar results if not better with the right vitamins at a cheaper price too.</li>
            <li> At first I could not believe the strength of this formerly vitamins my hair was not growing at all, and now after using these pills it grow 2 inches in less than one month Really I would advise everyone to use it</li>
            <li> Still taking but loved the price, no bad breakouts</li>
            <li> Been taking it almost a month now and starting to notice a little improvement; my first bottle from Amazon, I only got 59 capsules...</li>
            <li> Still not use it, but I heard about it its good</li>
            <li> Came in good condition:) Now its time to see if it really works</li>
            <li> Ehh, i took these everyday for the month as prescribed and i barely gained a half an inch. I know thye said your hair can grow slower as you get older, but im only 28. I exercise and drink water and eat healthy. I tried everything i could, deep conditionded and took REALLY good care of my hair with protective styles and all. But this didnt work for me. To each&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Helps promote healthy hair....has my hair thick and growing very rapidly. I love it</li>
            <li> My hair has already began to grow because of this. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am three weeks into my first bottle and i notice my edges starting to fill in</li>
            <li> Cant wait to see my hair growth!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see a difference in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it really works.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy and satisfied for the Hairfinity. I was very elated to have found them on Amazon. It&#x27;s expensive to order them online specially with the Tennessee, state tax. I would be able to get them when I visited family in Nee York, or my sister would mail them to me. So I am extremely happy.</li>
            <li> 8/17 So far so good, hair is growing.  First couple weeks skin broke our, I put toothpaste on the pimples and my hair and skin is getting better.  80% of my thinning sides broken off from extensions, has grown back&lt;br /&gt;10/17 Update 3 months later.  Hair is growing great.  Eyelashes great, nails getting stronger.  Drink plenty of water to avoid breakouts</li>
            <li> Love love customer service</li>
            <li> Well I haven&#x27;t started taking the pills yet but reading the reviews I must say , you can NOT expect the pills to do all the work. You have to drink plenty of water , &amp; it&#x27;ll also help if you excercise ( it&#x27;ll help you sweat all those toxins out your body that will cause the breakouts). Btw... Protective styles are best as well where you&#x27;ll see much of a difference, due to the fact you won&#x27;t be combing your hair as much causing breakage . I always wear sew ins &amp; I follow these regimens so I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll work fine for me . But &amp;#34;fingers crossed &amp;#34; I&#x27;ll surely update .</li>
            <li> As always it works great</li>
            <li> While the expiration date meant that the supplements were still good, the inside of the  bottle was powdery.  I kept the product since the seal on the package was not tampered with.  Regardless, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> It definitely didn&#x27;t not meet my expectations.. Waste...</li>
            <li> Item Delivered On Time &amp; 60 Capsules As Promised 😊 Love It 😙</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the Hairfinity vitamins.  My hair has been restored to its thickness, and there has been a lot of growth.  I would recommend these vitamins who is experiencing problems with their hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing the results and I&#x27;m very happy to see my hair growth.  Thank you Hairfainity!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the product, but it got here really fast. It was a little expensive though.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. No complaints!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stop using it cause within days of using this pill I start breaking out!!!!!</li>
            <li> My package was received on time and the service was great.  After using it for a while, I noticed my hair was thickening,  receiving nutrients and strength, as well as, getting some length.  This is truly a God sent... since, I had to cut my hair extremely short due to harsh perm damaged. I noticed that my hair is fuller and has more body.... like I had in my teens and twenties.  I recommended this product to anyone who needs help with any hair issues. I&#x27;m seeing beautiful results in a short time that I have been using Hairfinity Healthy Hair Vitamins Supplements.</li>
            <li> We are still trying to see if this helps to improve hair growth.</li>
            <li> Received rash on my face</li>
            <li> We a seeing some results but this is only the first bottle so goin to order more</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two months my hair is growing.  I love that getting longer, thicker, healthier hair this product really works well my hair is Finally growing again because I take a lot of medications and my hair was falling out because I have just went through two back surgeries this is a lifesaver I am in love with this product I would recommend it to all my friends and family it really works.

My goal is shoulder blade  length in eight months will keep you updated. I normally can&#x27;t get pass shoulder.  My hair is almost pass my neck not hitting my shoulders yet.</li>
            <li> It makes my sister&#x27;s hair thick and long</li>
            <li> I just finish my first bottle of hair infinity and it seems to be growing my hair. I am now on the 2nd bottle. I read some reviews where they take this hair vitamin with a biotin vitamin, so I may try taking bpotin as well. At least for a little bit. I would recommend the hair infinity vitamins/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been taking these for 2 1/2 weeks and i haven&#x27;t checked for length but my heAd has been itching LIKE CRAZY !  And sometimes my skin itches like EVERYWERE ! . I always take it at different times Of day like I take it when I feel like it and I was taking 1 a day now I&#x27;m taking 2 a day &#x27; and I take them with a little water ( I&#x27;m very bad at drinking water) but this pill used to give me VERY bad head aches and they would last all day ! But I guess I had to get used to them ... But my body hair haven&#x27;t been growing fast at all ... I hope theses pills work CUS after my 2nd bottle I&#x27;m done taking them I can&#x27;t take the itchiness !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started talking the vitamins but I heard a lot of good results from I&#x27;m always satisfied with products I have received except 1it was the car mount cell phone holder that I have had a problem with it will not stick to the dash it keeps falling off</li>

            <li> This product have really improved my hair shredding.</li>
            <li> This stuff works awesome! Happy to find such a fast shipper too.</li>
            <li> I have only started using this product as my hair has been falling out - too soon to review and provide feedback</li>
            <li> I Love Hairfinity hair vitamins.  They are Terrific! I would recommend them to anyone who wants to grow long healthy hair.  I will be buying my second bottle soon and I am very pleased with the results they promised to deliver and they did!  Believe me this stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> I used them for about 2 months and didn&#x27;t really see any results. Maybe my nails got stronger but that was all.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. The first month I noticed a change in thickness.  The second month I did get growth. Hoping it continues in the third.</li>
            <li> Wow, I am amazed on the on how Hairfinity transform my hair. I am one of the women that could never get my hair to grow. Within the first two weeks of using Hairfinity my hair started to grow. I thought my eyes was playing trick with me. It been over a month now and everyone ask me am I wearing a wig. They don&#x27;t believe it my real hair. They actually have to come feel on it.(lol). I can&#x27;t explain on how much I love Hairfinity. I wish I can meet the one that came up with Hairfinity and give them a hug .</li>
            <li> This was for my sister and she love it her hair actually growing</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Great product! I ordered two bottles &amp; it really works!</li>
            <li> Gives u really bad migraines not even excedrin extra strength won&#x27;t help and it also cause your hair to brake everyday</li>
            <li> MY HAIR SHED LIKE CRAZY! It&#x27;s so thin it&#x27;s ridiculous. I STARTED TAKING HAIRNAMICS, a new hair vitamin that has iron in it, and I got over 6 inches of new growth. But the ends which was the hair that was there before I took HAIRFINITY is so thin. I want to just cut the ends off, but my hair will be too short, might have to do a weave or some braids till I get my hair back. I&#x27;m so pissed. I don&#x27;t know what they have in hairfinity that causes this, but they need to take it off the market or something cuz it makes no sense to keep selling it when so many people report it causes excessive shedding #ijs - Google Hairfinity side effects or shedding and you&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m talking bout.</li>
            <li> still looking for result but happy!  It has been four months so far my hair is stronger, the thickness is starting slow but it is happening.</li>
            <li> It gives you real bad acne break out real bad.I drank plenty of water.I don&#x27;t know if I would try it again.</li>
            <li> Order was just as I expected. Great service!</li>
            <li> I love this! I have always use this!!! Never fails what it does!! 😍</li>
            <li> Not happy about receiving a product with no expiration date .I usually by my pills thru the company that make them .The pills were darker than usual and old.I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful works wonders</li>
            <li> So got the my order while waiting I got nervous reading comments but my hairfinity was packaged properly excited to try and see if it work :)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair and vitamin supplement, I have been using it for 2 years and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know yet. I will let you when I finish this bottle</li>
            <li> Love them they do work patience...</li>
            <li> These pills are seriously amazing! I was skeptical about them working but they really do! My hair is semi thin and I recently got it cut too short, so I decided to try these pills, I&#x27;ve been using them for the past month and my hair has never been healthier or thicker. It&#x27;s growing fast too. I just ordered my second bottle. Anyone whose wanting to try these please do they really work!</li>
            <li> Still waiting for results. It&#x27;s been only 3 weeks since I have been using this product, but others I know who have used it said it works great.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!! THIS IS A SCAM!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be stronger and getting longer but I think it&#x27;s a little too early to tell. I will write an update review when I&#x27;ve finished my bottle :-).</li>
            <li> I bought two hairfinity bottles,and this product almost took my life.&lt;br /&gt;All of a sudden i became so ill,i was shocked as iv not had a fever in years,,i went to the hospital the doctor ran some tests yet couldn&#x27;t find out what was wrong with me.I developed a serious migraine and even took sick time off from work.&lt;br /&gt;I just didn&#x27;t know what was going on with me,i was slowly dieing,i bought all sorts of fever pills and migraine pills ,they only helped for a few hours until the fever and terrible migraine returns.&lt;br /&gt;My friend who was very worried about me asked me if there&#x27;s any medicine im taking everyday,i told him none except for my hair vitamins.He asked me to try and stop taking for a few days and see if there&#x27;s improvement on my health,To my surprise,as soon as i stopped taking those pills,migraine  and fever disappears,&lt;br /&gt;please if your taking these pills and notice any headache,nausea,fever. etc,then these pills might be the stuf making you sick without your knowing.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet.  Just started using this product.  Arrival was quick.</li>
            <li> Please know your reaction to biotin before getting these because I broke out in my face really bad</li>
            <li> I think it did wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a real review. I am not paid nor associated with the brand. I had a bald spot in my hair from from some twist I had put it in I tried everything and nothing worked to regrow my hair. I had heard about these pills long before I bought themand finally decided to give them a try. I bought a two month supply and with in the first 2 weeks I had improvement in my hair as far as the condition of it as well as the bald spot was showing signs of growth at the end of the two month supply my bald spot is completely gone.I adore this product I love it it is affordable it works but I don&#x27;t recommend buying it from Amazon on the website it is $25 per bottle the shipping on the website is very fast it takes about a week but it&#x27;s worth it so grateful for these pills</li>
            <li> It grow my baby hair but to get good result you have to eat healthy food also</li>
            <li> Best product, very healthy and excellent seller.</li>
            <li> the cost on here is way to high, it&#x27;s cheaper everywhere else, you all nee to do better with pricing....</li>
            <li> My previous experience was very positive: My fingernails had phenomenal improvement and growth. Oh yes, I recall that my hair did very well, too :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy more! Amazing! Saler got the product to me in time. Thank you! :) makes your hair grow so fast! Seen an improvement!!!! So happy!</li>
            <li> This product really works and is amazing but only if you want your hair thicker not longer. It worked for a few months but now I don&#x27;t see any changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this at a better price than other places. I have been using them for a month or so and I have used them before. I notice a difference in how full and soft my hair has become. I also realize that proper maintenance will have an effect, too.</li>
            <li> Love Hairfinity vitamins.  My hair grow healthier and quicker.  Highly  recommended.</li>
            <li> best pills I hav e ever taken hair got longer but not Thicker I will be ordering more than you</li>
            <li> Hairfinity pills are the best.They not only grew my hair they also gives me energy.I dont nap during the day like i use to.</li>
            <li> Loved hairfinity it&#x27;s an amazing product especially if you are going natural and drinking plenty if water.  This is not a 1 time trial you must stick with the product will definitely be purchasing more on a monthly basis</li>
            <li> I absolutely love hair Infinity</li>
            <li> arrived FIVE hours before the expected time.... EXCELLENT....we&#x27;ve used this product before</li>
            <li> I did not like this product it broke my skin out really bad and I felt nauseous all the time I took it for a week to see if it would get better and it didn&#x27;t so it&#x27;s a waste of my money</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle, I have three pills left. I Stop taking it because for some reason my left leg starting cramping and paining me.  I did have a fall two years ago. but I don&#x27;t remember having that kind of pain.  Mostly when I first get out of bed in the morning.  So I want to wait a while to see my doctor  to see what he think could be the problem . Before I start taken it again.  My hair do look a little fuller.  I will see my doctor next month see what he has to say about the leg pain.  It may not have any thing do with Hairfinity, I shall see after my visit.</li>
            <li> I see good results with my hair</li>
            <li> The expiration date has been rubbed off of product, could be old product.</li>
            <li> I tried these and I did not like them they made my face break out real bad and my hair started shedding real bad I will never take these again</li>
            <li> My hair has not grew from these pills at all I should have Kelp My Money In My Pocket ughh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair definitely got thicker and has grown. But it doesn&#x27;t prevent from things like split ends etc. You still need to apply necessary protecting products in order for your hair to grow healthy. But these pills definitely help. I just wish they were cheaper. And also my month supply bottle actually came with a few days extra worth of pills.... (and no I didn&#x27;t forget to take them any day.)</li>
            <li> It deserve Five stars😊</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for a few months. My hair has become thicker and and grown considerably. I like it plus I have been drinking alot of water which is needed for healthier hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!!! My hair is growing like crazy!!!</li>
            <li> I Love ❤ my Hairfinity it really works!!!! and thank you to both companies.</li>
            <li> The pills busted open and the powder was all in the bottle.  Too expensive .  Not a good price</li>
            <li> So I came across this supplement on instagram and was curious to see if it would work for me. To my disappointment I couldn&#x27;t take it long enough to see results because it induced the most horrible break out I have ever seen on my face and thats after only ONE week of using it. After posting my disappointment on IG I was then informed that I had to increase my water intake. Apparently the MSM in it flushes out toxins and without enough water to flush those toxins it breaks you out badly. Now my beautiful skin is ruined so now instead of focusing on my hair journey I now have to focus on getting my skin clear again. I really think this is overrated, because prior to this I was taking regular multi vitamins and experienced increased hair growth. I will go back to my regular vitamins. This is just not worth messing up your skin for. NOT recommended if you are not in the habit of drinking 8 glasses of water or more a day.</li>
            <li> How old do you have to be to use it? Meaning is it for 18 and up or can be younger long as they can swallow.</li>
            <li> The vitamins combined with the biotin in this product actually did thicken and slightly lengthen my hair. I plan to order another 2 bottles. (Each bottle contains a month&#x27;s worth of pills). I would recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I like them I&#x27;ve been taking them for about two months now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product,  after the first month I started to see a difference</li>
            <li> These really work. My hair has grown tremendously but ordering them from the original site will save u money. I learned the hard way...could&#x27;ve got 2 for the price that I paid for 1.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It grew out 3 bald spots that I acquired because of stress... Simply amazing...</li>
            <li> made my BIGCHOP much easier....what are you waiting for order now!!! im on my 2nd bottle!!</li>
            <li> These supplements did not agree with my body and upon the first week of taking them, it caused me to experience my menstrul cycle early and took an entire month before it stopped and became better regulated. I also experienced the worst case of acne taking these pills.</li>
            <li> just like Anyone else i was very hesitant to trying this.. i saw some reviews (hair goes in other places etc.) it doesn&#x27;t at all! you can tell after just the first week in the condition of your hair! mine grew very quickly ! when normally my hair grows soooo slooooow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im almost done my 1st bottle and have been taking 2 a day as recommended! not only is it growing quicker than usual - but even my Hairdresser stopped and asked me what i was doing! she said my hair is Very soft and full of life compared to before. looks very healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my One complaint.. i ordered right from the site.. and shipping to Canada is MORE than the pills.. 1 month &#x3D; $24, shipping&#x3D; $29.99.... but i had to try it! and im so glad i did ! cant wait till my 2nd bottle is done :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. yes, i would order it again!</li>
            <li> I took of my hair before and after the results was amazing 2 inches in 2 weeks this product is amazing thanks.</li>
            <li> Vitamin capsules were broken never order from here again</li>
            <li> Love it! I saw a difference in just two weeks. No side effects for me! I will continue to buy this product until I reach my hair length goal. I usually take it with breakfast and before bed. It worked fine.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results as of yet. I&#x27;m sure each individual has different results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hairfinity for  about 6 months now I believe, and I&#x27;m starting to see new growth around my edges, and some thickness. I&#x27;m going to continue using it for about a year. I like the bigger bottle, and will be ordering that again.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;2nd bottle ordered. My hair grew 3 inches with the first bottle. Leaves my hair feeling healthy, must drink lots of water. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Just finished my 1st bottle. I hope to see results by the 2nd or 3rd bottle</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping....great buy.</li>
            <li> you could tell the product was old. Its letters and design on the bottle was coming off and some of the product in the bottle was starting to leak inside the causing it to change from clear to sandy white within a week. I suggest that they buy certain amounts and only reorder when they are out to ensure that the product does not sit for a while. And no, my bottle was not used.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews about this product, good and bad, and decided to try it for myself.  I have been using them for a month and have just ordered a second month&#x27;s supply only because not only I, but my hairdresser has noticed new growth.  I am trying to thicken and grow hair in a couple of areas where I lost hair due to a weave. The rest of my hair is very long. I will come back and give it another review in another month after I have been using this for sixty days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been I haven&#x27;t seen any result.</li>
            <li> You will definitely see results an inch every month. Just put your hair in protective Hairstyles while using these pills. Also drink water everyday see better results if you do abs no breakouts for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It works buy you can get it cheaper on the website hairfinity.com where you can also get points, discounts, and other hair growth products (:</li>
            <li> So far I am definitely satisfied my hair is stronger and healthier. And even the previously relaxed hair I am growing off seems to have stopped breaking off like it was before. I&#x27;ve already referred my mom, Aunt, and a few girls from work to try. I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair so short for quite some time and I&#x27;m rocking little ponytails now. Very exciting!</li>
            <li> My hair is growing quickly with this product. Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> i wasnt impressed by the reviews online about these pills but i really works, my hair doesn&#x27;t look a lot longer but it looks fuller and healthier .. have only used it about a month and i can already see the results.. i grew a little i suppose that within the 60 days of taking pills it will be longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure what to take on this, so I definitely do not want to give this a bad review because my excessive split ends and weak hair could be for endless reasons.&lt;br /&gt;But it did make my hair grow!&lt;br /&gt;I think that hairfinity works, but if you don&#x27;t take care of your hair along the way you won&#x27;t see the results you want. And that was my problem. I didn&#x27;t wrap my hair at night always, condition, or have protective hairstyles during the week. Plus it is windy where i live and that can damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So definitely try hairfinity and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but from reading previous reviews I think that it will be 100% satisfaction.</li>
            <li> My hair is still falling out a bit after having baby but so far I can see it&#x27;s looking healthier!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It does work. You do have to take care of your hair, so do not expect the vitamin to do all of the work on its own.</li>
            <li> HairFinity Healthy Hair Complex is wonderful.  My daughter noticed my thinning hair a few months ago and ordered me two bottles.  I have since ordered two more bottle.  My hair is noticeable thicker.</li>
            <li> It really works I saw the difference in my hair after the first day I started using them</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK IT LEFT ME WITH A FACE FULL OF ACNE &amp; BLACKHEADS!!!! IF YOU HAVE ACNE PRONE SKIN DONT TRY THIS YOURE JUST ASKING FOR MORE ACNE!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife and she is already satisfied and seeing the results. Great product.</li>
            <li> My hair grew a lot after HairFinity intake.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if my nutrition made some influence but my hair grew 2 inches per month..</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle.  I have very thin hair at the very top of my head, so much so that I wear headbands all the time.  I started getting really discouraged and I came across this.  I take this and a vitamin D3 (my doctor told me I practically had no vitamin d in my body at my last checkup)  every night before bed.  It&#x27;s taking some time but I think I may be seeing some improvement.  I put crochet braids in to give my hair a rest and I could barely put in enough of the base braids to make a decent hairstyle without using a scarf to cover the thin patch.  But this time around I was able to add an additional base braid.  I&#x27;m drinking lots of water too and massaging my scalp with a combination of the Alma oil (billion dollar potion), and Via hair gro serum.  It SEEMS to be working but I don&#x27;t think I will know definitely until the next month or so.  Will update then.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 4 days and of course I have not seen any results but I can say I received the product in a timely manner. I can&#x27;t wait to see growth!!</li>
            <li> These pills work great! I can defiantly see a change in length within the first month!! DONT BUY FROM AMAZON!!! ITS DOUBLE THE PRICE! GO TO ACTUAL HAIRFINITY WEBSITE!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent, result seen</li>
            <li> I purchased a month supply two months ago. I did not take it as reccomend end just randomly and I never write revised but even with taking a few times a week I noticed hair growth! I even had to dye my roots again because they were so grown out! love this!</li>
            <li> Very good for the first month.  My hair feels fuller but one bottle is too expensive from Amazon next time I&#x27;ll get it from hairfinity.com it&#x27;s 24.00 for one and 48.00 for 2 months</li>
            <li> This is my second month on the hairfinity capsules. Been taking twice a day as directions say and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference at all.. I understand vitamins take a while to absorb into your system, but this product seems like a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like the hairinfinity pills but I did not like the ones I bought from this supplier. They had a strong odor that the others did not have and they looked different. I will stick with the previous supplier or buy off the hairinfinity site.</li>
            <li> This did not make my hair grow BUT it did stop the fall outs and it feels softer so thumbs up from me on that. (Used 2 months)</li>
            <li> They worked great. I seen results in a matter of weeks. I am glad I joined the Hairfinity Family. I look forward to continuing our business relationship.</li>
            <li> My hair is stronger with less breakage after just one month of using it. Can&#x27;t wait to see what results I will see in the next 30 days.</li>
            <li> helped with acne. my hair did grow</li>
            <li> I gave this product a three start because I have 3b type hair (curly) so it&#x27;s very dry. It got my hair really full the first month. Then I continued to drink the pills for another month and saw no growth. I am now taking it for a third month and is honestly feel like there is no change. This product is ok. I guess it depends on who takes them. To me they barely did sh** but get my hair fuller the first month.</li>
            <li> This product is good it really works but u should go to the website its much cheaper</li>
            <li> ******This is a 3 month update******: I did not see any growth. Shedding did slow down alot. I tired it for 2 months and at the end of the 2nd I started weening off and taking Country Life Maxi Hair vitamins. They were $11.99  and same ingredients -more vitamins then Hairfinity with the exception of vitamin D which I take separately because I know my Vitamin D is low from my yearly Blood work/physical.I switched over to Country Life and never finished the hairfinity. I noticed  significant hair  growth with Country life Maxi Hair. My nails are growing like the American Werewolf in London. I tried Proactiv+ and I had irritation-not sure of its related to the vitamins or the product, but I will go back to the Original Proactiv and stay on Country Life Maxi Hair.  Overall hairfinity  is down graded to 2 stars-for less shedding.    I&#x27;ve been taking these for a week and a half now and my main concern was breaking out in acne. I have cystic acne and I used MSM before which was in a natural joint med and it broke me out in large painful pimples that took months to go away and they left scars. I had to take Advil for the pain and swelling. Since then I started drinking more water for overall health. I have not had any problems with Hairfinity so far. Thank God. I found vitamins in the wholefood store with the exact-exact ingredients for $11.99. If I don&#x27;t have any reaction to the MSN,I will probably take those because of price. As for hair growth-I will do another review at the end of 30days.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any result in my hair..</li>
            <li> I have almost completed my first month using Hairfinity. My hair is noticeably thicker and I have at least a one half inch of growth. I had three almost bald areas which are showing signs of hair regrowth. What is most noticeable to me is that my. hair texture has improved. It was so brittle and breaking off..no matter how much I conditioned and oiled it. I am committing to another month of this product.</li>
            <li> I saw immediate growth, but I itched so badly that I stop taking them. I never broke out in acne. However I do drink lots of water. I may try again, but do I pill instead of two and see how that work. I just had to stop, because the itch was terrible.</li>
            <li> I order the pills for my daughter and she said that they really make your hair grow</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle and didn&#x27;t notice any hair growth. I was told that I must use it consistently by my hair dresser. This can be quite expensive so, I opted out of using this product. It may work for those who can afford to use this product for 6 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing it on Instagram from the actual website. Buy from the actual website it is much cheaper. Also if you compare the ingredients its the same thing as Woman&#x27;s One A Day Multi-Vitamin. They just changed the daily needed value to 200% sides of 100%. The biotin is exactly the same. Plus its three times the cost of One a Day. Also after doing some research I learned that hair takes almost three months to show a difference. Meaning if you change your diet you wont see the difference until three months later. Same with these pills. All the posts about two inch difference in one month aren&#x27;t possible unless your hair naturally does this. Your hair grows on average half an inch a month. I really wish I would have done my homework before buying these. Lesson Learned</li>
            <li> Noticed after two mos. Hair growth &amp; looking fabulous</li>
            <li> this product is amazing I could show inches in just a few weeks</li>
            <li> Love it. I haven&#x27;t even had for a month and I&#x27;ve seen results.</li>
            <li> I have been taking the pills for 2 weeks now and I already noticed a difference.  I have new growth and unfortunately it makes my permed hair look \\&quot;poofy\\&quot; but it&#x27;s OK cause I look forward to my next perm.  The scalp did itch a little during the first few days however that went away.  My nails are also growing.  As far as the acne breakout...I have not experienced it yet and hope I don&#x27;t but I also wash my face with Ambi so that my be helping me out a little bit (I&#x27;m not sure).  I have nothing negative to say about the product and if things keep going like this...yes I will repurchase but from their website where it is cheaper...lol.  Hope you all have great experiences as well.    SECOND BOTTLE UPDATE 10/31/14  I was so pleased with my first purchase that I purchased another bottle.  I hair was shoulder length and now it is down my back and it has not been over 2 months.  Still no acne (but I love drinking water also).  I have pics on my Facebook page for those interested.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I&#x27;d like to say that I am not the one to do reviews unless I absolutely need to as in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had mild breakage and I read on numerous sites that hairfinity was THE vitamin to take to not only stop breakage but actually grow hair. I just want to add, I can grow my own hair and have been blessed to have a full head of hair. I merely took these pills as a precuationary tool just in case my case of shedding was more than just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What proceeded to happen next was a hard lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few days of taking these pills, my body felt strange...but I just thought maybe it was all in my head. After about a week, I literally woke up with massive headaches and heart palpitations. I live in NYC and consider myself in decent physical shape. But going up stairs proved to be difficult for me; in fact I had shortness of breath for the first time in my life. I&#x27;m 32.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to all of these, I started to severely break out. Brock Beauty&#x27;s website affirms that these breakouts are merely our bodies ways of getting rid of toxins. No. I don&#x27;t think so. I would not have experienced physical distress if this vitamin only did that. My face and chest broke out so much, I am embarrassed at how terrible my face and chest look. I probably took the pill for less than two weeks and all of this has happened. Mind you, I eat healthily and consume plenty of vegetables and fruits daily. I only can imagine what would have happened if I finished the bottle. I probably would have gotten a heart attack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s body is different but I would suggest you speak to a doctor before taking these pills or take extreme caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not worth the health risks and  face and chest full of pimples.</li>
            <li> Second bottle and my hair is longer and more manageable but I originally purchased it thinking it will regrow a receding hairline and it hasn&#x27;t so I will be finishing product and searching for a new product.... Next stop manechoice don&#x27;t get me wrong it does what it says just don&#x27;t get your hopes up if your balding or have trouble spots.</li>
            <li> I took them for the 2 months faithfully.. I honestly think it took some of my hair out and brought back an old scalp condition ( psoriasis). I alwasys drink water... it is just about the only liquid I will drink... I did not experience any facial breakouts like others. I will say that ever since I stopped taking them my scalp has been fine and I have WAY less shedding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter said the same thing. She didn’t have scalp issues and when she was taking them her scalp itched and was irritated AND she felt her hair was shedding more than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fried of mine took them as well.. not as faithfully as I did. But she felt her hair was shedding more than normal as well. I will not state a full review for her... I don’t want to misquote :0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I take them again?  HECK NO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend them to anyone?  HECK NO</li>
            <li> Wife used product. Not very pleased with results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; cause I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 8 days and it&#x27;s to soon to tell. So I&#x27;ll check back after a month usage. I&#x27;ve notice no change in my hair texture or any growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad with! This bottle is false, don&#x27;t buy people!</li>
            <li> Before I bought hairfinity, it seemed like there was no catch besides the expensive price. THERE IS. It makes you breakout like none other. I look like a 13 year old hitting puberty again. It&#x27;s awful. And I have only been taking it for 2 weeks.  Save your skin and your money!</li>
            <li> a lot cheaper on their own website. your a ripoff!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen much improvement but my hair has grown about 2-3 inches in the first month taking it . I expected way more results since the results on the official hairfinity site gives positive comments .</li>
            <li> Excellent have lots of new growth</li>
            <li> VIDEO UPDATE!  I&#x27;ve been natural for 9½ months  See how much my hair has grown.  https://m.youtube.com/?app&#x3D;m&amp;persist_app&#x3D;1#/watch?v&#x3D;CEXDG_0YW4w</li>
            <li> It works well for your nails but not your hair&lt;br /&gt;My nails grew fast but my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to grow it looks the same.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have 60 pills as promised product previously openend!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try using this product and I followed all the instructions did everything I was supposed to do and I did not see any results.</li>
            <li> It worked for me and my daughter! I have soft curly, fine hair my hair is longer, thicker and has very little shedding! My teenage daughters results are the same! We will continue to use for a year. We have had no side effects.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product over two months ago, the product has been wonderful.  I have seen a change in my hair  - it is healthier, stronger and has grown.</li>
            <li> Great product and it is working so far.</li>
            <li> Been taking for one month and I have had about an inch in growth and my hair has increased in thickness. My ends were really shedding and I have seen less breakage, I&#x27;ll be starting my second bottle and hope I to see more growth.</li>
            <li> I have my hair braided in box braids and I started taking hairfinity the same day I got it done. Before that I was taking Biotin 5000 mg caps. Let me say this, since being on hairfinity my hair is growing like a potted plant. I wash and deep condition my hair once per week, moisturize my braids and scalp every other day and take my hairfinity, making sure to drink at least 3 bottled waters a day and sometimes more. That&#x27;s been my routine for this entire 30 day supply and my hair has grown at least an inch if not more. I actually have to get my braids redone because of the new growth. My edges haven&#x27;t grown in on the side that well but I have a full head of baby hair on the fronts that I haven&#x27;t seen in years. Just try them, they work for me and I haven&#x27;t changed my diet food wise.</li>
            <li> I am starting  on my second bottle,  and so far I have not seen much difference.  I still have a third bottle,  and if I still don&#x27;t see any results,  I&#x27;m not likely to try anymore.  I am however hoping to see some results, and when I do, I will gladly write a new review.</li>
            <li> Not sure about my hair growing (although I think it is longer in the month I&#x27;ve been taking this supplement) but nails are super strong now!  I used to have nails that were really flexible and would break easy. Now they are super strong and grow fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite checking the product &amp;#34;nutrition&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; for soy and not seeing any documented, it seems that this product DOES contain soy.  I have a bad reaction to soy (protein), a reaction that I do not have to anything else I consume.  Each time I took just one pill, half the recommended dose), I was ill for the next day.  When I stopped taking this vitamin, the reaction stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried emailing the company from the Hairfinity website to get a definitive answer as to whether or not this product contains soy (or any ingredients derived from soy), but they never responded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my recommendation to anyone with food allergies or sensitivities is to email the company and ask for a definitive answer on whether the product contains the allergen or any ingredients derived from the allergen.  If they don&#x27;t respond, steer clear.</li>
            <li> Hair growth, softer hair, easy to take supplements.</li>
            <li> HAIRFINITY HAS REALLY WRK FOR ME</li>
            <li> I take this daily with a strong biotin supplement: [[ASIN:B00PWQTG8E Omegaboost Biotin for Stronger Hair and Nails]], and the combined effect of both pills is nothing short of amazing. Hairfinity is like a hair growth multi, it contains many different ingredients to help your hair grow, which is why I recommend taking it with a straight biotin supplement as biotin is the most important supplement that most people are short on. Some say natrol biotin works well for them, but im sticking with omegaboost as its 5,000MCG and seems to be very high quality.</li>
            <li> Awesome got it really fast! Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I was using these for a little while, but then I decided to stop since it didn&#x27;t sit right with me.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product for 6 months.  Saw results immediately.  This price was  the best price.</li>
            <li> Using as part of a regimen to decrease hair loss and I&#x27;m seeing significant improvement. Granted, this is not a controlled experiment because I started some other things, too, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a critical element in the process.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product for the first time. So far I really like it. It makes my hair feel soft and my hair is growing out much faster. ( at least my friends are telling me this), so far I can not tell. :)</li>
            <li> Saw no difference in my hair</li>
            <li> Thank you for this wonderful product I bought for my daughter, she saw it on YouTube last  year and her hair grew a lot and is much softer looks extremely healthy and this our 2nd bottle we will be put in another order soon Thank you so much.... Juliana</li>
            <li> With this amount of biotin you must drink lots of water or else you face may break out…..  8x 8oz glasses &#x3D;1 gallon a day💧</li>
            <li> I would not recommend Hair Infinity.&lt;br /&gt;1) My nails chipped and thinned&lt;br /&gt;2) Hair grew back thin&lt;br /&gt;3)Constant Breakouts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion: ManeChoice! (Been using for almost a month and hair is already getting full, no chipping nails and my skin is clear)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money because of the Celebrity endorsements. Because if look at some of the before and after pics, you notice the growth but also on some the hair was thicker in their before pic too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Autumn</li>
            <li> Hairfinity is making my hair grow so much! Thanks Hairfinity.</li>
            <li> This bottle arrived in a decent time frame. My complaint is about the content of the bottle. There was a lot of loose powder inside the bottle, the capsules somehow came loose. I is obvious there was no longer 60 capsules.  It was definitely not the bottle as shown on the website.</li>
            <li> I literally have never written a review for any product before, but I HAVE to for this one. First let me start off by saying my hair is curly and HAD a thick texture. It grows pretty fast on its own, but I thought it would be nice to get some help. I was using Hairfinity for 1 month. I would take it off and on and the bottle literally lasted me for about 2 months. I would drink two bottles of water a day. (Maybe I should&#x27;ve drank more?) By the end of this bottle, I noticed my hair began to thin out but it defintiely grew. It probably grew about two inches. Even though I noticed my hair was becoming thin, I stupidly decided to purchase another bottle. For two weeks straight, I took the recommended dose of two pills daily. My hair is so thin not, it&#x27;s embarrasing. Literally, I don&#x27;t even care about the length at this point. It scared me so much, that I refuse to take these pills anymore. My hair has never been in this state, and the only thing I have changed in my diet is taking Hairfinity. My hair has NEVER been this thin as long as I can remember. I am just surprised, because usually I never have bad experiences with any product I take. This is the first time, and it&#x27;s so bad i&#x27;m scared to even use a blow dryer at this point. Maybe it has worked for others, but unfortunately for me it has not. Just be careful ladies. If you experience thinning of your hair, immediately stop taking this.</li>
            <li> amazing this grew my hair and my nails out in the first week. LOVE this product will be making it apart of my daily regimen</li>
            <li> stopped using... dont know if it works or not</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Packaged tightly..No Problems.</li>
            <li> The pills made my hair thicker in certain places.I take birth control pills also and I notice light bleeding as I started these.Then I stop taking them and the bleeding stop.I dont know if the pills caused it or not.I never had this issue before until I started these.I do know everybody is different so try it and see.I dont think I will order again.I will stick with taking a prenatal vitamin for growth.</li>
            <li> So far..So good.  My hair normally takes forever to grow but I have noticed over an inch of hair growth in a month.</li>
            <li> Honestly made my nails grow but had no change to my hair growth horrible break outs</li>
            <li> Purchased this product and started using immediately.  This product gave me acne when. I have clear beautiful skin!!! Stopped using immediately and started using another company called Hairburst. So much better. When I reached out to the owner via social media she immediately shot down the information shared and deleted my message.  Glad I use Hairburst now.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! My hair has never looked and felt more healthy.</li>
            <li> My hairfinity bottle pills were bad ...the powder was all over the bottle ...i dont know whAts going on????can i get a replacement plz</li>
            <li> Not sure why Amazon is charging so much for this product. It&#x27;s much cheaper buying it from hairfinity.com:/&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good growth aid if used consistently. Don&#x27;t expect to see immediate results. It definitely makes your hair thicker as well. Don&#x27;t buy this if you know you will forget to take it or if you don&#x27;t take care of your hair. It would be a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about 30 days now. I haven&#x27;t really been able to tell much of a difference in GROWTH but I have noticed a lot less breakage...a lot less hair in the shower/in my brush after washing. So that&#x27;s definitely a plus! I might continue to use it just to see what it can do over time!</li>
            <li> did not work made me eat too much the B vitamins in it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a little over a week. Pretty sure I will go back to using my GNC hair skin and nails formula. That worked great for me and I should have stuck with it. I never had acne into life... Now I have acne on the whole side of my face. I read a few reviews where a few other people have said this and didn&#x27;t think much of it.. But yeah.. Major acne.</li>
            <li> took one bottle. did not see any results</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and so far, so geeat! My hair is defintely healthier, stronger, and longer. On to the 3rd bottle shortly.</li>
            <li> Bought Hairfinity for my daughter.  First bottle seems to be working well.  Experienced lots of itching initially.  Only disappointment at this point is the bottle did not have 60 capsules as stated.  I&#x27;ve order a 2 month supply from the website.  Hopefully, I receive what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Every thing was good. Thanks</li>
            <li> I started Hairfinity a month ago and definetly notice a difference in length.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product! I have been using the product since November and have clearly seen an improvement in the growth and strength of my hair. The seller was also great because there was no hassle and the shipment was fast!</li>
            <li> Amazing..I definetly see a big difference in my hair fullness</li>
            <li> It helped my hair grow.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these pills since October, My didn&#x27;t grow at the rate i thought it would with the pills. When I purchased the pills some of the pills were damaged in the bottle. I would rather stick to my own hair regimen, than take these pills. I believe these pills work but only for women who have medium to long length of hair.</li>
            <li> I started my second week of hairfinity and I started getting a bald spot..a coworker asked if I was going bald???? I&#x27;m only 23 and have a head full of hair.. I discontinued  as of today, because  I can&#x27;t risk getting any more bald spots..  this is the only think I added to my daily routine..  this product just isn&#x27;t for me..</li>
            <li> No changes in my hair growth. To the contrary my hair broke off..</li>
            <li> Love them. My hair grew a half an inch within one month.</li>
            <li> it is really working I have only been using for a little over a month now and I can tell there is a boost in the growth.  I am going to give it another 60 days to really tell a difference before I give the 5 star review</li>
            <li> Although this product works, it made me ridiculously thirsty - to a point where I didn&#x27;t feel good! I started noticing results after I had almost finished my first bottle. At first, I took the two pills a day but as I started feeling more and more thirsty, I started taking one. I still purchase them because it DOES work, but I have started taking breaks because I don&#x27;t feel good after 10 days of taking them straight. I usually drink 2 per day for a week and take 2 weeks off... it still works, just a little slower. It is better if you get them from their website!</li>
            <li> It takes patience  and time . I saw the difference within my hair when I was going to quit. Also you have to eat right , drink water and workout</li>
            <li> This product is a great product for those who can actually use it. I saw noticeable hair growth in just 7 days! However, I had an allergic reaction, and my face broke out from using this product, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Hair Infinity for 3 months now and it&#x27;s About time I found something that makes my hair grow longer ,healthier, thicker and feels silky-like . Only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it had 59 pills when it should&#x27;ve had 60 :(</li>
            <li> Hairfinity healthy hair vitamins work great</li>
            <li> I love it!! A few of my co-workers used this product and there hair look good and mine is more healthy looking and growing.</li>
            <li> I just love the results after 60 days of hairfinity vitamins, now starting my 3rd bottle, thanks infinity. My hair is growing like never before, as well as being shiny and manageable, thank you Hairfinity!!!</li>
            <li> This product definitely helped the overall appearance of my hair, As far as being shiny And more body. But in no way did it help my hair grow or feel like it made it thicker. I took the product for over two months and didn&#x27;t see any results. So if you are looking for something to grow hair or make it thicker I would not recommend this try using Castro oil and coat your scalp with it and leave it on for an hour that promotes hair growth. Just a suggestion</li>
            <li> They are some good pill but I started to get bad migraines after using them but everybody is different but I did see some hair growth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first bottle,I haven&#x27;t notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I bought HF in August from the actual website in 2014. My hair was brittle and dry. My hair shedded so much after I comb it and get it out the sink it was a ball of hair. My skin was breaking out. I stop using it January 2015 And still NO growth!</li>
            <li> I have just completed my 1st 2 months of Hairfinity &amp; just reordered from Amazon my next 2 month supply. Someone had said it was way more expensive buying on Amazon, not true. I paid $48.99 + shipping from Hairfinity &amp; from Amazon it&#x27;s $54.99 with Prime the shipping is free so it all evened out. With Amazon Prime I&#x27;ll get it in 2 days which is much quicker. I have found this product to be 100%. I&#x27;m over 60, still wear my hair long (no it&#x27;s not grey yet) and I was getting the post menopausal receding hairline, my part was widening &amp; my hair was becoming very thin. After the 1st month there was a lot of new growth &amp; the receding is not noticeable any bald spots are now filled in w/ new growth &amp; I can see new hair growing, baby bangs etc. Not only has my hair grown longer but it is getting thicker. I will admit at first my hair seemed to be shedding more but the new growth is coming in much faster. My friends &amp; hairdresser noticed the change even before I finished the 1st bottle. My daughter was the one who persuaded me to try it as she has been using it for a few months with great results.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied.... great vendor to purchase from!</li>
            <li> I just started taking them 2 weeks ago and I already have sensitive skin so I just did the one pill a day from the beginning. I have noticed its thicker and is so much more manageable. You definitely have to keep up with your regular regimen though in order for them to work that&#x27;s my personal opinion. So far, so good though.</li>
            <li> Okay product. Did not grow hair as fast as expected (this was after using them for 2 months straight). Made scalp extremely itchy! And yes, I drank plenty of water while taking them. Only benefit is my nails grow really long and it DID grow my hair a little.</li>
            <li> I believe I need more time to give a fair review so I will be ordering the vitamins again.</li>
            <li> &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://fde97bgi-mx6tej2-2modtbqfj.hop.clickbank.net/\\&quot; target&#x3D;\\&quot;_top\\&quot;&gt;Click Here!&lt;/a&gt;</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle and I am loving the results so far. My hair is thicker and is healthier. I am a very happy client and I am going to continue with this process.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> They are great! I love Hairfinity! My hair is growing fuller and healthier!</li>
            <li> I have been taking the vitamins for 3 weeks now. To be honest I haven&#x27;t noticed much in the way of growth but from the day after I took the pills what I did notice was better manageability of the short hairs around my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;I suffered a lot of hair loss around my hairline 6 months after giving birth, and since taking the pills the shorts hairs are sitting in place in the direction they should be instead of straight up on end and frizzy. For this reason I will continue to take the vitamins as my hair is much better controlled.</li>
            <li> Love the supplements. Hate the price. Hairfinity.com is way cheaper for double the product!</li>
            <li> They make me throw up ..</li>
            <li> I love what hairfinity has done and continues to do for my hair! Great product!</li>
            <li> This is my third time buying these pills and I must say that it has made my hair healthy and grew ..In accordance with me using a few more others products..</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It does everything it says. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> one capsule opened so when i got it, powder all over the other capsules are there. had to clean it all one by one.</li>
            <li> Love this product, see results already.</li>
            <li> I have recieved my Hairinfinity and I hope this product helps me achieve my goal in regards of my hair growth. I know it will because I have seen real results in all my friends hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks healthy</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! Im 16 year old black girl, (sorry if that offends anyone, me saying &amp;#34;black girl&amp;#34;) and for me its extremly hard to grow nice length and volume hair.I&#x27;m very insucure about my hair for some odd reason and I&#x27;ve tried everything you could imagine for about 2 years, then I discovered this pill. I recently had a bad haircut and they cut my shoulder lenght hair to almost a bob cut. I tried the one month bottle and all my hair grew out again to where it was before, even longer!! I recommend you try this product. (As long as you don&#x27;t mind the smell.)</li>
            <li> It was a wonderful experience .It did my hair justice but it&#x27;s only been a month</li>
            <li> My hairstylist told me about this product after I had suffered from hair loss due to stress and grief. My hair was shedding like crazy and my scalp was starting to show. I&#x27;m only 30 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical to try this product because I was already taking 5,000 mcg of Biotin and saw that this product also contained biotin (good for hair, skin and nails). (I take multivitamins daily and the regular biotin vitamins I had been taking for months.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a two-month supply after my appointment with my hair stylist and made an appointment with her 6 weeks after. I ordered them from brockbeauty.com, and started taking them as prescribed. I took two daily, religiously. I can say that after about 1 1/2 I started noticing less shedding in the shower and when I would brush my hair. After about a month I really noticed a difference in the fullness and texture of my hair. My shedding had almost completely stopped and was so amazed that rarely I would lose even one strand of hair. My hair grew thick and a lot of small baby hairs started coming out. I used the two month supply, then stopped taking them to continue the regular biotin vitamins (from Costco) and continued taking as directed (3, daily) religiously. My hair started falling out again so I just ordered my auto-ship from brockbeauty.com. I can&#x27;t wait for my hair to stop falling out again. I can&#x27;t wait for the fullness. This stuff really works, and I recommend it to anyone looking to hide some bald spots. :)</li>
            <li> I started taking hairfinity in 2013 and you know you feel hairfinitys&#x27; working cuz your hair is growing but honestly its just your hair growing...anyways I started feeling really sick, half of my face stopped moving! I could not smile!  I was always sleeping and I could not look at light! So I went to the doctor and I stopped taking those pills, and they said since those vitamins are going to your hair they&#x27;re going through the brain..I got an MRI and had 3 unidentified spots on my brain, and they considered brain surgery, but they waited and a year later they were stable, but the thing is when I stopped taking hairfinity all the symptoms went away, and then I decided to try it one more time, and the symptoms came back! So what else are they, besides the pills, I&#x27;m not joking these pills are very dangerous I&#x27;ve heard other females that have taken these pills say they had heart troubles I do not advice these pills to anybody, do not buy these pills!</li>
            <li> Yes! These pills work. Umquestionably and without a doubt, they work. They&#x27;ve grown my hair down to bra-strap length in a year. However I noticed, once I stopped taking the vitamins my hair was weaker and growing in thinner. When you stop taking the pills and your new growth starts to come in, you will notice the difference in texture from when you&#x27;ve been taking supplements. My hair began to break off much easier and appeared to be weaker. I actually did the big chop today and I&#x27;m starting over, without the Hairfinity. I would like my hair to grow itself healthy and strong. GNC biotin supplements have a healthy quantity of Bioton, that will not weaken your hair over time.  Take it into consideration :)</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this.  But pills came open in container</li>
            <li> I am sure my body liked the vitamins, but I saw no change in my normal growth of hair and I used it for over 7 months.  The only thing I did notice was that  nails grew faster</li>
            <li> Wife must be feeling a placebo effect... she swears they are working, but I have noticed ZERO difference...  These are way overpriced for the ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> Caused cystic acne on my face and back</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t really know if I&#x27;ve experienced tremendous hair growth. I still have a couple bald spots from traction pulling. It&#x27;s been a couple days since I&#x27;ve been done with them. I&#x27;ll try a different brand and see if I get better results with that one.</li>
            <li> I purchased these from the HairFinity website where they are much cheaper...I am on my 4th bottle and I do see a difference in the thickness of my hair but and I gave gained some length but not much</li>
            <li> Love it so so sooooooooo much</li>
            <li> Love them! They work very well but you have to keep taking them.  Will not see results right away.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible .. Makes your face break out a lot . Even if you drink a lot of water</li>
            <li> The capsules  were  covered  with  a dust that  appears  to  be the product  inside the  capsules.  Maybe  one or more  are broken  in the  bottle.</li>
            <li> Been taking these pills for a month. Not sure on the growth yet because I have had a sew-in done since I began taking the pills. But it seems the hair has grown  much faster than usual from feeling between my braids underneath the sew-in.  However, I just had a baby and my acne was worse than ever. Since I started taking these pills my face has cleared completely up and I have not consumed any more water than usual. Acne was my main concern from reviews. Going to order more!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a quick delivery.  I received and started using the product and I must say, I&#x27;m surprised with the results.  The product is working as indicated.  I see results already.  I&#x27;m excited and looking forward to the long term results.</li>
            <li> Loveeee!!! And bottle is so cute!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any change in hair growth and I suffered headaches</li>
            <li> Amazing product so glad I ordered it. I&#x27;m now a loyal customer</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time now.. Honestly, i dont see any changes or difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the result. However it is cheaper on the ACTUAL website</li>
            <li> I would never expect a pill to give me healthy hair, and yet this pill is doing just that.  I&#x27;ve on my second month of these and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I suffer from plaque psoriasis of the scalp and a recent breakout left me with a LOT of bald spots.  I began taking these pills along with my psoriasis treatment to hit it from the inside and outside, and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.  My hair is thicker, longer, fuller, and the bald spots show new growth.  The seller is a dream to work with too!  It&#x27;s just an excellent vitamin to take that benefits the hair.  Top notch, never stop selling this product!</li>
            <li> I had hair loss around the edges due to tight braids.  I have tried the spray, the grease - they did nothing and cost a lot!  Finally I can see that my hair line is coming back.  Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I have only used used this product for a month.  I believe I am starting to see a difference.  My hair looks healthier and longer.  I also decided to stop using the flat iron and keep my hair pinned up so I am sure that plays a part as well.  Unfortunately, the prices here are way too high.  The month supply is only around $25 if you purchase from the hairfinity website.</li>
            <li> Still take them no sure yet</li>
            <li> This product made me break out in hives after one dose.</li>
            <li> Just buy biotin at your local drug store. Much cheaper and it does work!</li>
            <li> I have only tried this product for 30 days so therefore I can&#x27;t say if it really has worked or not. I can&#x27;t tell a difference but will try another month to see if I get results. Thank you</li>
            <li> Came on time, have notice new growth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken this product for 3 months and I haven&#x27;t seen near the results that other&#x27;s testify to. I received better results from GNC HAIR NOURISH without the side effects of pimples. Just my opinion</li>
            <li> Love it and buy two bottles often, one for me and my daughter. She struggled with her growing since she was little and this product did what all the OTC products couldn&#x27;t do it. Forget rogaine and empty promises from other hair products as this one will provide proof within days if used correctly</li>
            <li> My daughter has been taking these for a little over a month now and she loves it! Her hair is fuller and the strands are growing in stronger thus less breakage. With her solid wash/moisture regimen in tune with taking hairfinity, we are looking forward to seeing the progress her hair will make in 6 months to a year from now!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT LIKE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> These work like magic! My hair grew 3 inches in a month!&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who isn&#x27;t getting the results they want with these comb/brush your hair less and drink more water.&lt;br /&gt;Buy from the site...it&#x27;s a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Five stars&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li> I noticed growth in my hair</li>
            <li> I heard so many good reports about this product before I started using it.  However, I have been taking this product for over a month and I can&#x27;t tell if it has made my hair grow plus my hair is still breaking off.  I also heard that this product can break you out. It caused me to have itching and a rash when I first started taking them.  After using cortisone cream it had cleared up.</li>
            <li> Got the product in a timely manner without any problems and so far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it! Great company to do business with as well as great product!</li>
            <li> AWESOME MY HAIR GREW!!  I recommend this product to all !!!  My hair was blading in the top in the top of my head and in a month it  was growing back and it was thick all over!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful and I thank you very courteous deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Hair Finity for a month. My nails look amazing! My hair has grown over an inch. Great product!</li>
            <li> This time the bottle came and some of them  pills were open and there was powder in the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there was hair growth. I couldn&#x27;t finish the whole bottle&lt;br /&gt;Because of how bad this made me brake out, and I&#x27;m not even the person to get brake outs</li>
            <li> I would like this product so much more if it weren&#x27;t as heavily endorsed by celebs who never use it, and convince us of growth through clip-ins and hair extensions. Some things to note: 1. This is not a miracle pill, expect change with DAILY/consistent use, around 6 weeks. 2. Increase your water intake or your skin will suffer. 3. Start a hair diary where you can track your growth in pictures. For me, the first thing I notice was that my edges filled in right away, not much length but at least I&#x27;m no longer looking bald from years of braids and tight pony tails.</li>
            <li> These pills really work. My hair was thin from extensions and I normally have think hair. Ice been taking the pills for about a month and can really see the growth and my thickness is returning.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Stop working not sure why.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat order as my customer experience was great! The product works well too! I continue to see a difference. I have been taking this for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the entire bottle yet but I have to say that so far I&#x27;ve been able to notice a huge difference in my hair growth. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I was told this product really works. So far it has been a couple of weeks and I see a liitle difference.</li>
            <li> I started taking these pills about a month now and I already see my hair starting to grow at first I was using Rogaine but didn&#x27;t get any results. I heard about hairfinity through these celebrities and figured they&#x27;re only doing it for promotion but I decided to try it and I love the results  I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I am not sure have not used this long enough to know if it works. But thanks</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen results</li>
            <li> Like it my hair grown.</li>
            <li> thanks for the hair infinity it was what I wanted</li>
            <li> I have been taking hairfinity for 3mo. hais is still not growing</li>
            <li> Im in love with this pills.. im going to order more until i reach my desired lenght</li>
            <li> Love it!! My hair grew one and a half inch to two inches (i should have measured) but the growth is so obvious! I took the whole month supply and got such great results. On my second bottle now!</li>
            <li> Biotin is the active ingredient in tgis pill, and cost less in any retail store and give better results!!</li>
            <li> Great product and it really works.</li>
            <li> Im usually not the type to write any reviews for any product but i felt compelled to write a review on hairfinity. This product is the BOMB, it really really works. I must say that Ive never had any issues with growing my hair. In May 2010 I cut my hair in a bob and a few months later I went to my stylist to put in a relaxer. The relaxer made some of my hair fall out in the middle of my hair. I wassss soooo angry that I didnt even know what to do with myself. So to try to fix it, I had no choice but to put in a couple of tracks( which was costly) in the middle to make my hair look full bc you could tell that my hair was thin to my hair falling out. One day I was browsing the internet looking for the best brand of biotin pills to help my hair grow back and I came across hairfinity. Im telling you that was the best thing I ever did. I was very skeptical at first esp when I saw the price lol but I went ahead and decided to buy them. That was the best investment I ever made. Now it is D... Read more</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and the first bottle that I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon. My pills arrived within 2 days, with no loose powder. The pills do work wonderful magic, but do drink a lot of water.</li>
            <li> So far I have seen okay improvement (3weeks). I tend to end up only taking one a day (I forget to take the second one). My hair has not grown in length, and it does continue to have shedding (even when I trimmed my ends), but my edges appear to be growing back in, which was one of my main concerns. I also have been using Dr. Miracle temple and nape balm which may also be helping, so it&#x27;s hard to tell which has attributed to my edges coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails are stronger, and do not beak easily. They also appear healthier as they have a natural &amp;#34;sheen&amp;#34; to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t really like the taste of the pill. But it is easy to swallow. Will post more updates in a month.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about trying this product because of all the good reviews; however, after finishing my 1-month supply I saw no changes with my hair. 😔</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference yet 30 days out..</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s only one month not sure yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for 3 weeks and have noticed a slight growth in my hair.</li>
            <li> These pills are awesome! I&#x27;ve been using them for 2 months aftr birth control taking the center of my hair out &amp; micros taking my hairline out. My hair grew back in no time &amp; it also helped my nails grow strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> After taking for a few days, I felt tingling in my legs, so I stopped taking them. The tingling stopped. It could be a great product, but it&#x27;s not for me...</li>
            <li> I have been taking for a while and I noticed my hair growing</li>
            <li> My wife says she likes it and has asked me to buy some more.&lt;br /&gt;So I presume its working.</li>
            <li> Great hair product for my hair. I am white but my hair is more frizzy kinky than most white girls. My hairdresser said I have so much new growth and this is the longest my hair has ever been. I also take regular iron vitamins with the hairfinity. I see that it works good on African American hair. It works great on mine too!</li>
            <li> Hairfinity has grew my hair back in the spots where it had thinned and bald.</li>
            <li> Amazing, just amazing. Im a southern black American and my hair grows slowly without help. Once I begin using this my hair grew half up to an inch every month! My hair is stronger, sheds less, looks as if i have more shine and moisture... I mean the list goes on yall. I love it!</li>
            <li> It made me break out...cystic acne, sometimes rash patches</li>
            <li> a lot cheaper on original cite.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t worth the money if you just plan on buying it once so either stick to it or just don&#x27;t buy it because you won&#x27;t really see any improvements.</li>
            <li> Love these supplements! I had a lot of breakage prior to using these supplements. Had seen lots of endorsements on facebook but was still skeptical. OMG, my hair has never been thicker or healthier!! My hairdresser even asked me if I were doing anything different to my hair in between visits because it was growing so fast.</li>
            <li> My sisters love the vitamins.</li>
            <li> Excellent product;  item delivered on time</li>
            <li> I recommend it; It is very good and the seller is responsible</li>
            <li> OMG! It&#x27;s amazing! I saw a significant difference in my hair length. Definitely ordering again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for my hair so I will not be buying this product anymore.</li>
            <li> Saw this product at my friend&#x27;s page who recommended to everyone who&#x27;a had hair loss or damage problems and I was one of them due to so mant hair dyes and bleach which caused me to keep cutting my hair and hasn&#x27;t grown ever since, before buying this I checked the customer reviews and YouTube videos for more options also to see if it had any serous side effects, saw some good and bad reviews so to try it I ordered this myself and I&#x27;m on my second week and so far I&#x27;ve seen a different in my hair roots already the only bad part is I am encountering the side effects which are: my pee is lime green. Body itch, my appetite for food increased. Gas, and nauxia, also feeling drowsy throughout the day, but so far so good I will complete my first month and of results very and become more effective I will do a 3-month supply :)</li>
            <li> So I took the vitamins faithfully for 2 weeks, at the end of the 1st week I noticed a little shed but I read that may happen, so I continued by the end of the second week I literally had patches of missing hair I&#x27;m natural so I don&#x27;t put chemicals in my hair this was the only thing different added to my routine so again congrats for who this worked for but I have had to cut my hair dramatically just to bring it back to life I&#x27;m sad I got these results but what can I do about it now anyways its not for everyone..</li>
            <li> Excellent and it came right on schedule love it !!!!!</li>
            <li> It seems a little soon to be rating, so I can&#x27;t be completely honest in my review; so far Hairfinity does seem to be making my hair thicker.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. The expiration year was rubbed off the bottle. Pills appeared old and dust covered the inside of bottle. Compared pills to a earlier batch and the new pills were darker in color and smelled.</li>
