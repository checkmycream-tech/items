            <li>I bought this nail polish thinking it would look good for Christmas.</li>
            <li>and i loved using it for st Patricks day.</li>
            <li>You have to put on 3 or more coats, but it didn&#x27;t have the color result I wanted from the look on the bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a great color and it really lasts.</li>
            <li>Apply two coats of nail polish and finish off with top coat.</li>
            <li>and I can go more than one week of chip free nail polish!</li>
            <li>I usually love China Glaze.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to apply top coat to edges and under nails and every night apply a fresh top coat.</li>
            <li>and it looked just fine, until I took it off</li>
            <li>IMO, it&#x27;s the best green on the market today.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>This color is really fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful emerald green.</li>
            <li>Beautiful vibrant shine and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice color, decent price and pretty fast shipping so overall, it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>so I truely think it was this color in particular.</li>
            <li>it was a pretty color</li>
            <li>I make sure to let the coats dry</li>
            <li>The color is just that vibrant!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a metallic like green with a very high gloss kind of finish.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice green for the holidays and summer time on the toes maybe.</li>
            <li>Chipped more that some other colors that I have used.</li>
            <li>but it really is a very light green.</li>
            <li>I love the green.</li>
            <li>I used remover multiple time and it still did not come off, It has been 2 weeks and my nails are still tinted light yellow!</li>
            <li>But other than that this is a really fun color to wear!</li>
            <li>I put it on that morning and removed it that night and noticed my nails were a light green tint.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to add multiple coats, but I always do two coats to make the color ultra vibrant.</li>
            <li>I like this green very much; it&#x27;s a very pretty color.  </li>
            <li>My only problem with this is the fact of it chipping on me, I use a very good topcoat and a base</li>

            <li> This Polish looked good while it was on, but even though I used a clear base coat this polish left my nails yellow.  </li>
            <li> Secert to long lasting nail color: Trim and file nails, soak them in water and remove cuticle and then buff them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really long wearing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very noticeable but still there.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with china glaze before but this product needs to be taken off the market and reviewed, because i do not enjoy having yellow nails!</li>
            <li> Base coat and top coat are a MUST to make it last even longer.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use a base coat</li>
            <li> I had to put three coats just to make it look less yellowish.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a dark green</li>
            <li> However you might need a few coats to make it opaque.</li>
            <li> I am an OPI girl, but needed a witch green color polish for halloween.  </li>
            <li> This is as green as green gets!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed it makes me feel very embarrassed when someone looks at my nails.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if you forget to use a base coat, like I did, it will stain your nails an ugly yellow color.</li>
            <li> but it stains like crazy.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all, compared to some polishes.</li>
            <li> Wipe with nail polish remover and apply base coat.</li>
            <li> so if you use the polish dont use just one base coat use like two or three coats as a barrier before using.</li>

            <li> Ordered this for a friend for Valentine&#x27;s Day (she wanted it) She loved it, said the formula was awesome</li>
            <li> I love the green. Unfortunately, if you forget to use a base coat, like I did, it will stain your nails an ugly yellow color. It&#x27;s been several weeks and they are still yellow. They will be until they grow out all the way. Make sure to use a base coat and you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful emerald green. It&#x27;s not lime. IMO, it&#x27;s the best green on the market today.</li>
            <li> I like this green very much; it&#x27;s a very pretty color.  The only problem I had with it was that it stains your nails a yellow-ish color. It&#x27;s not very noticeable but still there. It&#x27;s a nice color, decent price and pretty fast shipping so overall, it was a good purchase.</li>

            <li> This color is misleading. I thought this was a dark green but it really is a very light green. I had to put three coats just to make it look less yellowish.</li>
            <li> Great color, lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> This is a great color and it really lasts. I have warn it in the summer and plan to wear it during the Christmas season.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish thinking it would look good for Christmas. I went to go wear it and it looked just fine, until I took it off it turned my nails YELLOW! I was very disappointed it makes me feel very embarrassed when someone looks at my nails. I am never buying this product again. After several attempts with trying to get it off with different products it still hasn&#x27;t came off.</li>
            <li> it was a pretty color and i loved using it for st Patricks day. I put it on that morning and removed it that night and noticed my nails were a light green tint.
