            <li>A wonderful product.</li>
            <li>One of the best hand</li>
            <li>The best quaility of lotion ive ever found</li>
            <li>This is the best hand cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Just like the hand and body crème - very good for the hands - I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li>I just loved it and searched Amazon for the best deal.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff and promptly delivered.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I lick this hand cream because it smells so good.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin fairly well; I did notice a bit of residue</li>
            <li>Good value for the money as well.</li>
            <li>Amazing lotion as well, absorbs quickly, moisturizes great, and the smell makes me happy every time I use it.</li>
            <li>My item arrived promptly and I love it!</li>
            <li>Best I have found so far</li>
            <li>I have shred it with many friends who say they like the way it goes on and the scent is very light</li>
            <li>and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>The creme is lovely and has a satin finish to it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hand Cream, but the box in a box in a box packaging is a bit of overkill.</li>
            <li>Otherwise..i love the handcream.</li>
            <li>I and my daughter love Olivina&#x27;s hand creams, body creams.</li>
            <li>I like to keep a stock of this hand crème to give as gifts and because it is my husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>so am glad that I can get it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li>I love the unique &#x27;olivy&#x27; scent, not at all sweet, although somewhat strong for some people.  </li>
            <li>I use this hand cream every day and it makes my hands smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>love that this contains no artificial fragrances or dyes.  </li>
            <li>It is not widely available at retails so am very happy that I can get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with this and am interested in trying more products from Olivina.</li>
            <li>Rich, smooth, does the skin gooood.</li>
            <li>Rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>I like the clean scent it has, also.</li>
            <li>Smells so fresh and clean and reminds me of my time in the Napa Valley.</li>
            <li>no other hand lotion compares, feels like silk on your skin and smells amazing...</li>
            <li>main difference from the sandalwood amber hand cream is the scent; this has more of a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Great handcream that sinks in and really moisturizes!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>are the ingredients, since I didn&#x27;t see the full list on the product page: purified water, sunflower oil, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, capric caprylic triglcerides, polysorbate 60, ceteraryl alcohol, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, shea butter, orange peel wax, cetyl ricinoleate, sweet almond oil, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, chamomile extract, sorbitol, beeswax, sodium pca, grape seed extract, stearic acid, olive oil, tocopherol acetate, xanthan gum, sodium alginate, phenoxyethanol, ethyl hexyl glycerin, natural fragrance and essential</li>
            <li>It now feels mass-produced with higher water content and fewer natural oils; I can distinguish the new version from the old because it now evaporates quickly rather than absorbing into my skin and the scent disperses rapidly.</li>
            <li>A friend gave me this particular hand creme as a gift.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is a smooth cream, not at all greasy, and really works, especially in dry winter indoor air.  </li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive to such things, even more so when it is dry and cracked!  </li>
            <li>I love the long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I have to frequently wash my hands.  </li>
            <li>The effects of the hand cream last until I&#x27;ve washed my hands with soapy water a time or two, so it&#x27;s at least as good as other creams I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very delicate and lovely, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>but I used a little too much at once.  </li>

            <li> My item arrived promptly and I love it!</li>
            <li> Great handcream that sinks in and really moisturizes! Noticeable difference in my skin, cuticles and fingernails! Has a nice fresh clean scent. Keep one at my bedside and one in my purse. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does not leave oil film after applying.  Best I have found so far and I have tried many.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and promptly delivered.</li>
            <li> The product formulation seems to have changed since I last purchased it. It used to be a rich, oil-based cream which helped me through cold, dry New England winters. It now feels mass-produced with higher water content and fewer natural oils; I can distinguish the new version from the old because it now evaporates quickly rather than absorbing into my skin and the scent disperses rapidly. I would have preferred a price increase to the watering-down of the product.</li>
            <li> If I could make everything smell like this lotion I would- clothes, blankets, towels, my hair- you name it. Smells so fresh and clean and reminds me of my time in the Napa Valley. Amazing lotion as well, absorbs quickly, moisturizes great, and the smell makes me happy every time I use it. Scent works for men and women both. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I lick this hand cream because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me this particular hand creme as a gift. I just loved it and searched Amazon for the best deal. The creme is lovely and has a satin finish to it. It is not greasy. The fragrance is very delicate and lovely, not overpowering at all. I use this hand cream every day and it makes my hands smooth and silky. A wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I had used some of this lotion as a sample at a store. It soothes my eczema on my hands without burning. I like the clean scent it has, also.</li>
            <li> I would not be caught dead without this in my bag!  I use it year round.  I have shred it with many friends who say they like the way it goes on and the scent is very light</li>
            <li> One of the best hand Cremes I have tried! Absorbs well and lasts well. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hand Cream, but the box in a box in a box packaging is a bit of overkill.</li>
            <li> I find this very similar to the sandalwood amber hand cream from the same company in terms of effectiveness.  It provides immediate and long-lasting relief to my dry and damaged skin.  (My hands always look terrible and feel terrible in cold weather, as I am outside a lot walking my dog and I have to frequently wash my hands.  So I use a lot of hand creams.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main difference from the sandalwood amber hand cream is the scent; this has more of a fresh scent.  It absorbs into the skin fairly well; I did notice a bit of residue but I used a little too much at once.  And the residue didn&#x27;t transfer to my computer keyboard.  The effects of the hand cream last until I&#x27;ve washed my hands with soapy water a time or two, so it&#x27;s at least as good as other creams I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients, since I didn&#x27;t see the full list on the product page: purified water, sunflower oil, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, capric caprylic triglcerides, polysorbate 60, ceteraryl alcohol, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, shea butter, orange peel wax, cetyl ricinoleate, sweet almond oil, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, chamomile extract, sorbitol, beeswax, sodium pca, grape seed extract, stearic acid, olive oil, tocopherol acetate, xanthan gum, sodium alginate, phenoxyethanol, ethyl hexyl glycerin, natural fragrance and essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this contains no artificial fragrances or dyes.  My skin is pretty sensitive to such things, even more so when it is dry and cracked!  Please note that this contains beeswax and so would not be considered vegan.  Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with this and am interested in trying more products from Olivina.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the cream came with a split at the bottom causing me to have to staple and tape the bottow to prevent it from leaking. Otherwise..i love the handcream.</li>
            <li> no other hand lotion compares, feels like silk on your skin and smells amazing...The best quaility of lotion ive ever found</li>
            <li> Hooked on this hand creme</li>
            <li> I and my daughter love Olivina&#x27;s hand creams, body creams. I have given this to my daughter before and now she always requests it. It is not widely available at retails so am very happy that I can get it through Amazon. Good value for the money as well.</li>
            <li> Just like the hand and body crème - very good for the hands - I would recommend this product to anyone but once again it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Rich, smooth, does the skin gooood.</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy.  Not at all greasy.  I use very little for maximum benefit.  I love the long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like to keep a stock of this hand crème to give as gifts and because it is my husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> I found this hand lotion on a trip to the Central Coast in California. I can&#x27;t find it retail so am glad that I can get it through Amazon.  It is a smooth cream, not at all greasy, and really works, especially in dry winter indoor air.  I love the unique &#x27;olivy&#x27; scent, not at all sweet, although somewhat strong for some people.  This is the best hand cream I have ever used.  I also like the small (2.5 oz) size, it lasts a very long time, and the size means you can take it on a plane.</li>
