            <li>The smell is light and pleasant, and there is no waxy residue like Pantene.</li>
            <li>We really love using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands of shampoo over the years, varying from salon to premium to pharmacy brands.</li>
            <li>It would be better if it comes in a squeeze bottle</li>
            <li>My hair feels nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>Tried many many products.</li>

            <li>the Price is fantastic!  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love prime pantry boxes...don&#x27;t have time to shop and don&#x27;t even like going out to do it anymore...</li>
            <li>Does a great job of getting residue out of hair but also is very smoothing and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Pretty darn good</li>
            <li>Seems to clean great and leaves what hair I have, nice and soft, clean and smelling nice - and no film (according to my barber).</li>
            <li>TreSemme is My favorite shampoo, I have used it and the conditioner for years and my hair always come out smooth and silky, with a lot of life</li>
            <li>Great quality shampoo and makes hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>TRESemme Smooth and Silky is the answer to most girls&#x27; hair problems.</li>
            <li>Lathers up richly, my husband and I both love it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not bad!</li>
            <li>but oh well, I could easily transfer it to another bottle.</li>
            <li>Product is fine.  </li>
            <li>TRESemme Smooth and Silky is extremely easy to use and works wonders for your hair.</li>
            <li>Huge bottle for the money.</li>
            <li>My hair always feels silky smooth and light.</li>
            <li>Hi, I have been using TRESemme Smooth &amp; Silky Shampoo with Moroccan Argan Oil for about 3 months with my wavy curly hair</li>
            <li>Great shampoo, simple</li>
            <li>Good shampoo it leaves my hair clean and very soft</li>
            <li>Change hair care products every three months and think may be a new favorite!</li>
            <li>For many, many years,I have tried so many different Brands!  </li>
            <li>Thankfully I reacted quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is gentle, not perfumy, and leaves my hair shiny and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>Nice BIG bottle!</li>
            <li>For an inexpensive shampoo, this works great for me - an older guy with not much hair.  </li>
            <li>I have it in me to find the best product of every kind :(</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for sleek, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>After years and years of using various products, I started losing hope that my hair would someday stop falling and have a smooth and silky feel to it, enter TRESemme Smooth and Silky.  </li>
            <li>The price is VERY reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I dropped it the first time I used it in the shower and could have hurt my toes.  </li>
            <li>My naturally curly hair is a beast to maintain and Tresemme Smooth and Silky shampoo leaves my hair light and soft.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd wash with it and its even better this time around.</li>
            <li>As I said, the first time was ohhhkay.</li>
            <li>and I am expecting for better results in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is absolutely a \\&quot;Dream Come True\\&quot; for me!  </li>
            <li>but itâ€™s so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>Enriched by Moroccan Argan oil, it intensely moisturizes your hair and gives you the soft, smooth and silky hair that you rightfully deserve and dreamt of.  </li>
            <li>has lovely long silky hair</li>
            <li>It really lathered well and cleaned our hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>Very please</li>
            <li>There are still hairs on my comb but not as much as before.</li>
            <li>Very picky with hair care tried this</li>
            <li>I bought both the shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; really like both.</li>
            <li>As a result, I am not losing as much hair because it so tangle-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works very well on my hair adds body and sheen plus it</li>
            <li>have a home business that keeps me working to much...</li>
            <li>After rinsing thoroughly for a few minutes, the lather can be washed clean with water giving it a smooth and silky feel, and anyone who has used it will agree.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special about it, it&#x27;s regular shampoo that doesn&#x27;t suck all the moisture out of your hair.</li>
            <li>Most made my hair fall out, oily, or heavy.</li>
            <li>It does not clean you hair very good and leaves it hard.</li>
            <li>,i washed and condition my hair with tresemme&#x27;s product and the result was soft and manageable shiny hair!</li>
            <li>Definitely spending more and getting the Jack Black shampoo</li>
            <li>It makes your hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>So far I believe this shampoo is helping my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>But this is BY FAR</li>
            <li>However, one of the drawbacks of using the Smooth and Silky by TRESemme is that it is hard to get your hands on as it lacks availability.  </li>
            <li>I like the large size and gives me time to reorder less frequently.</li>
            <li>It simply needs to be applied to wet hair and gently massaged into a lather.</li>
            <li>Despite being hard to get, taking the trouble of searching for it is totally worthwhile and barely measures to the quality it provides.</li>
            <li>Whether it be dry, oily, rough hair, split ends or hair-fall, TRESemme&#x27;s variety of shampoos provides us with the answers that were much needed for our ongoing battle against hair problems.</li>

            <li> Highly concentrated shampoo, you only need a little.</li>
            <li> and I all have long hair, but with different textures.</li>
            <li> 2nd time I threw out every single hair care product I had.</li>
            <li> bleaching my hair all the time, 3 years later it was still bad.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t brush my hair when it was wet or even damp.</li>
            <li> With these Tresemme Hair Products, my hair now tangles only minimally.  </li>
            <li> I really like how thick my hair feels after using this.</li>
            <li> Strips hair of moisture and makes it poofy and a bit dry (even with conditioner) Has sulfates which I suspect is the cause.</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry the hair out.  </li>
            <li> Hair is so silky, but scalp is dry.</li>
            <li> Blow dried in less than half the usual time and the finish is smooth silky</li>
            <li> My hair is medium lenght,thick and very dry and for the longest</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bottle for several weeks now and my hair is getting dry and dull, even though I don&#x27;t wash it daily.  </li>
            <li> my hair is damaged and didn&#x27;t like being wet, I washed it weekly.</li>
            <li> My hair is also less dry now even when I don&#x27;t use conditioner.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling a little heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few months, these dry flakes started appearing on my scalp.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my curls down at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t build up &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair softer than my previous shampoo.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> TRESemme Smooth and Silky Shampoo is wonderful!  It makes your hair shiny and soft.  My girls use it too.  It&#x27;s great for anyone.  The price is VERY reasonable.  I wish it came in a pump bottle though.  It&#x27;s totally worth the price and is a GREAT product!</li>
            <li> Sorry, don&#x27;t like this one.  I&#x27;ve been using this bottle for several weeks now and my hair is getting dry and dull, even though I don&#x27;t wash it daily.  My hair is curly and dry and usually out of control, this shampoo is making it worse.</li>
            <li> Product is fine.  Caution of spillage in the packaging.</li>
            <li> We really love using this shampoo. It really lathered well and cleaned our hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair perfect.  No residue.  Huge bottle for the money.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium lenght,thick and very dry and for the longest it seemed that my shampoo worsened it&#x27;s state,i washed and condition my hair with tresemme&#x27;s product and the result was soft and manageable shiny hair! Im hooked.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I use this with TRESemme Volumizing Conditioner. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done with ordinary shampoo.  This is gentle, not perfumy, and leaves my hair shiny and easy to manage.  I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner with it and my hair is always shiny.  Has a pleasant scent.  My only suggestion is to make it with a pump for us shower users.  I dropped it the first time I used it in the shower and could have hurt my toes.  Thankfully I reacted quickly.  The bottle is flexible plastic so no damage was done.  I like the large size and gives me time to reorder less frequently.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of shampoo over the years, varying from salon to premium to pharmacy brands. Most made my hair fall out, oily, or heavy. Whenever I came back to using TRESemme, I felt like 5 pounds was lifted from my hair. My hair always feels silky smooth and light. The smell is light and pleasant, and there is no waxy residue like Pantene. When paired with the conditioner, it&#x27;s like having a premium hair treatment every day for under $10!</li>
            <li> great shampoo t a great price!</li>
            <li> Best lather shampoo.  Smells great.</li>
            <li> My naturally curly hair is a beast to maintain and Tresemme Smooth and Silky shampoo leaves my hair light and soft. It does not weigh my curls down at all. I have been using this for about 4 years and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I also bought the conditioner, and again it was an amazing deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t remember the price, but it was amazing. It was I think under 10 dollars and it is a 32 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works so well and I dont need a ton of shampoo to get all of my hair. It also works for both men and women.</li>
            <li> It would be better if it comes in a squeeze bottle but oh well, I could easily transfer it to another bottle. Nothing special about it, it&#x27;s regular shampoo that doesn&#x27;t suck all the moisture out of your hair. It leaves my hair softer than my previous shampoo.</li>
            <li> TreSemme is My favorite shampoo, I have used it and the conditioner for years and my hair always come out smooth and silky, with a lot of life</li>
            <li> Product is good but not a value for me to get through the mail.</li>
            <li> I donâ€™t usually buy shampoo for softening... but this stuff is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not work well. It does not clean you hair very good and leaves it hard. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> Highly concentrated shampoo, you only need a little. Good bang/buck.</li>
            <li> Great quality shampoo and makes hair shiny and soft. I like this a lot for the price and value. Impressed, a lot more to the bottle. Hope my hair continues to respond well to this shampoo.</li>
            <li> great smelling shampoo..... Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like how thick my hair feels after using this. I feel like my hair is stronger after using this for a while now. My hair is also less dry now even when I don&#x27;t use conditioner.</li>
            <li> Hi, I have been using TRESemme Smooth &amp; Silky Shampoo with Moroccan Argan Oil for about 3 months with my wavy curly hair and I had found excellent results! My hair feels nice and smooth. But only yesterday I found out that this shampoo contains Sodium Laureth Sulphate which is apparently bad for your hair.... I researched a bit about SLES and found out that it is harmful chemical used in washing detergents!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months, these dry flakes started appearing on my scalp. It also made my hair all greasy. Would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> What can I say, my hair is clean and smells excellent!</li>
            <li> Price and quality excellent.  I am satisfied with the results.  Can&#x27;t wait to reorder.</li>
            <li> I really love this produce!!!</li>
            <li> Tried many many products. I have it in me to find the best product of every kind :( this has become expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this through my brothers girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;She has lovely long silky hair and I had to ask. &#x27;What shampoo and conditioner do you use&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme.&lt;br /&gt;Was very shocked. I have been turned off it for some reason, wether I tried it years ago and didn&#x27;t like it...or....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I tried it and was a bit mmm...yehh... while washing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But when I blow dried it and straightened it. Pretty darn good if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;Also, a week went by and still NO dandruff!&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair is damaged and didn&#x27;t like being wet, I washed it weekly. And I had bad dandruff. Bad!&lt;br /&gt;Even after washing with expensive dandruff shampoo..&lt;br /&gt; This tresemme got rid of it. Like that!&lt;br /&gt;Starting to think these dandruff shampoos just make dandruff worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the best selling, all the advertised products..  And none doing what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From bleaching my hair all the time, 3 years later it was still bad.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t brush my hair when it was wet or even damp. It had to be completely dried. And the time it took to dry :(&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is brilliant.. Really. This is my 2nd wash with it and its even better this time around. Brushed with ease while damp..Blow dried in less than half the usual time and the finish is smooth silky hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would try it a few times and see how you feel about it. As I said, the first time was ohhhkay. 2nd time I threw out every single hair care product I had.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo it leaves my hair clean and very soft</li>
            <li> Strips hair of moisture and makes it poofy and a bit dry (even with conditioner) Has sulfates which I suspect is the cause. Definitely spending more and getting the Jack Black shampoo</li>
            <li> My teenaged girls and I all have long hair, but with different textures. We had trouble finding inexpensive brands that we could all share until we found this one. Finally a shampoo we can all agree on!! Great, affordable, smells good. A grew buy for families who need to share a shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good results. No drying or fly aways but not over moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo</li>
            <li> Shampoo is awesome. Very please</li>
            <li> I saw the show of Oprah about hair problems and Iâ€™m one of the people who are in need for help. My hair is unbelievably thin and I even have hair fall every day. And it is really frustrating to see hair fall on the comb. I started using this for a week, I still donâ€™t see the big change with my hair but my hair felt lighter and smoother. There are still hairs on my comb but not as much as before. So happy that I tried it and I am expecting for better results in the future.</li>
            <li> Very picky with hair care tried this and it&#x27;s not bad! Think I will but it again! Change hair care products every three months and think may be a new favorite!</li>
            <li> So far I believe this shampoo is helping my frizzy hair. I have seen some improvement.</li>
            <li> I bought both the shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; really like both. It doesn&#x27;t build up &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry the hair out.  I liked the price too.  Nice BIG bottle!</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleans and moisturizers</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, simple</li>
            <li> Best cheap shampoo out there! Lathers up richly, my husband and I both love it.</li>
            <li> After years and years of using various products, I started losing hope that my hair would someday stop falling and have a smooth and silky feel to it, enter TRESemme Smooth and Silky.  Whether it be dry, oily, rough hair, split ends or hair-fall, TRESemme&#x27;s variety of shampoos provides us with the answers that were much needed for our ongoing battle against hair problems. One of the best among others is the Smooth and Silky by TRESemme. Enriched by Moroccan Argan oil, it intensely moisturizes your hair and gives you the soft, smooth and silky hair that you rightfully deserve and dreamt of.  TRESemme Smooth and Silky is extremely easy to use and works wonders for your hair. It simply needs to be applied to wet hair and gently massaged into a lather. After rinsing thoroughly for a few minutes, the lather can be washed clean with water giving it a smooth and silky feel, and anyone who has used it will agree.  However, one of the drawbacks of using the Smooth and Silky by TRESemme is that it is hard to get your hands on as it lacks availability.  Despite being hard to get, taking the trouble of searching for it is totally worthwhile and barely measures to the quality it provides. TRESemme Smooth and Silky is the answer to most girls&#x27; hair problems. I give it 5 stars out of 5.</li>
            <li> Cleans my hair like it should.</li>
            <li> I have never found a more perfect Shampoo and Conditioner than the Tresemme Smooth Silk for my fine hair.  I have one of the most tangliest hair imaginable!  And not just a normal tangle, but an extremely awful and difficult tangles to remove!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can brush it one minute, then one minute later, it tangles again!  I believe just to look at it, would tangle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use both the Shampoo and Conditioner.  With these Tresemme Hair Products, my hair now tangles only minimally.  As a result, I am not losing as much hair because it so tangle-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what an Amazing Shine!  They leave your hair beautifully SHINY, without the greasy look!  --- It makes your hair look so healthy and alive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the Price is fantastic!  Unbelievable Bargain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely a \\&quot;Dream Come True\\&quot; for me!  For many, many years,I have tried so many different Brands!  But this is BY FAR is \\&quot;The Best of the Best!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susie</li>
            <li> TreSemme is a wonderful shampoo that I love because it makes my hair clean, shiny and smelling great!</li>
            <li> This product has helped my husband&#x27;s bald spot.  I no longer can identify him from behind on the plane!</li>
            <li> works very well on my hair adds body and sheen plus it deep vleans</li>
            <li> My hair feels like velvet on a microfiber budget.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo.  Left my hair feeling a little heavy. Smell is nice.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It works as well as the expensive salon shampoos but itâ€™s so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> My go to shampoo for several years.</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive shampoo, this works great for me - an older guy with not much hair.  Seems to clean great and leaves what hair I have, nice and soft, clean and smelling nice - and no film (according to my barber).</li>
            <li> Hair is so silky, but scalp is dry.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love prime pantry boxes...don&#x27;t have time to shop and don&#x27;t even like going out to do it anymore...have a home business that keeps me working to much...I shop for 5 to so it is a job in itself...PRIME Pantry is a more than fair price...just plan them right &amp; it is wonderful...</li>
            <li> I like TRESemme shampoo.  It genlty cleans my hair and smells great.  I like that it does not strip the color from my hair as well.</li>
            <li> Great smelling shampoo.  Does a great job of getting residue out of hair but also is very smoothing and moisturizing.  I highly recommend it for sleek, smooth hair.</li>
