    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and i am very happy with its performance.  </li>
            <li>You can have the best toothcare product on the market today.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>And it helps remove stains wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with this -- for awhile.</li>
            <li>And it truly does, with the greatest of ease!</li>
            <li>This one is the best.  </li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so impressed.  </li>
            <li>Best invention since sliced bread.</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;d say that Sonicare&#x27;s brush is the best oral hygeine product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>if the finances allowed.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you think you might like it and you can afford it, then go ahead and get one.</li>
            <li>if the finances allowed.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>It cleans the teeth perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>But the Sonicare Toothbrush is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done for myself.</li>
            <li>My Dentist said that it was the best my gums and plaque problems (or lack of!)</li>
            <li>After reading all the wonderful reviews, I just had to get one and try it out for myself.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>If  you have a parent like that, this makes a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>If  you have a parent like that, this makes a great gift.</li>
            <li>but what a job it does.&lt;br /&gt;The two-minute timer is great.  </li>
            <li>The pauses in vibration over the course of two minutes that the PL-4 gives is a great boon for me.</li>
            <li>Checkups have been great and teeth feel cleaner and whiter.  </li>
            <li>and it is great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>-(&lt;br /&gt;Spring 2002 Dental Visit, after using Sonicare for 5 months:  My hygienist complimented me on the great job I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
            <li>I asked each one how they liked their toothbrush, and they all raved about it and the excellent results they&#x27;re experiencing.</li>
            <li>This brush may be great...</li>
            <li>I have had great dental visit reports because of using the brush twice a day and flossing once.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had mine for two years and it still works great.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did!!</li>
            <li>- This is really amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed a remarkable decrease in the number of \\&quot;paste spots\\&quot; on the mirror.</li>
            <li>I had heard from 2 of my friends that they loved their Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>And because of my fear of dentists, I always try to take really good care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I can massage my gums too which feels good.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t give a good &amp;quot;workout&amp;quot; for your gums.</li>
            <li>&amp; I know they&#x27;re getting a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good brush.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s habit forming and a good one for a change.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been reserving judgement on this product until I&#x27;ve had a good chance to see how I like it.  </li>
            <li>After two minutes it shuts itself off after what is supposedly the ideal length of brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;You can also take this brush with you when traveling as it works for more than a week without recharging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>The benefits are so good we bought one for each member of the family.  </li>
            <li>It is great for getting and keeping healthy gums.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the use of this brush.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase......</li>
            <li>I liked how this sonicare product is built and the timer things, but it doesn&#x27;t make a good toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you too need help at keeping your teeth &amp;amp; gum healthy, get a sonicare!</li>
            <li>Okay!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>sonicare is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>(woo-hoo!)--but you need to remove it if you want to use the carrying case, which has been handily provided.</li>
            <li>I am THRILLED, and will be recommending it to everyone -</li>
            <li>Yep, I bought one and liked it alot too.  </li>
            <li>The sonic cleaning really does a great job!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used the popular names.  </li>
            <li>Within two weeks of using it my smile was whiter, my gums felt incredible and I CAN&#x27;T wait to brush.</li>
            <li>The concept of an electronic toothbrush is a good one but better materials are needed on this one.</li>
            <li>(...), everyone in the family can use it; just get them each their own head.  </li>
            <li>Also, listen to recommendation about changing the head every 6 months, a worn head just isn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li>I have tried every kind of toothbrushes -- manual and electric -- to no avail, until I tried this Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>know a lot of people love the Sonicare toothbrush, but I would like to know how many of them are still happy with it after the 18- to 24-month mark.  </li>
            <li>This is the most amazing toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I first got my unit, it worked great for about 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li>cleans my teeth better.</li>
            <li>my teeth look whiter, feel cleaner, and my gums are feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>I just love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better check ups  at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>simply love my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and we both love it.  </li>
            <li>but now I know better.  </li>
            <li>The dentist was able to save it, and install a crown.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I could take a fingernail and pick at the top of the tooth where it met the gum.</li>
            <li>It will save you way more than the purchase price in dental bills.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>comes with more than one brush head, which is a savings if you are using it for more than one person in the house.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>We love our Sonicare.</li>
            <li>so this makes sure that I get the job</li>
            <li>but hey, I use it more.  </li>
            <li>though I read that article, I still believe that I get better results from my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>teeth have always been reasonably healthy, but my gums have always been an issue for me.</li>
            <li>teeth are cleaner and whiter, my gums look healthier and my mouth feels better.</li>
            <li>You still need to floss to get in between your teeth, but this brush is infinitely better than using a manual one.</li>
            <li>After a month of regular use I&#x27;ve got to say that it&#x27;s GREAT!  </li>
            <li>My husband and I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>At this price, this appliance should be a lot more strudy.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It does an excellent job of cleaning your teeth but the brush should last longer than one year.</li>
            <li>Fall 2001 Dental Visit, before Sonicare:  My dental hygienist gave me the plaque lecture about how I need to brush better.  </li>
            <li>This cannot be healthy.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended by my dentist who said it was safe for dental work.  </li>
            <li>In two minutes my teeth are super clean and my mouth feels great.</li>
            <li>I find the 30-second beep that lets you know when to move along from top inner/outer to bottom</li>
            <li>Sonicare makes the task easier, and the results are vastly better.</li>
            <li>The business about better checkups wasn&#x27;t hype.</li>
            <li>I purchased this tooth brush about five years or more ago.</li>
            <li>I have 2 bridges in my mouth, and was told that this is 100% safe and recommended for all people with dental work done.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I struggled to get my husband to brush his teeth more than once a day--</li>
            <li>It would be nice, however, if the brush handle had a better seal so that it could withstand a quick rinse under the</li>
            <li>Believe me, brushing with this unit is so enjoyable, it is easy to lose track of the time.</li>
            <li>and I was somewhat reluctant, but after trying the Sonicare I am amazed at how clean my teeth feel!  </li>
            <li>Overall, a very good product and one I would recommend.</li>
            <li>Starting with 31,000 brush strokes per minute and sonic waves, this toothbrush does an incredible job of cleaning my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>addition, the unit has a sleek, modern design that looks good in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>You need to rinse it off after every use anyhow, so a quick rinse under the shower, keeping it held straight up, works great.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very smooth and clean, somewhat like they feel after the dentist cleans them and they feel cleaner longer after brushing than with a manual tooth brush.   </li>
            <li>but it is quite easy to get used to.  </li>
            <li>use it all the time &amp; absolutely love the clean it gives my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and it trains aggressive brushers (read:</li>
            <li>And will be hiring a cleaning crew to help clean the house top to bottom.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and to care for.</li>
            <li>I grumble about the cost of new brush heads, but this toothbrush is so good</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done my teeth feel clean and smooth, as good or better than after I get done with a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Now when I floss, their isn&#x27;t any blood, or at best an occassional little bit.</li>
            <li>and now actually enjoy the sensation.</li>
            <li>He finally said everything was great.  </li>
            <li>My teeth just don&#x27;t feel that smooth cleanness that I want.  </li>
            <li>As it turned out, we received a second toothbrush from my folks at Christmas, so we are the proud owners of two Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Our children (ages 6, 8, 10) use it as well, and they enjoy it too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like how it cleans and enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>It works great, but I&#x27;m astonished that no one tested this plastic under the conditions that someone would actually used it.</li>
            <li>never used to enjoy brushing</li>
            <li>Fortunately all the moving and wearable parts (including brush, magnets and metal connecting parts) are in the brush head</li>
            <li>Fortunately all the moving and wearable parts (including brush, magnets and metal connecting parts) are in the brush head</li>
            <li>In short, Sonicare has saved me a great deal of expense, time, and discomfort in dental work.</li>
            <li>My dentist always ask me what do I do to keep my teeth so free of plaque.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s worth it for better dental and gum health.</li>
            <li>They will recycle their product for free (oh, gee -</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m giving this system as a gift and everyone has loved it ... so far.</li>
            <li>I really love the super clean feeling in my mouth when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li>my teeth has never felt so refreshingly clean in my whole lifetime, maybe even better than the dentist!  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I can get my husband to clean my oven, but I can&#x27;t get him to go to the dentist for me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nicely placed high on the handle for convenient access, but there is no chance of it getting in the way while brushing.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is worth the money!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the Sonicare&#x27;s brushes are higher</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m achieving much better results with the Sonicare than with manual brushing, for 2 reasons:  First, there&#x27;s no way I come close to 31,000 brush strokes per minute by hand.  </li>
            <li>Her next visit was much improved and the latest was great.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>After about 2 months use, the pockets were significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>Sonicare quickly became the #1 player in the electric toothbrush industry, due to its incredible technology.</li>
            <li>i no longer go to bed wondering if my teeth are clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably better to get two units, because the power unit can get kind of gross with splattered toothpaste...</li>
            <li>This toothbrush gets your mouth amazingly clean...</li>
            <li>clean -- feeling as if I&#x27;d just returned from the dentist</li>
            <li>can honestly say that my gums feel like they are in better shape than they used to be, and my teeth are cleaner on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a feeling of a clean mouth that you can&#x27;t get anywhere else.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean after each use; as though I had just come from the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vibration from this toothbrush leaves a lasting tingle in my mouth that I find quite pleasant and somewhat relaxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really complaining because my dentist visits have been great since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>Another nice feature: if the brush needs a charge, it&#x27;ll beep four or five times after you complete your brushing cycle (\\&quot;beep-beep-beep-beep\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Now even at full strength I do not experience any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now even at full strength I do not experience any discomfort.</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t sound like much fun</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like getting a full dental cleaning every time you brush.</li>
            <li>I suspect that people with tender mouths will really want to follow the directions they give you with the toothbrush to be sure they don&#x27;t discourage themselves from using it again.</li>
            <li>The internal timer is a good idea.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;After a full month of using a Sonicare brush</li>
            <li>The bristles move fast, but they&#x27;re not vicious and hurt your gums like some others out there tend to</li>
            <li>Honestly, when the price comes down everyone will own one of these.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My teeth feel exceptionally clean--more clean on a daily basis than they ever did before!</li>
            <li>But this is a sophisticated unit and is more like a medical device than a disposable supply item.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is easy to keep clean, quite well</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this Sonicare toothbrush for anyone looking for healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Its outstanding in my opinion, and I highly  recommend it.</li>
            <li>This Sonicare Advance 4700 is still available here on Amazon at a reasonable price in another listing!</li>
            <li>programs the unit to start of mild, then increase over the first couple of weeks use to full strength.</li>
            <li>Sonicaire programs the unit to start of mild, then increase over the first couple of weeks use to full strength.</li>
            <li>With the Sonicaire, then body is light, yet large, and does all the brushing for you.</li>
            <li>With the Sonicaire, then body is light, yet large, and does all the brushing for you.</li>
            <li>- they go on their little stand to dry.&lt;BR&gt;3)  great for one person or two -  </li>
            <li>(the battery may gradually lose life over time, requiring more frequent charging).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the drool, brushing just shouldn&#x27;t be this much fun.  </li>
            <li>Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you it was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>When I use the PL-4, I&#x27;m much better at completely brushing each section of my mouth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer a skeptic, this brush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Could it have any downsides?&lt;br /&gt;Although I consider it easily worth every penny, the upfront cost is staggering compared to a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s fun to use</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>inner/outer to be quite useful.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The 30 Second Timer - This is probably my favorite feature, aside from clean teeth :</li>
            <li>The 2 minute timer, however, does get me to brush for the right amount of time...</li>
            <li>Her prescription proved to be right on target.</li>
            <li>The massaging action is actually quite pleasant...</li>
            <li>It helps you to pace your tooth brushing, making sure that you spend enough time to insure adequate cleaning.  </li>
            <li>When I first heard about Sonicare, I figured it was worth a try</li>
            <li>brush can run for a week between recharges, and the charging stand is small and attractive.</li>
            <li>Although it did clean my teeth, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle this unit for long.  </li>
            <li>My wife is a dental hygienist, and the dentist she works for highly recommends this product (and he rarely if ever recommends dental products!).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean out &amp; not that big of a deal.  </li>
            <li>the way, the reason I&#x27;m willing to keep spending so much in order to own this toothbrush is that I believe that it is going to save me lots of money in dental bills later on.</li>
            <li>The brush moves VERY fast, doing ALL the work for you.</li>
            <li>2 minutes on sonicare, and the teeth still aren&#x27;t smooth, then I brush manually for 20 seconds, and actually get the teeth clean.</li>
            <li>i bought this toothbrush after my last visit to the dentist because i wanted to take better care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>i first started using the sonicare.  </li>
            <li>my first brushing session</li>
            <li>One cleaning cycle lasts 2 minutes and I love the internal timer that beeps every 30 seconds that allows you to focus on another part of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>The zones are bottom inside, bottom outside, top inside, and top outside.  </li>
            <li>At first I noticed that it was too aggressive.</li>
            <li>In his words, teeth cleaning should be called &amp;quot;gums cleaning&amp;quot; and you can do much better manually with a proper technique.</li>
            <li>and I have personally used many non-manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>-- I&#x27;m able to reach all the way to my back molars and not gag on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Our whole family loves this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>Well, the real question should be, are your teeth worth it?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a steep price for something that most of us treat as a generic commodity</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>read in a leading consumer magazine that the toothbrush didn&#x27;t perform better than manual brushing when manual brushing was done properly.  </li>
            <li>The magazine article said that the reason the Sonicare would perform better was because people would brush their teeth longer and for the proper amount of time because there was a timer on it.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>For some reason, they don&#x27;t seem to last many years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, since the toothbrush is so valuable to me, I&#x27;ve been willing to incur this expense in order to keep owning one.  </li>
            <li>It simply brushes your teeth better than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the simple shutoff of the PL-1 after two minutes.</li>
            <li>and I find that I&#x27;m much more likely to continue brushing even after the unit has turned off just in case</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d regret paying that much money for something my dentist would give me for free, but having used the Sonicare PL-4 and seen the results for both of us, I can firmly say to friends and family that your dentist, your teeth, and your gums will thank you for spending this kind of money.</li>
            <li>Once the battery decides not to recharge anymore, there is absolutely NOTHING that you can do!  </li>
            <li>I like the compact head better than the larger head.  </li>
            <li>You might want to be aware of this before purchasing.</li>
            <li>The timer pulses every thirty seconds to prompt you to switch from front to back of teeth and from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I use mentadent toothpaste, and don&#x27;t want to change\\&quot;, was the first thing I said before I got this.  </li>
            <li>I really like this!  </li>
            <li>the price may be high but it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I love the timer function because it lets them know just how long they need to brush</li>
            <li>I could feel how much cleaner my teeth after the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>And while I don&#x27;t fully understand how it&#x27;s possible, I find it fascinating that simply changing a toothbrush can make this much difference.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>;-)&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way: WOW!!!</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll be amazed at how clean your teeth are and how healthy your gums look after a few uses.  </li>
            <li>I had a previous soni-care like this that I really liked.  </li>
            <li>Though one 2-minute cycle is long enough for a good brushing, I often brush for two of those cycles.  </li>
            <li>This, plus the obligatory heachache you&#x27;ll get using it, which is, of course, unfortunate because your now beautiful smile will be replaced by a frown.  </li>
            <li>He would use it if they made a large size</li>
            <li>If this one wear out I certainly hope Sonic stay in business</li>
            <li>&lt;BR&gt;- holds a charge long enough to take on vacation without the charging base&lt;BR&gt;- travel case is a good design&lt;BR&gt;- gets my teeth very clean&lt;BR</li>
            <li>Just a nice little side benefit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a little getting used to, but that&#x27;s the nice thing about the \\&quot;ramp up\\&quot; feature of the brush.  </li>
            <li>leaves your teeth feeling smooth and seems to get the hard-to-reach places in the back very well.  </li>
            <li>Even though I was spending more than 2 minutes carefully brushing my teeth manually 3x/day  and flossing - after using the Sonicare</li>
            <li>Very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush system wondering if it really lived up to the hype.</li>
            <li>This system really works.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really blame that on the toothbrush, though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I took notice when I found out how much the one was that she wanted.  </li>
            <li>brush handle contains a rechargable battery, and the brushes are available in different sizes.  </li>
            <li>All you have to do is to hold the brush head gently against the teeth and</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>and I never used to brush my teeth as much as they needed it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>BTW, it&#x27;s important to regularly unscrew the toothbrush head and rinse off toothpaste that&#x27;s accumulated between the nut and the head, as recommended in the instructions.   </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress how much confidence I have in the benefits from using this toothbrush.     </li>
            <li>Pull the carpeting and wash the walls then have the ducts cleaned and get a whole house air cleaner.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth very well</li>
            <li>The Sonicare toothbrush is really a breakthrough.</li>
            <li>It seems to be very thorough...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot man</li>
            <li>one of the reasons the toothbrush cracks is because the owner uses toothpaste with too much hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>There are several benefits to this 30-second \\&quot;beep\\&quot; feature that I noticed; first, it gets you to brush for a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>It also would be much more environmentally-friendly, as the nickel-cadmium batteries in the Sonicare are extremely toxic.  </li>
            <li>I worked with Sonicare support and they got me a new brush and a new charger right away.  </li>
            <li>I thought I had clean teeth, and would brush regularly.</li>
            <li>It is even smart enough to run at a slower rate when you first get it and after a number of brushes it will move to a higher speed.  </li>
            <li>The plastic could be antibacterial, the instructions to dry it out completely between uses should be more emphatically written.     </li>
            <li>Second, because of the way they instruct you to use the brush, you get full coverage of both arches.</li>
            <li>30-second reminder is a cool function that lets you know every 30 seconds to move to a different part of your mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not painful, but very different.</li>
            <li>First of all, I am not a dental professional...</li>
            <li>and then it finally works at full capacity.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>opposed to manual brushing, with the sonicare I actually find myself brushing for the full recommended two minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A light touch helps, and also gives more effective cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Although you can switch brush heads so more than one person can use the base, it gets tiring to do this multiple times a day, in different bathrooms, etc.  </li>
            <li>It also takes a few brushings to get used to the rapid vibrations in your mouth -- it can really tickle -- and I imagine that if you have sensitive gumsthat it could cause some mild painat first, but will certainly firm up the gums and help their condition improve in good order.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t think much about it when my wife told me that she wanted a new toothbrush for Christmas...</li>
            <li>only does this device make brushing my teeth quicker and more relaxing, but they simply get cleaner.</li>
            <li>This is the first electronic toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, and let me tell you, the first time I used it, it was definitely a wierd feeling; almost like the feeling you get when you get your teeth cleaned from the dentist</li>
            <li>first time you use this product it may make your teeth sensitive for a few days (because of the vibration) and while its permanent and rechargeable battery will last through most trips it is physically larger and takes slightly more space to pack than a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>first time you use this product it may make your teeth sensitive for a few days (because of the vibration) and while its permanent and rechargeable battery will last through most trips it is physically larger and takes slightly more space to pack than a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>It goes easy on you for the first few brushings</li>
            <li>Consumers should not just toss these in the trash to end up in a landfill - but ask the manufacturer to recycle the plastic, metal and batteries in the brushes and the handle.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the recycling issue for the brush heads, on performance - I would highly recommend this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly to everyone.  </li>
            <li>Type As) to treat their gums with a little more TLC.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice it very much except when brushing my upper front teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have 2 things to confess--a bad cola habit &amp;amp; that I&#x27;m a once-a-day brusher (twice, for special occasions  lol).</li>
            <li>Very minor considering how clean your teeth get.  </li>
            <li>husband pushed us into buying this rather expensive &amp;quot;toy.&amp;quot; At just under 100$US at the time we bought it, even the 20% off coupon we had didn&#x27;t make me all that happy.</li>
            <li>(\\&quot;How does it charge?\\&quot;, I thought), but evidently it doesn&#x27;t need any exposed metal to make contact with the charging base. :D</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, you need to use far less toothpaste than normal, because the Sonicare brush doesn&#x27;t need gobs of it to work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>My general dentist&#x27;s staff noticed a significant improvement in oral hygiene shortly after I started using the Sonicare unit.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they could design it to last a little longer.  </li>
            <li>Every time some company puts out a new toothbrush, I buy it.  </li>
            <li>and I had my new toothbrush in a matter of days.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for over 6 months, and the brush is still in like new shape.&lt;br /&gt;The kit</li>
            <li>So every 1-2 weeks I had to shell out the cash for a new brush</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks, my gums were like new.</li>
            <li>Look at it this way, it&#x27;s cheaper than a new filling...</li>
            <li>Anyway, enjoy it, especially if you have a neckbrace or public heath facility near by!</li>
            <li>First of all at my last check-up, my dentist said I didn&#x27;t need a cleaning this time around.</li>
            <li>Only 1/2 the price and full of all the same promises.  </li>
            <li>Second, I rarely brushed for 2 full minutes with a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The replacement brush heads cost more than a regular toothbrush, but seem to last long enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After years of brushing too hard and using softer toothbrushes, my dentist recommended &amp;quot;any electronic toothbrush&amp;quot; to facilitate better cleaning without gum recession.</li>
            <li>I was unsure if I would grow used to the vibrating action</li>
            <li>Maybe it has something to do with the sonic waves of the bristles, maybe it&#x27;s because you use the brush with no water (only toothpaste), but I noticed that my paste doesn&#x27;t foam-up NEARLY as much as it used to.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well the Sonicare cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li>In fact, it fees as if you&#x27;ve just had your teeth cleaned professionally in a way.</li>
            <li>It has developed cracks around the on&#x27;off button and is no longer usable.  </li>
            <li>Every time I use the Sonicare, my teeth and gums feel professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you want that stuff near you...</li>
            <li>It feels strange at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve considered replacing them, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll even bother, since the toothbrush&#x27;s cleaning action was sub-par.  </li>
            <li>Although the PL-4 should have been equipped with a \\&quot;smart\\&quot; battery, it&#x27;s best if you leave it off the base until it needs to be recharged</li>
            <li>Just know that if you leave your brush head attached to the base, check the inside for growing mold every once in a while!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>If your worried about how it might feel when you first try it, there is an introductory period where the toothbrush starts slower and every time you use it, it slowly speeds up until you&#x27;re at full speed by about a week.  </li>
            <li>More important, my dentist says the health of my gums (leading cause of tooth loss) is extremely good since I started using the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;The feature where it beeps every 30 seconds is pretty useless, and the auto-off after 2 minutes is downright annoying (I like to brush for 3-4</li>
            <li>It really made my saliva run the first few times I used it, but that&#x27;s not a problem now.  </li>
            <li>I bought this particular toothbrush back in March, 2002, and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier.  </li>
            <li>Back to the plusses: For anyone with trouble holding small items due to arthritis or similar conditions, I can say that although the handle feels bulky at first, it&#x27;s quite comfortable &amp;amp; easy to hold; and you don&#x27;t have to move your hand much.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it should be no big deal, since what I&#x27;ve heard from various dentists is that there is no particular benefit to using baking soda &amp; peroxide over any other paste.</li>
            <li>i would never go back to the normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Now I was told to come back in three months vs my normal 4-month cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li>I found my sonic, charged it and in about a week my teeth and gums were back to normal.  </li>
            <li>main complaint is that the battery is not replaceable, forcing people to replace their Sonicare after several years and filling up the landfills with more toothbrushes than necessary.  </li>
            <li>The brush also does a terrific job of massaging my gums--very nice!&lt;br /&gt;There are several things about it that really impress me:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>Like most people, I was skeptical about spending so much money on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Sonicare could and should be more responsible in warning about this potenially serious health threat due to - in their thoughts - improper or inadequate customer/owner maintenance.</li>
            <li>Generally I&#x27;d describe it feels like it is \\&quot;tickling\\&quot;</li>
            <li>recharger is small and simple with a light on the handle to let you know when it is fully charged.  </li>
            <li>I am going back to a regular brush with soft bristles that I can buy for a couple bucks and toss when it gets old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to note that the brush head will slowly wear out without any visible sign of wear.</li>
            <li>After going thru a year of severe allergy symptoms all summer, then having severe eye allergy symptoms this winter, and now another eye problem just one week after after tackling the first issue I was feeling beaten down by my health issues.</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit put off by the price-I mean I&#x27;m supposed to spend HOW much?  </li>
            <li>To be honest, it was rather startling at first to feel vibrations througout my mouth, on my gums especially, and a little into my sinuses because they&#x27;re so near everything else in my head.</li>
            <li>In the long run you will need a new head.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicaire</li>
            <li>In the long run you will need a new head.</li>
            <li>But other than that I have nothing to really complain about.  </li>
            <li>[price] for a toothbrush seemed a bit excessive to me at first!  </li>
            <li>I am terrified that my whole house is contaminated with black mold.</li>
            <li>Even brushing manually for just these few days, I have not been as satisfied as I am with my Sonicare, and am anxious for my replacement one to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I was almost abt to finish the transaction for buying this, but luckily, i saw a negative feedback posted by someone else, in this website, so i decided not to buy it.</li>
            <li>only real drawback I see in this brush is the \\&quot;Battery Low\\&quot; indicator tends to come on a little premature.  </li>

            <li> -(&lt;br /&gt;Spring 2002 Dental Visit, after using Sonicare for 5 months:  My hygienist complimented me on the great job I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
            <li> I asked each one how they liked their toothbrush, and they all raved about it and the excellent results they&#x27;re experiencing.</li>

            <li> I have had great dental visit reports because of using the brush twice a day and flossing once.</li>

            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed a remarkable decrease in the number of \\&quot;paste spots\\&quot; on the mirror.</li>
            <li> I had heard from 2 of my friends that they loved their Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> And because of my fear of dentists, I always try to take really good care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I can massage my gums too which feels good.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t give a good &amp;quot;workout&amp;quot; for your gums.</li>
            <li> &amp; I know they&#x27;re getting a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good brush.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s habit forming and a good one for a change.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been reserving judgement on this product until I&#x27;ve had a good chance to see how I like it.  </li>
            <li> After two minutes it shuts itself off after what is supposedly the ideal length of brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;You can also take this brush with you when traveling as it works for more than a week without recharging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> The benefits are so good we bought one for each member of the family.  </li>

            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase......</li>
            <li> I liked how this sonicare product is built and the timer things, but it doesn&#x27;t make a good toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you too need help at keeping your teeth &amp;amp; gum healthy, get a sonicare!</li>
            <li> Okay!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> sonicare is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> (woo-hoo!)--but you need to remove it if you want to use the carrying case, which has been handily provided.</li>
            <li> I am THRILLED, and will be recommending it to everyone -</li>
            <li> Yep, I bought one and liked it alot too.  </li>
            <li> The sonic cleaning really does a great job!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used the popular names.  </li>
            <li> Within two weeks of using it my smile was whiter, my gums felt incredible and I CAN&#x27;T wait to brush.</li>
            <li> The concept of an electronic toothbrush is a good one but better materials are needed on this one.</li>
            <li> (...), everyone in the family can use it; just get them each their own head.  </li>
            <li> Also, listen to recommendation about changing the head every 6 months, a worn head just isn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li> I have tried every kind of toothbrushes -- manual and electric -- to no avail, until I tried this Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> know a lot of people love the Sonicare toothbrush, but I would like to know how many of them are still happy with it after the 18- to 24-month mark.  </li>
            <li> This is the most amazing toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I first got my unit, it worked great for about 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li> cleans my teeth better.</li>
            <li> my teeth look whiter, feel cleaner, and my gums are feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> I just love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better check ups  at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> simply love my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and we both love it.  </li>
            <li> but now I know better.  </li>
            <li> The dentist was able to save it, and install a crown.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I could take a fingernail and pick at the top of the tooth where it met the gum.</li>
            <li> It will save you way more than the purchase price in dental bills.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> comes with more than one brush head, which is a savings if you are using it for more than one person in the house.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> We love our Sonicare.</li>
            <li> so this makes sure that I get the job</li>
            <li> but hey, I use it more.  </li>
            <li> though I read that article, I still believe that I get better results from my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> teeth have always been reasonably healthy, but my gums have always been an issue for me.</li>
            <li> teeth are cleaner and whiter, my gums look healthier and my mouth feels better.</li>
            <li> You still need to floss to get in between your teeth, but this brush is infinitely better than using a manual one.</li>
            <li> After a month of regular use I&#x27;ve got to say that it&#x27;s GREAT!  </li>
            <li> My husband and I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> At this price, this appliance should be a lot more strudy.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It does an excellent job of cleaning your teeth but the brush should last longer than one year.</li>
            <li> Fall 2001 Dental Visit, before Sonicare:  My dental hygienist gave me the plaque lecture about how I need to brush better.  </li>
            <li> This cannot be healthy.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dentist who said it was safe for dental work.  </li>
            <li> In two minutes my teeth are super clean and my mouth feels great.</li>
            <li> I find the 30-second beep that lets you know when to move along from top inner/outer to bottom</li>
            <li> Sonicare makes the task easier, and the results are vastly better.</li>
            <li> The business about better checkups wasn&#x27;t hype.</li>
            <li> I purchased this tooth brush about five years or more ago.</li>
            <li> I have 2 bridges in my mouth, and was told that this is 100% safe and recommended for all people with dental work done.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I struggled to get my husband to brush his teeth more than once a day--</li>
            <li> It would be nice, however, if the brush handle had a better seal so that it could withstand a quick rinse under the</li>
            <li> Believe me, brushing with this unit is so enjoyable, it is easy to lose track of the time.</li>
            <li> and I was somewhat reluctant, but after trying the Sonicare I am amazed at how clean my teeth feel!  </li>
            <li> Overall, a very good product and one I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Starting with 31,000 brush strokes per minute and sonic waves, this toothbrush does an incredible job of cleaning my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> addition, the unit has a sleek, modern design that looks good in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> You need to rinse it off after every use anyhow, so a quick rinse under the shower, keeping it held straight up, works great.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very smooth and clean, somewhat like they feel after the dentist cleans them and they feel cleaner longer after brushing than with a manual tooth brush.   </li>
            <li> but it is quite easy to get used to.  </li>
            <li> use it all the time &amp; absolutely love the clean it gives my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and it trains aggressive brushers (read:</li>
            <li> And will be hiring a cleaning crew to help clean the house top to bottom.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and to care for.</li>
            <li> I grumble about the cost of new brush heads, but this toothbrush is so good</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done my teeth feel clean and smooth, as good or better than after I get done with a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Now when I floss, their isn&#x27;t any blood, or at best an occassional little bit.</li>
            <li> and now actually enjoy the sensation.</li>
            <li> He finally said everything was great.  </li>
            <li> My teeth just don&#x27;t feel that smooth cleanness that I want.  </li>
            <li> As it turned out, we received a second toothbrush from my folks at Christmas, so we are the proud owners of two Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Our children (ages 6, 8, 10) use it as well, and they enjoy it too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like how it cleans and enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li> It works great, but I&#x27;m astonished that no one tested this plastic under the conditions that someone would actually used it.</li>
            <li> never used to enjoy brushing</li>
            <li> Fortunately all the moving and wearable parts (including brush, magnets and metal connecting parts) are in the brush head</li>
            <li> Fortunately all the moving and wearable parts (including brush, magnets and metal connecting parts) are in the brush head</li>
            <li> In short, Sonicare has saved me a great deal of expense, time, and discomfort in dental work.</li>
            <li> My dentist always ask me what do I do to keep my teeth so free of plaque.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s worth it for better dental and gum health.</li>
            <li> They will recycle their product for free (oh, gee -</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m giving this system as a gift and everyone has loved it ... so far.</li>
            <li> I really love the super clean feeling in my mouth when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li> my teeth has never felt so refreshingly clean in my whole lifetime, maybe even better than the dentist!  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, I can get my husband to clean my oven, but I can&#x27;t get him to go to the dentist for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nicely placed high on the handle for convenient access, but there is no chance of it getting in the way while brushing.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is worth the money!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the Sonicare&#x27;s brushes are higher</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m achieving much better results with the Sonicare than with manual brushing, for 2 reasons:  First, there&#x27;s no way I come close to 31,000 brush strokes per minute by hand.  </li>
            <li> Her next visit was much improved and the latest was great.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> After about 2 months use, the pockets were significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> Sonicare quickly became the #1 player in the electric toothbrush industry, due to its incredible technology.</li>
            <li> i no longer go to bed wondering if my teeth are clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably better to get two units, because the power unit can get kind of gross with splattered toothpaste...</li>
            <li> This toothbrush gets your mouth amazingly clean...</li>
            <li> clean -- feeling as if I&#x27;d just returned from the dentist</li>
            <li> can honestly say that my gums feel like they are in better shape than they used to be, and my teeth are cleaner on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a feeling of a clean mouth that you can&#x27;t get anywhere else.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean after each use; as though I had just come from the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vibration from this toothbrush leaves a lasting tingle in my mouth that I find quite pleasant and somewhat relaxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really complaining because my dentist visits have been great since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature: if the brush needs a charge, it&#x27;ll beep four or five times after you complete your brushing cycle (\\&quot;beep-beep-beep-beep\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Now even at full strength I do not experience any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now even at full strength I do not experience any discomfort.</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t sound like much fun</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like getting a full dental cleaning every time you brush.</li>
            <li> I suspect that people with tender mouths will really want to follow the directions they give you with the toothbrush to be sure they don&#x27;t discourage themselves from using it again.</li>
            <li> The internal timer is a good idea.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After a full month of using a Sonicare brush</li>
            <li> The bristles move fast, but they&#x27;re not vicious and hurt your gums like some others out there tend to</li>
            <li> Honestly, when the price comes down everyone will own one of these.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My teeth feel exceptionally clean--more clean on a daily basis than they ever did before!</li>
            <li> But this is a sophisticated unit and is more like a medical device than a disposable supply item.</li>
            <li> The whole thing is easy to keep clean, quite well</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this Sonicare toothbrush for anyone looking for healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Its outstanding in my opinion, and I highly  recommend it.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare Advance 4700 is still available here on Amazon at a reasonable price in another listing!</li>
            <li> programs the unit to start of mild, then increase over the first couple of weeks use to full strength.</li>
            <li> Sonicaire programs the unit to start of mild, then increase over the first couple of weeks use to full strength.</li>
            <li> With the Sonicaire, then body is light, yet large, and does all the brushing for you.</li>
            <li> With the Sonicaire, then body is light, yet large, and does all the brushing for you.</li>
            <li> - they go on their little stand to dry.&lt;BR&gt;3)  great for one person or two -  </li>
            <li> (the battery may gradually lose life over time, requiring more frequent charging).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the drool, brushing just shouldn&#x27;t be this much fun.  </li>
            <li> Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you it was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> When I use the PL-4, I&#x27;m much better at completely brushing each section of my mouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer a skeptic, this brush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Could it have any downsides?&lt;br /&gt;Although I consider it easily worth every penny, the upfront cost is staggering compared to a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s fun to use</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> inner/outer to be quite useful.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The 30 Second Timer - This is probably my favorite feature, aside from clean teeth :</li>
            <li> The 2 minute timer, however, does get me to brush for the right amount of time...</li>
            <li> Her prescription proved to be right on target.</li>
            <li> The massaging action is actually quite pleasant...</li>
            <li> It helps you to pace your tooth brushing, making sure that you spend enough time to insure adequate cleaning.  </li>
            <li> When I first heard about Sonicare, I figured it was worth a try</li>
            <li> brush can run for a week between recharges, and the charging stand is small and attractive.</li>
            <li> Although it did clean my teeth, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle this unit for long.  </li>
            <li> My wife is a dental hygienist, and the dentist she works for highly recommends this product (and he rarely if ever recommends dental products!).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to clean out &amp; not that big of a deal.  </li>
            <li> the way, the reason I&#x27;m willing to keep spending so much in order to own this toothbrush is that I believe that it is going to save me lots of money in dental bills later on.</li>
            <li> The brush moves VERY fast, doing ALL the work for you.</li>
            <li> 2 minutes on sonicare, and the teeth still aren&#x27;t smooth, then I brush manually for 20 seconds, and actually get the teeth clean.</li>
            <li> i bought this toothbrush after my last visit to the dentist because i wanted to take better care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> i first started using the sonicare.  </li>
            <li> my first brushing session</li>
            <li> One cleaning cycle lasts 2 minutes and I love the internal timer that beeps every 30 seconds that allows you to focus on another part of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The zones are bottom inside, bottom outside, top inside, and top outside.  </li>
            <li> At first I noticed that it was too aggressive.</li>
            <li> In his words, teeth cleaning should be called &amp;quot;gums cleaning&amp;quot; and you can do much better manually with a proper technique.</li>
            <li> and I have personally used many non-manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> -- I&#x27;m able to reach all the way to my back molars and not gag on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Our whole family loves this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Well, the real question should be, are your teeth worth it?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a steep price for something that most of us treat as a generic commodity</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> read in a leading consumer magazine that the toothbrush didn&#x27;t perform better than manual brushing when manual brushing was done properly.  </li>
            <li> The magazine article said that the reason the Sonicare would perform better was because people would brush their teeth longer and for the proper amount of time because there was a timer on it.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> For some reason, they don&#x27;t seem to last many years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, since the toothbrush is so valuable to me, I&#x27;ve been willing to incur this expense in order to keep owning one.  </li>
            <li> It simply brushes your teeth better than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the simple shutoff of the PL-1 after two minutes.</li>
            <li> and I find that I&#x27;m much more likely to continue brushing even after the unit has turned off just in case</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d regret paying that much money for something my dentist would give me for free, but having used the Sonicare PL-4 and seen the results for both of us, I can firmly say to friends and family that your dentist, your teeth, and your gums will thank you for spending this kind of money.</li>
            <li> Once the battery decides not to recharge anymore, there is absolutely NOTHING that you can do!  </li>
            <li> I like the compact head better than the larger head.  </li>
            <li> You might want to be aware of this before purchasing.</li>
            <li> The timer pulses every thirty seconds to prompt you to switch from front to back of teeth and from top to bottom.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I use mentadent toothpaste, and don&#x27;t want to change\\&quot;, was the first thing I said before I got this.  </li>
            <li> I really like this!  </li>
            <li> the price may be high but it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I love the timer function because it lets them know just how long they need to brush</li>
            <li> I could feel how much cleaner my teeth after the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> And while I don&#x27;t fully understand how it&#x27;s possible, I find it fascinating that simply changing a toothbrush can make this much difference.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> ;-)&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way: WOW!!!</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll be amazed at how clean your teeth are and how healthy your gums look after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I had a previous soni-care like this that I really liked.  </li>
            <li> Though one 2-minute cycle is long enough for a good brushing, I often brush for two of those cycles.  </li>
            <li> This, plus the obligatory heachache you&#x27;ll get using it, which is, of course, unfortunate because your now beautiful smile will be replaced by a frown.  </li>
            <li> He would use it if they made a large size</li>
            <li> If this one wear out I certainly hope Sonic stay in business</li>
            <li> &lt;BR&gt;- holds a charge long enough to take on vacation without the charging base&lt;BR&gt;- travel case is a good design&lt;BR&gt;- gets my teeth very clean&lt;BR</li>
            <li> Just a nice little side benefit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a little getting used to, but that&#x27;s the nice thing about the \\&quot;ramp up\\&quot; feature of the brush.  </li>
            <li> leaves your teeth feeling smooth and seems to get the hard-to-reach places in the back very well.  </li>
            <li> Even though I was spending more than 2 minutes carefully brushing my teeth manually 3x/day  and flossing - after using the Sonicare</li>
            <li> Very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush system wondering if it really lived up to the hype.</li>
            <li> This system really works.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really blame that on the toothbrush, though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I took notice when I found out how much the one was that she wanted.  </li>
            <li> brush handle contains a rechargable battery, and the brushes are available in different sizes.  </li>
            <li> All you have to do is to hold the brush head gently against the teeth and</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> and I never used to brush my teeth as much as they needed it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> BTW, it&#x27;s important to regularly unscrew the toothbrush head and rinse off toothpaste that&#x27;s accumulated between the nut and the head, as recommended in the instructions.   </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress how much confidence I have in the benefits from using this toothbrush.     </li>
            <li> Pull the carpeting and wash the walls then have the ducts cleaned and get a whole house air cleaner.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth very well</li>
            <li> The Sonicare toothbrush is really a breakthrough.</li>
            <li> It seems to be very thorough...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot man</li>
            <li> one of the reasons the toothbrush cracks is because the owner uses toothpaste with too much hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> There are several benefits to this 30-second \\&quot;beep\\&quot; feature that I noticed; first, it gets you to brush for a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> It also would be much more environmentally-friendly, as the nickel-cadmium batteries in the Sonicare are extremely toxic.  </li>
            <li> I worked with Sonicare support and they got me a new brush and a new charger right away.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had clean teeth, and would brush regularly.</li>
            <li> It is even smart enough to run at a slower rate when you first get it and after a number of brushes it will move to a higher speed.  </li>
            <li> The plastic could be antibacterial, the instructions to dry it out completely between uses should be more emphatically written.     </li>
            <li> Second, because of the way they instruct you to use the brush, you get full coverage of both arches.</li>
            <li> 30-second reminder is a cool function that lets you know every 30 seconds to move to a different part of your mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not painful, but very different.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am not a dental professional...</li>
            <li> and then it finally works at full capacity.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> opposed to manual brushing, with the sonicare I actually find myself brushing for the full recommended two minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A light touch helps, and also gives more effective cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Although you can switch brush heads so more than one person can use the base, it gets tiring to do this multiple times a day, in different bathrooms, etc.  </li>
            <li> It also takes a few brushings to get used to the rapid vibrations in your mouth -- it can really tickle -- and I imagine that if you have sensitive gumsthat it could cause some mild painat first, but will certainly firm up the gums and help their condition improve in good order.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think much about it when my wife told me that she wanted a new toothbrush for Christmas...</li>
            <li> only does this device make brushing my teeth quicker and more relaxing, but they simply get cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is the first electronic toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, and let me tell you, the first time I used it, it was definitely a wierd feeling; almost like the feeling you get when you get your teeth cleaned from the dentist</li>
            <li> first time you use this product it may make your teeth sensitive for a few days (because of the vibration) and while its permanent and rechargeable battery will last through most trips it is physically larger and takes slightly more space to pack than a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> first time you use this product it may make your teeth sensitive for a few days (because of the vibration) and while its permanent and rechargeable battery will last through most trips it is physically larger and takes slightly more space to pack than a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> It goes easy on you for the first few brushings</li>
            <li> Consumers should not just toss these in the trash to end up in a landfill - but ask the manufacturer to recycle the plastic, metal and batteries in the brushes and the handle.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the recycling issue for the brush heads, on performance - I would highly recommend this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly to everyone.  </li>
            <li> Type As) to treat their gums with a little more TLC.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice it very much except when brushing my upper front teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have 2 things to confess--a bad cola habit &amp;amp; that I&#x27;m a once-a-day brusher (twice, for special occasions  lol).</li>
            <li> Very minor considering how clean your teeth get.  </li>
            <li> husband pushed us into buying this rather expensive &amp;quot;toy.&amp;quot; At just under 100$US at the time we bought it, even the 20% off coupon we had didn&#x27;t make me all that happy.</li>
            <li> (\\&quot;How does it charge?\\&quot;, I thought), but evidently it doesn&#x27;t need any exposed metal to make contact with the charging base. :D</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, you need to use far less toothpaste than normal, because the Sonicare brush doesn&#x27;t need gobs of it to work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> My general dentist&#x27;s staff noticed a significant improvement in oral hygiene shortly after I started using the Sonicare unit.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they could design it to last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Every time some company puts out a new toothbrush, I buy it.  </li>
            <li> and I had my new toothbrush in a matter of days.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for over 6 months, and the brush is still in like new shape.&lt;br /&gt;The kit</li>
            <li> So every 1-2 weeks I had to shell out the cash for a new brush</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks, my gums were like new.</li>
            <li> Look at it this way, it&#x27;s cheaper than a new filling...</li>
            <li> Anyway, enjoy it, especially if you have a neckbrace or public heath facility near by!</li>
            <li> First of all at my last check-up, my dentist said I didn&#x27;t need a cleaning this time around.</li>
            <li> Only 1/2 the price and full of all the same promises.  </li>
            <li> Second, I rarely brushed for 2 full minutes with a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The replacement brush heads cost more than a regular toothbrush, but seem to last long enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After years of brushing too hard and using softer toothbrushes, my dentist recommended &amp;quot;any electronic toothbrush&amp;quot; to facilitate better cleaning without gum recession.</li>
            <li> I was unsure if I would grow used to the vibrating action</li>
            <li> Maybe it has something to do with the sonic waves of the bristles, maybe it&#x27;s because you use the brush with no water (only toothpaste), but I noticed that my paste doesn&#x27;t foam-up NEARLY as much as it used to.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well the Sonicare cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> In fact, it fees as if you&#x27;ve just had your teeth cleaned professionally in a way.</li>
            <li> It has developed cracks around the on&#x27;off button and is no longer usable.  </li>
            <li> Every time I use the Sonicare, my teeth and gums feel professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you want that stuff near you...</li>
            <li> It feels strange at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve considered replacing them, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll even bother, since the toothbrush&#x27;s cleaning action was sub-par.  </li>
            <li> Although the PL-4 should have been equipped with a \\&quot;smart\\&quot; battery, it&#x27;s best if you leave it off the base until it needs to be recharged</li>
            <li> Just know that if you leave your brush head attached to the base, check the inside for growing mold every once in a while!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> If your worried about how it might feel when you first try it, there is an introductory period where the toothbrush starts slower and every time you use it, it slowly speeds up until you&#x27;re at full speed by about a week.  </li>
            <li> More important, my dentist says the health of my gums (leading cause of tooth loss) is extremely good since I started using the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;The feature where it beeps every 30 seconds is pretty useless, and the auto-off after 2 minutes is downright annoying (I like to brush for 3-4</li>
            <li> It really made my saliva run the first few times I used it, but that&#x27;s not a problem now.  </li>
            <li> I bought this particular toothbrush back in March, 2002, and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier.  </li>
            <li> Back to the plusses: For anyone with trouble holding small items due to arthritis or similar conditions, I can say that although the handle feels bulky at first, it&#x27;s quite comfortable &amp;amp; easy to hold; and you don&#x27;t have to move your hand much.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it should be no big deal, since what I&#x27;ve heard from various dentists is that there is no particular benefit to using baking soda &amp; peroxide over any other paste.</li>
            <li> i would never go back to the normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Now I was told to come back in three months vs my normal 4-month cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> I found my sonic, charged it and in about a week my teeth and gums were back to normal.  </li>
            <li> main complaint is that the battery is not replaceable, forcing people to replace their Sonicare after several years and filling up the landfills with more toothbrushes than necessary.  </li>
            <li> The brush also does a terrific job of massaging my gums--very nice!&lt;br /&gt;There are several things about it that really impress me:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I was skeptical about spending so much money on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Sonicare could and should be more responsible in warning about this potenially serious health threat due to - in their thoughts - improper or inadequate customer/owner maintenance.</li>
            <li> Generally I&#x27;d describe it feels like it is \\&quot;tickling\\&quot;</li>
            <li> recharger is small and simple with a light on the handle to let you know when it is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> I am going back to a regular brush with soft bristles that I can buy for a couple bucks and toss when it gets old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to note that the brush head will slowly wear out without any visible sign of wear.</li>
            <li> After going thru a year of severe allergy symptoms all summer, then having severe eye allergy symptoms this winter, and now another eye problem just one week after after tackling the first issue I was feeling beaten down by my health issues.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit put off by the price-I mean I&#x27;m supposed to spend HOW much?  </li>
            <li> To be honest, it was rather startling at first to feel vibrations througout my mouth, on my gums especially, and a little into my sinuses because they&#x27;re so near everything else in my head.</li>
            <li> In the long run you will need a new head.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicaire</li>
            <li> In the long run you will need a new head.</li>
            <li> But other than that I have nothing to really complain about.  </li>
            <li> [price] for a toothbrush seemed a bit excessive to me at first!  </li>
            <li> I am terrified that my whole house is contaminated with black mold.</li>
            <li> Even brushing manually for just these few days, I have not been as satisfied as I am with my Sonicare, and am anxious for my replacement one to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I was almost abt to finish the transaction for buying this, but luckily, i saw a negative feedback posted by someone else, in this website, so i decided not to buy it.</li>
            <li> only real drawback I see in this brush is the \\&quot;Battery Low\\&quot; indicator tends to come on a little premature.  </li>
            <li> have an 88 year old mother who due to mild arthritis, is unable to grasp a regular toothbrush very well.</li>
            <li> I have an 88 year old mother who due to mild arthritis, is unable to grasp a regular toothbrush very well.</li>
            <li> Around the same time, I developed an illness that causes extreme dry-mouth.</li>
            <li> I never brushed long enough using a standard brush</li>
            <li> And then let everyone know how long it has taken you to ship an item that is advertised next day.</li>
            <li> They last a long time...</li>
            <li> They last a long time...</li>
            <li> but it won&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> before long I began to feel pain and bleeding on one side around the gum line on my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> After two years of using this toothbrush, my teeth remain healthy with no losses or fillings, my gums have actually improved their health, cleanings are annoying but no longer unbearable, and my dentist thanks me.</li>
            <li> After using the Sonicaire system, my gums have healed and moved down so much that it is impossible for me to push them out of the way enought to feel that crown top anymore.</li>
            <li> In less than one week it will feel completely natural.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, my last visit to my dentist was the first time in years that a regular checkup did not end up in another filling or worse.  </li>
            <li> Little Or No Mess! -</li>
            <li> Only the most minor complaint: it is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> The only drawback as other have suggested is the fact that the battery is not replaceable, which means you&#x27;ll have to purchase another one when your current one goes out.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to the first few times you use it</li>
            <li> I hated having this problem, but the responsiveness of their support staff was great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked going, and in fact, have been known to avoid it for 7 years at a stretch.&lt;br /&gt;Since we purchased this toothbrush, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to use the PL-1 (thanks to the removeable brush heads, using a friend&#x27;s toothbrush is no longer an issue).</li>
            <li> If you are already using an electric toothbrush the upgrade is minor.  </li>
            <li> I will wait as long as it takes.</li>
            <li> There are 2 minor inconveniences I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first few brushings my teeth were noticably whiter and after a few months I noticed the puffiness in my gums was gone.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> My 14 year old &amp; 9 year old have been using the small brush heads for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> The handle takes a little getting used to, since it is much larger than a standard toothbrush&#x27;s handle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to assume that if you&#x27;re reading this review, you&#x27;re seriously considering spending this much $ on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a single flaw or downside to the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I like the 30 sec feature that reminds me how long I&#x27;ve been brushing.</li>
            <li> the only issue i have with it is that it shuts down after 2 mins.</li>
            <li> I only have one problem: black mold.</li>
            <li> Finally Sonicare should make every effort to eliminate black mold as a problem for their product.</li>
            <li> I am careful not to submerge it, or get it too wet.</li>
            <li> After a few months with the top-of-the-line sonicare, I&#x27;m switching back to a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> 30 sec timed cycles give me the discipline to stay brushing for the recommended two minutes</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I skipped several dental cleanings.</li>
            <li> I had never used an electric toothbrush before, but I was curious to see what all the fuss was about.</li>
            <li> I brush and I floss everyday, but it seemed like every three month I am back to my dentist&#x27;s office for another filling or crown!  </li>
            <li> I trusted Sonicare&#x27;s engineers to have designed the unit properly, such that it won&#x27;t over-charge and destroy the batteries, but I guess the joke is on me.  </li>
            <li> I certainly am not.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cost could probably buy you a very small third world country with an entire population of &amp;quot;teeth brushers&amp;quot; to serve you for the rest of your life.  </li>
            <li> I was a little confused about this at first</li>
            <li> The vibration will drive you crazy at first, especially on the roof of your mouth, but just fight through it.  </li>
            <li> She said that was due to bacteria.</li>
            <li> My husband does not use it because even the regular size head is too small for his preference.  </li>
            <li> The other is cleaning my oven.</li>
            <li> -- you can read that in the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Oh yes, there is one other negative:&lt;BR</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for almost a year (on the advice of my dentist as well as other Sonicare owners), and it works extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I noticed a big improvement with this device over an ordinary toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was told by customer service that this maybe due to the type of toothpaste I was using and that I shouldn&#x27;t use a baking soda and peroxide type toothpaste, which my dentist had recommended.</li>
            <li> I change the replacement heads pretty regularly, even though they are very expensive.</li>
            <li> We had a very expensive Oral B that is about 3 years old and decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li> I hate those cleanings, the drills and all the other torture devices that dentists just love to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not right.  </li>
            <li> The only thing these two have in common is the brushes on the end</li>
            <li> There was black mold as well as thick white gunk.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally I broke down and bought this unit for me and my wife.  </li>
            <li> In fact, mine broke down on me about a week ago, and I&#x27;ve signed online to buy another one.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done, I hold the brush bristle side down and push the on button to wisk off the water.  </li>
            <li> The InterPlak product I previously mentioned is excellent^2 at cleaning your teeth, but the battery life is woefull.  </li>
            <li> This pays for itself in one less cavity.</li>
            <li> I have had the brush for less than a year.</li>
            <li> There is one slight drawback though.  </li>
            <li> I got the BLACK MOLD....</li>
            <li> It is the black mold like all the homeowners got in their homes and ended up having to move away.  </li>
            <li> much less your face.</li>
            <li> Today when cleaning the bathroom I noticed something black on the side and handle of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It was black mold inside and pouring out of the brush.</li>
            <li> One of my previous electric toothbrushes I had to use their paste.  </li>
            <li> the only complaint i have about my sonicare is the disappointment of when it needs to be recharged - and while i&#x27;m waiting i must use a NORMAL toothbrush!</li>
            <li> She had dental surgery for tooth implants a few months ago and was given a mouth rinse to use by her oral surgeon that stained her teeth black.  </li>
            <li> when I use it, their isn&#x27;t even a little bit of discomfort.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my gums were swelling a little</li>
            <li> Until the brushes started wearing out some little mechanical piece inside after 1-2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Another thing that takes a little getting used to is the fact that you don&#x27;t have to supply the muscle power to do the brushing.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were a little discolored and my gums were consistently a little puffy around the tooth.</li>
            <li> My gums bled a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can name the other brands</li>
            <li> And going to the dentist in the past only created serious problems in that regard.</li>
            <li> so I thought I would give it a try and see if I could cut down on the yearly cleanings that I need (3 or 4!).  </li>
            <li> only disappointment I have with this toothbrush is that this is the third one I&#x27;m buying within about a 4 year period.</li>
            <li> I like this one for a few reasons.  </li>
            <li> Use of the Sonicare stopped incipient gum disease dead in its tracks.</li>
            <li> I have used it continually with the exception of a few in between spurts of just not using it.  </li>
            <li> The key thing behind this is the amount of brush strokes; the force you feel doesn&#x27;t matter, but the repetition is what does the job.</li>
            <li> not one problem with cracking OR dead batteries...and</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the Sonicare is just a really expensive disposable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> had a tooth that was other than a few thin shell walls, down to my gumline.</li>
            <li> The brush-head is too small &amp;amp; stiff to brush your tongue well, so I use a manual brush for that.</li>
            <li> using the brush was a bit annoying for the first few days</li>
            <li> After using the Sonicare for one week - she has noticed a noticible improvement in the removal of the stain.&lt;br /&gt;The one issue I am concerned about is the recycling of the plastic/metal in the brush heads and nickel/cadmium batteries after the life of the unit is past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic--</li>
            <li> To fix that, I leave the brush off, distribute the paste across my teeth, then turn the brush on &amp;amp; proceed as usual.</li>
            <li> I was just too lazy.</li>
            <li> Black mold is toxic and can cause serious problems.</li>
            <li> I followed Sonicare&#x27;s instructions and left the unit in the charger, even though I was a bit skeptical of that strategy.  </li>
            <li> When gums recede due to plaque and bacteria, that is when we get gingivitus, and even worse, periodontal disease, which results in having to remove the tooth.</li>
            <li> the inside of the brush head, the threaded top of the handle and the base get dirty within a few weeks and are not easy to clean.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;d long been frustrated by an inability to avoid plaque buildup, despite brushing carefully and flossing nightly.</li>
            <li> I tend to brush too hard on the corner teeth and was creating notches.</li>
            <li> You always know that you&#x27;re brushing for the recommended time, that you&#x27;re removing plaque, and you&#x27;re not brushing too hard and damaging enamel.  </li>
            <li> I hope I am not too late in my clean-up efforts.     </li>
            <li> I have had extensive work done in my mouth, but gums are by far the worst.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used my Sonicare toothbrush in about a year - I switched back to manual because I was unhappy with the effectiveness of the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> so getting it doesn&#x27;t mean that your dentist will stop hassling you about flossing.</li>
            <li> Next I unscrewed the base from the brush and it was pretty bad in there.</li>
            <li> After realizing that she had to choose between having serious gingivitis or using the toothbrush she opted for the toothbrush and loves it now.</li>
            <li> Not a good thing on a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It did take some time to adjust to the level of brush \\&quot;vigor\\&quot; when they started using it, but it didn&#x27;t take long, &amp; it didn&#x27;t make their gums bleed or anything bad like that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She just never \\&quot;got around to using it\\&quot; and had a very negative dental visit.</li>
            <li> Nothing personal, but I just hate going to dentists.  </li>
            <li> After having used the Conair Interplak and experiencing poor battery life and power to the unit, I switched to Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> There is a metal post behind the brush head that interferes at times with brushing.  </li>
            <li> You brush longer because the timer keeps you working and in a two minute cycle you get 61,000 brush strokes with some torque behind it.  </li>
            <li> It also requires a replacement brush head approximately every six months at about $15 each.</li>
            <li> a per-unit cost of an extra dollar or two, Sonicare could have screwed the two halves of the base unit together, rather than fusing the plastic.  </li>
            <li> I have bad teeth, due to a flouride-less childhood.  </li>
            <li> By that, I mean that if I leave my brush head attached to the base unit for, let&#x27;s say a week, then when I open it to take my brush head off, there is black mold growing on the inside of the handle &amp; the inside of my head base.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed what I&#x27;d call crud or slime around the threads and into the base of the brush when I&#x27;d change the head or wipe the brush down.     </li>
            <li> the tickling sensation was a bit weird</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> It felt a liitle weird in the beginning</li>
            <li> They want be sorry.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s how to make them last:  The worst thing you can do to Nickle-Cadnium (rechargeable) batteries is overcharge them.  </li>
            <li> To throw away a $100+ toothbrush because the $8 battery won&#x27;t hold a charge is absurd.</li>
            <li> The unit is bulky and awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive - but it does deliver the promised results!</li>
            <li> Very weird if you aren&#x27;t used to an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Today I went for my dental cleaning appointnment and guess what - my dentist told me that my gums now were in a really bad shape</li>
            <li> I thought the battery had gone bad</li>
            <li> My neighbor had consistently bad dental visits, so I convinced her to buy one.</li>
            <li> Bad breath is no longer a problem, either, now that our gums are healthier.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I know I have been sick, but I didn&#x27;t think I had let any of my chores get this out of hand.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I hate dentists.  </li>
            <li> The rechargeable base and brush handle are sturdy and neither has exposed contacts so theres no worry about corrosion or shorting of electricity.  </li>
            <li> There are two things I really hate doing.</li>
            <li> I must admit, I hate brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t leave the base plugged in all the time.  </li>
            <li> But just once-a-day with the Sonicare has brought my teeth &amp;amp; gums to where I no longer require a skin graft, despite bad habits!</li>
            <li> I am very, very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> (the worst one i&#x27;ve ever tried) before</li>
            <li> After using it for awhile I started to notice a nasty smell.</li>
            <li> it is disgusting.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i bought this toothbrush after my last visit to the dentist because i wanted to take better care of my teeth.  i have been using it for about 1 month now and i am very happy with its performance.  my teeth have never feel cleaner.  i no longer go to bed wondering if my teeth are clean.  whether the sonicare helps prevent cavities from forming...that has yet to be determined.&lt;br /&gt;when i first started using the sonicare.  the tickling sensation was a bit weird but it is quite easy to get used to.  i&#x27;ve used the oral-b and interplak (the worst one i&#x27;ve ever tried) before and i give the sonicare a 2-thumbs up.  my dentist told me that using an electric toothbrush is not really necessary if we all practice proper brushing techniques, but i am one of those individuals who need help at brushing.  if you too need help at keeping your teeth &amp;amp; gum healthy, get a sonicare!</li>
            <li> i would never go back to the normal toothbrush. sonicare is amazing. cleans my teeth better. the only issue i have with it is that it shuts down after 2 mins. there should be a button to turn this &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; off. using the brush was a bit annoying for the first few days but once i got used to it, i was hooked on.</li>
            <li> I had heard from 2 of my friends that they loved their Sonicare toothbrush so I thought I would give it a try and see if I could cut down on the yearly cleanings that I need (3 or 4!).  After using the toothbrush for one week (3x/day) I can already see and feel a noticable difference.  Even though I was spending more than 2 minutes carefully brushing my teeth manually 3x/day  and flossing - after using the Sonicare my teeth look whiter, feel cleaner, and my gums are feeling healthy. (You still should floss daily!)&lt;br /&gt;During my first brushing session I was unsure if I would grow used to the vibrating action but after a couple of sessions I grew accustomed to it and now actually enjoy the sensation. &lt;br /&gt;Another family member is also using the Sonicare (I have the PL-4 model).  She had dental surgery for tooth implants a few months ago and was given a mouth rinse to use by her oral surgeon that stained her teeth black.  After using the Sonicare for one week - she has noticed a noticible improvement in the removal of the stain.&lt;br /&gt;The one issue I am concerned about is the recycling of the plastic/metal in the brush heads and nickel/cadmium batteries after the life of the unit is past. I hope that Sonicare has some provision for users to recycle the brush heads as they do the batteries. Consumers should not just toss these in the trash to end up in a landfill - but ask the manufacturer to recycle the plastic, metal and batteries in the brushes and the handle.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the recycling issue for the brush heads, on performance - I would highly recommend this toothbrush.  It is expensive - but it does deliver the promised results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to assume that if you&#x27;re reading this review, you&#x27;re seriously considering spending this much $ on a toothbrush. Let&#x27;s pause here for a second and reflect... A TOOTH BRUSH. That&#x27;s all you are going to be getting here. It&#x27;s not magic--so getting it doesn&#x27;t mean that your dentist will stop hassling you about flossing. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way: WOW!!! I am blown away by this gadget! My teeth feel exceptionally clean--more clean on a daily basis than they ever did before! The brush also does a terrific job of massaging my gums--very nice!&lt;br /&gt;There are several things about it that really impress me:&lt;br /&gt;1. Construction - The brush feels exceptionally solid in your hand. Also, there are no exposed metal pieces on the handle. I was a little confused about this at first (\\&quot;How does it charge?\\&quot;, I thought), but evidently it doesn&#x27;t need any exposed metal to make contact with the charging base. :D Okay! No parts to get gummed-up or corrode! Only the most minor complaint: it is a little heavy. My whimpy-wristed girlfriend would complain about this, but I have no problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;2. Design - It is very simple to operate and change brush heads. The brush head itself only needs to be replaced every 6 months (woo-hoo!)--but you need to remove it if you want to use the carrying case, which has been handily provided. No problem! Twist, pop, done. There&#x27;s only one button to worry about--it&#x27;s nicely placed high on the handle for convenient access, but there is no chance of it getting in the way while brushing. Another nifty thing is that you can find replacement brush heads almost anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;3. The Brushing Itself - This is really amazing! The brush moves VERY fast, doing ALL the work for you. All you need to do is apply some toothpaste and simply glide the vibrating brush over your teeth--no pressure or scrubbing! Swipe, swipe, swipe. That&#x27;s all there is to it.&lt;br /&gt;4. The 30 Second Timer - This is probably my favorite feature, aside from clean teeth :-DThe brush pauses and beeps briefly (maybe a tenth of a second, if that)--this is your cue to switch the area you&#x27;re concentrating on. There are several benefits to this 30-second \\&quot;beep\\&quot; feature that I noticed; first, it gets you to brush for a full 2 minutes. If you are anything like I was before I got the Sonicare, I would brush for 30 seconds, max. (i.e. scrub-scrub-scrub, spit, rinse). Second, because of the way they instruct you to use the brush, you get full coverage of both arches. You spend 30 seconds on the upper front arch, move to the upper back for another 30, then lower, etc. Very easy.&lt;br /&gt;5. Little Or No Mess! - Maybe it has something to do with the sonic waves of the bristles, maybe it&#x27;s because you use the brush with no water (only toothpaste), but I noticed that my paste doesn&#x27;t foam-up NEARLY as much as it used to. Hence, I don&#x27;t need to keep spitting the excess. I&#x27;ve also noticed a remarkable decrease in the number of \\&quot;paste spots\\&quot; on the mirror. Just a nice little side benefit. One thing, though--if you take the brush out of your mouth while it&#x27;s on it will splatter everywhere! Simple enough to fix, though--just don&#x27;t take it out of your mouth until you&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;NOTES: If you use baking soda &amp; peroxide toothpaste, you&#x27;re going to have to switch, unless you&#x27;ve been instructed by your doctor to specifically use this type of toothpaste. Honestly, it should be no big deal, since what I&#x27;ve heard from various dentists is that there is no particular benefit to using baking soda &amp; peroxide over any other paste. The problem with the Sonicare is the plastic on the brush head and handle tends to crack if you use BS&amp;P. This does not happen if you use the manufacturer recommended gel-type toothpaste (I use gel and have had no problems whatsoever).&lt;br /&gt;Also, there&#x27;s no reason to leave the unit in the charger. Although the PL-4 should have been equipped with a \\&quot;smart\\&quot; battery, it&#x27;s best if you leave it off the base until it needs to be recharged (the battery may gradually lose life over time, requiring more frequent charging). Another nice feature: if the brush needs a charge, it&#x27;ll beep four or five times after you complete your brushing cycle (\\&quot;beep-beep-beep-beep\\&quot;). I haven&#x27;t noticed any decrease in brushing power towards the end of the battery life, and I have only had to recharge the unit twice in the 2 months since I got it.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this information helps your decision!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sonicare about 3 weeks ago.  At the same time I read a review of toothpastes and changed to Colgate with Peroxide and Soda.&lt;br /&gt;Since I was in my 20&#x27;s (I am 62 now) I had 2 areas of my front teeth that were discolored.  I have tried the different treatments which are suppose to whiten teeth, to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;5 days after beginning to use the Sonicare and the change in tooth paste, the discolored lines in my front teeth are almost gone, it is a miracle, and I&#x27;ll aways use the Sonicare.  I am THRILLED, and will be recommending it to everyone - IT TRULY WORKS!</li>
            <li> You can have the best toothcare product on the market today. That makes it a bargain. You will also have cleaner-feeling teeth (yes, you can tell the difference!) and you will brush your teeth longer... The massaging action is actually quite pleasant...My only problem is having to switch the heads because my wife and I share the same unit...It&#x27;s probably better to get two units, because the power unit can get kind of gross with splattered toothpaste... As an added bonus, you need to use far less toothpaste than normal, because the Sonicare brush doesn&#x27;t need gobs of it to work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I just love this toothbrush.  Every since I started using it I&#x27;ve had better check ups  at the dentist.  He finally said everything was great.  And my dentist never, never says that.  I recommend this product to everyone.  It&#x27;s the best on the market.  Just try it.</li>
            <li> I hate dentists.  Nothing personal, but I just hate going to dentists.  I hate those cleanings, the drills and all the other torture devices that dentists just love to use.  And because of my fear of dentists, I always try to take really good care of my teeth.  Every time some company puts out a new toothbrush, I buy it.  When I first heard about Sonicare, I figured it was worth a try and so I bought it.  I didn&#x27;t realize this would be the last toothbrush I would buy.&lt;br /&gt;I simply love my Sonicare toothbrush.  Starting with 31,000 brush strokes per minute and sonic waves, this toothbrush does an incredible job of cleaning my teeth and gums.  One cleaning cycle lasts 2 minutes and I love the internal timer that beeps every 30 seconds that allows you to focus on another part of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;When I first got my unit, it worked great for about 2-3 weeks and then it stopped charging.  It would not hold its charge and die in about 10 seconds.  I worked with Sonicare support and they got me a new brush and a new charger right away.  I hated having this problem, but the responsiveness of their support staff was great and I had my new toothbrush in a matter of days.  I would highly recommend this Sonicare toothbrush for anyone looking for healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> After having used the Conair Interplak and experiencing poor battery life and power to the unit, I switched to Sonicare.  &lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;ve used it one day and I&#x27;m not impressed.  The unit is bulky and awkward to use.  There is a metal post behind the brush head that interferes at times with brushing.  Although it did clean my teeth, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle this unit for long.  The InterPlak product I previously mentioned is excellent^2 at cleaning your teeth, but the battery life is woefull.  I&#x27;m returning the Sonicare and I&#x27;m trying the Braun unit instead.</li>
            <li> I have been using this system for 3 years and my dental check-ups have improved everytime I go in.  We have one in every bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m giving this system as a gift and everyone has loved it ... so far.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I can massage my gums too which feels good.  Stange sensations when you just start using it but it goes away.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought a two pack for both of us and we both love it.  It has a 2 minute timer built-in and every 30 seconds it will beep telling you to move to a different zone.  The zones are bottom inside, bottom outside, top inside, and top outside.  It is even smart enough to run at a slower rate when you first get it and after a number of brushes it will move to a higher speed.  I thought I brushed well until I got this but now I know better.  I cannot say enough good things about the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush system wondering if it really lived up to the hype. At first I noticed that it was too aggressive. My teeth and gums weren&#x27;t used to it. I thought I had clean teeth, and would brush regularly. After visiting my dentist for a cleaning, the dental assistant razzed me about my gums bleeding when I flossed. She said that was due to bacteria. So I brushed and flossed, and used mouthwash, and that helped. Then I bought the Sonicaire toothbrush, and that made all the difference. Now when I floss, their isn&#x27;t any blood, or at best an occassional little bit. This system really works.&lt;br /&gt;I had a tooth that was other than a few thin shell walls, down to my gumline. The dentist was able to save it, and install a crown. I noticed that I could take a fingernail and pick at the top of the tooth where it met the gum. After using the Sonicaire system, my gums have healed and moved down so much that it is impossible for me to push them out of the way enought to feel that crown top anymore. When gums recede due to plaque and bacteria, that is when we get gingivitus, and even worse, periodontal disease, which results in having to remove the tooth. Do yourself a favor. A stitch in time truly saves nine. Buy this Sonicaire toothbrush system. You can not afford not to. It will save you way more than the purchase price in dental bills.&lt;br /&gt;Now when I use it, their isn&#x27;t even a little bit of discomfort. I even consider it a massage of sorts. I use it in the shower, even though the instructions tell you not to. I am careful not to submerge it, or get it too wet. You need to rinse it off after every use anyhow, so a quick rinse under the shower, keeping it held straight up, works great. I have had it for over 6 months, and the brush is still in like new shape.&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with more than one brush head, which is a savings if you are using it for more than one person in the house. If you are just using it for yourself, one head is enough. It is a savings to buy this kit though, because the multiple heads are a bargain over purchasing them individually. In the long run you will need a new head.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicaire programs the unit to start of mild, then increase over the first couple of weeks use to full strength. Now even at full strength I do not experience any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I have an 88 year old mother who due to mild arthritis, is unable to grasp a regular toothbrush very well. With the Sonicaire, then body is light, yet large, and does all the brushing for you. If  you have a parent like that, this makes a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;Even if you are just buying it for yourself, buy it, and have the toughest gums, and brightest teeth on the block. I am sorry that I wasn&#x27;t able to have one of these for all time. Hope this was helpful.his kit though, because the multiple heads are a bargain over purchasing them individually.

            <li> This toothbrush gets your mouth amazingly clean... :)  We had a very expensive Oral B that is about 3 years old and decided to try something new.  We haven&#x27;t regretted it yet!&lt;br /&gt;Nice features - &lt;BR&gt;1)  if you go on vacation you can take just the toothbrush with you (without the charger)...the battery is quite long-lasting.&lt;BR&gt;2)  the toothbrush heads don&#x27;t go in a \\&quot;compartment\\&quot; where they collect germs and stay damp - they go on their little stand to dry.&lt;BR&gt;3)  great for one person or two -  my dh and I share this toothbrush.  With a simple twist we remove the head after use and put on it&#x27;s stand to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - &lt;br /&gt;It *does* about vibrate your head off if you aren&#x27;t used to it.  I really don&#x27;t notice it very much except when brushing my upper front teeth.  Very minor considering how clean your teeth get.  And it helps remove stains wonderfully.  Generally I&#x27;d describe it feels like it is \\&quot;tickling\\&quot; your mouth while you brush.  Very weird if you aren&#x27;t used to an electric toothbrush.  If you are already using an electric toothbrush the upgrade is minor.  Manual toothbrush users might find it a bit too stimulating at first.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it...You bet!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush three months ago and I have been using it every day. I noticed that my gums were swelling a little but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to it. Today I went for my dental cleaning appointnment and guess what - my dentist told me that my gums now were in a really bad shape (there was a lot of blood). Now I was told to come back in three months vs my normal 4-month cleaning cycle. He told me either to brush manually or to get an OralB electric brush. In his words, teeth cleaning should be called &amp;quot;gums cleaning&amp;quot; and you can do much better manually with a proper technique. &lt;br /&gt;I do feel that this brush cleans well the teeth but the problem areas are the ones below the gumline and this brush doesn&#x27;t seem to reach there and it doesn&#x27;t give a good &amp;quot;workout&amp;quot; for your gums. It felt a liitle weird in the beginning but then I got used to it. I liked how this sonicare product is built and the timer things, but it doesn&#x27;t make a good toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I am switching back to manual brushing and I recommend against buying this brush.</li>
            <li> I got this brush because my dentist recommended it. I tend to brush too hard on the corner teeth and was creating notches. I was very happy with this -- for awhile. After using it for awhile I started to notice a nasty smell. I cleaned the outside of the brush and that didn&#x27;t help. Next I unscrewed the base from the brush and it was pretty bad in there. There was black mold as well as thick white gunk. I cleaned it thoroughly with bleach, getting into corners with q-tips. In no time, the smell was back. This time I investigated further into the brush head itself. Gaaaaack. There was a lot of gross mold growing in there. I soaked that in clorox, then gave it a shake. Chunks of mold came flying out. I cleaned it as well as I could and reassembled it. The brush head no longer worked.    I change the replacement heads pretty regularly, even though they are very expensive. I am going back to a regular brush with soft bristles that I can buy for a couple bucks and toss when it gets old.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is worth the money!  Every time you use it you feel as though you&#x27;ve just left the dentist office.  At my last cleaning my dentist even noticed a difference. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> After a few months with the top-of-the-line sonicare, I&#x27;m switching back to a manual toothbrush.  My teeth just don&#x27;t feel that smooth cleanness that I want.  2 minutes on sonicare, and the teeth still aren&#x27;t smooth, then I brush manually for 20 seconds, and actually get the teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Not rating the product but the company that sells the product your add stated the item I ordered was going to ship the next day the next day you send me an email stating that you can no longer ship the item on the  date in the add. But the add still states the item will ship the next day. I will wait as long as it takes. And then let everyone know how long it has taken you to ship an item that is advertised next day.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well the Sonicare cleans my teeth. I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to a regular toothbrush! &lt;BR&gt;Things I like:&lt;BR&gt;- 30 sec timed cycles give me the discipline to stay brushing for the recommended two minutes&lt;BR&gt;- holds a charge long enough to take on vacation without the charging base&lt;BR&gt;- travel case is a good design&lt;BR&gt;- gets my teeth very clean&lt;BR&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like... the inside of the brush head, the threaded top of the handle and the base get dirty within a few weeks and are not easy to clean.&lt;BR&gt;Overall, a very good product and one I would recommend.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I skipped several dental cleanings. Around the same time, I developed an illness that causes extreme dry-mouth. When I finally went back to the dentist in pain, he took one look at my gumline &amp;amp; said I&#x27;d need a skin graft. That didn&#x27;t sound like much fun so I asked what to do to delay it. He told me to buy 1 of 2 electric brushes. I chose the Sonicare &amp;amp; after 3 months of use, my gums are noticeably healthier &amp;amp; no longer bleed if I even THINK of brushing. I have 2 things to confess--a bad cola habit &amp;amp; that I&#x27;m a once-a-day brusher (twice, for special occasions  lol). I know, shame on me. But just once-a-day with the Sonicare has brought my teeth &amp;amp; gums to where I no longer require a skin graft, despite bad habits! There are 2 minor inconveniences I&#x27;ve found: 1) The brush-head is too small &amp;amp; stiff to brush your tongue well, so I use a manual brush for that. 2) You use a tiny bit of toothpaste but it often sits in the bottom of your mouth, shaken off by the vibration before you get &amp;quot;coverage&amp;quot;. To fix that, I leave the brush off, distribute the paste across my teeth, then turn the brush on &amp;amp; proceed as usual. Back to the plusses: For anyone with trouble holding small items due to arthritis or similar conditions, I can say that although the handle feels bulky at first, it&#x27;s quite comfortable &amp;amp; easy to hold; and you don&#x27;t have to move your hand much. It took me awhile to learn not to &amp;quot;brush&amp;quot; but let the Sonicare do the work. And it truly does, with the greatest of ease!</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist and I have personally used many non-manual toothbrushes.  This one is the best.  This is the only one I recommend to my patients.  It is great for getting and keeping healthy gums.  If you&#x27;re going to spend money on a battery operated toothbrush, spend it on this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush!  &lt;br /&gt;The vibration from this toothbrush leaves a lasting tingle in my mouth that I find quite pleasant and somewhat relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;Not only are my teeth clean -- feeling as if I&#x27;d just returned from the dentist -- I&#x27;m able to reach all the way to my back molars and not gag on the toothbrush.  Also, the 2-minute timer beeps and pauses every 30 seconds which helps me concentrate on the task at hand.&lt;br /&gt;The power unit comes with three brush heads that should last me for a year.  The rechargeable base and brush handle are sturdy and neither has exposed contacts so theres no worry about corrosion or shorting of electricity.  It would be nice, however, if the brush handle had a better seal so that it could withstand a quick rinse under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this toothbrush is that it seems to set off my salivary glands causing me to drool.  Can&#x27;t really blame that on the toothbrush, though.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the drool, brushing just shouldn&#x27;t be this much fun.  It&#x27;s just not right.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> My husband and I are total converts! We love our Sonicare. When my husband had to leave on business, we had to draw cards to determine who got to keep the Sonicare! My dentist is giving me another one next week, so we won&#x27;t have that problem again!</li>
            <li> Our whole family loves this toothbrush!  My 14 year old &amp; 9 year old have been using the small brush heads for a few years now.  I love the timer function because it lets them know just how long they need to brush &amp; I know they&#x27;re getting a good cleaning.  It did take some time to adjust to the level of brush \\&quot;vigor\\&quot; when they started using it, but it didn&#x27;t take long, &amp; it didn&#x27;t make their gums bleed or anything bad like that.&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time &amp; absolutely love the clean it gives my teeth.  My husband does not use it because even the regular size head is too small for his preference.  He would use it if they made a large size head.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the unit is not waterproof.  By that, I mean that if I leave my brush head attached to the base unit for, let&#x27;s say a week, then when I open it to take my brush head off, there is black mold growing on the inside of the handle &amp; the inside of my head base.  Not that it ever comes in contact with my mouth, but I just wish it didn&#x27;t happen...it&#x27;s easy to clean out &amp; not that big of a deal.  Maybe the instructions say to remove the brush head after every use...the mold could be my fault.  Just know that if you leave your brush head attached to the base, check the inside for growing mold every once in a while!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I would purchase another one for anyone looking for a toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I admit it, I put off buying the Sonicare because I couldn&#x27;t justify the price.  Several times my dentist asked me &amp;quot;So when you gonna get that Sonicare?&amp;quot;.  Yet after seeing the price I just couldn&#x27;t do it.  So instead I bought a knock-off.  You know the ones.  Only 1/2 the price and full of all the same promises.  Yep, I bought one and liked it alot too.  Until the brushes started wearing out some little mechanical piece inside after 1-2 weeks.  So every 1-2 weeks I had to shell out the cash for a new brush head.&lt;br /&gt;Finally I broke down and bought this unit for me and my wife.  What a difference!  It takes a little getting used to the first few times you use it but what a job it does.&lt;br /&gt;The two-minute timer is great.  I never brushed long enough using a standard brush so this makes sure that I get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;The 30-second reminder is a cool function that lets you know every 30 seconds to move to a different part of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The recharger is small and simple with a light on the handle to let you know when it is fully charged.  I went a week without charging the brush and it still worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wait any longer.  If you are looking at the Sonicare you KNOW it&#x27;s a good brush.  The question you are asking though is the same one I asked myself.  Is it worth it?  Well, the real question should be, are your teeth worth it?</li>
            <li> First of all at my last check-up, my dentist said I didn&#x27;t need a cleaning this time around. This was a 6 mo. routine for me. I am very pleased with the use of this brush. It&#x27;s simple to operate, no complicating instructions. I like the 30 sec feature that reminds me how long I&#x27;ve been brushing. I really love the super clean feeling in my mouth when I&#x27;m finished. Its outstanding in my opinion, and I highly  recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the way to go so just do it.  You brush longer because the timer keeps you working and in a two minute cycle you get 61,000 brush strokes with some torque behind it.  You&#x27;d probly have two brush for a month by hand to get the same results you get in two minutes.  It&#x27;s a steep price for something that most of us treat as a generic commodity but hey, I use it more.  Believe me it&#x27;s habit forming and a good one for a change.  This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> It is a fancy electric toothbrush.  I&#x27;m not so impressed.  The 2 minute timer, however, does get me to brush for the right amount of time...</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is invaluable to me.  I use it to help keep my gum disease under control.  I need to brush with an antibacterial solution and to have it reach under the gumline and the Sonicare toothbrush achieves this for me.&lt;br /&gt;I read in a leading consumer magazine that the toothbrush didn&#x27;t perform better than manual brushing when manual brushing was done properly.  The magazine article said that the reason the Sonicare would perform better was because people would brush their teeth longer and for the proper amount of time because there was a timer on it.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I read that article, I still believe that I get better results from my Sonicare.  In fact, mine broke down on me about a week ago, and I&#x27;ve signed online to buy another one.  Even brushing manually for just these few days, I have not been as satisfied as I am with my Sonicare, and am anxious for my replacement one to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;The only disappointment I have with this toothbrush is that this is the third one I&#x27;m buying within about a 4 year period. For some reason, they don&#x27;t seem to last many years.  I try to take care of it.  I unscrew the brush head and rinse out the toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;However, since the toothbrush is so valuable to me, I&#x27;ve been willing to incur this expense in order to keep owning one.  It would be nice if they could design it to last a little longer.  Then I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the reason I&#x27;m willing to keep spending so much in order to own this toothbrush is that I believe that it is going to save me lots of money in dental bills later on.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of years ago when the dentist recommended it to me.  At first I was a bit put off by the price-I mean I&#x27;m supposed to spend HOW much?  Let me tell you it was worth every penny.  If your worried about how it might feel when you first try it, there is an introductory period where the toothbrush starts slower and every time you use it, it slowly speeds up until you&#x27;re at full speed by about a week.  I recommend this highly to everyone.  It simply brushes your teeth better than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li> Best invention since sliced bread. This made such a difference even my dentist noticed. This pays for itself in one less cavity.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It&#x27;s easy to use, and it trains aggressive brushers (read: Type As) to treat their gums with a little more TLC. Your teeth feel cleaner longer after using a sonicare. It&#x27;s almost like getting a full dental cleaning every time you brush.</li>
            <li> There are two things I really hate doing. One is going to the dentist. The other is cleaning my oven. Fortunately, I can get my husband to clean my oven, but I can&#x27;t get him to go to the dentist for me. I&#x27;ve never liked going, and in fact, have been known to avoid it for 7 years at a stretch.&lt;br /&gt;Since we purchased this toothbrush, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to use the PL-1 (thanks to the removeable brush heads, using a friend&#x27;s toothbrush is no longer an issue). The pauses in vibration over the course of two minutes that the PL-4 gives is a great boon for me. I like it better than the simple shutoff of the PL-1 after two minutes. When I use the PL-1, I tend to rush through my brushing and find that I&#x27;m done before the toothbrush is. When I use the PL-4, I&#x27;m much better at completely brushing each section of my mouth and I find that I&#x27;m much more likely to continue brushing even after the unit has turned off just in case I feel I&#x27;ve missed a spot or two. I don&#x27;t do that with the PL-1 model.&lt;br /&gt;Getting used to a vibrating toothbrush was...interesting. For me, it tickled a bit. To be honest, it was rather startling at first to feel vibrations througout my mouth, on my gums especially, and a little into my sinuses because they&#x27;re so near everything else in my head. Not painful, but very different. I suspect that people with tender mouths will really want to follow the directions they give you with the toothbrush to be sure they don&#x27;t discourage themselves from using it again. &lt;br /&gt;My teeth have always been reasonably healthy, but my gums have always been an issue for me. And going to the dentist in the past only created serious problems in that regard. That is, cleanings were excrutiating. I didn&#x27;t want to go and I avoided it as often as possible. After two years of using this toothbrush, my teeth remain healthy with no losses or fillings, my gums have actually improved their health, cleanings are annoying but no longer unbearable, and my dentist thanks me. I&#x27;ve seenmy xrays and they&#x27;ve shown improvement in bone health too. And while I don&#x27;t fully understand how it&#x27;s possible, I find it fascinating that simply changing a toothbrush can make this much difference.&lt;br /&gt;My husband pushed us into buying this rather expensive &amp;quot;toy.&amp;quot; At just under 100$US at the time we bought it, even the 20% off coupon we had didn&#x27;t make me all that happy. I thought I&#x27;d regret paying that much money for something my dentist would give me for free, but having used the Sonicare PL-4 and seen the results for both of us, I can firmly say to friends and family that your dentist, your teeth, and your gums will thank you for spending this kind of money.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I was skeptical about spending so much money on a toothbrush. I had never used an electric toothbrush before, but I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. I purchased the 30-day tester version of this brush ... ..., which includes a standard brush head with a non-rechargeable handle. At the end of the trial period, I was convinced and purchased one ...&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are cleaner and whiter, my gums look healthier and my mouth feels better. You still need to floss to get in between your teeth, but this brush is infinitely better than using a manual one. I&#x27;m no longer a skeptic, this brush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in my Sonicare.  Once the battery decides not to recharge anymore, there is absolutely NOTHING that you can do!  You have to replace the entire unit.  I am very, very disappointed.  What a SCAM!</li>
            <li> First of all, I am not a dental professional...&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think much about it when my wife told me that she wanted a new toothbrush for Christmas...but I took notice when I found out how much the one was that she wanted.  Around [price] for a toothbrush seemed a bit excessive to me at first!  But we went ahead and got one anyway.  My wife is a dental hygienist, and the dentist she works for highly recommends this product (and he rarely if ever recommends dental products!).  As it turned out, we received a second toothbrush from my folks at Christmas, so we are the proud owners of two Sonicare toothbrushes. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been reserving judgement on this product until I&#x27;ve had a good chance to see how I like it.  After a month of regular use I&#x27;ve got to say that it&#x27;s GREAT!  The internal timer is a good idea.  It helps you to pace your tooth brushing, making sure that you spend enough time to insure adequate cleaning.  Though one 2-minute cycle is long enough for a good brushing, I often brush for two of those cycles.  I sometimes use the brush without toothpaste and sit and read while I brush for two or three cycles.  The sonic cleaning really does a great job!  When I&#x27;m done my teeth feel clean and smooth, as good or better than after I get done with a professional cleaning.  &lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that my gums feel like they are in better shape than they used to be, and my teeth are cleaner on a regular basis.  &lt;br /&gt;After a full month of using a Sonicare brush I give it two thumbs up.  Our children (ages 6, 8, 10) use it as well, and they enjoy it too.&lt;br /&gt;The brush handle contains a rechargable battery, and the brushes are available in different sizes.  I like the compact head better than the larger head.  The handle takes a little getting used to, since it is much larger than a standard toothbrush&#x27;s handle.  It also takes a few brushings to get used to the rapid vibrations in your mouth -- it can really tickle -- and I imagine that if you have sensitive gumsthat it could cause some mild painat first, but will certainly firm up the gums and help their condition improve in good order.  It really made my saliva run the first few times I used it, but that&#x27;s not a problem now.  Another thing that takes a little getting used to is the fact that you don&#x27;t have to supply the muscle power to do the brushing.  All you have to do is to hold the brush head gently against the teeth and the handle does the rest.  &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d say that Sonicare&#x27;s brush is the best oral hygeine product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Definitely in the 5-star category!&lt;br /&gt;Brush on!  &lt;br /&gt;Alan Holyoak</li>
            <li> Sonicare quickly became the #1 player in the electric toothbrush industry, due to its incredible technology. It was, and still is, the only brand to consider. I&#x27;m not going to go on and on about its features -- you can read that in the other reviews. But let me just say that I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare for a couple of years, and I would never consider anything else. I have yet to find a single flaw or downside to the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this toothbrush.  Checkups have been great and teeth feel cleaner and whiter.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have had a sonicare toothbrush for two years.  I like how it cleans and enjoy using it.  I am presently on my third handle.  Cracks keep appearing in the handles or part where the brush is screwed on.  Sonicare has replaced them but tell me that they will no longer do this because I use baking soda or peroxide toothpaste.  They claim paste with these ingredients cause the material to crack.  You might want to be aware of this before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare&#x27;s toothbrush now for a couple of years and it is great. It gives you a feeling of a clean mouth that you can&#x27;t get anywhere else. In fact, it fees as if you&#x27;ve just had your teeth cleaned professionally in a way. The only drawback as other have suggested is the fact that the battery is not replaceable, which means you&#x27;ll have to purchase another one when your current one goes out. I&#x27;m not really complaining because my dentist visits have been great since I&#x27;ve been using it. I have a bridge and it has never given me any problems. I&#x27;d highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this! The handle is cracking in 4 places and I&#x27;ve only had it a week! It works great, but I&#x27;m astonished that no one tested this plastic under the conditions that someone would actually used it. I am VERY disappointed. I have talked to others and gues what! Cracks started forming on their 100 dolloar toothbrushes also! At this price, this appliance should be a lot more strudy.</li>
            <li> I bought a similar model of Sonicare toothbrush about four years ago and I still marvel at how well it works. Honestly, when the price comes down everyone will own one of these.&lt;br /&gt;I never used to enjoy brushing and I never used to brush my teeth as much as they needed it. I was just too lazy. My teeth were a little discolored and my gums were consistently a little puffy around the tooth. Then I bought a Sonicare toothbrush with the interval timer and now I&#x27;ll never switch back to a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;After the first few brushings my teeth were noticably whiter and after a few months I noticed the puffiness in my gums was gone.&lt;br /&gt;At 30,000 strokes per minute it&#x27;s like brushing hundreds of times with a manual brush. But all you have to do is \\&quot;aim the brush\\&quot; while it glides back and forth across your teeth. It feels like a vibrator in your hand. The timer pulses every thirty seconds to prompt you to switch from front to back of teeth and from top to bottom. After two minutes it shuts itself off after what is supposedly the ideal length of brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;You can also take this brush with you when traveling as it works for more than a week without recharging.&lt;br /&gt;Could it have any downsides?&lt;br /&gt;Although I consider it easily worth every penny, the upfront cost is staggering compared to a manual toothbrush. It also requires a replacement brush head approximately every six months at about $15 each. But this is a sophisticated unit and is more like a medical device than a disposable supply item. The only thing these two have in common is the brushes on the end and I&#x27;m sure the Sonicare&#x27;s brushes are higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note that the brush head will slowly wear out without any visible sign of wear. The performance gradually degrades until the unit seems nonfunctional. I know because I tried to save money by not replacing the brush heads according to schedule. I thought the battery had gone bad and I called customer service for advice.  It turns out that the brush head was way overdue for replacement.  Fortunately all the moving and wearable parts (including brush, magnets and metal connecting parts) are in the brush head and when they are replaced performance is restored to like-new again.&lt;br /&gt;The first time you use this product it may make your teeth sensitive for a few days (because of the vibration) and while its permanent and rechargeable battery will last through most trips it is physically larger and takes slightly more space to pack than a manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have never had to share the brush with anyone so I never had to switch brush heads on a daily basis. This seems to me like it would be an enormous hassle as you have to unthread and detach the head each time. While this is possible, I would probably buy two units instead if the finances allowed.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you think you might like it and you can afford it, then go ahead and get one. They last a long time...It turns out that the brush head was way overdue for replacement.

            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an electric toothbrush and I was somewhat reluctant, but after trying the Sonicare I am amazed at how clean my teeth feel!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have had the brush for less than a year. It has developed cracks around the on&#x27;off button and is no longer usable.  &lt;br /&gt;It does an excellent job of cleaning your teeth but the brush should last longer than one year.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  It cleans the teeth perfectly.  There is one slight drawback though.  It sometimes has a tendency to bore a hole through the back of your head.  This, plus the obligatory heachache you&#x27;ll get using it, which is, of course, unfortunate because your now beautiful smile will be replaced by a frown.  Apart from that it&#x27;s great all around.&lt;BR&gt;Oh yes, there is one other negative:&lt;BR&gt;It&#x27;s cost could probably buy you a very small third world country with an entire population of &amp;quot;teeth brushers&amp;quot; to serve you for the rest of your life.  But...it&#x27;s your choice.  Anyway, enjoy it, especially if you have a neckbrace or public heath facility near by!</li>
            <li> The gold standard of all power tooth brushes, no question about it.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  In 7 days of using the Sonicare, my teeth are whiter and feel cleaner then they have ever been.&lt;br /&gt;I would not trade this toothbrush for the world.  &lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Fall 2001 Dental Visit, before Sonicare:  My dental hygienist gave me the plaque lecture about how I need to brush better.  My gums bled a little. :-(&lt;br /&gt;Spring 2002 Dental Visit, after using Sonicare for 5 months:  My hygienist complimented me on the great job I&#x27;m doing.  No plaque nor bleeding gums. :-)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m achieving much better results with the Sonicare than with manual brushing, for 2 reasons:  First, there&#x27;s no way I come close to 31,000 brush strokes per minute by hand.  Second, I rarely brushed for 2 full minutes with a manual toothbrush.  I like the 30 second timer beep feature for each quadrant of the mouth, and brush them in this order:  upper outer surface, lower outer, bottom teeth chewing surface + inside, upper teeth chewing surface + inside.  Then I go in for overtime and brush my upper and lower gums.  When I&#x27;m done, I hold the brush bristle side down and push the on button to wisk off the water.  Every time I use the Sonicare, my teeth and gums feel professionally cleaned.  Plus it&#x27;s fun to use and I like the fact it has a plastic cover for the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I took the Sonicare on vacation for a week, and it held its charge just fine.&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is that the battery is not replaceable, forcing people to replace their Sonicare after several years and filling up the landfills with more toothbrushes than necessary.  I grumble about the cost of new brush heads, but this toothbrush is so good, it&#x27;s well worth the cost.  BTW, it&#x27;s important to regularly unscrew the toothbrush head and rinse off toothpaste that&#x27;s accumulated between the nut and the head, as recommended in the instructions.   &lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I have 6 friends who also have a Sonicare.  I asked each one how they liked their toothbrush, and they all raved about it and the excellent results they&#x27;re experiencing.</li>
            <li> This brush may be great...but it won&#x27;t last long...Like other reviewers I got the BLACK MOLD....it is disgusting.  I guess the problem is that the water gets into all the places and cracks in the frame.  This cannot be healthy.  It is the black mold like all the homeowners got in their homes and ended up having to move away.  Not a good thing on a toothbrush.  While it doesn&#x27;t touch your mouth...I don&#x27;t think you want that stuff near you...much less your face.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for years. I have had great dental visit reports because of using the brush twice a day and flossing once. I have recommended the brush to strangers in the dentists office who are being told to use one by the hygenist or dentist and hope they have joined the band wagon. My neighbor had consistently bad dental visits, so I convinced her to buy one. She just never \\&quot;got around to using it\\&quot; and had a very negative dental visit. I was puzzled why, when she confessed she just hadn&#x27;t wanted to make the effort to get used to it. After realizing that she had to choose between having serious gingivitis or using the toothbrush she opted for the toothbrush and loves it now. Her next visit was much improved and the latest was great. I can&#x27;t stress how much confidence I have in the benefits from using this toothbrush.     I only have one problem: black mold. After going thru a year of severe allergy symptoms all summer, then having severe eye allergy symptoms this winter, and now another eye problem just one week after after tackling the first issue I was feeling beaten down by my health issues. Today when cleaning the bathroom I noticed something black on the side and handle of the toothbrush. I know I have been sick, but I didn&#x27;t think I had let any of my chores get this out of hand. It was black mold inside and pouring out of the brush. I had changed the handle about a month ago and saw no problems.  I have noticed what I&#x27;d call crud or slime around the threads and into the base of the brush when I&#x27;d change the head or wipe the brush down.     I am terrified that my whole house is contaminated with black mold. And will be hiring a cleaning crew to help clean the house top to bottom. Pull the carpeting and wash the walls then have the ducts cleaned and get a whole house air cleaner. Black mold is toxic and can cause serious problems. I hope I am not too late in my clean-up efforts.     I am nervous about getting another Sonicare toothbrush andwish the company would step up to the plate and accept more responsibility for such an expensive appliance. The plastic could be antibacterial, the instructions to dry it out completely between uses should be more emphatically written.     Finally Sonicare should make every effort to eliminate black mold as a problem for their product. It is like the auto industry not acknowledging that they is a potentially life threatening problem with their autos. Sonicare could and should be more responsible in warning about this potenially serious health threat due to - in their thoughts - improper or inadequate customer/owner maintenance.</li>
            <li> I had a previous soni-care like this that I really liked.  When it quit working after a number of years  I wanted a replacement and I found one.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I&#x27;m not sure if I can name the other brands but I&#x27;ve used the popular names.  I like this one for a few reasons.  (1) It was recommended by my dentist who said it was safe for dental work.  (2) It works very well.  Cleans you teeth as well as an office visit.  (3) You can use any tooth paste.  One of my previous electric toothbrushes I had to use their paste.  I did not and damaged the gears in the hand unit.  (4) It cleans your teeth very well (had to say it again).  I am amazed at how well this product works.  Remember when you are considering purchasing this product that Sonicare recommends changing the brush heads every 6 months so there is an addition cost involved.  I suggest the PL-4 since you get 3 brush heads.</li>
            <li> I never do anything like this...But the Sonicare Toothbrush is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done for myself. Within two weeks of using it my smile was whiter, my gums felt incredible and I CAN&#x27;T wait to brush. I used to only brush once maybe twice a day and now it&#x27;s a minimum of three times a day. My Dentist said that it was the best my gums and plaque problems (or lack of!) have ever looked! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and would NEVER switch to anything else. Do yourself a favor and try the Sonicare toothbrush out. You&#x27;ll be glad you did!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush! Being a big coffee drinker, I had started to get unsightly brown spots in between my teeth. It took only one use of this toothbrush for those spots to disappear. Amazing! My mouth feels so clean after each use; as though I had just come from the dentist&#x27;s office. My manual brush could not achieve those results. This is easy to use and to care for. I am very pleased with my purchase......the price may be high but it is well worth the investment. I like the 30 second timer function that reminds me when to move on to another section of my mouth. Believe me, brushing with this unit is so enjoyable, it is easy to lose track of the time.</li>
            <li> I received the Sonicare for Christmas and can&#x27;t imagine ever using a regular toothbrush again. In two minutes my teeth are super clean and my mouth feels great. I find the 30-second beep that lets you know when to move along from top inner/outer to bottom inner/outer to be quite useful. It also lets you know when it needs to be recharged at the end of your brushing session. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second Sonicare. About six years ago, a periodonist recommended Sonicare while she was performing surgery to restore my gums. Her prescription proved to be right on target. Use of the Sonicare stopped incipient gum disease dead in its tracks. Also, I&#x27;d long been frustrated by an inability to avoid plaque buildup, despite brushing carefully and flossing nightly. My general dentist&#x27;s staff noticed a significant improvement in oral hygiene shortly after I started using the Sonicare unit. Sonicare makes the task easier, and the results are vastly better. The business about better checkups wasn&#x27;t hype. In short, Sonicare has saved me a great deal of expense, time, and discomfort in dental work.</li>
            <li> After reading all the wonderful reviews, I just had to get one and try it out for myself.  Let me tell you, my teeth has never felt so refreshingly clean in my whole lifetime, maybe even better than the dentist!  I must admit, I hate brushing my teeth.  The max amount of time I used to spend brushing my teeth before was 30 seconds.  Now, with the sonicare, I do it for 4 minutes (that&#x27;s two cycles)!  This toothbrush is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I bought this particular toothbrush back in March, 2002, and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier.  My teeth have never felt cleaner, nor have they looked any whiter.  The bristles move fast, but they&#x27;re not vicious and hurt your gums like some others out there tend to do.&lt;br /&gt;It took a little getting used to, but that&#x27;s the nice thing about the \\&quot;ramp up\\&quot; feature of the brush.  It goes easy on you for the first few brushings and then it finally works at full capacity.&lt;br /&gt;The only real drawback I see in this brush is the \\&quot;Battery Low\\&quot; indicator tends to come on a little premature.  But other than that I have nothing to really complain about.  The battery life is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been on week-long trips and never even worry about running out of battery once I fully charge it.  This toothbrush, although expensive, will most likely give you the cleanest mouth you could ever have.</li>
            <li> I purchased this tooth brush about five years or more ago. I have used it continually with the exception of a few in between spurts of just not using it.  Like vacation, moving, etc.   My dentist always ask me what do I do to keep my teeth so free of plaque.  I explained it was my Sonic tooth brush.  She complimented me at every six month visit.  I moved across country and my tooth brush was packed and I use the manual for a while and before long I began to feel pain and bleeding on one side around the gum line on my back teeth.  I found my sonic, charged it and in about a week my teeth and gums were back to normal.  My teeth feel very smooth and clean, somewhat like they feel after the dentist cleans them and they feel cleaner longer after brushing than with a manual tooth brush.   I would recommend that anyone that cares about their teeth to sacrafice and purchase the Sonic Tooth brush.  They want be sorry.  I certainly am not.  Mine has lasted for over five years without any problems.  If this one wear out I certainly hope Sonic stay in business so I can re-buy.....</li>
            <li> The Sonicare toothbrush is really a breakthrough. I&#x27;ve had mine for almost a year (on the advice of my dentist as well as other Sonicare owners), and it works extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this device make brushing my teeth quicker and more relaxing, but they simply get cleaner. More important, my dentist says the health of my gums (leading cause of tooth loss) is extremely good since I started using the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;The feature where it beeps every 30 seconds is pretty useless, and the auto-off after 2 minutes is downright annoying (I like to brush for 3-4 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;The brush can run for a week between recharges, and the charging stand is small and attractive. The whole thing is easy to keep clean, quite well designed.&lt;br /&gt;One caution: you need to replace the brush head every 6 months.... However, it&#x27;s worth it for better dental and gum health.</li>
            <li> I have had extensive work done in my mouth, but gums are by far the worst. Medication that I must take makes my gums puffy and red. I bought this toothbrush with the thought that I might as well give it a try.(I had already tried a water pik - but it didn&#x27;t work.) After 2 weeks, my gums were like new. The redness and puffiness were gone. If you have gingivitis, definitly give this toothbrush a try.</li>
            <li> After years of brushing too hard and using softer toothbrushes, my dentist recommended &amp;quot;any electronic toothbrush&amp;quot; to facilitate better cleaning without gum recession. I noticed a big improvement with this device over an ordinary toothbrush. &lt;BR&gt;   My only problem was that the plastic cracked on the handle after a short time. I was told by customer service that this maybe due to the type of toothpaste I was using and that I shouldn&#x27;t use a baking soda and peroxide type toothpaste, which my dentist had recommended.This happened again when I was sent a replacement handle. The concept of an electronic toothbrush is a good one but better materials are needed on this one.</li>
            <li> This is the first electronic toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, and let me tell you, the first time I used it, it was definitely a wierd feeling; almost like the feeling you get when you get your teeth cleaned from the dentist (my tongue constantly runs over my teeth, just like after I get my teeth professionaly cleaned).  A close friend of mine is a Dental Hygenist and she recommended this to me.  She uses it, because \\&quot;it&#x27;s the closest thing to having your teeth professionaly cleaned\\&quot;.  The key thing behind this is the amount of brush strokes; the force you feel doesn&#x27;t matter, but the repetition is what does the job. \\&quot;I use mentadent toothpaste, and don&#x27;t want to change\\&quot;, was the first thing I said before I got this.  I have 2 bridges in my mouth, and was told that this is 100% safe and recommended for all people with dental work done.  (...), everyone in the family can use it; just get them each their own head.  Also, listen to recommendation about changing the head every 6 months, a worn head just isn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li> I really like this!  It seems to be very thorough... leaves your teeth feeling smooth and seems to get the hard-to-reach places in the back very well.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The vibration will drive you crazy at first, especially on the roof of your mouth, but just fight through it.  In less than one week it will feel completely natural.  A light touch helps, and also gives more effective cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Although you can switch brush heads so more than one person can use the base, it gets tiring to do this multiple times a day, in different bathrooms, etc.  The benefits are so good we bought one for each member of the family.  Look at it this way, it&#x27;s cheaper than a new filling...&lt;br /&gt;I reserved one star because the batteries are not replaceable.  Here&#x27;s how to make them last:  The worst thing you can do to Nickle-Cadnium (rechargeable) batteries is overcharge them.  So don&#x27;t leave the base plugged in all the time.  Just charge it overnight once a week.  &lt;br /&gt;The replacement brush heads cost more than a regular toothbrush, but seem to last long enough.&lt;br /&gt;As opposed to manual brushing, with the sonicare I actually find myself brushing for the full recommended two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The sonicare was recommended to my by my dentist after I started developing some deep pockets in my gums.  After about 2 months use, the pockets were significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> I have bad teeth, due to a flouride-less childhood.  I brush and I floss everyday, but it seemed like every three month I am back to my dentist&#x27;s office for another filling or crown!  I have tried every kind of toothbrushes -- manual and electric -- to no avail, until I tried this Sonicare.  It took a few days not so much to get used to the sonic vibrations in my mouth, but rather to learn to angle the toothbrush so only the bristles touch my teeth and gum.  And what a difference this toothbrush makes!  I could feel how much cleaner my teeth after the first time I used it.  It literally felt like I just had a dental cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office.  Moreover, my last visit to my dentist was the first time in years that a regular checkup did not end up in another filling or worse.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was almost abt to finish the transaction for buying this, but luckily, i saw a negative feedback posted by someone else, in this website, so i decided not to buy it.Thanks a lot man</li>
            <li> somebody wrote about their toothbrush cracking after four days. this has happened to one of my friends. one of the reasons the toothbrush cracks is because the owner uses toothpaste with too much hydrogen peroxide. have you dropped it, maybe? i&#x27;ve had mine for two years and it still works great. not one problem with cracking OR dead batteries...and the toothpaste i use even has hydrogen peroxide in it. the only complaint i have about my sonicare is the disappointment of when it needs to be recharged - and while i&#x27;m waiting i must use a NORMAL toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is well worth the money.  It feels strange at first but you&#x27;ll be amazed at how clean your teeth are and how healthy your gums look after a few uses.  &lt;br /&gt;I struggled to get my husband to brush his teeth more than once a day--I was concerned about the health of his gums.  Since purchasing this toothbrush he uses it 2-3 times a day.  You always know that you&#x27;re brushing for the recommended time, that you&#x27;re removing plaque, and you&#x27;re not brushing too hard and damaging enamel.  The super-clean feeling in your mouth encourages you to brush frequently.&lt;br /&gt;Our teeth are whiter through the use of this brush alone--no bleach or &amp;quot;whitening&amp;quot; toothpaste needed.  Bad breath is no longer a problem, either, now that our gums are healthier.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the unit has a sleek, modern design that looks good in the bathroom.  The brush heads have a ventilated, plastic cover to protect them from dust, etc. &lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy this for everyone in my family next Christmas.  It&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> This Sonicare Advance 4700 is still available here on Amazon at a reasonable price in another listing! here is the link&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00008BFXI Philips Sonicare Advance 4700 Power Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used my Sonicare toothbrush in about a year - I switched back to manual because I was unhappy with the effectiveness of the Sonicare.  About a month ago, I decided to give it another chance, but the battery is now ruined.  I followed Sonicare&#x27;s instructions and left the unit in the charger, even though I was a bit skeptical of that strategy.  I trusted Sonicare&#x27;s engineers to have designed the unit properly, such that it won&#x27;t over-charge and destroy the batteries, but I guess the joke is on me.  The battery pack is considered non-replaceable, and that is simply unacceptable in my opinion.  To throw away a $100+ toothbrush because the $8 battery won&#x27;t hold a charge is absurd. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a nerdy do-it-yourselfer, so I cracked open the case to access the batteries.  I&#x27;ve considered replacing them, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll even bother, since the toothbrush&#x27;s cleaning action was sub-par.  And if I do replace the batteries myself, it will be tricky re-sealing the case to prevent water damage without making future battery replacement even more difficult. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For a per-unit cost of an extra dollar or two, Sonicare could have screwed the two halves of the base unit together, rather than fusing the plastic.  Doing so would have made battery replacement simple.  It also would be much more environmentally-friendly, as the nickel-cadmium batteries in the Sonicare are extremely toxic.  Even Sonicare, on its website, cautions not to dispose of the toothbrush in a landfill.  They will recycle their product for free (oh, gee - that&#x27;s big of them!), and for those of us who want to recycle it ourselves, they give instructions to crack open the case with a screwdriver and remove the batteries. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people love the Sonicare toothbrush, but I would like to know how many of them are still happy with it after the 18- to 24-month mark.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the Sonicare is just a really expensive disposable toothbrush.  And I say to theengineers who designed the Sonicare with irreplaceable batteries: shame on you!</li>
