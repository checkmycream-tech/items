            <li>Smells amazing and leaves me soft.</li>
            <li>Still a &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; overall hazard rating but not as good as I&#x27;d thought.  </li>
            <li>This body wash is so nice, it smells wonderful and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but good all year long!</li>
            <li>My favorite body wash by far!</li>
            <li>Smells really nice and is very soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SOOOOO FRESH</li>
            <li>In my original review I said the Environmental Working Group (EWG.org) gave this body wash its best rating, but I was either wrong or</li>
            <li>I use other organic products when taking a break from this one, and nothing as good.</li>
            <li>I bought other Nubian Heritage products because I loved this body wash so much.</li>
            <li>While using them, they have all lathered pretty well.</li>
            <li>All natural which is important to me.</li>
            <li>It is nice and thick with a good, strong smell and lathers beautifully on an ordinary washcloth.</li>
            <li>I still like it, it smells great, and doesn&#x27;t have most of questionable ingredients that so many other washes do, no carcinogens or development and reproductive toxins according to EWG.</li>
            <li>Great smell but not too heavy for a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>It leaves you feeling soft and clean, too.</li>
            <li>i use H&amp;S extra strength to keep my skin clear, and this to keep it soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all dry and itchy, like many of the name brands</li>
            <li>This Nubian Coconut Papaya body wash goes for over $11 at the Whole Foods store I shop at from time to time.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>The body wash lasts so much longer than the bars (no brainer).  </li>
            <li>After using them, they have a pleasant and subtle after smell on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is RICH and moisturizing, made with basic ingredients by an honorable company.  </li>
            <li>It definitely has a bubblegum or overly sweet scent to it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It arrived earlier than expected and smells really good--much better than the bar version.  </li>
            <li>Product is NOT watered down, and a little goes a long way, with a fantastic and pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>There was a little spilled out of the container when I received it, but I would order it again, it&#x27;s worth the price!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few of them at this point and each one has it&#x27;s own specific smell and purpose as stated on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin while I am having chemo.</li>
            <li>and, it will make your skin incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>IT FEELS SOFT .</li>
            <li>It leaves my body feeling clear and soft, does not strip my body</li>
            <li>Its creamy and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing and long lasting but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This product has a different scent than other brands I currently have this body wash in my personal top ten soap list.</li>
            <li>your skin will look and feel extra soft.  </li>
            <li>This is definetly one of the few products that is really worth buying if you are in the market for it</li>
            <li>IT DOES NOT DRY MY SKIN.  </li>

            <li> IT DOES NOT DRY MY SKIN.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thick and luxurious, too!</li>
            <li> I have dry and oily skin and occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go back to using my other body wash.  </li>
            <li> This body wash will last quite a wile since you only need a little.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> and this body wash doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Only need a little to get job done.</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I expected.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this has been sitting down for a while, it smells off.</li>
            <li> No more dry flaky skin nor a filmy residue left behind by other moisturizing body washes.</li>
            <li> I wished it had a little stronger scent.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that, in spite of the smell, the moisturizing it promised would make up for the smell, but it actually dried out my skin...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m spending a couple $&#x27;s less!</li>
            <li> I keep succumbing to a these body washe descriptions that sound so yummy &amp; as always, I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My suggestion to the manufacturer is to provide a pump with it since the lotion is so thick.</li>
            <li> However, The smell is terrible, and I literally gagged because of the odor the first couple of times I used it.  </li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t cloying or fake.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Nuria Heritage products.  </li>

            <li> IS A GOOD VALUE A.  A TINY BIT MAKES LOTS OF LATHER.  COULD HAVE A BIT MORE SCENT TO IT.  IT DOES NOT DRY MY SKIN.  IT FEELS SOFT . RINSES  OFF EASY.  I WOULD BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Not as moisturizing as I expected. Smells good cleans good.</li>
            <li> Very nice, pricey but nice</li>
            <li> this stuff smells like a trip to a tropical island. and, it will make your skin incredibly soft! highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash by far! The scent is amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is just soooooo great!</li>
            <li> Very rich and creamy! Smells great, too. I also use this body wash as a shampoo. My hair loves it!!!! Will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Smells great and spreads nicely. Washes very clean. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice and is very soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing the way it makes your skin feel. Worth every penny. Don&#x27;t care for the smell of it. But it is a great body wash.</li>
            <li> This is the best smell ever for a body wash, I will continue to purchase this item every time I run out!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Nubian Heritage. Every one of their body washes smell great when using in the shower. I&#x27;ve used quite a few of them at this point and each one has it&#x27;s own specific smell and purpose as stated on the bottle. For example, some are hydrating, others are aching fighting, and then combinations of various traits. While using them, they have all lathered pretty well. After using them, they have a pleasant and subtle after smell on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has a very sweet coconut smell as one would assume.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and makes my skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have the Coconut and Papaya body wash and I swear, this is the best smelling body wash, no wait, best smelling soap product ever. It smells like coconut and papaya but it isn&#x27;t cloying or fake. I have really dry skin and this body wash doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all. This product just makes me very happy.</li>
            <li> Straightforward ingredients, delicious smell. Love this body wash.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing but the smell is offputing. It definitely has a bubblegum or overly sweet scent to it.</li>
            <li> All of their products are great. I use other organic products when taking a break from this one, and nothing as good. Worth the price. Good for sensitive types.</li>
            <li> This Nubian Coconut Papaya body wash goes for over $11 at the Whole Foods store I shop at from time to time. I really only go there for this. So, to find it on amazon actually is nice. Since it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item, I just need to wait til I&#x27;m buying more than $25 worth of amazon products that I would be buying anyway. So, it works out and I&#x27;m spending a couple $&#x27;s less!</li>
            <li> Silky smooth soap scrumptious smell great with lotion you must add them both to your collection I would buy again</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this body wash. However, The smell is terrible, and I literally gagged because of the odor the first couple of times I used it.  I was hoping that, in spite of the smell, the moisturizing it promised would make up for the smell, but it actually dried out my skin...I&#x27;m very disappointed...</li>
            <li> Love this body wash&lt;br /&gt;Fragrant clean&lt;br /&gt;Masculine and feminine</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for me!  Lathers nicely, wholesome ingredients, makes my skin feel smooth and silky.  Product is NOT watered down, and a little goes a long way, with a fantastic and pleasant fragrance.  Quality product. This will be a staple at my house!</li>
            <li> It leaves my body feeling clear and soft, does not strip my body oils!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Wish it had a pump in it o make it easier for me!</li>
            <li> Lathers very nicely and has a good,soft,long lasting scent. I&#x27;m satisfied and will be ordering more in the future for sure.</li>
            <li> After usage, someone else wanted to use it.  Therefore another purchase was made.  This product has a different scent than other brands I currently have this body wash in my personal top ten soap list.</li>
            <li> The body wash smells wonderful and leaves your skin feeling like silk!  I love all their products.I give them as gifts</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leaves me soft. i use H&amp;S extra strength to keep my skin clear, and this to keep it soft and smelling good. perfect combination.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected and smells really good--much better than the bar version.  We haven&#x27;t used it yet though, but hopefully it work as great as it smells.</li>
            <li> This company makes products that I can actually use on my eczema prone skin.  The smell and texture of this is great.  It is nice and thick with a good, strong smell and lathers beautifully on an ordinary washcloth.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says -- I LOVE LOVE LOVE how this body wash smells. It leaves you feeling soft and clean, too. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves the smell of papaya with a hint of coconut. Yum!</li>
            <li> I keep succumbing to a these body washe descriptions that sound so yummy &amp; as always, I am very disappointed. This one has a &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; coconut smell. As for &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; the skin?? Really? A body wash? Come now. Back to my good ol&#x27; Nutribiotic shower gel!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and I am completely satisfied with the results!</li>
            <li> Makes skin smoothe. Great smell! Only need a little to get job done. Great for acne and natural product goers. I have dry and oily skin and occasional breakouts. I look and feel better with this soap. I use in hair sometimes too. You will like it too!</li>
            <li> Best body wash for the whole family, gives our skin a healthy glow, radiant shine and moisturized. Also makes a great lather for shaving.</li>
            <li> Great service! A++++++++++++</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a very good body wash. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all dry and itchy, like many of the name brands</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!! IT&#x27;S SOOOOO FRESH</li>
            <li> This body wash, besides having a very pleasant scent, it leaves your skin feeling very soft.  No more dry flaky skin nor a filmy residue left behind by other moisturizing body washes.</li>
            <li> this is a fine product and we will order it again. It arrived on time and as expected. We love it!</li>
            <li> This is RICH and moisturizing, made with basic ingredients by an honorable company.  I can&#x27;t go back to using my other body wash.  The scent is amazing and long lasting but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this I feel like I&#x27;m back in Hawaii. It&#x27;s super thick and luxurious, too!</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash!</li>
            <li> I liked the smell good, but does not cause dryness of the skin but I want moisturizing liquid soap</li>
            <li> Very good product that really works...This body wash will last quite a wile since you only need a little. This is definetly one of the few products that is really worth buying if you are in the market for it go make your purchase and the Prime Free shipping is exelent you simply can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Its creamy and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is the best body wash I ever used. There might be other body wash products that smell great, but this one is not just smelling amazing but all the ingredients are natural and do wonderful things to my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and will use it for many more to come. Thank you Nubian Heritage for creating such a healthy and wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I wished it had a little stronger scent.</li>
            <li> this is the best lotion i/ve ever used by far. My suggestion to the manufacturer is to provide a pump with it since the lotion is so thick.</li>
            <li> smells great and lathers up! No residue! Loved it</li>
            <li> Smells really good and leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Nuria Heritage products.  Just pick your favorite flavor!</li>
            <li> Great Product. All natural which is important to me. Feels great and smells great in the shower!</li>
            <li> Maybe this has been sitting down for a while, it smells off.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best company for soap and body wash.  The body wash lasts so much longer than the bars (no brainer).  Match with a simple lufa and your skin will look and feel extra soft.  I get compliments all the time!</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly! I bought other Nubian Heritage products because I loved this body wash so much.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash, its my go to for the winter months but good all year long!</li>
            <li> Great smell but not too heavy for a sensitive nose. Susdy and moisturizing. Great ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have very sensitive skin while I am having chemo. This product is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This is the best body wash I have EVER used.  It leaves my skin smooth and soft and smelling great!  The price is outstanding, I&#x27;m buying more, just incase the price goes up.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.  I love!</li>
            <li> This body wash is so nice, it smells wonderful and a little bit goes a long way. There was a little spilled out of the container when I received it, but I would order it again, it&#x27;s worth the price!!</li>
            <li> CORRECTION:  In my original review I said the Environmental Working Group (EWG.org) gave this body wash its best rating, but I was either wrong or the rating has been changed.  They now give it a rating of 3.  Still a &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; overall hazard rating but not as good as I&#x27;d thought.  I&#x27;ve changed my rating here from 5 stars to 4.  I still like it, it smells great, and doesn&#x27;t have most of questionable ingredients that so many other washes do, no carcinogens or development and reproductive toxins according to EWG.</li>
