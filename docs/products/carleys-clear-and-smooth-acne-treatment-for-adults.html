    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Awesome scrub and soap!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a perfect scrub.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s awesome about Carley&#x27;s is you always get a handful of great samples with every purchase included in your shipment.  </li>
            <li>and it does a great job clearing my skin.</li>
            <li>In our case though, it worked great.  </li>
            <li>in all, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I found it very effective  </li>
            <li>Great product, good price, and it works.</li>
            <li>One of the best acne products available for those who have literally tried everything.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I choose this treatment because my dauchter and my son have used it for quite some time and they loved it.  </li>
            <li>Although the instructions say to rewash with the soap I rarely used to do so and still saw excellent results, but I would recommend doing so in the summer though as body heat causes the skin to give off the smell of the scrub.  </li>
            <li>Very light and works amazingly!</li>
            <li>Love that!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I may not have perfect skin, but i have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin, which I am very grateful</li>
            <li>Liked it.</li>
            <li>And just a side note: Their soap is by far the BEST bar soap ever!  </li>
            <li>Their natural soap is wonderful too!</li>
            <li>I will say, it is very important to follow the instructions with this product and keep it on your face for 30-60 seconds while cleansing, AND rinse well.</li>
            <li>It has taken away most of my sons acne that was all over his face.</li>
            <li>We love it and will keep ordering it.</li>
            <li>It is really a phenomenal product.</li>
            <li>I love the oils used; they are moisturizing and soothing after the Benzoyl Peroxide works its magic.</li>
            <li>Works better than any product on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for my Rosacea and it works as well as or better than the prescription clyndomicin that I used for 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product on eBay, but I have been so pleased with the resultsi</li>
            <li>I went on the pill and it got better</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li>Like almost all acne stories I&#x27;ve read, I too have tried many, many products trying to find what works.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for almost 6 months and my skin has never felt better.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve re-ordered it and am now trying more of their products.  </li>
            <li>I love working with this company.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better and at some point I may switch to the Tea Tree formula</li>
            <li>I had to take the time to write you about this product, I &#x27;ve had such wonderful results from using it.</li>
            <li>Also tried many off the shelf scrubs.  </li>
            <li>The best part, aside that it works, is how simple it is.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, my skin started to clear up right away and now is the best it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li>Carley&#x27;s acne wash does a great job of making my face feel clean and fresh without breaking me out even more (like some face washes do).</li>
            <li>try to give them a good review wherever I see it sold because I believe in this product so much!</li>
            <li>I love that you get free samples when you purchase.</li>
            <li>all of the ingredients in this bottle and my favorite part is that all of Carley&#x27;s products are cruelty free- never tested on animals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They also send you little samples of products, like day and night moisturizers, bar soap (which is also awesome) and lip balm (which is OK).  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and done in the shower.</li>
            <li>also noticed that the redness faded very quickly from the spots I picked at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hands down one of the best product combos I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>They are ground so finely and leave your skin silky</li>
            <li>and it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>(I noticed in reviews on various sites) because of the walnut shells, but they are a great exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>(Iknow I sound like an infomercial</li>
            <li>help smooth it out.</li>
            <li>Also, my spots disappear a lot faster when using this wash; I may pick at them, but one wash and the redness is primarily gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, (I promise), they send loads of great samples, and I actually bought the daytime and nighttime moisturizers because of the samples they sent.</li>
            <li>Compared to other products that don&#x27;t work as well, the price is incredible.</li>
            <li>this is their original product.  </li>
            <li>Within a week of using this soap/wash/soap on rag combo, my skin felt so clean.</li>
            <li>These folks are always willing to send samples of the products you want to try and it&#x27;s a great idea because I&#x27;m about to make another purchase based on samples they sent me with the last order.  </li>
            <li>Returned the unused portion and got a full refund.</li>
            <li>The shipper also included some acne treatments creams- which I will be purchasing full sizes.  </li>
            <li>but I love this so much</li>
            <li>It really is that gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>It is more vibrant versus dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took around 4 maybe 5 months for my skin to fully clear of dozens of layered scars, but the product was so effective at completely shrinking pimples within around 2 to 4 days that my skin was able to gradually heal.  </li>
            <li>have varied from Clearasil, clean and clear, walmart and kroger brands, and many variations that are &#x27;affordable.&#x27;</li>
            <li>&quot; version with 5% benzoyl peroxide (this wash is 2%, which is generally strong enough for most people).  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping this product worked well as I had read so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Like, squeaky clean, for the first time I can remember.</li>
            <li>Carely&#x27;s is a old favorite from when I had had acne issues as a teenager.</li>
            <li>This is very much worth the money to try it out and it lasts FOREVER.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff - it won&#x27;t clear you up overnight</li>
            <li>I liked that it was natural and gentle -</li>
            <li>Then via my step mom, Mary Kay, which had their own line of the same 3 or 4 step system.  </li>
            <li>I am never disappointed with the product results and always fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>The price, at first, I thought was kind of steep, but it DOES indeed last about 3 months</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel the need, because my skin is soft, and smooth, and has more of the natural coloring.</li>
            <li>I have been using this stuff for more than ten years.</li>
            <li>I have ordered Carley&#x27;s many times, not only for myself but for anybody that mentions they have a problem with acne.  </li>
            <li>Love the extra samples they send along with the soap.</li>
            <li>This is the first Carley&#x27;s product I tried.  </li>
            <li>I researched Carley&#x27;s a lot before I first bought from them-</li>
            <li>I found carley&#x27;s Clear and smooth online.</li>
            <li>but my skin is soft and smooth and</li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;ll ask them for samply in my next order :)</li>
            <li>and it comes with a free, natural soap, that lasts about 1 1/2 months between two people.</li>
            <li>They have a video on their website, that shows you exactly how to use it.</li>
            <li>I would say it is better for moderate acne than mild, because of the relatively high amount of medication in it.</li>
            <li>BTW, you will get a decent size bottle and soap - definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Carley&#x27;s saved my face, and I plan to buy from this company as long as they allow me to. :)</li>
            <li>Carley&#x27;s has certainly helped.  </li>
            <li>and I would certainly recommend it to one and all</li>
            <li>I used this product as directed without other products and often experienced an excessively dry face without improvement of symptoms.</li>
            <li>So I bought it again and within about a week to two weeks, I was completely clear with soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals like regular pet shampoos and it washed out quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and it really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been comfortable going out in public without Foundation on.</li>
            <li>but it really worked for me.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to gently pop and disinfect them which would leave a scar.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first week after using it my acne had been reduced by half, and it just got better from there.</li>
            <li>Their customer service is top notch, unlike some other acne products I&#x27;ve been hearing about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this stuff has been working pretty well.</li>
            <li>I thought now that I am older</li>
            <li>I wish I would of know about this in high school</li>
            <li>I tried proactive around 16 years old and it really helped for awhile.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely do away with spots (zits), but it makes their healing really speedy.</li>
            <li>am actually glad I chose Carleys, because it is not at all harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>but my skin feels clean and no new acnes!  </li>
            <li>The slightly gritty texture in the scrub really aided in gently exfoliating the skin and speeding up the process.  </li>
            <li>For the areas on my face that would get very dry i&#x27;d apply a light amount of the Day-time moisturizer to the outside, and drink plenty of water for the inside.  </li>
            <li>getting compliments on clear skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my fifty&#x27;s and my skin is clear, wish I had found your product sooner.</li>
            <li>Our skin is glowing and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This bottle happened to be for my 13 year old nephew who plays baseball.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne non stop since I was 13 years old.</li>
            <li>and few on my forehead - I have tried numerous things from changing my face towel more frequently to checking my hormone levels and taking antibiotics, to tover the counter products to all these home remedies-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll its natural oils and balance.</li>
            <li>When I left my skin alone (no picking, no over-washing, no other acne products) and just used this once at night my skin felt the difference immediately and started clearing up fast.</li>
            <li>month later, I am still getting an occasional spot, but I am not picking my face as much at all.</li>
            <li>I absolutely think this one bottle will last me for AN ENTIRE YEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back with this version and my face is clear again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only is my acne almost completely gone</li>
            <li>Especially during the summer, my back and shoulders break out and Carley&#x27;s has been keeping my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li>I use the natural soap as an all body wash in the shower then after I do my face and back, apply the scrub for 30 seconds before rinsing.  </li>
            <li>, I have been using the wash for a month, and have made barely a dent in the bottle.</li>
            <li>The best part of this wash is that it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of nasty chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>the first few weeks and almost gave up.</li>
            <li>I first bought this for my little brother ten years ago on EBay.  </li>

            <li> but my skin is soft and smooth and</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;ll ask them for samply in my next order :)</li>
            <li> and it comes with a free, natural soap, that lasts about 1 1/2 months between two people.</li>
            <li> They have a video on their website, that shows you exactly how to use it.</li>
            <li> I would say it is better for moderate acne than mild, because of the relatively high amount of medication in it.</li>
            <li> BTW, you will get a decent size bottle and soap - definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Carley&#x27;s saved my face, and I plan to buy from this company as long as they allow me to. :)</li>
            <li> Carley&#x27;s has certainly helped.  </li>
            <li> and I would certainly recommend it to one and all</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed without other products and often experienced an excessively dry face without improvement of symptoms.</li>
            <li> So I bought it again and within about a week to two weeks, I was completely clear with soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals like regular pet shampoos and it washed out quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and it really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been comfortable going out in public without Foundation on.</li>
            <li> but it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to gently pop and disinfect them which would leave a scar.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first week after using it my acne had been reduced by half, and it just got better from there.</li>
            <li> Their customer service is top notch, unlike some other acne products I&#x27;ve been hearing about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far this stuff has been working pretty well.</li>
            <li> I thought now that I am older</li>
            <li> I wish I would of know about this in high school</li>
            <li> I tried proactive around 16 years old and it really helped for awhile.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely do away with spots (zits), but it makes their healing really speedy.</li>
            <li> am actually glad I chose Carleys, because it is not at all harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> but my skin feels clean and no new acnes!  </li>
            <li> The slightly gritty texture in the scrub really aided in gently exfoliating the skin and speeding up the process.  </li>
            <li> For the areas on my face that would get very dry i&#x27;d apply a light amount of the Day-time moisturizer to the outside, and drink plenty of water for the inside.  </li>
            <li> getting compliments on clear skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my fifty&#x27;s and my skin is clear, wish I had found your product sooner.</li>
            <li> Our skin is glowing and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This bottle happened to be for my 13 year old nephew who plays baseball.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne non stop since I was 13 years old.</li>
            <li> and few on my forehead - I have tried numerous things from changing my face towel more frequently to checking my hormone levels and taking antibiotics, to tover the counter products to all these home remedies-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll its natural oils and balance.</li>
            <li> When I left my skin alone (no picking, no over-washing, no other acne products) and just used this once at night my skin felt the difference immediately and started clearing up fast.</li>
            <li> month later, I am still getting an occasional spot, but I am not picking my face as much at all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely think this one bottle will last me for AN ENTIRE YEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back with this version and my face is clear again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only is my acne almost completely gone</li>
            <li> Especially during the summer, my back and shoulders break out and Carley&#x27;s has been keeping my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li> I use the natural soap as an all body wash in the shower then after I do my face and back, apply the scrub for 30 seconds before rinsing.  </li>
            <li> , I have been using the wash for a month, and have made barely a dent in the bottle.</li>
            <li> The best part of this wash is that it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of nasty chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> the first few weeks and almost gave up.</li>
            <li> I first bought this for my little brother ten years ago on EBay.  </li>
            <li> The rate at which old scars healed vs new ones showed up meant my face was riddled with little dark spots.  </li>
            <li> My skin problems are far less severe now</li>
            <li> If anyone has severe acne, I strongly recommend this product, you want be sorry.</li>
            <li> Like any acne wash, you need to use this for a few weeks to achieve optimal results, and your ace may get worse before it gets better.  </li>
            <li> I was naive back then and thought natural ingredient based products were ineffective compared to big marketed brands</li>
            <li> but the bottle is bigger than expected and some extras were included</li>
            <li> other than that fast shipping and got some little samples of other stuff as well.</li>
            <li> I tried proactive again, but it made my skin flaky dry</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d start to dry out in about 3 days and then rebound.  </li>
            <li> and I still have over half of the bottle left.</li>
            <li> This product really did nothing for my acne, but maybe make it worse.</li>
            <li> It also made my face look rough rather than</li>
            <li> I never had a breakout as a teenager, but in my early 20&#x27;s I started breaking out pretty bad, around my chin, sometimes my forehead, then it started on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I had small bumps all over my forehead, chin, and around the outside of my face.</li>
            <li> St. Ive&#x27;s Apricot Scrub and a couple of other products</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and very hard to treat.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up my blemishes and dark scars.</li>
            <li> As an adult my acne got worse.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been preventing breakouts during &amp;#34;that time of month&amp;#34; but the pimples I do get, seem to be clearing up faster since I&#x27;ve been using this wash and there seems to be less.</li>
            <li> Less itch and cleared up</li>
            <li> smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, and maybe a little TMI here, but I&#x27;ve used Carley&#x27;s on razor burn before; those pesky little bumps.</li>
            <li> After recent stressful events my skin was worse than it&#x27;s ever been</li>
            <li> 34 and few months ago I started to get acne on my cheeks</li>
            <li> I tried this product a few years ago.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a love it or hate it product from what I&#x27;ve read online lately.  </li>
            <li> I found it when I was 25 and had suffered from horrible acne for many years.</li>
            <li> I still get small breakouts now and then, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to before I began using this product.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just not sure if I should.  </li>
            <li> (very few, if any, products can even say that...)</li>
            <li> My guy uses it before he shaves, too, to get the grease and sweat off his beard without having to worry about soap residue in his whiskers that other brands would leave behind (dulling razor blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I decided to go off of the pill and my skin progressively got worse and worse the last 3 years.</li>
            <li> It was not for me at least...</li>
            <li> is the L.L. Bean quality of the cosmetic world (if you&#x27;re from Maine, you know what I mean).</li>
            <li> but seriously haha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get a handful of painful ones at a time in various spots that would never fully heal.  </li>
            <li> but my skin was never great.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic results.</li>
            <li> Desperate for a solution I searched online during my late teens for anything I could find and came across a recommendation in a forum post to a reseller of Carley&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> A bit expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I&#x27;ll explain my skin type: I have never suffered terrible acne, but have always had blackhead issues and 2-5 red spots.</li>
            <li> I would always wear makeup to cover the spots, because I was terrible and picked at them, causing them to be really really red.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked, and I was desperate.</li>
            <li> If this product isn&#x27;t quite cutting it for your acne, they have the \\&quot;Kick Ass\\</li>
            <li> I was desperate to cler my face when stumbled upon this product.</li>
            <li> Well, I was WRONG!</li>
            <li> I used to have really really bad breakouts  </li>
            <li> why, but i am not feeling the urge to pick- my face isn&#x27;t itchy and my spots aren&#x27;t as painful when they do pop up.</li>
            <li> or my face would react badly to the solution sitting on it all day, but there were no problems!</li>
            <li> It helped but had terrible side affects.</li>
            <li> I broke out, my skin looked and felt awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this product as directed without other products and often experienced an excessively dry face without improvement of symptoms.</li>
            <li> One of the best acne products available for those who have literally tried everything.  Been using it for years and it does a great job clearing my skin. B</li>
            <li> It has cleared up my blemishes and dark scars. It has taken away most of my sons acne that was all over his face. Our skin is glowing and feeling soft. We love it and will keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> Carely&#x27;s is a old favorite from when I had had acne issues as a teenager. It is really a phenomenal product. The first week after using it my acne had been reduced by half, and it just got better from there. I still got a pimple now and again, but it finally felt in control. I love the oils used; they are moisturizing and soothing after the Benzoyl Peroxide works its magic. I remember going camping once and I couldn&#x27;t wash all of the product off because the tap didn&#x27;t work. I was sure something would go wrong or my face would react badly to the solution sitting on it all day, but there were no problems! It really is that gentle and effective. My skin problems are far less severe now but I am still tempted to get Carley&#x27;s just in case. I would say it is better for moderate acne than mild, because of the relatively high amount of medication in it. The Benzoyl Peroxide will make the sensitive skin under your eyes puffy temporarily if you rub it all over your face without being careful, so do stay away from your eye area, as with ANY medication. This is very much worth the money to try it out and it lasts FOREVER. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for more than ten years. I found it when I was 25 and had suffered from horrible acne for many years. Nothing worked, and I was desperate. After 3 weeks of using Carley&#x27;s, my acne was gone. It hasn&#x27;t come back. I still get small breakouts now and then, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to before I began using this product. I may not have perfect skin, but i have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin, which I am very grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 2 months ago I tried the Tea Tree Oil version of this and it broke me out, so I must have one of those faces that needs the Benzoyl Peroxide. Returned the unused portion and got a full refund. I&#x27;m back with this version and my face is clear again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also send you little samples of products, like day and night moisturizers, bar soap (which is also awesome) and lip balm (which is OK).  Their customer service is top notch, unlike some other acne products I&#x27;ve been hearing about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to give them a good review wherever I see it sold because I believe in this product so much! And I&#x27;ve never said that about ANYTHING!</li>
            <li> I first bought this for my little brother ten years ago on EBay.  It cleared up his teenage acne that over the counter and prescriptions meds did nothing for.  This seems to be a love it or hate it product from what I&#x27;ve read online lately.  In our case though, it worked great.  And just a side note: Their soap is by far the BEST bar soap ever!  You can even use it to shampoo your hair.  I used to shampoo my cats when they needed a bath and it was fantastic.  No harsh chemicals like regular pet shampoos and it washed out quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Awesome scrub and soap! Very light and works amazingly!</li>
            <li> it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the best product combos I&#x27;ve ever used. Follow the directions and it really works. I was hesitant to drop the &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34;-type step but I&#x27;ve never missed it.  I just bought it for my two sisters too. Three weeks in and i took all the rest of the stuff out of the shower. Well worth the $</li>
            <li> I have ordered Carley&#x27;s many times, not only for myself but for anybody that mentions they have a problem with acne.  This bottle happened to be for my 13 year old nephew who plays baseball.  He gets acne type bumps on his forehead from his baseball cap.  Carley&#x27;s has certainly helped.  I am never disappointed with the product results and always fast shipping.  Love the extra samples they send along with the soap.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and very hard to treat. Easy to use and done in the shower. Works better than any product on the market. I have used it for years and it works for every one.</li>
            <li> I have purchased all sorts of products but finally something that works I wish I would of know about this in high school</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff - it won&#x27;t clear you up overnight (very few, if any, products can even say that...) but give it time and it&#x27;ll kick in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my Rosacea and it works as well as or better than the prescription clyndomicin that I used for 20 years.  Plus they send me a bunch of samples of various moisturizers.  Love that!</li>
            <li> Good product. Been using for years now.</li>
            <li> Got it promptly.  Used it. Liked it. I found it very effective  and I would certainly recommend it to one and all</li>
            <li> Love it. A bit expensive but the bottle is bigger than expected and some extras were included</li>
            <li> This is the first Carley&#x27;s product I tried.  Some people are apprehensive about it (I noticed in reviews on various sites) because of the walnut shells, but they are a great exfoliator.  Like any acne wash, you need to use this for a few weeks to achieve optimal results, and your ace may get worse before it gets better.  My before and after pictures are like night and day, but it took about a month for my acne to fully subside.  If this product isn&#x27;t quite cutting it for your acne, they have the \\&quot;Kick Ass\\&quot; version with 5% benzoyl peroxide (this wash is 2%, which is generally strong enough for most people).  I researched Carley&#x27;s a lot before I first bought from them- this is their original product.  What&#x27;s awesome about Carley&#x27;s is you always get a handful of great samples with every purchase included in your shipment.  Each time I buy it&#x27;s like Christmas because I never know what else I will get!  Carley&#x27;s saved my face, and I plan to buy from this company as long as they allow me to. :)</li>
            <li> I had cystic acne for EVER. Then one of my friends gave me a bottle of this stuff and I started clearing up in a MONTH. It took about 6-7 months but I literally have zero breakouts and my skin glows (Iknow I sound like an infomercial but seriously haha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would pass on their daytime moisturizer though and get CeraVe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely DON&#x27;T overwash. I tried using it two to three times a day (whenever I felt gross and oily) the first few weeks and almost gave up. When I left my skin alone (no picking, no over-washing, no other acne products) and just used this once at night my skin felt the difference immediately and started clearing up fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on eBay, but I have been so pleased with the resultsi wanted to leave a review here since I read all of these reviews before I decided to purchase. I&#x27;ve had acne non stop since I was 13 years old. I&#x27;m almost 30 now. I tried proactive around 16 years old and it really helped for awhile. As an adult my acne got worse. I went on the pill and it got better but my skin was never great. I&#x27;ve never been comfortable going out in public without Foundation on. Then I decided to go off of the pill and my skin progressively got worse and worse the last 3 years. I tried proactive again, but it made my skin flaky dry and I still had acne. After recent stressful events my skin was worse than it&#x27;s ever been and I started looking for an answer. I found carley&#x27;s Clear and smooth online. Honestly, my skin started to clear up right away and now is the best it&#x27;s ever been. It may not work for everyone but it really worked for me. I wanted to give some background on my skin so you could compare my skin issues with yours. Not only is my acne almost completely gone but my skin is soft and smooth and my pores are much smaller. Love it!</li>
            <li> I am 34 and few months ago I started to get acne on my cheeks (around the jaw line) and few on my forehead - I have tried numerous things from changing my face towel more frequently to checking my hormone levels and taking antibiotics, to tover the counter products to all these home remedies-nothing was helping, I think I was stripping my skin off I&#x27;ll its natural oils and balance. I was desperate to cler my face when stumbled upon this product. I liked that it was natural and gentle - I&#x27;ve been using this product fora week now... It works! Obviously it won&#x27;t go awy overnight but my skin feels clean and no new acnes!  The shipper also included some acne treatments creams- which I will be purchasing full sizes.  BTW, you will get a decent size bottle and soap - definitely worth the money. Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> So far this stuff has been working pretty well. I never had a breakout as a teenager, but in my early 20&#x27;s I started breaking out pretty bad, around my chin, sometimes my forehead, then it started on my cheeks. Like almost all acne stories I&#x27;ve read, I too have tried many, many products trying to find what works. I&#x27;m convinced mine is hormonal acne since my breakouts happen around &amp;#34;that time of month&amp;#34;. Carley&#x27;s acne wash does a great job of making my face feel clean and fresh without breaking me out even more (like some face washes do). It hasn&#x27;t been preventing breakouts during &amp;#34;that time of month&amp;#34; but the pimples I do get, seem to be clearing up faster since I&#x27;ve been using this wash and there seems to be less. I follow the directions on the bottle and use it in the morning and wash with soap afterwards. The best part of this wash is that it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of nasty chemicals in it. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three months now. I love that you get free samples when you purchase. I will use my sample for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 6 months and my skin has never felt better.  I love the smell and it&#x27;s a perfect scrub. I&#x27;ve re-ordered it and am now trying more of their products.  I love working with this company.  I am always hesitant to order makeup and face care products on-line even with money-back guarantees.  These folks are always willing to send samples of the products you want to try and it&#x27;s a great idea because I&#x27;m about to make another purchase based on samples they sent me with the last order.  You will not regret ordering from Carley&#x27;s. My skin looks better and at some point I may switch to the Tea Tree formula but I love this so much, I&#x27;m just not sure if I should.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll ask them for samply in my next order :)</li>
            <li> I went off of birth control after being on it for 7 years and my skin decided to revert back to puberty. I had small bumps all over my forehead, chin, and around the outside of my face. This treatment got it under control. I&#x27;ll still get a zit now and then - it&#x27;s not a miracle cure, but it keeps it manageable. Furthermore, I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost two months and I still have over half of the bottle left. Compared to other products that don&#x27;t work as well, the price is incredible.</li>
            <li> just got it about 2 weeks ago.. haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic results. like the description says.. it takes time. hopefully after a month or so i shall start seeing results. other than that fast shipping and got some little samples of other stuff as well.</li>
            <li> I had to take the time to write you about this product, I &#x27;ve had such wonderful results from using it. Please don&#x27;t ever stop making it. I&#x27;ve had severe acne for thirty years. Spend thousand of dollars on over the counter medication, thousands on dermatologist ,and even had laser surgery. I went on Accutane med. It helped but had terrible side affects. I bought Carley&#x27;s  products about six months ago and don&#x27;t ever want to be with out it .I&#x27;m getting compliments on clear skin. I&#x27;m in my fifty&#x27;s and my skin is clear, wish I had found your product sooner. If anyone has severe acne, I strongly recommend this product, you want be sorry. Thank you so much. May God bless your company.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend introduced me to Carley&#x27;s about 3 years ago and I have been using it since, for both facial and body acne. Especially during the summer, my back and shoulders break out and Carley&#x27;s has been keeping my skin clear and soft. I understand (and can pronounce!) all of the ingredients in this bottle and my favorite part is that all of Carley&#x27;s products are cruelty free- never tested on animals. The price, at first, I thought was kind of steep, but it DOES indeed last about 3 months and it comes with a free, natural soap, that lasts about 1 1/2 months between two people. My guy uses it before he shaves, too, to get the grease and sweat off his beard without having to worry about soap residue in his whiskers that other brands would leave behind (dulling razor blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, these are all additional pluses. I can&#x27;t do without this product as a part of my daily routine. I take it everywhere I go; camping, on an airplane, on my annual visit to Europe. The selling point for me WAS the walnut shells, which another customer said might put people off, but I need exfoliation, as I wear makeup almost daily. They are ground so finely and leave your skin silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, and maybe a little TMI here, but I&#x27;ve used Carley&#x27;s on razor burn before; those pesky little bumps. Less itch and cleared up fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the L.L. Bean quality of the cosmetic world (if you&#x27;re from Maine, you know what I mean). Will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I choose this treatment because my dauchter and my son have used it for quite some time and they loved it.  I do, too.</li>
            <li> I actually quit using this for about 6 months to see if it made a difference after using it since 2000. I thought now that I am older maybe I don&#x27;t need it. Well, I was WRONG! I broke out, my skin looked and felt awful! So I bought it again and within about a week to two weeks, I was completely clear with soft smooth skin. I will say, it is very important to follow the instructions with this product and keep it on your face for 30-60 seconds while cleansing, AND rinse well. They have a video on their website, that shows you exactly how to use it. I will never use anything else. Their natural soap is wonderful too!</li>
            <li> I tried this product a few years ago. I was really hoping this product worked well as I had read so many positive reviews. This product really did nothing for my acne, but maybe make it worse. It also made my face look rough rather than help smooth it out. I would not recommend this product. It was not for me at least...</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.  I used to have really really bad breakouts  in my teens on my face and back coupled with a combination oily/dry skin.  I&#x27;d get a handful of painful ones at a time in various spots that would never fully heal.  They&#x27;d start to dry out in about 3 days and then rebound.  I&#x27;d have to gently pop and disinfect them which would leave a scar.  The rate at which old scars healed vs new ones showed up meant my face was riddled with little dark spots.  I tried Proactive during my teens back when they only had the 3 or 4 step system.  Then via my step mom, Mary Kay, which had their own line of the same 3 or 4 step system.  Also tried many off the shelf scrubs.  Nothing worked.  Desperate for a solution I searched online during my late teens for anything I could find and came across a recommendation in a forum post to a reseller of Carley&#x27;s products.  I was naive back then and thought natural ingredient based products were ineffective compared to big marketed brands so I bookmarked the link and kept looking.  3 years later after retrying Proactiv, Mary Kay, Neutrogena, St. Ive&#x27;s Apricot Scrub and a couple of other products, I was cleaning out my bookmarks when I came across the link I had saved to the forum post. I read it through, said why not I&#x27;ll try it, and the rest was history.  It took around 4 maybe 5 months for my skin to fully clear of dozens of layered scars, but the product was so effective at completely shrinking pimples within around 2 to 4 days that my skin was able to gradually heal.  The slightly gritty texture in the scrub really aided in gently exfoliating the skin and speeding up the process.  The best part, aside that it works, is how simple it is.  The 3 to 4 step regimen used to require putting aside a chunk of time to do and would irritate the skin.  I use the natural soap as an all body wash in the shower then after I do my face and back, apply the scrub for 30 seconds before rinsing.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll scrub for 30 seconds and leaveit for another 15 to 30 seconds before rinsing it off.  Although the instructions say to rewash with the soap I rarely used to do so and still saw excellent results, but I would recommend doing so in the summer though as body heat causes the skin to give off the smell of the scrub.  For the areas on my face that would get very dry i&#x27;d apply a light amount of the Day-time moisturizer to the outside, and drink plenty of water for the inside.  It&#x27;s the only product I still use to this day.</li>
            <li> I waited to write this review after I had used the product for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I&#x27;ll explain my skin type: I have never suffered terrible acne, but have always had blackhead issues and 2-5 red spots. I would always wear makeup to cover the spots, because I was terrible and picked at them, causing them to be really really red. I obsessively picked at my face, all of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have varied from Clearasil, clean and clear, walmart and kroger brands, and many variations that are &#x27;affordable.&#x27; I was deciding between Carleys and Proactiv when I made the choice for Carleys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am actually glad I chose Carleys, because it is not at all harsh on my skin. Within a week of using this soap/wash/soap on rag combo, my skin felt so clean. Like, squeaky clean, for the first time I can remember. There weren&#x27;t any residues left on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that the redness faded very quickly from the spots I picked at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month later, I am still getting an occasional spot, but I am not picking my face as much at all. I have no idea why, but i am not feeling the urge to pick- my face isn&#x27;t itchy and my spots aren&#x27;t as painful when they do pop up. Also, my spots disappear a lot faster when using this wash; I may pick at them, but one wash and the redness is primarily gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also- I&#x27;m not wearing makeup anymore. I don&#x27;t feel the need, because my skin is soft, and smooth, and has more of the natural coloring. It is more vibrant versus dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have been using the wash for a month, and have made barely a dent in the bottle. I absolutely think this one bottle will last me for AN ENTIRE YEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great product. It cleans and revitalizes the skin. It doesn&#x27;t completely do away with spots (zits), but it makes their healing really speedy. I absolutely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, (I promise), they send loads of great samples, and I actually bought the daytime and nighttime moisturizers because of the samples they sent. Great product, good price, and it works.</li>
