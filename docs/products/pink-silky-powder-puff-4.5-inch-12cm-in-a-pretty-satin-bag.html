            <li>I&#x27;m super impressed with this company--an excellent product, thoughtful customer care, and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for a gift and the recipient was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love the silk bag which makes it great for traveling.</li>
            <li>My wife is very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>We were very satisfied with all aspects of our transaction.</li>
            <li>It was exactly the size it said it would be, fits my powder box perfectly, and works well.  </li>
            <li>It also came with care instructions for washing and drying, and a nice Thank</li>
            <li>and you can use your own talc.</li>
            <li>Feels almost like a nice chair cushion.</li>
            <li>Machine washable is nice, and silk ribbon on one side makes holding the thing a breeze.</li>
            <li>anyhow I sent an email to the nice lady who sent these to thank her</li>
            <li>oh and the lady is really nice to,</li>
            <li>anyhow she is really a nice person.</li>
            <li>anyhow I sent an email to the nice lady who sent these to thank her</li>
            <li>oh and the lady is really nice to,</li>
            <li>anyhow she is really a nice person.</li>
            <li>Really nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came well packaged in a nice satin bag and was received in a timely manner from the seller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m telling you, you better grab them up because if she doesn&#x27;t get more made there will never be another puffer as good as these, I guarantee it, and that&#x27;s all I have to say on that....</li>

            <li>Distinct Impressions also makes a \\&quot;Great</li>
            <li>I have a beautiful vintage powder jar and this puff is exactly what I was looking for to use it for dudting powder again.</li>
            <li>Love having this handy.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly and is so soft and feminine.  </li>
            <li>The nice texture and athe ribbon strap across the puff make for easy use.</li>
            <li>but after using it I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I would not hesitate to order more items from this company or to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I have ordered many for gifts to family members and always get rave reviews.</li>
            <li>ended up with more powder on the floor than on me.    </li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this on Amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got them when I did</li>
            <li>My wife had me order more in case</li>
            <li>a big body puff, excellent for applying baby powder to your baby after a bath or whatnot.  </li>
            <li>Since that time I have purchased a much smaller powder dish and the puff fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Hope this helps you decided.. :-)</li>
            <li>Wonderful big puff.</li>
            <li>love this powder puff.</li>
            <li>I searched most retail stores, no powder puffs to be found.....</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great transaction.</li>
            <li>I did not think they still made them :)</li>
            <li>If you need a powder puff, don&#x27;t hesitate. :)</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find puffs this size anywhere in stores, so I was pleased to find it on line.</li>
            <li>the back, perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The item arrived quickly and was well packaged and comes with a nice satin bag if you prefer that for storage .</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to use these puffs, they make putting on power so easy...</li>
            <li>The satin bag adds a special touch and is perfect to store the puff when using different fragranced powders.  </li>
            <li>Can leave the bathroom feeling comfortable and warm even if the house is cool.  </li>
            <li>While this may seem an insignificant item, she considered it most important.  </li>
            <li>very nice powder puff...nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>The order shipped very quickly.    </li>
            <li>OK ladies, I&#x27;m a 57 year old guy and let me tell you about a really good powder puffer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>As far as the powder puff experience, it holds a lot of powder, and it spreads very nicely--I was using a cotton ball before, so you can imagine how impressed I am right now :)    </li>
            <li>so I was so pleased when I located these powder puffs online and with an added bonus of a very pretty satin bag.</li>
            <li>I like a nice large puff for all over body powdering in the heat of summer.</li>
            <li>I love the puffs from Distinct Impressions.</li>
            <li>Since I already had a container for my powder, it was important that I know the size of the puff before buying it.  </li>
            <li>, now this is important so pay attention, at about 9:45</li>
            <li>also fit perfecting in U.S. Acrylics 3Pcs Spa Canister Set, the shorter, wider one of the three.</li>
            <li>It also keeps the powder and puff moisture and humidity free if you plan on storing it in you bathroom and would like to have it sitting</li>
            <li>It is soft and feels good against your skin  as you rub powder over all parts of your body.</li>
            <li>Happy that I purchased it and the bag is a nice little benefit too!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful pink bag to keep your puff in.  </li>
            <li>so can always have a clean one.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special</li>
            <li>Just right for applying body powders!</li>
            <li>Shipped Oct 27th, arrived Oct 29th, a full 3 days ahead of estimated arrival date.</li>
            <li>and she wrote back and told me how she came about having these really good quality puffers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she wrote back and told me how she came about having these really good quality puffers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and fluffy, and fits perfectly in the bowl :-)</li>
            <li>Nice and soft, and palm-sized.</li>
            <li>you kidding me, that quick, must be a mistake, maybe?&lt;br /&gt;Nope</li>
            <li>Very pretty,  just as described.  </li>
            <li>As a child, I thought those green puffs were beautiful.  </li>
            <li>This is a lovely, soft body powder puff!  </li>
            <li>Needed certain size to fit in jar that I am using for body powder.</li>
            <li>LOL maybe I&#x27;ll get one for my little girl kitty</li>
            <li>LOL maybe I&#x27;ll get one for my little girl kitty</li>
            <li>So I really appreciate the accurate description.  </li>
            <li>Distinct Impressions&#x27; 5\\&quot; puff is amazing - if you&#x27;re someone who requires bath powder and a plush puff as the finishing touch to every bath and shower, look no further.  </li>
            <li>The puff comes inside a ziploc plastic bag, which is then inside a bright pink silk like bag.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never before done business with Distinct Impressions and was wholly accountable for the shipping costs I&#x27;d agreed to pay.  </li>
            <li>Distinct Impressions recognizes and appreciates their customers and, in so doing, has structured their business to succeed.</li>
            <li>I get a email saying that my order had been received by Distinct Impressions and that my puffers had been shipped, WHAT??&lt;br /&gt;Are</li>
            <li>worth the money i paid for it.</li>
            <li>it is worth the money ..</li>
            <li>Just the right size and pretty too!</li>
            <li>They are a good size and came in pretty little bags so they are easy to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, they came in a perty pink bag and then inside another plastic zip bag with a note inside on how to clean them with Woolite, ah my Mom&#x27;s favorite soap, she uses it on her undies and claims to have made her undies last some forty years now, hum must be good stuff</li>
            <li>This puff is just the right size for dusting powder after a shower.</li>
            <li>I am ordering another right now.</li>
            <li>Wish I would of purchased 2 right away.</li>
            <li>This was the right size.  </li>
            <li>This is a gift, to replace an old puff, but I&#x27;m sure it exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large, it has a strap for your hand, and, importantly it comes with its own plastic bag, inside the pink one, so</li>
            <li>Enjoy using after fowling off from a shower to make sure I am dry just before dressing.  </li>
            <li>I had been searching for a full sized powder puff for awhile, and all you can basically find is sponges...which doesn&#x27;t really work that well with powder.  </li>
            <li>I very love how pink they are..</li>
            <li>Large puff!</li>
            <li>My sister and I had been looking for a good old fashioned powder puff for quite some time when I finally decided to look online.  </li>
            <li>But no problem , the purchase was fast and I received it quick.</li>
            <li>Holds powder well after first washing, and is very gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>They are exactly as advertised.    </li>
            <li>First, this item arrived beautifully packaged with a pink satin draw-string pouch (the puff itself is white).  </li>
            <li>One more note, I placed my order on a Friday (evening), and the powder puff was delivered on the following Monday.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did not send it back.</li>
            <li>Not expensive</li>
            <li>Most times, stores don&#x27;t sell these this big anymore, and I didn&#x27;t even buy the largest one!  </li>
            <li>This puff looks exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li>Got exactly what I ordered and received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>even those weren&#x27;t good enough because they either weren&#x27;t big enough or fuzzy enough or didn&#x27;t have something she could pick it up with and hold on to as her fingers don&#x27;t work so good anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>The satin bag is an extra and makes it look special!</li>
            <li>; it is large enough to apply powder all over my body &amp; love the handle &amp; cute pink case I am now using to hold my pill bottles!</li>
            <li>The handle on the back make&#x27;s it easy to hold too.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, and soft as promised.</li>
            <li>I ordered the powder puff because it was a large puff and appeared to be 2.  </li>
            <li>I really like the biggest one</li>
            <li>This is very deceptive advertising</li>
            <li>I received my powder puff in 3 days, so fast I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>Powder does not adhere to the puff very well.</li>
            <li>She really likes them.  </li>
            <li>the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>So much so that the powder does NOT stay on the puff as you try to use it and goes everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Searching for powder puff that you can really use for your body...</li>
            <li>Amazon, thanks for having this merchant on your site.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again, Amazon.</li>
            <li>so when you really get to powdering you won&#x27;t drop it,</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>and it is very convenient to have an additional puff for replacement</li>
            <li>very well made.</li>
            <li>and we found the very thing she was looking for.  </li>
            <li>These are very generously sized and work well.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>nice and fluffy powder puff and lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li>The powder puff is soft and pretty and the ribbon stitched across the back makes it easy to hold on to the puff.</li>
            <li>Powder puff came very quickly and with a pretty pink satin bag.  </li>
            <li>Its not fluffy like the picture, but it fits in my powder container just right.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and just the right size.  </li>
            <li>It seemed a little thick at first, but after use, it is perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so surprised, because I never expected to &#x27;enjoy&#x27; this powder puff so much, but what can I say...</li>
            <li>I also love that they&#x27;re washable, and I washed them prior to using (although they arrived well packaged and seemed to be very sanitary, so that probably wasn&#x27;t necessary).</li>
            <li>The puffs are large and very soft.</li>
            <li>That particular size canister also holds a 7 ounce tin of fragranced body powder along with this puff with some room to spare.</li>
            <li>Nice n soft but not as fluffy as I thought</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>, the pretty pink satin bag is a nice touch and can be used for other things.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>Packaged individually, received quickly and very soft - photo doesn&#x27;t do the product justice.  </li>
            <li>They are VERY high quality and extremely soft.</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised at how fast they got here, so</li>
            <li>and WOW, what a puffer they are, really fat and fuzzy and even a silk handle</li>
            <li>The powder is more evenly spread and there is so much less on the floor!</li>
            <li>I finally thought of Amazon, and this one is just right.  </li>
            <li>and she needed a new powder puffy thing.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Honestly, i&#x27;m new to these though, so</li>
            <li>Very soft in texture and holds up well with washing.</li>
            <li>It feels very soft and comforting.  </li>
            <li>Pretty but not practical if you plan to actually use it.</li>
            <li>I love it but at the cost next time I will try other ones.</li>
            <li>Cindy responded with an extremely generous offer of free shipping on my next order which occurred that very day to build an emergency stash of 3 additional puffs.  </li>
            <li>you see I was sent on a mission for my dear old Mom who is in her mid 80&#x27;s and can&#x27;t get out much anymore</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really looking for the velour type of puff in this size or larger.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to use with my Lush Dusting powder.</li>
            <li>It came packaged so professionally in a silk bag with washing instructions.</li>
            <li>This puff gave that information up front, and was everything advertised: soft &amp; sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I purchased three, two for myself and one for my two year old granddaughter</li>
            <li>old granddaughter to go with a beauty dust box that I had found at a flea market.  </li>
            <li>That might not sound too exciting, but it really was.  </li>
            <li>Older puff I had was made of a different materal that required one application.</li>
            <li>They come in a little pink satin bag and are great little gifts.  </li>
            <li>I used my last one way beyond the normal time because I couldn&#x27;t find any anywhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, it comes in a cute little pink cloth bag.</li>
            <li>A funny thing is - I looked at the picture and thought, I wish I could have a pink satin bag instead of a burgundy one, and to my amazement the bag I received was a pretty pink satin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and very big.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds the powder I pick up and deposits it to my body and not the floor, and the major reason I moved away from using powder tins opting instead for a canister type of container.</li>
            <li>Although the powder puff is large and comes in a pretty silk bag, the puff itself is very stiff compared to the velvety one I had that was destroyed by my dog.  </li>
            <li>I had been given an expensive talc that came with a powder puff and really liked the ease of use.  </li>
            <li>It meets all the requirements, large, very soft without being too fluffy, pick-up ribbon</li>
            <li>It is hard to find full size body puffs these days.</li>
            <li>very large, very fluffy, no fuzz.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m super impressed with this company--an excellent product, thoughtful customer care, and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for a gift and the recipient was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love the silk bag which makes it great for traveling.</li>
            <li> My wife is very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> We were very satisfied with all aspects of our transaction.</li>
            <li> It was exactly the size it said it would be, fits my powder box perfectly, and works well.  </li>
            <li> It also came with care instructions for washing and drying, and a nice Thank</li>
            <li> and you can use your own talc.</li>
            <li> Feels almost like a nice chair cushion.</li>
            <li> Machine washable is nice, and silk ribbon on one side makes holding the thing a breeze.</li>
            <li> anyhow I sent an email to the nice lady who sent these to thank her</li>
            <li> oh and the lady is really nice to,</li>
            <li> anyhow she is really a nice person.</li>

            <li> Really nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came well packaged in a nice satin bag and was received in a timely manner from the seller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you, you better grab them up because if she doesn&#x27;t get more made there will never be another puffer as good as these, I guarantee it, and that&#x27;s all I have to say on that....</li>

            <li> Distinct Impressions also makes a \\&quot;Great</li>
            <li> I have a beautiful vintage powder jar and this puff is exactly what I was looking for to use it for dudting powder again.</li>
            <li> Love having this handy.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and is so soft and feminine.  </li>
            <li> The nice texture and athe ribbon strap across the puff make for easy use.</li>
            <li> but after using it I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate to order more items from this company or to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have ordered many for gifts to family members and always get rave reviews.</li>
            <li> ended up with more powder on the floor than on me.    </li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got them when I did</li>
            <li> My wife had me order more in case</li>
            <li> a big body puff, excellent for applying baby powder to your baby after a bath or whatnot.  </li>
            <li> Since that time I have purchased a much smaller powder dish and the puff fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Hope this helps you decided.. :-)</li>
            <li> Wonderful big puff.</li>
            <li> love this powder puff.</li>
            <li> I searched most retail stores, no powder puffs to be found.....</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great transaction.</li>
            <li> I did not think they still made them :)</li>
            <li> If you need a powder puff, don&#x27;t hesitate. :)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find puffs this size anywhere in stores, so I was pleased to find it on line.</li>
            <li> the back, perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The item arrived quickly and was well packaged and comes with a nice satin bag if you prefer that for storage .</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to use these puffs, they make putting on power so easy...</li>
            <li> The satin bag adds a special touch and is perfect to store the puff when using different fragranced powders.  </li>
            <li> Can leave the bathroom feeling comfortable and warm even if the house is cool.  </li>
            <li> While this may seem an insignificant item, she considered it most important.  </li>
            <li> very nice powder puff...nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> The order shipped very quickly.    </li>
            <li> OK ladies, I&#x27;m a 57 year old guy and let me tell you about a really good powder puffer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> As far as the powder puff experience, it holds a lot of powder, and it spreads very nicely--I was using a cotton ball before, so you can imagine how impressed I am right now :)    </li>
            <li> so I was so pleased when I located these powder puffs online and with an added bonus of a very pretty satin bag.</li>
            <li> I like a nice large puff for all over body powdering in the heat of summer.</li>
            <li> I love the puffs from Distinct Impressions.</li>
            <li> Since I already had a container for my powder, it was important that I know the size of the puff before buying it.  </li>
            <li> , now this is important so pay attention, at about 9:45</li>
            <li> also fit perfecting in U.S. Acrylics 3Pcs Spa Canister Set, the shorter, wider one of the three.</li>
            <li> It also keeps the powder and puff moisture and humidity free if you plan on storing it in you bathroom and would like to have it sitting</li>
            <li> It is soft and feels good against your skin  as you rub powder over all parts of your body.</li>
            <li> Happy that I purchased it and the bag is a nice little benefit too!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful pink bag to keep your puff in.  </li>
            <li> so can always have a clean one.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special</li>
            <li> Just right for applying body powders!</li>
            <li> Shipped Oct 27th, arrived Oct 29th, a full 3 days ahead of estimated arrival date.</li>
            <li> and she wrote back and told me how she came about having these really good quality puffers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she wrote back and told me how she came about having these really good quality puffers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and fluffy, and fits perfectly in the bowl :-)</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, and palm-sized.</li>
            <li> you kidding me, that quick, must be a mistake, maybe?&lt;br /&gt;Nope</li>
            <li> Very pretty,  just as described.  </li>
            <li> As a child, I thought those green puffs were beautiful.  </li>
            <li> This is a lovely, soft body powder puff!  </li>
            <li> Needed certain size to fit in jar that I am using for body powder.</li>
            <li> LOL maybe I&#x27;ll get one for my little girl kitty</li>
            <li> LOL maybe I&#x27;ll get one for my little girl kitty</li>
            <li> So I really appreciate the accurate description.  </li>
            <li> Distinct Impressions&#x27; 5\\&quot; puff is amazing - if you&#x27;re someone who requires bath powder and a plush puff as the finishing touch to every bath and shower, look no further.  </li>
            <li> The puff comes inside a ziploc plastic bag, which is then inside a bright pink silk like bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never before done business with Distinct Impressions and was wholly accountable for the shipping costs I&#x27;d agreed to pay.  </li>
            <li> Distinct Impressions recognizes and appreciates their customers and, in so doing, has structured their business to succeed.</li>
            <li> I get a email saying that my order had been received by Distinct Impressions and that my puffers had been shipped, WHAT??&lt;br /&gt;Are</li>
            <li> worth the money i paid for it.</li>
            <li> it is worth the money ..</li>
            <li> Just the right size and pretty too!</li>
            <li> They are a good size and came in pretty little bags so they are easy to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, they came in a perty pink bag and then inside another plastic zip bag with a note inside on how to clean them with Woolite, ah my Mom&#x27;s favorite soap, she uses it on her undies and claims to have made her undies last some forty years now, hum must be good stuff</li>
            <li> This puff is just the right size for dusting powder after a shower.</li>
            <li> I am ordering another right now.</li>
            <li> Wish I would of purchased 2 right away.</li>
            <li> This was the right size.  </li>
            <li> This is a gift, to replace an old puff, but I&#x27;m sure it exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large, it has a strap for your hand, and, importantly it comes with its own plastic bag, inside the pink one, so</li>
            <li> Enjoy using after fowling off from a shower to make sure I am dry just before dressing.  </li>
            <li> I had been searching for a full sized powder puff for awhile, and all you can basically find is sponges...which doesn&#x27;t really work that well with powder.  </li>
            <li> I very love how pink they are..</li>
            <li> Large puff!</li>
            <li> My sister and I had been looking for a good old fashioned powder puff for quite some time when I finally decided to look online.  </li>
            <li> But no problem , the purchase was fast and I received it quick.</li>
            <li> Holds powder well after first washing, and is very gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> They are exactly as advertised.    </li>
            <li> First, this item arrived beautifully packaged with a pink satin draw-string pouch (the puff itself is white).  </li>
            <li> One more note, I placed my order on a Friday (evening), and the powder puff was delivered on the following Monday.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did not send it back.</li>
            <li> Not expensive</li>
            <li> Most times, stores don&#x27;t sell these this big anymore, and I didn&#x27;t even buy the largest one!  </li>
            <li> This puff looks exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered and received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> even those weren&#x27;t good enough because they either weren&#x27;t big enough or fuzzy enough or didn&#x27;t have something she could pick it up with and hold on to as her fingers don&#x27;t work so good anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> The satin bag is an extra and makes it look special!</li>
            <li> ; it is large enough to apply powder all over my body &amp; love the handle &amp; cute pink case I am now using to hold my pill bottles!</li>
            <li> The handle on the back make&#x27;s it easy to hold too.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, and soft as promised.</li>
            <li> I ordered the powder puff because it was a large puff and appeared to be 2.  </li>
            <li> I really like the biggest one</li>
            <li> This is very deceptive advertising</li>
            <li> I received my powder puff in 3 days, so fast I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> Powder does not adhere to the puff very well.</li>
            <li> She really likes them.  </li>
            <li> the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> So much so that the powder does NOT stay on the puff as you try to use it and goes everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Searching for powder puff that you can really use for your body...</li>
            <li> Amazon, thanks for having this merchant on your site.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again, Amazon.</li>
            <li> so when you really get to powdering you won&#x27;t drop it,</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> and it is very convenient to have an additional puff for replacement</li>
            <li> very well made.</li>
            <li> and we found the very thing she was looking for.  </li>
            <li> These are very generously sized and work well.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> nice and fluffy powder puff and lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> The powder puff is soft and pretty and the ribbon stitched across the back makes it easy to hold on to the puff.</li>
            <li> Powder puff came very quickly and with a pretty pink satin bag.  </li>
            <li> Its not fluffy like the picture, but it fits in my powder container just right.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and just the right size.  </li>
            <li> It seemed a little thick at first, but after use, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so surprised, because I never expected to &#x27;enjoy&#x27; this powder puff so much, but what can I say...</li>
            <li> I also love that they&#x27;re washable, and I washed them prior to using (although they arrived well packaged and seemed to be very sanitary, so that probably wasn&#x27;t necessary).</li>
            <li> The puffs are large and very soft.</li>
            <li> That particular size canister also holds a 7 ounce tin of fragranced body powder along with this puff with some room to spare.</li>
            <li> Nice n soft but not as fluffy as I thought</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> , the pretty pink satin bag is a nice touch and can be used for other things.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Packaged individually, received quickly and very soft - photo doesn&#x27;t do the product justice.  </li>
            <li> They are VERY high quality and extremely soft.</li>
            <li> and I was really surprised at how fast they got here, so</li>
            <li> and WOW, what a puffer they are, really fat and fuzzy and even a silk handle</li>
            <li> The powder is more evenly spread and there is so much less on the floor!</li>
            <li> I finally thought of Amazon, and this one is just right.  </li>
            <li> and she needed a new powder puffy thing.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Honestly, i&#x27;m new to these though, so</li>
            <li> Very soft in texture and holds up well with washing.</li>
            <li> It feels very soft and comforting.  </li>
            <li> Pretty but not practical if you plan to actually use it.</li>
            <li> I love it but at the cost next time I will try other ones.</li>
            <li> Cindy responded with an extremely generous offer of free shipping on my next order which occurred that very day to build an emergency stash of 3 additional puffs.  </li>
            <li> you see I was sent on a mission for my dear old Mom who is in her mid 80&#x27;s and can&#x27;t get out much anymore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really looking for the velour type of puff in this size or larger.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Lush Dusting powder.</li>
            <li> It came packaged so professionally in a silk bag with washing instructions.</li>
            <li> This puff gave that information up front, and was everything advertised: soft &amp; sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I purchased three, two for myself and one for my two year old granddaughter</li>
            <li> old granddaughter to go with a beauty dust box that I had found at a flea market.  </li>
            <li> That might not sound too exciting, but it really was.  </li>
            <li> Older puff I had was made of a different materal that required one application.</li>
            <li> They come in a little pink satin bag and are great little gifts.  </li>
            <li> I used my last one way beyond the normal time because I couldn&#x27;t find any anywhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it comes in a cute little pink cloth bag.</li>
            <li> A funny thing is - I looked at the picture and thought, I wish I could have a pink satin bag instead of a burgundy one, and to my amazement the bag I received was a pretty pink satin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and very big.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds the powder I pick up and deposits it to my body and not the floor, and the major reason I moved away from using powder tins opting instead for a canister type of container.</li>
            <li> Although the powder puff is large and comes in a pretty silk bag, the puff itself is very stiff compared to the velvety one I had that was destroyed by my dog.  </li>
            <li> I had been given an expensive talc that came with a powder puff and really liked the ease of use.  </li>
            <li> It meets all the requirements, large, very soft without being too fluffy, pick-up ribbon</li>
            <li> It is hard to find full size body puffs these days.</li>
            <li> very large, very fluffy, no fuzz.  </li>
            <li> Came inside a plain envelope, with EXTREMELY FAST shipping.</li>
            <li> puff wasn&#x27;t very fluffy ; hard to handle (ribbon hanndle); it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> I was given a large powder dish and the puff was just too small for it.</li>
            <li> I can see these lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;d tell me that those weren&#x27;t the right ones and I&#x27;d take the dumb things back</li>
            <li> I purchased one of each color option (pink and white).</li>
            <li> It is thick, and is quite rigid in the middle, but soft on the outside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality, and very hard to find item in this size and the price is very reasonable in relation to the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is thick, soft, and feels totally luxurious against my skin.  </li>
            <li> At first I felt it was a little thick compared to the drugstore brands</li>
            <li> like previous viewer, finally!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fluffy and thick and is exactly 4 1/2&amp;#34; wide.</li>
            <li> I kept coming back with these little puny things</li>
            <li> Very thick and holds the powder that I use very well.  </li>
            <li> and finally she showed me what she needed, duh finally,</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what to do with the pink bag.  </li>
            <li> These puffs were absolutely not 4 and 1/2 inches unless you put the 2 side-by-side.  </li>
            <li> This product was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not really much you can say about a powder puff except it works.</li>
            <li> The pink puff is a bit lighter than the ribbon but the density of the pile, the thickness of the puff and the width are as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still not happy with it being so flat and not fluffy.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re in need of a container for your body powder, prefer something other than a box or tin, check that set out.</li>
            <li> Looking for a similar product in local stores proved unsuccessful and frustrating.  </li>
            <li> The puffs each came sealed in a zip lock bag and the puffs themselves in pink satin draw string bags with a little sample of body powder and a card with care instructions on how to launder them.</li>
            <li> You would not think something as simple as a powder puff would be hard to find, I can assure you it is, I looked everywhere.</li>
            <li> the other powder puffs were too small.</li>
            <li> I found surprisingly few options and</li>
            <li> This puff is definitely fluffy.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for fluffy..</li>
            <li> If you shake these out well after each use they stay fluffy longer.</li>
            <li> not easy to find.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not a frilly person, and I don&#x27;t usually go in for the girly stuff).  </li>
            <li> I have been unable to find these at my local drugstores or department stores, so Amazon came through for me again!  </li>
            <li> the quality of the past is in this ..you can even wash it .</li>
            <li> The product was as described, however, it feels very stiff in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Powder puffs were hard to find.  </li>
            <li> This is worse than when my kids were little and tried to make powder go everywhere.  </li>
            <li> It was impossible for me to find a powder puff in local stores.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the puff to be so thick!</li>
            <li> Very hard to find anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say she loves it all!</li>
            <li> Take the chance, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and plan to return them for refund.</li>

            <li> Works well to apply body powder.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Very hard to find anywhere.  Perfect size.  Holds the powder well.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to do with the pink bag.  I don&#x27;t store it in it.</li>
            <li> The product was as described, however, it feels very stiff in my hand.  I&#x27;m really looking for the velour type of puff in this size or larger.  I don&#x27;t understand why they have been phased out by manufacturer&#x27;s.  I used my last one way beyond the normal time because I couldn&#x27;t find any anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter knew I was looking and she ordered one of the 4.5 inch size and the larger 5.5 inch size for me from the same company.  I really like the biggest one the best.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the pretty pink satin bag is a nice touch and can be used for other things.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Cox</li>
            <li> I use it every day.  Very soft in texture and holds up well with washing. Glad to find this product online as difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Lush Dusting powder. It&#x27;s very soft and very big. The handle on the back make&#x27;s it easy to hold too.</li>
            <li> Just the right size and pretty too!</li>
            <li> I ordered the powder puff because it was a large puff and appeared to be 2.  Based on the picture there are two puffs displayed and I only received one.  This is very deceptive advertising and I will not buy anything from AMAZON.com or this vendor again.</li>
            <li> That might not sound too exciting, but it really was.  It was exactly the size it said it would be, fits my powder box perfectly, and works well.  I bought a &amp;#34;5 inch&amp;#34; puff on ebay that actually was over 7inches.  So I really appreciate the accurate description.  I&#x27;d buy again</li>
            <li> I received my powder puff in 3 days, so fast I couldn&#x27;t believe it. At first I felt it was a little thick compared to the drugstore brands but after using it I fell in love with it. It came packaged so professionally in a silk bag with washing instructions. I will definitely order one again.</li>
            <li> Powder puff came very quickly and with a pretty pink satin bag.  Nice and fluffy.  This is a gift, to replace an old puff, but I&#x27;m sure it exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> My sister and I had been looking for a good old fashioned powder puff for quite some time when I finally decided to look online.  I found surprisingly few options and still less that got decent reviews.  This puff seemed to be the exception so we ordered two and they did not disappoint.  They are exactly as advertised.    The puffs each came sealed in a zip lock bag and the puffs themselves in pink satin draw string bags with a little sample of body powder and a card with care instructions on how to launder them. The order shipped very quickly.    I would not hesitate to order more items from this company or to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The powder puff is soft and pretty and the ribbon stitched across the back makes it easy to hold on to the puff.</li>
            <li> Powder does not adhere to the puff very well. Needs continuous applications. Older puff I had was made of a different materal that required one application.</li>
            <li> This puff exceeded all my expectations.  I had been searching for a full sized powder puff for awhile, and all you can basically find is sponges...which doesn&#x27;t really work that well with powder.  First, this item arrived beautifully packaged with a pink satin draw-string pouch (the puff itself is white).  I thought it was a wonderful touch, and, surprisingly, I really liked the presentation (I&#x27;m not a frilly person, and I don&#x27;t usually go in for the girly stuff).  It also came with care instructions for washing and drying, and a nice Thank You card from the company.  As far as the powder puff experience, it holds a lot of powder, and it spreads very nicely--I was using a cotton ball before, so you can imagine how impressed I am right now :)    I was a child back in the 70&#x27;s, and my mother use to buy her perfume in duo packs that came with a bottle of perfume and a container of scented powder (powder puff included).  As a child, I thought those green puffs were beautiful.  This powder puff, if you can imagine, comes with all the glamour of those childhood memories.  I&#x27;m so surprised, because I never expected to &#x27;enjoy&#x27; this powder puff so much, but what can I say...it really is a great product!    One more note, I placed my order on a Friday (evening), and the powder puff was delivered on the following Monday.  I&#x27;m super impressed with this company--an excellent product, thoughtful customer care, and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I love the puffs from Distinct Impressions. I have ordered many for gifts to family members and always get rave reviews. The satin bag is an extra and makes it look special! couldn&#x27;t be happier with this sellers offerings!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what i was looking for. The size is perfect forvapplying powder to your body.</li>
            <li> nice and fluffy powder puff and lasts and lasts. Happy that I purchased it and the bag is a nice little benefit too!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely, soft body powder puff!  I have been unable to find these at my local drugstores or department stores, so Amazon came through for me again!  The satin bag adds a special touch and is perfect to store the puff when using different fragranced powders.  Great price, too!</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these thinking the 4.5\\&quot; stated would work well in my body powder &#x27;canister.&#x27;  I apply powder daily following my shower, so use the larger puff.  These puffs were absolutely not 4 and 1/2 inches unless you put the 2 side-by-side.  1 was to be a given to a friend.  These puffs would probably work in a facial compact.  I am very disappointed and plan to return them for refund.</li>
            <li> Distinct Impressions&#x27; 5\\&quot; puff is amazing - if you&#x27;re someone who requires bath powder and a plush puff as the finishing touch to every bath and shower, look no further.  Distinct Impressions also makes a \\&quot;Great Impression\\&quot; with their excellent customer service.  In my excitement over finding a replacement for my ancient threadbare puff, I neglected to pay close attention to the shipping costs and e-mailed my displeasure and regret.  Cindy responded with an extremely generous offer of free shipping on my next order which occurred that very day to build an emergency stash of 3 additional puffs.  I&#x27;d never before done business with Distinct Impressions and was wholly accountable for the shipping costs I&#x27;d agreed to pay.  Distinct Impressions recognizes and appreciates their customers and, in so doing, has structured their business to succeed.</li>
            <li> I have to use a medicated powder for rash on several parts of my body (don&#x27;t want to go there) and using my hands to apply it ended up with more powder on the floor than on me.    I trusted Amazon to help with my problem and found these.  The powder is more evenly spread and there is so much less on the floor!</li>
            <li> I have a beautiful vintage powder jar and this puff is exactly what I was looking for to use it for dudting powder again.</li>
            <li> very nice powder puff...nice and soft.  I am so glad I found this on Amazon...powder puffs are not even sold in stores anymore (it seems to me)&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend</li>
            <li> Mom had been looking for the body size puffs for months with no luck.  She mentioned it to me and I immediately logged into amazon and found these.  The reviews were excellent so I ordered two for her.  She really likes them.  She also likes that they are machine washable.  I&#x27;m glad I got them when I did because now they are out of stock.</li>
            <li> Since I already had a container for my powder, it was important that I know the size of the puff before buying it.  This puff gave that information up front, and was everything advertised: soft &amp; sturdy.  Also, it comes in a cute little pink cloth bag.</li>
            <li> This puff is just the right size for dusting powder after a shower. It seemed a little thick at first, but after use, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find full size body puffs these days. They are good quality, and they arrive beautifully wrapped. the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> My wife had me order more in case they quit making them![[ASIN:B002T5NMGS Body Puff for Body Powder 4.5\\&quot; (12cm) Size]]</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.  Large puff!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this on Amazon.  I was looking for a replacement puff for an Este Laude one I have used for quite awhile.  This puff is definitely fluffy.  So much so that the powder does NOT stay on the puff as you try to use it and goes everywhere.  I have powder on the counter, floor and in the drawer that the box of powder I use it with is in.  This is worse than when my kids were little and tried to make powder go everywhere.  So if you&#x27;re looking for fluffy..this one&#x27;s for you.  If you&#x27;re looking for functional...keep looking.</li>
            <li> It is what it says... a big body puff, excellent for applying baby powder to your baby after a bath or whatnot.  It is thick, and is quite rigid in the middle, but soft on the outside. It has a strap on the back so it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand when you&#x27;re handling it.  Very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This product is beyond all hopes. The biggest problem is finding them. I will be a customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> This is the best powder puff that I have used in years!  It is thick, soft, and feels totally luxurious against my skin.  I feel fortunate to have found it from this excellent seller!  Hollywood here I come!</li>
            <li> Searching for powder puff that you can really use for your body...like previous viewer, finally!  This is perfect for all over.  Definitely not for face make-up, but all over body freshness...powder, talc any baby powder product.  The satin handle is perfect control of puff.  Amazon, thanks for having this merchant on your site.  Packaged individually, received quickly and very soft - photo doesn&#x27;t do the product justice.  Take the chance, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Thanks again, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very nice powder puff!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I purchased this puff and was unsatisfied. I was given a large powder dish and the puff was just too small for it. Since that time I have purchased a much smaller powder dish and the puff fits perfectly. I am still not happy with it being so flat and not fluffy. All in all it&#x27;s ok and I am glad I did not send it back.</li>
            <li> I like to use talcum powder after shaving, but ended up sprinkling it over the floor, as well as myself.  I had been given an expensive talc that came with a powder puff and really liked the ease of use.  This puff is great.  Not expensive and you can use your own talc.</li>
            <li> I did not know I could find anything like this ..Amazon has it all ..just type it in and they got it ..the quality of the past is in this ..you can even wash it .</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the puff to be so thick! Feels almost like a nice chair cushion. Machine washable is nice, and silk ribbon on one side makes holding the thing a breeze. Used for body powder, works perfectly. Most times, stores don&#x27;t sell these this big anymore, and I didn&#x27;t even buy the largest one!  Came inside a plain envelope, with EXTREMELY FAST shipping. Shipped Oct 27th, arrived Oct 29th, a full 3 days ahead of estimated arrival date. The puff comes inside a ziploc plastic bag, which is then inside a bright pink silk like bag. Pretty but not practical if you plan to actually use it. Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Could not find this item anywhere in stores.  Was very happy when I found it online.  They are a good size and came in pretty little bags so they are easy to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality.  very large, very fluffy, no fuzz.  Makes you feel good using it.  Beautiful pink bag to keep your puff in.  Great size and well made.</li>
            <li> Very pretty,  just as described.  Arrived on time -  I am ordering another right now.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted. Wish I would of purchased 2 right away. But no problem , the purchase was fast and I received it quick.</li>
            <li> OK ladies, I&#x27;m a 57 year old guy and let me tell you about a really good powder puffer.&lt;br /&gt;This here is one really good quality puffer and the quality is not what you might expect, it&#x27;s way beyond great quality.&lt;br /&gt;And just how might I know?&lt;br /&gt;Well you see I was sent on a mission for my dear old Mom who is in her mid 80&#x27;s and can&#x27;t get out much anymore and she needed a new powder puffy thing.&lt;br /&gt;Well I kept coming back with these little puny things and she&#x27;d tell me that those weren&#x27;t the right ones and I&#x27;d take the dumb things back and finally she showed me what she needed, duh finally, so I measured it and the hunt continued.&lt;br /&gt;All I could find was puffers that came with some powder and even those weren&#x27;t good enough because they either weren&#x27;t big enough or fuzzy enough or didn&#x27;t have something she could pick it up with and hold on to as her fingers don&#x27;t work so good anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Well finally I came upon these powder puffers and printed a picture with the sizes and got out my tape measure and showed her about how big they&#x27;d be and she decided on the 4.5&amp;#34; one shown here.&lt;br /&gt;So I went home and ordered it at 9:15am on July 27th from Amazon, now this is important so pay attention, at about 9:45 I get a email saying that my order had been received by Distinct Impressions and that my puffers had been shipped, WHAT??&lt;br /&gt;Are you kidding me, that quick, must be a mistake, maybe?&lt;br /&gt;Nope, they was shipped, all three of them.&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, on the 29th I got them at my Moms in the mail and I was really surprised at how fast they got here, so something must have gotten screwed up so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;I went in and opened them up for my Mom and took them out and WOW, what a puffer they are, really fat and fuzzy and even a silk handle so when you really get to powdering you won&#x27;t drop it, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, they came in a perty pink bag and then inside another plastic zip bag with a note inside on how to clean them with Woolite, ah my Mom&#x27;s favorite soap, she uses it on her undies and claims to have made her undies last some forty years now, hum must be good stuff but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try it.&lt;br /&gt;But anyhow I sent an email to the nice lady who sent these to thank her and she wrote back and told me how she came about having these really good quality puffers.&lt;br /&gt;She had them custom made to her standards her in the U.S.A. for a baby product line she was trying to start but didn&#x27;t work out so she I guess she had a bunch of these left from that business venture.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you, you better grab them up because if she doesn&#x27;t get more made there will never be another puffer as good as these, I guarantee it, and that&#x27;s all I have to say on that.... LOL maybe I&#x27;ll get one for my little girl kitty, she likes girly stuff..&lt;br /&gt;These are an extremely good product and something you just don&#x27;t see anymore and not made in China !!!&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps, oh and the lady is really nice to, so you should buy her stuff as I think she sells dolls and baby stuff anyhow she is really a nice person. Hope this helps you decided.. :-)oap, she uses it on her undies and claims to have made her undies last some forty years now, hum must be good stuff but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try it.&lt;br /&gt;But anyhow I sent an email to the nice lady who sent these to thank her and she wrote back and told me how she came about having these really good quality puffers.&lt;br /&gt;She had them custom made to her standards her in the U.S.A. for a baby product line she was trying to start but didn&#x27;t work out so she I guess she had a bunch of these left from that business venture.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you, you better grab them up because if she doesn&#x27;t get more made there will never be another puffer as good as these, I guarantee it, and that&#x27;s all I have to say on that....

Hope this helps you decided.. :-)</li>
            <li> Its not fluffy like the picture, but it fits in my powder container just right.  This is the only place that I could find a puff.</li>
            <li> Although the powder puff is large and comes in a pretty silk bag, the puff itself is very stiff compared to the velvety one I had that was destroyed by my dog.  This one functions, but I wanted a flexible puff.</li>
            <li> Holds powder well after first washing, and is very gentle on skin. The item did come as described. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of the size. It is a generous 4.5 inch puff just as it says. This is a great quality puff.</li>
            <li> My daughter gives me the loveliest bath powder each Christmas and it is very convenient to have an additional puff for replacement so can always have a clean one.  Enjoy using after fowling off from a shower to make sure I am dry just before dressing.  Can leave the bathroom feeling comfortable and warm even if the house is cool.  Love having this handy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful big puff. Makes putting on those messy powders so much easier. Makes you feel feminine as well.</li>
            <li> use it for medicated powder</li>
            <li> I have looked everywhere in stores to find a bath puff for my Avon bath powder bowl, to no avail. Now, finally, I have just the one. It&#x27;s soft and fluffy, and fits perfectly in the bowl :-)</li>
            <li> THE BEST powder puff out there for the body; it is large enough to apply powder all over my body &amp; love the handle &amp; cute pink case I am now using to hold my pill bottles!</li>
            <li> This puff looks exactly like the picture.  The nice texture and athe ribbon strap across the puff make for easy use.</li>
            <li> This product was just what I expected. I purchased it for a gift and the recipient was very pleased.  I would order again from this company.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to use these puffs, they make putting on power so easy... I very love how pink they are..</li>
            <li> I could not find a power puff at any of the stores I visited locally. I would have to purchase the powder in a container in order to get a puff so I was so pleased when I located these powder puffs online and with an added bonus of a very pretty satin bag. I purchased three, two for myself and one for my two year old granddaughter and they worked great.</li>
            <li> Perfect for putting on my body powder.</li>
            <li> love this powder puff. very well made. worth the money i paid for it. i will purchase this item again</li>
            <li> The puffs are large and very soft. They are perfect for body powder. I love the silk bag which makes it great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I have been looking in all the stores for one of these for myself and for my mother.  Really nice.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for big powder puffs for years.  These are great!!!  They come in a little pink satin bag and are great little gifts.  I ordered 5 and very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> I searched most retail stores, no powder puffs to be found.....this one is awesome!!  It&#x27;s so soft and just the right size.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love it but at the cost next time I will try other ones.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice body powder puff, great for using with talcs and dusting powders.  The ribbon strap helps it stay on your hand while you use it.  It feels very soft and comforting.  A funny thing is - I looked at the picture and thought, I wish I could have a pink satin bag instead of a burgundy one, and to my amazement the bag I received was a pretty pink satin!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to be used in a victorian powder box.  It works perfectly and is so soft and feminine.  Thanks for a great transaction.</li>
            <li> I like a nice large puff for all over body powdering in the heat of summer. This does the job. Not really much you can say about a powder puff except it works.</li>
            <li> My wife is very pleased with this product.  While this may seem an insignificant item, she considered it most important.  It arrived promptly and was everything advertised.  Looking for a similar product in local stores proved unsuccessful and frustrating.  A couple of minutes on line and we found the very thing she was looking for.  We were very satisfied with all aspects of our transaction.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered and received in a timely manner. Would purchase again Thank you</li>
            <li> Powder puffs were hard to find.  Finally found them here.  Good quality.  Would order again. Have to watch out for size though because some are smaller and just for face powder.</li>
            <li> The product was sent out immediately and was well packaged.  It works great. Very thick and holds the powder that I use very well.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> I llke bath powder (actually Johnson&#x27;s baby powder), and for months i kept looking in drug stores, cosmetic stores, etc for a powder puff, to no avail.  Nobody sells them. I finally thought of Amazon, and this one is just right.  It&#x27;s large, it has a strap for your hand, and, importantly it comes with its own plastic bag, inside the pink one, so you have a place to store it between uses.</li>
            <li> This is a quality powder puff. It&#x27;s fluffy and thick and is exactly 4 1/2&amp;#34; wide. The pink puff is a bit lighter than the ribbon but the density of the pile, the thickness of the puff and the width are as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds the powder I pick up and deposits it to my body and not the floor, and the major reason I moved away from using powder tins opting instead for a canister type of container. If you shake these out well after each use they stay fluffy longer. It keeps them cleaner and they do not become matted after repeated uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These also fit perfecting in U.S. Acrylics 3Pcs Spa Canister Set, the shorter, wider one of the three. That particular size canister also holds a 7 ounce tin of fragranced body powder along with this puff with some room to spare. So if you&#x27;re in need of a container for your body powder, prefer something other than a box or tin, check that set out. This puff is a perfect fit along with 7 ounces of body powder. It also keeps the powder and puff moisture and humidity free if you plan on storing it in you bathroom and would like to have it sitting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived quickly and was well packaged and comes with a nice satin bag if you prefer that for storage . I would definitely order this item again. It&#x27;s a quality, and very hard to find item in this size and the price is very reasonable in relation to the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came well packaged in a nice satin bag and was received in a timely manner from the seller. I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> if this is what you where needing and looking for ..it is worth the money ..I did not think they still made them :)</li>
            <li> I got it on time , I was very happy with the service. 5 star rating. Wanda parsons I will order again.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this for my 8 yr. old granddaughter to go with a beauty dust box that I had found at a flea market.  The box was&lt;br /&gt;in perfect shape and was identical to one that I have here at home, which she loves to use.  It was a big surprise for her and&lt;br /&gt;the satin bag that accompanied the puff was just perfect.  Needless to say she loves it all! (of course I added the powder to the&lt;br /&gt;box before I gave it to her.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powder puff, so what can I say. Arrived quickly, and soft as promised. If you need a powder puff, don&#x27;t hesitate. :)</li>
            <li> Needed certain size to fit in jar that I am using for body powder. Took family member advice and bought one.</li>
            <li> Very happy to have found this on Amazon. It was impossible for me to find a powder puff in local stores. I purchased one of each color option (pink and white). They are VERY high quality and extremely soft. I also love that they&#x27;re washable, and I washed them prior to using (although they arrived well packaged and seemed to be very sanitary, so that probably wasn&#x27;t necessary). These are very generously sized and work well. I can see these lasting a long time. Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, and palm-sized. Just right for applying body powders! I couldn&#x27;t find puffs this size anywhere in stores, so I was pleased to find it on line.</li>
            <li> Nice n soft but not as fluffy as I thought</li>
            <li> People is stores did not know what a powder puff was. So I looked on line. I bought 2 puffs and they are just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> puff wasn&#x27;t very fluffy ; hard to handle (ribbon hanndle); it&#x27;s just okay. It came on time - if I can&#x27;t find any others, I may order it again.</li>
            <li> You would not think something as simple as a powder puff would be hard to find, I can assure you it is, I looked everywhere. This one is great.  It meets all the requirements, large, very soft without being too fluffy, pick-up ribbon the back, perfect. Reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job. Honestly, i&#x27;m new to these though, so I don&#x27;t even know if i&#x27;m using it correctly.</li>
            <li> not easy to find. it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> the other powder puffs were too small. This was the right size.  It is soft and feels good against your skin  as you rub powder over all parts of your body.</li>
            <li> I got this for travel and it works well with my powder... Nothing special but it works well. I would buy it again.</li>
