            <li>This is the BEST shampoo and conditioner for little kids hair.</li>

            <li>I like the smooth after effects of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I like that it is kid friendly and leaves my daughters hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>and it was getting tangled so easily after using the regular kids shampoo from the grocery store that I needed a good shampoo and conditioner option.</li>
            <li>My daughters entire bathroom smelled amazing after her bath that night!</li>
            <li>Love Hot Tot.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely suggest this to any parent who is dealing with tangles or is just looking for a great quality product to make their child&#x27;s hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very &amp;#34;difficult&amp;#34; hair but hot tot products are simply the best!</li>
            <li>We use the shampoo, conditioner, sweet pea serum and detangled.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell, though, and wonder if the results would be better on thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I was given a few samples of this conditioner along with a bottle of shampoo and loved them both!</li>
            <li>It does have a very strong fruity fragrance, so those sensitive to perfumes won&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li>(she was pretty bald for the first two years of her life!); this product does the trick!  </li>
            <li>I use the hot tot shampoo and conditioner regularly for my girls curly hair and love it:)</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t had tears since we started using the hot tot product line!</li>
            <li>I use the Hot Tot Curl Serum to help define my little one&#x27;s beautiful curls.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how easy her hair was to brush through just from using the conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, does not leave any residue or make the hair feel heavy, and has a great scent.  </li>
            <li>My girl&#x27;s hair is long and gets tangled very easily.  </li>
            <li>First of all let me just state</li>
            <li>My children&#x27;s hair has been transformed since we started using Hot Tot Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for your child&#x27;s hair!!  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything for my daughter with long but very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Most of the &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; products are pretty junky and leave his hair dry with a residue.</li>
            <li>When I used the conditioner, it was so easy to comb through their hair, plus it was even easier the next day.  </li>
            <li>and I have had a hard time finding a good shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My oldest son has very curly / unruly hair</li>
            <li>She has very fine hair, and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my kids sensitive skin and gets their clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It also left my daughters hair soft and the tangles were easy to brush out.</li>
            <li>It keeps his curls soft and pretty</li>
            <li>After using the Hot Tot Shampoo, when you put this on you can immediately feel the difference in how silky and soft the hair gets.</li>
            <li>I bought the hot tot conditioner to use on my 2 year old twin girl&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Natural Ingredients and NO Harsh Chemicals--made HOT TOT a winner in my book before I even tried it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my three year old daughters hair feeling so silky!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely a fan of Hot Tot products</li>
            <li>With using the Hot tot shampoo and conditioner, my daughters hair can be brushed with ease.</li>
            <li>and it feels so soft!</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is beautiful and thick and is just now needing some conditioner a few times a week</li>
            <li>But no hives so far, just yummy smelling hair.</li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin and allergies</li>
            <li>Thanks for an amazing product for my 10 month old daughter&#x27;s crazy hair.</li>
            <li>This is the only conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my kiddo&#x27;s hair down, makes it super soft</li>

            <li> After using for a  few days, her hair will look greasy and...kinda grungy.  </li>

            <li> People always compliment the smell of my little one&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> No more puffy frizzy curls that are like a rats nest to brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t bad, but nothing that has separated it from the standard kids shampoos on the market for me.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive, for what I got.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not impressed with this shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>

            <li> My daughter has very &amp;#34;difficult&amp;#34; hair but hot tot products are simply the best! Will not regret it. I&#x27;d use these for myself but they are bit pricey lol</li>
            <li> I love the way that this product smells. My daughters entire bathroom smelled amazing after her bath that night! The scent lasts a long time. During my daughters bath the following night when I poured water on her head it rejuvenated the smell.  It also left my daughters hair soft and the tangles were easy to brush out.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It leaves my three year old daughters hair feeling so silky! I will never use another product!</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; smells great too!</li>
            <li> I use the Hot Tot Curl Serum to help define my little one&#x27;s beautiful curls.

            <li> My son has fine curly hair and this product is the best for that !  It keeps his curls soft and pretty and I can always tell when my husband tries to short cut and wash his hair with another product.  We use the shampoo, conditioner, sweet pea serum and detangled.  I don&#x27;t have any local salons that carry the products so we have to buy online.  I hope that changes at some point,but I&#x27;m a loyal customer now !</li>
            <li> Love this for my daughtwr. She has very fine hair, and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Small amount goes a long way. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this for her for a long time!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is one of a kind!  There is nothing on the market like it.

People always compliment the smell of my little one&#x27;s hair!</li>

            <li> With using the Hot tot shampoo and conditioner, my daughters hair can be brushed with ease. I don&#x27;t even need to use the detangler. I was surprised how easy her hair was to brush through just from using the conditioner. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Natural Ingredients and NO Harsh Chemicals--made HOT TOT a winner in my book before I even tried it. First of all let me just state how much I LOVE the smell of the Shampoo and Conditioner-it is impossible to not cuddle up and sniff your child&#x27;s hair after using Hot Tot products.

            <li> Love this conditioner!!  My oldest son has very curly / unruly hair and I have had a hard time finding a good shampoo and conditioner.  Most of the &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; products are pretty junky and leave his hair dry with a residue. Not Hot Tots.  It is the best kids conditioner I have found.  His hair is soft, clean and smells so good!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and is the perfect conditioner for waist long hair of my toddler. We use California Baby but needed a product that deals with tangles and longer hair. This solved our needs and we were able to stay chemical free</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great but when you use the conditioner too, the results are amazing. My 2 year old daughter has long curly hair and it was getting tangled so easily after using the regular kids shampoo from the grocery store that I needed a good shampoo and conditioner option. This conditioner is exactly what I was looking for. After using the Hot Tot Shampoo, when you put this on you can immediately feel the difference in how silky and soft the hair gets. The shine is a huge plus too. I would absolutely suggest this to any parent who is dealing with tangles or is just looking for a great quality product to make their child&#x27;s hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> After developing a reaction to my regular shampoo/conditioner, I thought baby products would be less likely to contain allergens and irritants. Just tried this conditioner and it made my thick, dry, long hair shiny and soft! It does have a very strong fruity fragrance, so those sensitive to perfumes won&#x27;t like this. But no hives so far, just yummy smelling hair. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> Saw this line on Shark Tank, and was eager to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;I have the shampoo, conditioner, and detangler. I have not noticed any change in my daughters hair, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t bad, but nothing that has separated it from the standard kids shampoos on the market for me.  Too expensive, for what I got.</li>
            <li> Thanks for an amazing product for my 10 month old daughter&#x27;s crazy hair. I have tried several shampoo/conditioner combos on her hair and nothing compares to this! She has sensitive skin and allergies and I love that this product is both safe and effective. It works great, rinses out of her hair well, smells good, and makes her hair soft and easy to deal with! LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love Hot Tot. Gentle on my kids sensitive skin and gets their clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Product is good but the packaging bottle pump should be improved.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST shampoo and conditioner for little kids hair. I have tried everything for my daughter with long but very fine hair. this keeps away tangles and keeps her hair manageable not to mention it smells lovely!</li>
            <li> I bought the hot tot conditioner to use on my 2 year old twin girl&#x27;s hair.  Absolutely love this product.  It is gentle, does not leave any residue or make the hair feel heavy, and has a great scent.  My girl&#x27;s hair is long and gets tangled very easily.  When I used the conditioner, it was so easy to comb through their hair, plus it was even easier the next day.  No frizz or knots.  I highly recommend this product for your child&#x27;s hair!!  Also loved the shampoo as well!!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is beautiful and thick and is just now needing some conditioner a few times a week (she was pretty bald for the first two years of her life!); this product does the trick!  It&#x27;s a great complement to my Hot Tot shampoo.  We will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works wonderful on my son&#x27;s wavy hair. It also makes his hair smell wonderful and it feels so soft!</li>
            <li> I like the smooth after effects of this conditioner. I like that it is kid friendly and leaves my daughters hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Along with the shampoo this is simply a must have for all kids.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful but I&#x27;m not impressed with this shampoo/conditioner combo. Does not detangle or condition.</li>
            <li> great for mommy hair, too! // for those with fine hair that would like some volume!</li>
            <li> Left my child&#x27;s hair extremely dry</li>
