            <li>I am soooo pleased with the towel for my hair!</li>
            <li>the most pleasant surprise was that its practically weightless.</li>
            <li>A huge time saver and a great help keeping the hair dryer damage to a minimum.</li>

            <li>I liked mine</li>

            <li>I love the fabric and the very light weight.</li>
            <li>I love this towel.  </li>
            <li>(After about ten years, mine has had better days, but still works great!)  </li>
            <li>Then my kid decided to take my towel over, so I had to purchase more --</li>
            <li>The kids love them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are great at absorbing water.  </li>
            <li>just wish there would have been better designing on the size for function.</li>
            <li>I received my hair towel today and was pleased with the size and material used.</li>
            <li>Love this towel.</li>
            <li>This hair towel is great for absorbing excess  water off your hair.  </li>
            <li>Quality wise, the towel feels soft but dense, in a good way.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this towel.  </li>
            <li>I ordered more.</li>
            <li>love the size of it too…</li>
            <li>Looking forward to ordering more colors and gifting to my fellow curlies</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll just buy some more for my trips.</li>
            <li>I love this towel.</li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE these towels.</li>
            <li>I got one as a gift years ago, and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have never written a review on Amazon and when I saw that Amazin(hey, that&#x27;s a prety good typo for Amazon, right?)</li>
            <li>so far, so good!</li>
            <li>After having kids, I started using the towel to dry and wrap my hair -- perfect for this as well.  </li>
            <li>I am able to wrap up all of my hair in this and it stays up just fine wrapped up like a turban.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair towel and is nice and large plus very absorbent.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy not having a ton of weight on top of my head pulling on my hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first Aquis Microfiber towel that I&#x27;ve purchased but I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li>I can easily twist it up in a turban so that all of my hair stays wrapped up.</li>
            <li>Drys my hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying  more of these towels to keep on hand to put in gift baskets along with some candles and bath goodies for quick gift giving.</li>
            <li>This works great and is not too big.</li>
            <li>I will begin to sound like an LP, 33 and 1/3 revolutions per minute if I keep on reviewing.</li>
            <li>I even take one on trips now because it is indispensable.</li>
            <li>This towel is more than worth its price.  </li>
            <li>It is light but effectively dries hair much quicker.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair towel…it feels like it just instantly takes the moisture right out of your hair!  </li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly and easily tucks on head if you want to keep it on while finishing your morning routine.</li>
            <li>easily washable and dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>So excited to find this towel.  </li>
            <li>Works great on long hair.</li>
            <li>Love these I own several of them</li>
            <li>It is great to dry hair after shampoo.</li>
            <li>It was perfect -- small size -- dries quickly -- super-absorbant.  </li>
            <li>Great for long hair!!</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find a towel that was not only the right size to wrap around my hair after showering, but was super absorbant.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly, keeps most of the curl and the towel itself dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>here I am, and meanwhile, the first towel I bought 3 years back is still in great condition.</li>
            <li>My daughter has a good head of hair and our big towels weren&#x27;t working so well.  </li>
            <li>The Aquis towels just aren&#x27;t good enough for me to get away with using one, but I expect that of any microfiber towel.  </li>
            <li>the Aquis is true.</li>
            <li>Also, not that soft or nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dream come true.  </li>
            <li>Is this towel supposed to dry more effectively?  </li>
            <li>very light weight and doesn&#x27;t tug on your hair which is great as hair is more fragile when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a bonus that it comes in such cute colors :)</li>
            <li>The towel also dries quickly, preventing that mildew problem some people get in humid areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the main one for more than 10 years</li>
            <li>the towel is Ok, not as absorbant as the one I already own, but I am sure I ordered a white one not pink recommend it, but check colour when ordering</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and dries my hair pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>I sleep with mine on my long hair and wake up with gorgeous, frizz-free waves.</li>
            <li>Great product, would highly recommend (especially for us curly/wavy-haired men and women.</li>
            <li>Feels good to the touch and doesn&#x27;t stick to your fingers if you have chapped and dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact, so easy to roll up and pack for travel or for the gym.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised!</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the pink color is really pretty. :)</li>
            <li>Just the right size, and I have medium length tick hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size to travel with as well.  </li>
            <li>It removes more moisture from hair than normal bath towels so really helps speed up hair drying time when blow drying.</li>
            <li>It may have absorbed slightly more than my regular towels.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own a hair dryer and like to air or towel dry my hair.</li>
            <li>great hair towel - i don&#x27;t want to go back to regular towels.</li>
            <li>A regular towel will not do just fine!</li>
            <li>and it absorbs very fast.  </li>
            <li>I have had one of these towels for many years and was delighted to find a new one,  My only gripe is that this one is not quite as long and have a problem keeping it on my hea while drying my body.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t delay, they go FAST!</li>
            <li>but it really works!</li>
            <li>The first one I have still works, but</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li>All the other towels were thicker than this one &amp; had a nice texture.  </li>
            <li>Just a note, it was strange to use at first because this towel doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly along your skin like most towels do (which kind of makes it necessary for you to pat dry with it).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, soft, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I purchased this a few months ago and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>Could tell after touching the towel it would help dry my curly hair faster!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t quite understand why someone might need a &amp;#34;hair towel&amp;#34; when a regular towel will do just fine.</li>
            <li>If one had a smaller head and shorter hair, probably it would be fine.</li>
            <li>dries hair quickly and gently, easy to wrap like a turban, just the right size, my hair is a about 4 inches past shoulder length</li>
            <li>and it gave it a really scratchy feeling.</li>
            <li>I bought this towel for the fast drying reviews, and I did notice a difference in moisture absorption but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier on your neck and shoulders</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also given these as gifts and all have been very well received.</li>
            <li>microfiber towel is much easier on the neck than a cotton terry towel.</li>
            <li>I now have two of these and love them for use on my wet hair.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I&#x27;d gotten one of these years ago.</li>
            <li>This towel really absorbs water.</li>
            <li>I wrap it around my hair straight out of the shower and leave it on for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>This towel also drys exceptionally fast.</li>
            <li>It absorbs water very well and</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, A+!</li>
            <li>This towel works really well.  </li>
            <li>Works just as advertised thanks</li>
            <li>very absorbent like they say .</li>
            <li>I think it works really well.</li>
            <li>Better than i expected.</li>
            <li>Makes hair drying much faster.</li>
            <li>It is pretty effective at drying my long hair, I just wrap it up turban style, take it off about 30 minutes later and have damp, but not dripping hair.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the problem could be using fabric softener, but I bought a new one and didn&#x27;t use softener</li>
            <li>I would then bring one side up and over the top of my head and the the other side.  </li>
            <li>drape the towel over my head so that a short side runs from where my left jaw meets my neck to the top of my right ear; let gravity pull it more or less lengthwise towards the floor, covering the hair</li>
            <li>With this, I just flip my hair upside down and scrunch the product in my hair straight after a shower and then ball it up on the top of my head and then wrap this towel around it.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and super fast, this is my third one...</li>
            <li>The towel is very well-made and looks like it will hold up well to repeated washings, but I would have preferred more bulk to the towel i.e. some loops to improve absorbency.&lt;br /&gt;Aquis should include instructions for how to tie a hair turban in their packaging since this 39-inch towel is smaller than a standard bath towel.  </li>
            <li>i use this towel every single day for my breakage prone fine hair.</li>
            <li>Since she loves them so much, I thought I&#x27;d get her new towels.</li>
            <li>The towel itself dries quickly and these towels last forever.  </li>
            <li>and I love them… once you use them, you&#x27;ll never go back to a regular towel for your hair again</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this hair towel.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, highly absorbant.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it….I</li>
            <li>(it is her second one and the first lasted for 6 years!).</li>
            <li>When i wake up, my hair is smooth and dry, and my curls look very alive and intact.  </li>
            <li>It wraps easy and stays on your head leaving you to do other things.</li>
            <li>I would like to point out that my original towel is at least 10 years old and going strong.  </li>
            <li>I like the light pink color, too.</li>
            <li>They are different to get use to, but are worth it when you see how well they work.</li>
            <li>after almost seven years of constant use, I figured it was time to get a fresh one.  </li>
            <li>It did not help dry hair any better than a regular towel.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without mine.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this towel to match some new towels.</li>
            <li>tuck the free end tip of the towel into the back under the short end that ran diagonally across the nape of the neck&lt;</li>
            <li>It helps dry my hair quickly.....</li>
            <li>This does dry my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>I even tried drying my hair with a regular towel FIRST and then used this towel wrapped around my hair for quite a while.</li>
            <li>We use them for the hot tub outside (spa type towels)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never purchased a microfiber towel for my hair, but I&#x27;ve bought many in the past for my vehicle.</li>
            <li>Wrote a 5-Star review about it, and promised if they offer other hues, I would be back for more....</li>
            <li>Also, it isn&#x27;t long enough to securely keep in place when you wrap a turban.</li>
            <li>It is pretty and soft but it will not stay tucked on my head and I am not a big woman with a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>Since I bought it to make my hair dry quicker at least during the winter months, I&#x27;d say it does a good job for what I intended.</li>
            <li>It is large enough for me and is soft.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t justify spending this much money on such a small towel that barely does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I gently squeezed the hair on the sides and back</li>
            <li>I wring as much water out as possible after I shower and then wrap my hair in this baby for about 20 minutes while I do my makeup.  </li>
            <li>It almost completely dries hair on</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, it doesn&#x27;t totally soak the moisture out of my hair and for me isn&#x27;t too much more absorbent than a regular towel.</li>
            <li>This towel is very soft and is a pretty shade of pink.</li>
            <li>I machine wash it in hot water but hang it up to dry.</li>
            <li>They are large enough for my long hair and stay in place until I&#x27;m ready to take my hair out.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t claim that it drastically cut down my drying time (I towel dried pretty thoroughly in the past), but it&#x27;s a great size and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>My hair is pretty dry after 10 minutes in the towel (no dripping), and that&#x27;s saying a lot!</li>
            <li>They perform their job, such soft material meeting my hair&#x27;s needs!!</li>
            <li>I have long hair and it really dries it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about 50% dry when I take it down and dries the rest of the way very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It works no better than an ordinary good terry towel.</li>
            <li>It is not an acrobatic skill to keep it on top of your head (with classic length hair), and the ends actually can be tucked in because it&#x27;s so thin.</li>
            <li>She already has two very very old Aquis towels which she uses constantly and they are getting warn out.  </li>
            <li>They also dry rather quickly after use, so you don&#x27;t have to really worry about any of the ickiness that usually comes along with soggy, damp towels.</li>
            <li>A must for people with curly hair since it doesn&#x27;t act like a regular towel does, which extracts your natural oils</li>
            <li>This towel is very absorbent, but wet hair tends to stick to it which sometimes makes it break off.</li>
            <li>I have to tie the turban differently than I would with a bath towel to completely cover my hair.  </li>
            <li>This particular towel, which I washed &amp; hung to dry before using, is much thinner than the previous purchased ones.  </li>
            <li>I am 61 and have thin enough hair as it is, and I didn&#x27;t want to lose any more than I had to.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to a product that actually saved significant time by wicking away moisture from my thick wavy medium length hair,but this didn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li>so I still use the towels because they really cut down on my hair drying time.</li>
            <li>Really cuts down on drying time for my hair.</li>
            <li>However, the towel is left pretty wet after I unwrap my hair, and it takes it a while to dry out.</li>
            <li>They really do take out a lot of the water so less drying.</li>
            <li>Really cuts drying time in half.</li>
            <li>I just take off the towel after a little bit, put it some Deva clips for volume and then leave them in there until I&#x27;m finished getting ready and</li>
            <li>Hair loss has been an issue, and this little gem is so gentle, not pulling or tugging on hair.  </li>
            <li>Wrapping my hair in this towel while I get ready helps it dry faster than any other towel I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li> Love this towel!</li>
            <li> I am soooo pleased with the towel for my hair!</li>
            <li> the most pleasant surprise was that its practically weightless.</li>
            <li> A huge time saver and a great help keeping the hair dryer damage to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I liked it so ugh</li>
            <li> I liked mine</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>

            <li> I love the fabric and the very light weight.</li>
            <li> I love this towel.  </li>
            <li> (After about ten years, mine has had better days, but still works great!)  </li>
            <li> Then my kid decided to take my towel over, so I had to purchase more --</li>
            <li> The kids love them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are great at absorbing water.  </li>
            <li> just wish there would have been better designing on the size for function.</li>
            <li> I received my hair towel today and was pleased with the size and material used.</li>
            <li> Love this towel.</li>
            <li> This hair towel is great for absorbing excess  water off your hair.  </li>
            <li> Quality wise, the towel feels soft but dense, in a good way.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this towel.  </li>
            <li> I ordered more.</li>
            <li> love the size of it too…</li>
            <li> Looking forward to ordering more colors and gifting to my fellow curlies</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll just buy some more for my trips.</li>
            <li> I love this towel.</li>
            <li> I love this item.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these towels.</li>
            <li> I got one as a gift years ago, and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review on Amazon and when I saw that Amazin(hey, that&#x27;s a prety good typo for Amazon, right?)</li>
            <li> so far, so good!</li>
            <li> After having kids, I started using the towel to dry and wrap my hair -- perfect for this as well.  </li>
            <li> I am able to wrap up all of my hair in this and it stays up just fine wrapped up like a turban.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair towel and is nice and large plus very absorbent.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy not having a ton of weight on top of my head pulling on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first Aquis Microfiber towel that I&#x27;ve purchased but I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> I can easily twist it up in a turban so that all of my hair stays wrapped up.</li>
            <li> Drys my hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I plan on buying  more of these towels to keep on hand to put in gift baskets along with some candles and bath goodies for quick gift giving.</li>
            <li> This works great and is not too big.</li>
            <li> I will begin to sound like an LP, 33 and 1/3 revolutions per minute if I keep on reviewing.</li>
            <li> I even take one on trips now because it is indispensable.</li>
            <li> This towel is more than worth its price.  </li>
            <li> It is light but effectively dries hair much quicker.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair towel…it feels like it just instantly takes the moisture right out of your hair!  </li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly and easily tucks on head if you want to keep it on while finishing your morning routine.</li>
            <li> easily washable and dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> So excited to find this towel.  </li>
            <li> Works great on long hair.</li>
            <li> Love these I own several of them</li>
            <li> It is great to dry hair after shampoo.</li>
            <li> It was perfect -- small size -- dries quickly -- super-absorbant.  </li>
            <li> Great for long hair!!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find a towel that was not only the right size to wrap around my hair after showering, but was super absorbant.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly, keeps most of the curl and the towel itself dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> here I am, and meanwhile, the first towel I bought 3 years back is still in great condition.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a good head of hair and our big towels weren&#x27;t working so well.  </li>
            <li> The Aquis towels just aren&#x27;t good enough for me to get away with using one, but I expect that of any microfiber towel.  </li>
            <li> the Aquis is true.</li>
            <li> Also, not that soft or nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dream come true.  </li>
            <li> Is this towel supposed to dry more effectively?  </li>
            <li> very light weight and doesn&#x27;t tug on your hair which is great as hair is more fragile when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a bonus that it comes in such cute colors :)</li>
            <li> The towel also dries quickly, preventing that mildew problem some people get in humid areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the main one for more than 10 years</li>
            <li> the towel is Ok, not as absorbant as the one I already own, but I am sure I ordered a white one not pink recommend it, but check colour when ordering</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and dries my hair pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> I sleep with mine on my long hair and wake up with gorgeous, frizz-free waves.</li>
            <li> Great product, would highly recommend (especially for us curly/wavy-haired men and women.</li>
            <li> Feels good to the touch and doesn&#x27;t stick to your fingers if you have chapped and dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact, so easy to roll up and pack for travel or for the gym.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised!</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the pink color is really pretty. :)</li>
            <li> Just the right size, and I have medium length tick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size to travel with as well.  </li>
            <li> It removes more moisture from hair than normal bath towels so really helps speed up hair drying time when blow drying.</li>
            <li> It may have absorbed slightly more than my regular towels.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own a hair dryer and like to air or towel dry my hair.</li>
            <li> great hair towel - i don&#x27;t want to go back to regular towels.</li>
            <li> A regular towel will not do just fine!</li>
            <li> and it absorbs very fast.  </li>
            <li> I have had one of these towels for many years and was delighted to find a new one,  My only gripe is that this one is not quite as long and have a problem keeping it on my hea while drying my body.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t delay, they go FAST!</li>
            <li> but it really works!</li>
            <li> The first one I have still works, but</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li> All the other towels were thicker than this one &amp; had a nice texture.  </li>
            <li> Just a note, it was strange to use at first because this towel doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly along your skin like most towels do (which kind of makes it necessary for you to pat dry with it).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, soft, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> Could tell after touching the towel it would help dry my curly hair faster!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t quite understand why someone might need a &amp;#34;hair towel&amp;#34; when a regular towel will do just fine.</li>
            <li> If one had a smaller head and shorter hair, probably it would be fine.</li>
            <li> dries hair quickly and gently, easy to wrap like a turban, just the right size, my hair is a about 4 inches past shoulder length</li>
            <li> and it gave it a really scratchy feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this towel for the fast drying reviews, and I did notice a difference in moisture absorption but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier on your neck and shoulders</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also given these as gifts and all have been very well received.</li>
            <li> microfiber towel is much easier on the neck than a cotton terry towel.</li>
            <li> I now have two of these and love them for use on my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I&#x27;d gotten one of these years ago.</li>
            <li> This towel really absorbs water.</li>
            <li> I wrap it around my hair straight out of the shower and leave it on for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> This towel also drys exceptionally fast.</li>
            <li> It absorbs water very well and</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, A+!</li>
            <li> This towel works really well.  </li>
            <li> Works just as advertised thanks</li>
            <li> very absorbent like they say .</li>
            <li> I think it works really well.</li>
            <li> Better than i expected.</li>
            <li> Makes hair drying much faster.</li>
            <li> It is pretty effective at drying my long hair, I just wrap it up turban style, take it off about 30 minutes later and have damp, but not dripping hair.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the problem could be using fabric softener, but I bought a new one and didn&#x27;t use softener</li>
            <li> I would then bring one side up and over the top of my head and the the other side.  </li>
            <li> drape the towel over my head so that a short side runs from where my left jaw meets my neck to the top of my right ear; let gravity pull it more or less lengthwise towards the floor, covering the hair</li>
            <li> With this, I just flip my hair upside down and scrunch the product in my hair straight after a shower and then ball it up on the top of my head and then wrap this towel around it.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and super fast, this is my third one...</li>
            <li> The towel is very well-made and looks like it will hold up well to repeated washings, but I would have preferred more bulk to the towel i.e. some loops to improve absorbency.&lt;br /&gt;Aquis should include instructions for how to tie a hair turban in their packaging since this 39-inch towel is smaller than a standard bath towel.  </li>
            <li> i use this towel every single day for my breakage prone fine hair.</li>
            <li> Since she loves them so much, I thought I&#x27;d get her new towels.</li>
            <li> The towel itself dries quickly and these towels last forever.  </li>
            <li> and I love them… once you use them, you&#x27;ll never go back to a regular towel for your hair again</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this hair towel.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, highly absorbant.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it….I</li>
            <li> (it is her second one and the first lasted for 6 years!).</li>
            <li> When i wake up, my hair is smooth and dry, and my curls look very alive and intact.  </li>
            <li> It wraps easy and stays on your head leaving you to do other things.</li>
            <li> I would like to point out that my original towel is at least 10 years old and going strong.  </li>
            <li> I like the light pink color, too.</li>
            <li> They are different to get use to, but are worth it when you see how well they work.</li>
            <li> after almost seven years of constant use, I figured it was time to get a fresh one.  </li>
            <li> It did not help dry hair any better than a regular towel.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without mine.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this towel to match some new towels.</li>
            <li> tuck the free end tip of the towel into the back under the short end that ran diagonally across the nape of the neck&lt;</li>
            <li> It helps dry my hair quickly.....</li>
            <li> This does dry my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> I even tried drying my hair with a regular towel FIRST and then used this towel wrapped around my hair for quite a while.</li>
            <li> We use them for the hot tub outside (spa type towels)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased a microfiber towel for my hair, but I&#x27;ve bought many in the past for my vehicle.</li>
            <li> Wrote a 5-Star review about it, and promised if they offer other hues, I would be back for more....</li>
            <li> Also, it isn&#x27;t long enough to securely keep in place when you wrap a turban.</li>
            <li> It is pretty and soft but it will not stay tucked on my head and I am not a big woman with a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Since I bought it to make my hair dry quicker at least during the winter months, I&#x27;d say it does a good job for what I intended.</li>
            <li> It is large enough for me and is soft.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t justify spending this much money on such a small towel that barely does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I gently squeezed the hair on the sides and back</li>
            <li> I wring as much water out as possible after I shower and then wrap my hair in this baby for about 20 minutes while I do my makeup.  </li>
            <li> It almost completely dries hair on</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, it doesn&#x27;t totally soak the moisture out of my hair and for me isn&#x27;t too much more absorbent than a regular towel.</li>
            <li> This towel is very soft and is a pretty shade of pink.</li>
            <li> I machine wash it in hot water but hang it up to dry.</li>
            <li> They are large enough for my long hair and stay in place until I&#x27;m ready to take my hair out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t claim that it drastically cut down my drying time (I towel dried pretty thoroughly in the past), but it&#x27;s a great size and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty dry after 10 minutes in the towel (no dripping), and that&#x27;s saying a lot!</li>
            <li> They perform their job, such soft material meeting my hair&#x27;s needs!!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it really dries it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about 50% dry when I take it down and dries the rest of the way very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It works no better than an ordinary good terry towel.</li>
            <li> It is not an acrobatic skill to keep it on top of your head (with classic length hair), and the ends actually can be tucked in because it&#x27;s so thin.</li>
            <li> She already has two very very old Aquis towels which she uses constantly and they are getting warn out.  </li>
            <li> They also dry rather quickly after use, so you don&#x27;t have to really worry about any of the ickiness that usually comes along with soggy, damp towels.</li>
            <li> A must for people with curly hair since it doesn&#x27;t act like a regular towel does, which extracts your natural oils</li>
            <li> This towel is very absorbent, but wet hair tends to stick to it which sometimes makes it break off.</li>
            <li> I have to tie the turban differently than I would with a bath towel to completely cover my hair.  </li>
            <li> This particular towel, which I washed &amp; hung to dry before using, is much thinner than the previous purchased ones.  </li>
            <li> I am 61 and have thin enough hair as it is, and I didn&#x27;t want to lose any more than I had to.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to a product that actually saved significant time by wicking away moisture from my thick wavy medium length hair,but this didn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> so I still use the towels because they really cut down on my hair drying time.</li>
            <li> Really cuts down on drying time for my hair.</li>
            <li> However, the towel is left pretty wet after I unwrap my hair, and it takes it a while to dry out.</li>
            <li> They really do take out a lot of the water so less drying.</li>
            <li> Really cuts drying time in half.</li>
            <li> I just take off the towel after a little bit, put it some Deva clips for volume and then leave them in there until I&#x27;m finished getting ready and</li>
            <li> Hair loss has been an issue, and this little gem is so gentle, not pulling or tugging on hair.  </li>
            <li> Wrapping my hair in this towel while I get ready helps it dry faster than any other towel I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This towel just sucks the water right out of my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was barely damp and was dry by the time I went to bed.  </li>
            <li> I have curly, frizz-prone hair, and this towel really helps tame it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair any better than my regular towels.  </li>
            <li> It takes up far less space than a traditional towel and soaks up water like a champ!</li>
            <li> It normally takes me about 10-15 minutes to get my hair dry (using a blow dryer), but if I pull my hair up into this towel, it can cut that time down to under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have long hair, order the larger towel.</li>
            <li> After my shower I put the towel under my hair in back holding the long sides in either hand.  </li>
            <li> for long or for short hair.</li>
            <li> It is truly absorbent as advertised, but for my long hair it&#x27;s about 6 inches too short to allow it to be wrapped and tucked efficiently.</li>
            <li> Likewise, it is long/wide enough to gather all my hair and still tuck into the back of wrap as snugly or loosely as I want.  </li>
            <li> The only reason for not giving 5 stars is there should be a loop on it to hang to dry.</li>
            <li> They are lightweight as opposed to a regular bath towel and they really dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> 2 white and one blue and one pink.</li>
            <li> I rate this towel the same as I rated the two other ones above this comment?</li>
            <li> To get my hair as dry as possible to minimize blow drying, I use TWO towels:  one to towel dry my hair, and another to put my hair into a turban while I have breakfast.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have long hair.  </li>
            <li> I feel so passionate about this item that 1st</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like pink, and since this is the only color they are offering I&#x27;m taking one).</li>
            <li> And for exercising or the gym - any sports, it folds up so small, a normal towel would take up 5x&#x27;s the space.</li>
            <li> The color is now closer to white than pink.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for drying long hair after showering at the gym.  </li>
            <li> , I just have a lot of hair that takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> I hate having wet hair dripping down my back when I&#x27;m drying off after a bath, but at the same time, I don&#x27;t like having a separate bath towel just for my hair - they&#x27;re bulky and don&#x27;t do nearly as good of a job.</li>
            <li> It cuts hair drying time for my long curly hair by 1/2!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands but always come back to this brand.</li>
            <li> I wrap my hair in it while I dry off and brush my teeth</li>
            <li> I take showers in the evening and try to towel dry my hair by squeezing the water out.</li>
            <li> You will feel like your hair is already dry just from towelling.</li>
            <li> - YOU BECOME COMPLETELY DRY.</li>
            <li> I also use it to quickly dry class on our shower enclosure.</li>
            <li> It does seem to dry my hair a bit faster, especially when I plop, but this towel gets soaked within a few minutes of using it, so I think I may need a second one.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not thrilled with the quality of this particular one</li>
            <li> I have hair that falls midway down my back.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is really dry!  </li>
            <li> A bit weird at first but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> All the regular bath towels are way to big and too heavy, I always felt like my head was going to fall off!</li>
            <li> Very soft and thick material.</li>
            <li> Then I can get dressed without soaking wet hair.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair faster &amp; then the blow drying takes only few minutes.</li>
            <li> It was money well spent.</li>
            <li> I have thick natural curly hair (3b/c) and have always struggled with frizz.</li>
            <li> It has a strange texture, nothing like the ones bought previously.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my slightly damp only took about half the time to style.</li>
            <li> I use the Aquis Microfiber Hair Towel&#x27;s to cut down on the time it takes me to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> If only this were wider than 19 inches, I could wrap my hair up tightly so that the towel might absorb the moisture it claims to absorb!</li>
            <li> Pretty big disappointment for the price.</li>
            <li> If you have long, thick hair I definitely recommend these towels.</li>
            <li> After one wash with other items, it became so ingrained with fibers from other clothes that it was unusable.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first  </li>
            <li> I still use the small one for traveling, or when the big one is in the wash.</li>
            <li> I always put my hair up in a little turban to let it dry.  </li>
            <li> This morning I wet down my hair and wrapped the towel around it like I had the night before</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth it.  </li>
            <li> They can get sour smelling after a while.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down on the sizing and staying put, however, I do like the feel and absorbency of the towel</li>
            <li> I was hopeful, but ended up feeling let down.</li>
            <li> ( My hair comes down to my sholders).  </li>
            <li> It helps cut your drying time in half.</li>
            <li> it leaves a residue or coating on the fabric, and makes them less absorbent.</li>
            <li> , i have long thick hair</li>
            <li> For someone with thick, long hair, this is a MUST-HAVE.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, and long hair (about 20 inches)</li>
            <li> If you have long, thick, and/or</li>
            <li> Out of frustration, I held the towel tightly around my hair to give it a chance to absorb the moisture.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that this towel is too small.  </li>
            <li> I usually replace them every year and a half or as needed because sometimes they accidentally get thrown in the washer with fabric softer and this causes them to be less absorbent and need to be replaced quicker.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you have short, thin hair it might work, but not for my type.</li>
            <li> I purchased one for my daughter and one for myself a few months ago.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried one of these hair towels, you don&#x27;t know what you are missing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I dried my hair before this towel.</li>
            <li> , I would recommend washing it on hand wash and then letting it air dry; I read somewhere that it&#x27;s not good to put microfiber towels in the dryer</li>
            <li> The towel is thick enough to gather excess water from thick hair without towel being too thick to handle effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> We both have very thick hair that takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> (I sometimes refer to myself as a pinhead..haha) with not a ton of hair &amp; this towel will not stay wrapped on my head which I find super annoying since that</li>
            <li> but it was just too small to make a turban</li>
            <li> I can usually make a turban out of any towel, but this is just too small.</li>
            <li> I have a small head</li>
            <li> Too small to wrap around head and stay there.</li>
            <li> There is NO better product anywhere.</li>
            <li> (my hair is about 9 inches past my shoulders, for a reference point).</li>
            <li> These towels are very thin and lightweight, but are insanely absorbent and will get you dry in a flash (and all you have to do is pat dry very gently to accomplish this, there&#x27;s no need for any harsh continual rubbing of your skin with this towel).</li>
            <li> I use these towels at the gym because trying to change into street clothes after a shower is difficult unless I am completely dry.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of these towels, and hardly ever use an electric dryer for my hair.</li>
            <li> , it has cut blow drying by at least 5-8 min for me</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and was using the Deva towel</li>
            <li> This towel is not effective for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair.  </li>
            <li> as some of the hotels hairdryers take forever with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this towel for anyone with really thick hair.  </li>
            <li> and it still ended up with a faint sour scent after a while.</li>
            <li> I bought the colored ones, so I would see it in the hotel bathroom and not accidentally leave it behind.  </li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but all I have to say was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this towel.  It&#x27;s light and dries my hair pretty quick.  I got one for myself and both my daughters.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a good head of hair and our big towels weren&#x27;t working so well.  This works great and is not too big.</li>
            <li> This towel is seriously amazing! I have thick curly hair and was using the Deva towel but it was just too small to make a turban so I&#x27;d have to settle with only scrunching the excess water out and still I had to walk around with soaking, dripping hair... yuck! With this, I just flip my hair upside down and scrunch the product in my hair straight after a shower and then ball it up on the top of my head and then wrap this towel around it. Then I can get dressed without soaking wet hair. My hair is pretty dry after 10 minutes in the towel (no dripping), and that&#x27;s saying a lot! I just take off the towel after a little bit, put it some Deva clips for volume and then leave them in there until I&#x27;m finished getting ready and viola! Hair is all done! And it&#x27;s a bonus that it comes in such cute colors :) I will definitely be ordering another one (or two) to have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would recommend washing it on hand wash and then letting it air dry; I read somewhere that it&#x27;s not good to put microfiber towels in the dryer and I&#x27;ve put my Deva towel in the dryer and it gave it a really scratchy feeling. Definitely don&#x27;t want to make that mistake again!</li>
            <li> This towel is great.  Feels good to the touch and doesn&#x27;t stick to your fingers if you have chapped and dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does seem to dry my hair a bit faster, especially when I plop, but this towel gets soaked within a few minutes of using it, so I think I may need a second one. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the towel&#x27;s fault, I just have a lot of hair that takes a long time to dry. I like how the towel feels and I plan on buying a larger one for my body.</li>
            <li> If only this were wider than 19 inches, I could wrap my hair up tightly so that the towel might absorb the moisture it claims to absorb! I can usually make a turban out of any towel, but this is just too small. Out of frustration, I held the towel tightly around my hair to give it a chance to absorb the moisture. It may have absorbed slightly more than my regular towels. I can&#x27;t justify spending this much money on such a small towel that barely does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I purchased the Aquis Waffle Weave towel in the 29&amp;#34; x 55&amp;#34; size, and it fits better! I can easily twist it up in a turban so that all of my hair stays wrapped up. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair any better than my regular towels.  I even tried drying my hair with a regular towel FIRST and then used this towel wrapped around my hair for quite a while.</li>
            <li> A must for people with curly hair since it doesn&#x27;t act like a regular towel does, which extracts your natural oils</li>
            <li> Third purchase. I use these towels at the gym because trying to change into street clothes after a shower is difficult unless I am completely dry.</li>
            <li> This towel is not effective for thick hair.  It works no better than an ordinary good terry towel. I was looking forward to a product that actually saved significant time by wicking away moisture from my thick wavy medium length hair,but this didn&#x27;t even come close. Perhaps if you have short, thin hair it might work, but not for my type. Also, it isn&#x27;t long enough to securely keep in place when you wrap a turban. My advice: Do not spend the money.</li>
            <li> This towel is very absorbent, but wet hair tends to stick to it which sometimes makes it break off.</li>
            <li> So excited to find this towel.  I have had one for 15 years and have been searching for another to no avail til I searched amazon!  Great hair towel, very absorbent!</li>
            <li> My mother brought me back one of these from some trip she went on years and years ago.  I thought it was the greatest thing ever!  I haven&#x27;t been able to find them again until now!  (After about ten years, mine has had better days, but still works great!)  I highly recommend this product.  I sleep with mine on my long hair and wake up with gorgeous, frizz-free waves.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this towel! I purchased one for my daughter and one for myself a few months ago. We both have very thick hair that takes forever to dry. This towel just sucks the water right out of my hair. A huge time saver and a great help keeping the hair dryer damage to a minimum. The towel also dries quickly, preventing that mildew problem some people get in humid areas.&lt;br /&gt;  I plan on buying  more of these towels to keep on hand to put in gift baskets along with some candles and bath goodies for quick gift giving.</li>
            <li> I used this type of towel (in basic white) for years while scuba diving.  It was perfect -- small size -- dries quickly -- super-absorbant.  After having kids, I started using the towel to dry and wrap my hair -- perfect for this as well.  Then my kid decided to take my towel over, so I had to purchase more -- It is the perfect size to wrap a toddler below the arms after a bath.  The kids love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would like to point out that my original towel is at least 10 years old and going strong.  The towels are pricey, but they last.  Also, I bought mine when Amazon was running a sale, so you could wait patiently and get a good deal.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had one of these towels for her hair in FL and when I returned home to MI I decided to buy a hair one for me and two body towels for my husband and I.  We use them for the hot tub outside (spa type towels) and we also use them for the bath.  They are great at absorbing water.  They are different to get use to, but are worth it when you see how well they work.</li>
            <li> I love the fabric and the very light weight. So much better than having your bath towel on your head! The only reason for not giving 5 stars is there should be a loop on it to hang to dry. Also, if you have long hair, order the larger towel. I would highly recommend this hair towel.</li>
            <li> works well, i have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that this towel is too small.  I have a small head (I sometimes refer to myself as a pinhead..haha) with not a ton of hair &amp; this towel will not stay wrapped on my head which I find super annoying since that and its great absorbancy seem to be its claim to fame.  Thumbs down on the sizing and staying put, however, I do like the feel and absorbency of the towel just wish there would have been better designing on the size for function.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised! Dries my hair faster &amp; then the blow drying takes only few minutes. Good quality &amp; great size.</li>
            <li> This towel is great for soaking up the excess water when you wash your hair. It helps cut your drying time in half.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have long hair.  During the rush of the morning, this towel does help to cut the drying time.  It wraps easy and stays on your head leaving you to do other things.</li>
            <li> I bought this towel for the fast drying reviews, and I did notice a difference in moisture absorption but the most pleasant surprise was that its practically weightless. It&#x27;s much easier on your neck and shoulders and it never flops over! I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these towels for many years and was delighted to find a new one,  My only gripe is that this one is not quite as long and have a problem keeping it on my hea while drying my body.  If you ever find a longer ine count me in,  These towels are super wonderful drying your.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried one of these hair towels, you don&#x27;t know what you are missing.  I can&#x27;t live without mine.  They are lightweight as opposed to a regular bath towel and they really dry your hair.  The towel itself dries quickly and these towels last forever.  I purchased this one to keep at our weekend home.  I also have one in my overnight luggage and of course the one at home for daily use.  I&#x27;ve had the main one for more than 10 years and it still works like a charm.  I&#x27;ve also given these as gifts and all have been very well received.</li>
            <li> This hair towel I received as a gift. I liked it so ugh that I purchased one as a gift.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find a towel that was not only the right size to wrap around my hair after showering, but was super absorbant. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It did not help dry hair any better than a regular towel.  Definitely not worth it.  I was hopeful, but ended up feeling let down.</li>
            <li> I bought this towel to replace a hair turban.  I have extremely thick hair.  To get my hair as dry as possible to minimize blow drying, I use TWO towels:  one to towel dry my hair, and another to put my hair into a turban while I have breakfast.  The Aquis towels just aren&#x27;t good enough for me to get away with using one, but I expect that of any microfiber towel.  The towel is very well-made and looks like it will hold up well to repeated washings, but I would have preferred more bulk to the towel i.e. some loops to improve absorbency.&lt;br /&gt;Aquis should include instructions for how to tie a hair turban in their packaging since this 39-inch towel is smaller than a standard bath towel.  I have hair that falls midway down my back.  I have to tie the turban differently than I would with a bath towel to completely cover my hair.  What I do is:&lt;br /&gt;1) lean forward so that my hair dips towards the floor&lt;br /&gt;2) drape the towel over my head so that a short side runs from where my left jaw meets my neck to the top of my right ear; let gravity pull it more or less lengthwise towards the floor, covering the hair&lt;br /&gt;3) wrap the towel around my hair and twist counterclockwise&lt;br /&gt;4) tuck the free end tip of the towel into the back under the short end that ran diagonally across the nape of the neck&lt;br /&gt;A microfiber towel is much easier on the neck than a cotton terry towel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago and LOVE IT!  I can&#x27;t claim that it drastically cut down my drying time (I towel dried pretty thoroughly in the past), but it&#x27;s a great size and absorbs well.  I can put my hair up after my shower and it actually stays put!  It was money well spent.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for me because I had given several as gifts some years ago. Everyone loved their towels and are still using them with great results to this day.  All the other towels were thicker than this one &amp; had a nice texture.  This particular towel, which I washed &amp; hung to dry before using, is much thinner than the previous purchased ones.  It has a strange texture, nothing like the ones bought previously.  This towel &amp; the others are all the same brand, Aquis Britanne, but there is a definite difference in the quality of product. Had planned to buy another one to give as a gift but I&#x27;m not thrilled with the quality of this particular one, so I will pass on buying another one .</li>
            <li> Lightweight, highly absorbant.  Great for taking to the pool or beach!</li>
            <li> I now have two of these and love them for use on my wet hair.  They really do take out a lot of the water so less drying.</li>
            <li> dries hair quickly and gently, easy to wrap like a turban, just the right size, my hair is a about 4 inches past shoulder length</li>
            <li> I really wish I&#x27;d gotten one of these years ago. I hate having wet hair dripping down my back when I&#x27;m drying off after a bath, but at the same time, I don&#x27;t like having a separate bath towel just for my hair - they&#x27;re bulky and don&#x27;t do nearly as good of a job. I have shoulder-length hair and this one is the perfect size for me.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and super fast, this is my third one...got it as a gift and now I give them as gifts...Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I received my hair towel today and was pleased with the size and material used. Could tell after touching the towel it would help dry my curly hair faster!</li>
            <li> This towel really absorbs water. I am ready to start on my hair only a few minutes after wearing this towel.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly, keeps most of the curl and the towel itself dries pretty quickly. I machine wash it in hot water but hang it up to dry.</li>
            <li> I rate this towel the same as I rated the two other ones above this comment? I will begin to sound like an LP, 33 and 1/3 revolutions per minute if I keep on reviewing. Wonderful, meets all my needs...what else is there but these perfect towels? I LOVE THEM!! They perform their job, such soft material meeting my hair&#x27;s needs!!</li>
            <li> Love this towel. I wrap it around my hair straight out of the shower and leave it on for a couple minutes. It removes the moisture while keeping the curls intact.</li>
            <li> This hair towel is great for absorbing excess  water off your hair.  It&#x27;s very compact, so easy to roll up and pack for travel or for the gym.</li>
            <li> I bought this towel being a bit skeptic... but all I have to say was I wrong!  It cuts hair drying time for my long curly hair by 1/2!  I wrap my hair in it while I dry off and brush my teeth and my hair is really dry!  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this out of curiosity. Didn&#x27;t quite understand why someone might need a &amp;#34;hair towel&amp;#34; when a regular towel will do just fine. WRONG. A regular towel will not do just fine! This thing is light weight, thin, and absorbent. It is not an acrobatic skill to keep it on top of your head (with classic length hair), and the ends actually can be tucked in because it&#x27;s so thin. This towel also drys exceptionally fast. I ended up buying another one o these because they&#x27;re life changing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very much pleased!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased a microfiber towel for my hair, but I&#x27;ve bought many in the past for my vehicle. I find that Korean mibrofiber has performed best, so knowing this, and having read a glowing review on a blog, I purchased this item. Quality wise, the towel feels soft but dense, in a good way. It is pretty effective at drying my long hair, I just wrap it up turban style, take it off about 30 minutes later and have damp, but not dripping hair. so far, so good!</li>
            <li> i use this towel every single day for my breakage prone fine hair. Unlike other reviewers, it doesn&#x27;t totally soak the moisture out of my hair and for me isn&#x27;t too much more absorbent than a regular towel. It just somehow FEELS different running it across my hair and I enjoy not having a ton of weight on top of my head pulling on my hair. I am able to wrap up all of my hair in this and it stays up just fine wrapped up like a turban.</li>
            <li> I bought this towel because of the number of good reviews and what customers said about it.  I take showers in the evening and try to towel dry my hair by squeezing the water out. My hair would still be damp when I went to bed. Also, I was concerned about the hair breakage I was getting along my forehead.  I am 61 and have thin enough hair as it is, and I didn&#x27;t want to lose any more than I had to. I decided to replace my twisting turban-style towel and get something gentler on my hair. I received the towel yesterday and washed it and dryed it.  After my shower I put the towel under my hair in back holding the long sides in either hand.  I would then bring one side up and over the top of my head and the the other side.  I secured it with a clip. Then I gently squeezed the hair on the sides and back ( My hair comes down to my sholders).  I left it on for about 1 hour (probably longer than I had to.)  My hair was barely damp and was dry by the time I went to bed.  This morning I wet down my hair and wrapped the towel around it like I had the night before ( I have to re-wet my hair every morning because it has&lt;br /&gt;natural curl, but the curl never goes the way I want it to).  This time I only left it on for about 5-10 minuter.  I noticed that my slightly damp only took about half the time to style. I am really pleased with this towel.  It is large enough for me and is soft.  It absorbs water very well and when  washed it doesn&#x27;t pill. I don&#x27;t think you will regret buying this towel.</li>
            <li> This is the first Aquis Microfiber towel that I&#x27;ve purchased but I absolutely love them! These towels are very thin and lightweight, but are insanely absorbent and will get you dry in a flash (and all you have to do is pat dry very gently to accomplish this, there&#x27;s no need for any harsh continual rubbing of your skin with this towel). Because of this, they&#x27;re way gentler on skin and hair. They also dry rather quickly after use, so you don&#x27;t have to really worry about any of the ickiness that usually comes along with soggy, damp towels. Just a note, it was strange to use at first because this towel doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly along your skin like most towels do (which kind of makes it necessary for you to pat dry with it). It sort of sticks to you or grips you, if that makes sense. A bit weird at first but not a big deal. I love these towels and will not use anything else for my skin/hair again! Highly recommend, A+!</li>
            <li> Love these I own several of them these were for gifts of people who have used the ones I have when they stayed at my home.</li>
            <li> Loved the towel wrap my hair when done washing and it&#x27;s like just damp when I take it off, it has cut blow drying by at least 5-8 min for me</li>
            <li> This towel works really well.  It&#x27;s lightweight but very effective and washes well.  I like it a lot and will likely buy another.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it (it is her second one and the first lasted for 6 years!).</li>
            <li> Love these towels! I have three. They can get sour smelling after a while. At first I thought the problem could be using fabric softener, but I bought a new one and didn&#x27;t use softener and it still ended up with a faint sour scent after a while. It&#x27;s not that bad so I still use the towels because they really cut down on my hair drying time. If you have long, thick hair I definitely recommend these towels.</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizz-prone hair, and this towel really helps tame it.  I wring as much water out as possible after I shower and then wrap my hair in this baby for about 20 minutes while I do my makeup.  It&#x27;s about 50% dry when I take it down and dries the rest of the way very quickly.  It also keeps my hair relatively frizz-free.</li>
            <li> I looked for a hair towel that was big enough.  These are great.  I ordered more.</li>
            <li> My sister had one of these when she came from Australia. It is great to dry hair after shampoo. Dries hair quickly and easily tucks on head if you want to keep it on while finishing your morning routine.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair towel and is nice and large plus very absorbent. I liked mine so well that I ordered one for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a birthday present for my daughter.  She already has two very very old Aquis towels which she uses constantly and they are getting warn out.  Since she loves them so much, I thought I&#x27;d get her new towels.</li>
            <li> Great for long hair!! Cuts blow drying time.</li>
            <li> Too small to wrap around head and stay there. It is pretty and soft but it will not stay tucked on my head and I am not a big woman with a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Love this towel! Last one lasted 20 years.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair towel…it feels like it just instantly takes the moisture right out of your hair!  I highly recommend it….I love the size of it too….good for long or for short hair.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT! There is NO better product anywhere. In the art world they say &#x27;form follows function&#x27;. Well, for this product the function gets a 100% superb rating. And the form? Well, no towel has ever known the qualities that this towel holds. I have never written a review on Amazon and when I saw that Amazin(hey, that&#x27;s a prety good typo for Amazon, right?) I feel so passionate about this item that 1st I purchased one(I would have bought 5 but I don&#x27;t like pink, and since this is the only color they are offering I&#x27;m taking one). Trust me, everythng they say @ the Aquis is true. You will feel like your hair is already dry just from towelling. And for exercising or the gym - any sports, it folds up so small, a normal towel would take up 5x&#x27;s the space. In my experience, a terry cloth towel NEVER absorbs all the water after a bath.. THIS towel as it touches you - YOU BECOME COMPLETELY DRY. Hope you discover the joy and the simplification afforded your life once you&#x27;ve tried an Aquis. Don&#x27;t delay, they go FAST!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these towels for years! I&#x27;ve tried other brands but always come back to this brand. They are large enough for my long hair and stay in place until I&#x27;m ready to take my hair out. I usually replace them every year and a half or as needed because sometimes they accidentally get thrown in the washer with fabric softer and this causes them to be less absorbent and need to be replaced quicker.</li>
            <li> After one wash with other items, it became so ingrained with fibers from other clothes that it was unusable. Also, not that soft or nice. Pretty big disappointment for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of this back in 2004. Wrote a 5-Star review about it, and promised if they offer other hues, I would be back for more....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...here I am, and meanwhile, the first towel I bought 3 years back is still in great condition. Thank you for making a great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I dried my hair before this towel. I have thick natural curly hair (3b/c) and have always struggled with frizz. I don&#x27;t own a hair dryer and like to air or towel dry my hair. This towel was perfect for my needs...it soaks up all the excess water but doesn&#x27;t frizz up my hair. Love love love! Looking forward to ordering more colors and gifting to my fellow curlies</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have for your outdoor towel collection. It&#x27;s compact, soft, and dries quickly. I&#x27;m tempted to trade in all my bath towels for this instead. But this is the perfect travel towel as well so I&#x27;ll just buy some more for my trips.</li>
            <li> I love this towel. It is light but effectively dries hair much quicker. I even take one on trips now because it is indispensable.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised thanks</li>
            <li> I use this towel every night!  After showering and squeezing out the moisture from my hair, I put my products in my hair, and then wrap it up in this towel and fall asleep with it on my head.  When i wake up, my hair is smooth and dry, and my curls look very alive and intact.  Great product, would highly recommend (especially for us curly/wavy-haired men and women.</li>
            <li> I love this item. Bought several in this color selection for gifts. Personally use mine on a daily basis. Great product. Really cuts down on drying time for my hair.</li>
            <li> Very soft and thick material. I could tell some difference with the drying power. :) great product.</li>
            <li> very absorbent like they say .</li>
            <li> This towel is very soft and is a pretty shade of pink. It removes more moisture from hair than normal bath towels so really helps speed up hair drying time when blow drying.</li>
            <li> I am soooo pleased with the towel for my hair! All the regular bath towels are way to big and too heavy, I always felt like my head was going to fall off! This towel is light, but speeds drying time and is the perfect fit! Very happy!</li>
            <li> Is this towel supposed to dry more effectively?  I can&#x27;t tell the difference.  The color is now closer to white than pink.</li>
            <li> I have three now.  2 white and one blue and one pink. I bought the colored ones, so I would see it in the hotel bathroom and not accidentally leave it behind.  It helps dry my hair quickly.....as some of the hotels hairdryers take forever with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see the difference between it and the regular towel.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of these towels, and hardly ever use an electric dryer for my hair. Very happy with it, and would recommend it for men and women.</li>
            <li> I recommend this towel for anyone with really thick hair.  Some mornings I just don&#x27;t have the ten minutes to blowdry my hair.  Wrapping my hair in this towel while I get ready helps it dry faster than any other towel I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> very light weight and doesn&#x27;t tug on your hair which is great as hair is more fragile when it&#x27;s wet. easily washable and dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for drying long hair after showering at the gym.  It takes up far less space than a traditional towel and soaks up water like a champ!</li>
            <li> Best hair towel going</li>
            <li> This towel is AMAZING!  It almost completely dries hair on it&#x27;s own!  Hair loss has been an issue, and this little gem is so gentle, not pulling or tugging on hair.  It&#x27;s a dream come true.  I give them as gifts, and will use it for life!</li>
            <li> Just the right size, and I have medium length tick hair.</li>
            <li> I use the Aquis Microfiber Hair Towel&#x27;s to cut down on the time it takes me to dry my hair. I think it works really well. I like the light pink color, too.</li>
            <li> It is truly absorbent as advertised, but for my long hair it&#x27;s about 6 inches too short to allow it to be wrapped and tucked efficiently. If one had a smaller head and shorter hair, probably it would be fine.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first  but it really works! Better than i expected. Really cuts drying time in half. Considering getting a second one.</li>
            <li> Drys my hair very quickly.  I place it on my hair and scrunch it and it absorbs very fast.  It also washes well.  It&#x27;s just the right size to travel with as well.  It&#x27;s definitely my go to hair towel.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these towels. I got one as a gift years ago, and fell in love with it. I somehow lost track of it, so I replaced it with this one. For someone with thick, long hair, this is a MUST-HAVE. It normally takes me about 10-15 minutes to get my hair dry (using a blow dryer), but if I pull my hair up into this towel, it can cut that time down to under 5 minutes. I don&#x27;t have an issue getting all of my hair into this smaller size (my hair is about 9 inches past my shoulders, for a reference point). However, the towel is left pretty wet after I unwrap my hair, and it takes it a while to dry out. For that reason, I upgraded to the larger 29&amp;#34; x 55&amp;#34; size later on. I still use the small one for traveling, or when the big one is in the wash. I&#x27;ve had this one for about 4 years and it&#x27;s still in good shape. **Remember, don&#x27;t use fabric softener or dryer sheets when you wash your towels - it leaves a residue or coating on the fabric, and makes them less absorbent.</li>
            <li> Someone gave me a towel of theirs for Christmas and I loved it.  I have long hair and it really dries it.  I purchased this towel to match some new towels. Great product and service.</li>
            <li> A must-buy hair towel.</li>
            <li> This is my second Aquis Microfiber Hair Towel.  The first one I have still works, but after almost seven years of constant use, I figured it was time to get a fresh one.  I can&#x27;t say enough about these towels.  I have thick, wavy, and long hair (about 20 inches) and this is the ONLY hair towel I&#x27;ve ever found that could handle all aspects of my hair.  I tried the TurbyTowel - what a joke.  This towel is more than worth its price.  The towel is thick enough to gather excess water from thick hair without towel being too thick to handle effortlessly.  Likewise, it is long/wide enough to gather all my hair and still tuck into the back of wrap as snugly or loosely as I want.  On top of that, the pink color is really pretty. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  If you have long, thick, and/or wavy hair then this towel will become a daily shower necessity.</li>
            <li> I have five of these and I love them… once you use them, you&#x27;ll never go back to a regular towel for your hair again</li>
            <li> Very good product. Makes hair drying much faster.</li>
            <li> This is a must for curly or frizzy hair. It absorbs moisture without having to rub and snag fragile locks. A bit pricey but worth it. I even have one for my dogs (tiny yorkies) dries them instantly and no shaking water everywhere.</li>
            <li> the towel is Ok, not as absorbant as the one I already own, but I am sure I ordered a white one not pink recommend it, but check colour when ordering</li>
            <li> great hair towel - i don&#x27;t want to go back to regular towels.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims.  Dries hair perfectly every time.  Very easy to clean and dries very quickly. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I have used this hair towel for well over 20 years. Works great on long hair. I always put my hair up in a little turban to let it dry.  I also use it to quickly dry class on our shower enclosure. Bought another one to give as a gift.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This does dry my hair quickly.  But getting my hair up in it is a pain and it&#x27;s uncomfortable. Since I bought it to make my hair dry quicker at least during the winter months, I&#x27;d say it does a good job for what I intended.</li>
