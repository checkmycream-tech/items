    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>In fact, everyone has been telling me how wonderful my hair works</li>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>I use this product twice a week, and my hair has a wonderful shine and looks hydrated.</li>
            <li>Best stuff ever for the price point.</li>
            <li>As a result of bleaching, my hair *looks* awesome, but it becomes damaged and porous after each bleaching session.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Its GREAT!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best on the market.</li>
            <li>This smells awesome, like almonds!  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try it because i heard a great review about it on Andrea&#x27;s choice</li>
            <li>I am really happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice.  </li>
            <li>feel good but for result need wait</li>
            <li>It also smells really good, like cherries.</li>
            <li>Then after using the Ion Conditioner, it felt even better!</li>
            <li>This product amazingly seems to reverse the so-called irreversible damage.</li>
            <li>The overnight treatment is AMAZING</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I rinsed everything out with Apple Cider Vinegar and my hair felt amazing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything amazing, but maybe my hair isn&#x27;t that damaged.  </li>
            <li>Now it feels better, but there  is still a fair amount of tackiness.  </li>
            <li>But plus side, its smells really nice.</li>
            <li>I have used just about every conditioner on the planet and nothing made it softer, but this stuff is like magic! :-).</li>
            <li>have tried many hair repair conditioners, masks and serums and this is BY FAR THE BEST EVER!</li>
            <li>After one use, my hair was no longer snapping off in my fingers, and looked much better.</li>
            <li>It also seems to thicken my hair, creating more volume.</li>
            <li>Because of the reduced breakage, my hair is able to grow longer now.</li>
            <li>The more I use it, the softer my hair gets.  </li>
            <li>If you have SEVERELY damaged hair, I suggest getting their overnight treatment more than this.  </li>
            <li>I definately do see a difference for the better with this product and would recommend.</li>
            <li>5 stars for sure :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it again for the smell though!  :-)</li>
            <li>My hair is usually healthy, but I can&#x27;t escape the effects of bleach damage.</li>
            <li>but it spreads easily) and</li>
            <li>My hair is fairly fine yet has body...</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, my hair hasn&#x27;t felt this nice in years.</li>
            <li>All ion products are fantastic.</li>
            <li>After 20 minutes I washed it out and my hair felt silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to me that my hair looks sleek and shiny to pull off the purple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my hair was residue free.</li>
            <li>It is my first time using this product, and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>It significantly reduces breakage and reduces blow-dry time.</li>
            <li>I love the product, I will buy the whole red line of ion at Sally, it us just a great product line.</li>
            <li>I felt that I needed more than daily conditioner and went to Sally&#x27;s in search of some kind of protein treatment..</li>
            <li>I also used a clarifying shampoo, so my hair was extremely clean.</li>
            <li>The texture of it will fool you because it feels more like shampoo than conditioner, but it goes on easily because it&#x27;s not thick and goopy.</li>
            <li>, my hair felt amazing- soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>REALLY light first.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what happened!</li>
            <li>I bought two packets and liked it enough that now I have the 20 ounce bottle.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, my hair is so soft and silky, I rinsed off in the sink, just to be sure to get everything out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought Kerastase and some other pricey deep conditioners, but this Ion product works the best.</li>
            <li>My hair is strong , silky, soft, manageable.</li>
            <li>Okay so my hair is platinum blonde and has been through a lot.</li>
            <li>I could feel the difference even while the product was still on my hair during the first use.</li>
            <li>but honestly I just style and leave it in since it makes my hair extremely manageable.</li>
            <li>I used Ion Effective care shampoo, Ion Reconstructor, and then I used Ion Extreme Moisture Cream as a leave-In.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wowowow, my hair has been pretty much completely repaired, and it feels strong and soft like it did before I colored.</li>
            <li>makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Bought a sample packet and had to buy large bottle.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great it brought back lifr into my over processed dead hair</li>
            <li>Leave in for 5 minutes, you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I really felt I needed to write review about it.</li>
            <li>This makes my kinky hair so much easier to manage.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t really do anything to my hair.</li>
            <li>but i really didn&#x27;t noticed it doing anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>My mother didn&#x27;t really care for it either.</li>
            <li>Ion Reconstructor really does work on dry-damaged breaking off hair.</li>
            <li>ion reconstructor works on damaged hair very well.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable too....</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because The Ion Effective Care may work a little better for extreme damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Anyways, I got lucky because my hair is only somewhat damaged.  </li>
            <li>I\\&quot;m giving this reconstructor 4 stars simply because the overnight ion treatment(same red color) is so much better.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Ion Reconstructor.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that my hair is still quite fragile, so I expect that I will have to use this product frequently until I am able to brush my hair again without worry.</li>
            <li>My hair was in ok condition after coloring, but it definitely got dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>The only thing to make sure with this product (as with all protein treatments) is that you condition after you use it or your hair might feel dry or tacky.</li>
            <li>I am very happy that this product has allowed me to avoid cutting my hair very short.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just didn&#x27;t rinse it out well enough, which has happened before, but I expected a lot more.</li>
            <li>After four attempts and no luck, I had to end up in a salon to get it fixed.  </li>
            <li>I did not expect to feel any difference in my hair after just one use, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I&#x27;ll definitely be going back to get a full sized bottle!</li>
            <li>The key is - you don&#x27;t need very much to coat your entire head of hair.</li>
            <li>Usually, they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about &amp; in this case it was confirmed.</li>
            <li>I had an old Flex conditioner with protein that I was using to repair my over-processed hair, which I&#x27;d like to dye back to my natural color, allow to grow out &amp; never mess with again.</li>
            <li>I used Aphogee before with great results and various other protein treatments, this is the very first time that I had a bad experience.  </li>
            <li>Combing through my wet hair with my fingers, I noticed large chunks breaking off.</li>
            <li>That flex protein conditioner was amazing at fixing my damaged hair, prepping it for another process, but I unfortunately ran out.</li>
            <li>It saved my hair but it definitely still has a way to go before it&#x27;s back to a normal state.</li>
            <li>Although I expected the product to leave my hair as soft as conditioner normally does, it definitely moisturizes my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is bleached blonde (from a natural medium/strawberry blonde color).</li>
            <li>Mostly because my hair is really broken and damaged from stripping black dye out of my hair, which turned it red, then bleaching over a few times to get it to a light reddish brown.  </li>
            <li>Your hair feels like it&#x27;s going to be silky &amp; soft when you rinse, but after you dry, your hair just feels odd, like it&#x27;s dried out but still filled with a gunky feeling.</li>

            <li> My hair is bleached blonde (from a natural medium/strawberry blonde color).</li>

            <li> Your hair feels like it&#x27;s going to be silky &amp; soft when you rinse, but after you dry, your hair just feels odd, like it&#x27;s dried out but still filled with a gunky feeling.</li>
            <li> and my flat iron at on 450 degrees is doing almost nothing...</li>
            <li> I highlight and flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> No residue as long as you use it in place of Conditioner and only leave on for directed 10 minutes max.  </li>
            <li> But I have been using this everyday and my hair feels so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> The bottle suggests 2 pumps for my long hair(I do two, let it dry, then do two again) and your hair will soak it up immediately.  </li>
            <li> Rinse out, and dry hair is repaired and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I am finally starting to see a little length to my hair.</li>
            <li> Also as I was combing it wet</li>
            <li> When I washed my hair that night, I noticed my hair was extremely gummy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other review is talking about at all about tacky hair.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is soapy &amp; runny/watery &amp; it&#x27;s deceptive when you&#x27;re rinsing, like the other reviewer said.</li>
            <li> compared to all the other products the Hair Salons push on you.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how everyone else is having such good luck with this... even using a small amount of this for only a few minutes in place of conditioner and immediately washing out leaves hair stiff, tacky, weighed down, unable to brush, and unable to flat iron.</li>
            <li> I put it on my wet hair and blow dried it (with a shower cap on)</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li> I was horrified and extremely upset!</li>
            <li> I think the person who left a bad review probably put in way too much.</li>
            <li> so maybe its for hidden benefits.</li>
            <li> My hair fell out 80% less after just one use.</li>
            <li> If you towel dry your hair, apply this generously, comb it through, and let it sit on your hair for at least 15 minutes, it will work wonders for you.</li>
            <li> my hair covered with just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dark hair</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years now</li>
            <li> It looks fluffy, too.</li>
            <li> I want to return this garbage, but I&#x27;m just so tired from running around town trying to find that flex protein conditioner or a replacement, I don&#x27;t want to make another trip back over there.</li>
            <li> Then.... i put in my leave in conditioner and my hair dried.</li>

            <li> I way over processed my hair last week trying to get it blonde.  After four attempts and no luck, I had to end up in a salon to get it fixed.  Anyways, I got lucky because my hair is only somewhat damaged.  But I have been using this everyday and my hair feels so soft and manageable.  I leave it in for about 4 minutes and use about a 1/3 of a packet.  Then wash out.  I have never, ever had a sticky residue left over.  In fact, everyone has been telling me how wonderful my hair works and I have given this treatment all the credit.  I actually bought some for my mom and a coworker so they could try it.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li> Leave in for 5 minutes, you don&#x27;t need much. Rinse out, and dry hair is repaired and refreshed. I think the person who left a bad review probably put in way too much. For example, if I use the envelope packets, I use 1/3 of it per treatment. The key is - you don&#x27;t need very much to coat your entire head of hair. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Not sure how everyone else is having such good luck with this... even using a small amount of this for only a few minutes in place of conditioner and immediately washing out leaves hair stiff, tacky, weighed down, unable to brush, and unable to flat iron. It has literally made my hair the texture of horse hair and I cannot even run my fingers through it, let alone a brush... and my flat iron at on 450 degrees is doing almost nothing... whatever is in it is preventing the heat from being transferred to the hair. Horrible product :(</li>
            <li> feel good but for result need wait</li>
            <li> While I was washing the product out ( I did not shampoo after the product), my hair felt amazing- soft and silky.  Then I started drying it...  My hair felt and looked like I had sticky honey in it.  I washed my hair again this time using shampoo- soaping twice.  Now it feels better, but there  is still a fair amount of tackiness.  I have never used a product that did this to my hair. I used Aphogee before with great results and various other protein treatments, this is the very first time that I had a bad experience.  BEWARE!</li>
            <li> It is my first time using this product, and I am pleased. Although I expected the product to leave my hair as soft as conditioner normally does, it definitely moisturizes my hair. I use this product twice a week, and my hair has a wonderful shine and looks hydrated. Follow the directions, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> So I very recently started coloring my hair, and while I was buying the dye I bought one of the sample packs of this stuff at Sally&#x27;s on a whim. My hair was in ok condition after coloring, but it definitely got dry and brittle. So I tried this stuff out; slathered it on under a cap for about an hour. All I can say is wowowow, my hair has been pretty much completely repaired, and it feels strong and soft like it did before I colored. The only thing to make sure with this product (as with all protein treatments) is that you condition after you use it or your hair might feel dry or tacky. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I&#x27;ll definitely be going back to get a full sized bottle!</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever for the price point.</li>
            <li> Okay so my hair is platinum blonde and has been through a lot. I never really had any damage (thankfully) until I got my roots retouched by a sloppy stylist who kinda just slapped the bleach on without being careful. When I washed my hair that night, I noticed my hair was extremely gummy. Combing through my wet hair with my fingers, I noticed large chunks breaking off. I was horrified and extremely upset! So I immediately went to Sally&#x27;s and picked some of this up. After one use, my hair was no longer snapping off in my fingers, and looked much better. I am very happy that this product has allowed me to avoid cutting my hair very short. The only thing is that my hair is still quite fragile, so I expect that I will have to use this product frequently until I am able to brush my hair again without worry. Overall, I recommend this product. It saved my hair but it definitely still has a way to go before it&#x27;s back to a normal state.</li>
            <li> My hair is bleached blonde (from a natural medium/strawberry blonde color). As a result of bleaching, my hair *looks* awesome, but it becomes damaged and porous after each bleaching session. This product amazingly seems to reverse the so-called irreversible damage. If you towel dry your hair, apply this generously, comb it through, and let it sit on your hair for at least 15 minutes, it will work wonders for you. It significantly reduces breakage and reduces blow-dry time. It also seems to thicken my hair, creating more volume. Because of the reduced breakage, my hair is able to grow longer now. I&#x27;ve bought Kerastase and some other pricey deep conditioners, but this Ion product works the best. I have used this product for a few years now and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I really felt I needed to write review about it.</li>
            <li> To me you can spend all kinds of money on expensive hair care but this reasonable product does the job just like the expensive product with half the cost. I LOVE IT!!!!!! everyone who dyes their hair or even if you don&#x27;t try it.  Its GREAT! I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed Go ahead try it i dare you........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month now.  And I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair! I did not expect to feel any difference in my hair after just one use, but I was pleasantly surprised. The more I use it, the softer my hair gets.  I have been relaxer-free for 4 years now. This makes my kinky hair so much easier to manage. I have used just about every conditioner on the planet and nothing made it softer, but this stuff is like magic! :-). Now, when I press my hair, I no longer leave half my hair in the sink!!! I am finally starting to see a little length to my hair. Yessssss!  I guess hair needs protein just like our bodies....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other review is talking about at all about tacky hair.  When I did it, personally I needed to put A LOT in.  Mostly because my hair is really broken and damaged from stripping black dye out of my hair, which turned it red, then bleaching over a few times to get it to a light reddish brown.  The last bleach I did I almost immediately regretted, my hair was in horrible shape after so I bought this and figured I should give it a shot.  Before using it, I couldn&#x27;t even run my fingers through my hair without hearing some ends break, but now I can actually do it!  I feel that if you have moderately damaged hair this will work well for you.  If you have SEVERELY damaged hair, I suggest getting their overnight treatment more than this.  The bottle suggests 2 pumps for my long hair(I do two, let it dry, then do two again) and your hair will soak it up immediately.  The overnight treatment is AMAZING and it says on there that you can wash it out in the morning but honestly I just style and leave it in since it makes my hair extremely manageable. I\\&quot;m giving this reconstructor 4 stars simply because the overnight ion treatment(same red color) is so much better.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really do anything to my hair. I wanted to try it because i heard a great review about it on Andrea&#x27;s choice but i really didn&#x27;t noticed it doing anything for my hair. this product is keratin enriched so maybe its for hidden benefits. but i didn&#x27;t see any immediate results. kinda disappointed. My mother didn&#x27;t really care for it either. But plus side, its smells really nice. Like a tropical fruity starburst smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly fine yet has body...I highlight and flat iron my hair so it has seen its share of damage.  I felt that I needed more than daily conditioner and went to Sally&#x27;s in search of some kind of protein treatment..I am really happy with the results.  I bought two packets and liked it enough that now I have the 20 ounce bottle.  I definately do see a difference for the better with this product and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I had to use a lot of the product, because I couldn&#x27;t get al my hair covered with just a little bit. I also used a clarifying shampoo, so my hair was extremely clean. Anyways, my hair is so soft and silky, I rinsed off in the sink, just to be sure to get everything out. Amazing. I love the product, I will buy the whole red line of ion at Sally, it us just a great product line. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, my hair hasn&#x27;t felt this nice in years. You don&#x27;t need a lot of product to cover your hair (I have really short hair but it spreads easily) and I like how it has a shampoo consistency that you can lather. It also smells really good, like cherries.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair product I have ever used in my life. I had an old Flex conditioner with protein that I was using to repair my over-processed hair, which I&#x27;d like to dye back to my natural color, allow to grow out &amp; never mess with again. That flex protein conditioner was amazing at fixing my damaged hair, prepping it for another process, but I unfortunately ran out. Can&#x27;t find the stuff anywhere so I looked for another protein treatment. The girls at Sally recommended this. What a mistake it was to trust them. Usually, they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about &amp; in this case it was confirmed. The consistency is soapy &amp; runny/watery &amp; it&#x27;s deceptive when you&#x27;re rinsing, like the other reviewer said. Your hair feels like it&#x27;s going to be silky &amp; soft when you rinse, but after you dry, your hair just feels odd, like it&#x27;s dried out but still filled with a gunky feeling. It looks fluffy, too. I want to return this garbage, but I&#x27;m just so tired from running around town trying to find that flex protein conditioner or a replacement, I don&#x27;t want to make another trip back over there.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great it brought back lifr into my over processed dead hair</li>
            <li> Ion Reconstructor really does work on dry-damaged breaking off hair. My hair had an emergency. It was falling out all over the sink, floor, and my hair brush. I was afraid to touch it. I had a horrible bleach job done. My hair was over-bleached and damaged beyond repair. I used Ion Effective care shampoo, Ion Reconstructor, and then I used Ion Extreme Moisture Cream as a leave-In. A miracle happened. My hair fell out 80% less after just one use. My hair is strong , silky, soft, manageable. I can actually comb my hair and not be afraid of breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried thousands of reconstructors and all of them fall short compared to Ion Reconstructor. It&#x27;s the best on the market. All ion products are fantastic. I highly recommend Ion Reconstructor. I gave it 4 stars because The Ion Effective Care may work a little better for extreme damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;The ion reconstructor works on damaged hair very well.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed with this stuff. I bought mine at Sally&#x27;s and had read reviews warning about the sticky feeling of your hair after using this. That&#x27;s exactly what happened! I put it on my wet hair and blow dried it (with a shower cap on) so it would sink in. After 20 minutes I washed it out and my hair felt silky and smooth. Then after using the Ion Conditioner, it felt even better! I rinsed everything out with Apple Cider Vinegar and my hair felt amazing. Then.... i put in my leave in conditioner and my hair dried. My hair looked fluffy, damaged, stiff, felt like straw and felt like I had put honey in it. It was so sticky! It was too late to shower again, so I went to work with my hair in a ponytail. This stuff is not good. Maybe I just didn&#x27;t rinse it out well enough, which has happened before, but I expected a lot more. I even bought the big bottle long ago and can&#x27;t return it anymore :( Hopefully when I shower tonight, all the stickiness will go away.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  No residue as long as you use it in place of Conditioner and only leave on for directed 10 minutes max.  Bought a sample packet and had to buy large bottle.  Price is reasonable too....compared to all the other products the Hair Salons push on you.  5 stars for sure :)</li>
            <li> This smells awesome, like almonds!  It&#x27;s very nice.  I will say it&#x27;s just like regular conditioner though.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything amazing, but maybe my hair isn&#x27;t that damaged.  I&#x27;d buy it again for the smell though!  :-)</li>
            <li> i use every time&lt;br /&gt;thanks for job&lt;br /&gt;i like is vey beatiful&lt;br /&gt;i lile i like i like i liek</li>
            <li> makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dark hair and I color it purple so I have to bleach it REALLY light first. My hair is usually healthy, but I can&#x27;t escape the effects of bleach damage. I am also VERY picky about how my hair looks when it&#x27;s an extreme color, as I have always hated people who have a crazy hair color but their hair looks awful and damaged. It&#x27;s important to me that my hair looks sleek and shiny to pull off the purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many hair repair conditioners, masks and serums and this is BY FAR THE BEST EVER! The texture of it will fool you because it feels more like shampoo than conditioner, but it goes on easily because it&#x27;s not thick and goopy. I could feel the difference even while the product was still on my hair during the first use. When I rinsed it out, my hair felt thicker and fuller under the water...I kept thinking I hadn&#x27;t rinsed it all out but my hair was residue free. Once it dried it was the shiniest and fullest I&#x27;ve seen it in YEARS, even on the bleached/dyed parts. Also as I was combing it wet it wasn&#x27;t stretching and breaking. It was as if I had never chemically processed my hair. I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
