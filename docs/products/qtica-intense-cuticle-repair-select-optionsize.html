            <li>This is nice cuticle cream.</li>
            <li>has been this effective.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s own price now is $18.34 per jar.</li>
            <li>It rubs in and absorbs nicely and seems to be working - my cuticles are looking better after just a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>my job doesn&#x27;t make any better, so I needed some kind of moisture for them.</li>
            <li>The cream smells good, not too strong and it goes on smoothly without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>My two daughters and three sisters always have a jar in their house, we all love it.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many cuticle products...</li>
            <li>It made it a bit softer but most wouldn&#x27;t absorb.  </li>
            <li>healthy cuticles and repair of skin around the nail area</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to find it here.  </li>
            <li>This product makes it more managable until I forget to use it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>I have not found anything else that works better.  </li>
            <li>I suppose this product would work better if I could use it more often</li>
            <li>but my husband is allergic to fragrances and this is rather potent.  </li>
            <li>sure if I should return the product or keep it...</li>
            <li>Have tried many cuticle cremes and this one ranks at the top of my list because of its emmuliant properties.</li>
            <li>Leaves my cuticles in better shape every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>I use it regularly and it is excellent.  </li>
            <li>My hands looked so much better within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>and I have found cheaper, better alternatives.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep using it to see if it gets better.  </li>
            <li>Glad it&#x27;s worked so well for so many others, though.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try using it twice a day for a better result.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more convenient to carry it around with me.</li>
            <li>This cream worked wonderful and helped get dry areas softer.</li>
            <li>but they then ended up bleeding and the skin around my nails was swollen, red, and incredibly sore.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy ~ smooth application ~ works fabulous!</li>
            <li>Have used other brands and this is the best yet.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I used this balm faithfully it quickly healed both!  </li>
            <li>glad that I&#x27;m married!  </li>
            <li>Great stocking stuffer especially to be used this time of year.</li>
            <li>She told me and showed me on my own nails how it really does repair cuticles!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I keep a jar in my car and use it to smooth my cuticles when I feel tempted to pick them.</li>
            <li>Great product for nails, works if you apply it on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>and I see a significant improvement in my cuticle.</li>
            <li>Rich, creamy, and does the trick.</li>
            <li>I also love the Lush &amp;#34;Lemony Flutter Cuticle Butter&amp;#34;, which is also a much better price.</li>
            <li>Daily use of this balm has completely stopped the splits and my nails look great!  </li>
            <li>Works great on dry, flakey elbows too!</li>
            <li>Very effective for dry &amp; cracking cuticles.</li>
            <li>But still, more cracking even in summer, more infections seemed inevitable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, however I wish it was sold in more stores.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product that is rich and thick without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the very first application.</li>
            <li>This cream doesn&#x27;t melt in the hot car!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product do far!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best cuticle cream I have ever used, and I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li>I have never taken the time to review anything on-line and rarely give anything the highest rating.  </li>
            <li>well worth</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this cream after the reviews and comparing the ingredients in this cream versus my Avon Mira Cuticle and they matched better than most other creams.</li>
            <li>I used Working Hands and it helped me tremendously, and I noticed results after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it four stars is because it&#x27;s slightly sticky so best for use at night before bed rather than throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Have to give it a little more time to see greater results I think.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just very, very greasy.</li>
            <li>It is greedy at first but it absorbs into your skin very fast-</li>
            <li>and I would most definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li>it first feels sticky...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>It absorbed straight away.  </li>
            <li>First bought this is in my hairdresser shop.  </li>
            <li>This is the only cuticle cream I have been able to find in ages.  </li>
            <li>Qtica Intense Cuticle Repair Balm is a winner!</li>
            <li>Absolutely buy this cuticle cream!</li>
            <li>My nails felt better instantly!</li>
            <li>I started using this cuticle cream about 9 months ago, and it was the first time I had ever used cuticle cream before.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this product for many years and it is the only thing she uses on her cuticles.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I was at first put off by the price, but it works.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time finding it consistently at local retailers, so finding a reliable source on Amazon.com was perfect.  </li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t have to use very much.  </li>
            <li>and my cuticles are still dry and cracked, I would use it more often, but the greasiness becomes an issue then</li>
            <li>This cream is thick and nourishing with a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>you name it - it emulsifies dead skin and is so nicely lubricating I use it to massage bruises and to quickly buff my nails to a soft shine.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Our hospital uses a brand that is pure alcohol.  </li>
            <li>My nails look much healthier.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend  this balm!  </li>
            <li>If I use this faithfully every day, usually at bedtime my cuticles are very healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried for two weeks straight.  </li>
            <li>This has really helped me to not have hangnails this winter.</li>
            <li>it really works and I will be ordering it again when needed.</li>
            <li>Very helpful product.</li>
            <li>I moisturize my whole hands then put this around the cuticle and edges.  </li>
            <li>I use this nightly and have seen a real difference in my cuticles and my nails.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week and it absolutely works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been generous in applying and don&#x27;t expect to need it as much in summer with humidity returning.</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this from all the great reviews, but unfortunately it smells like an old lady.  </li>
            <li>I really, really hoped that this balm would help, and although it felt very nice and moisturizing, alas, it did nothing at all to help the problem with my cuticles and fingernails..  </li>
            <li>I actually like this better on my heels as it worked quickly to soften the dry skin I had.</li>
            <li>This product works very well, better than all of the other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>We live in a very dry climate, and with regular use it will keep your cuticles soft and attractive.</li>
            <li>This balm is very thick, with a pleasant odor.  </li>
            <li>I have a huge problem with dry flaking cuticles but this is helping a lot.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees for cuticles is similar and actually works better.  </li>
            <li>It did the job and smelled decent.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m usually a loyal Amazon customer, I just ordered the same product (2) from paylessbeauty.com for $14.20 a jar with no shipping charges.</li>
            <li>I am a little concerned about the fact that the balm at the top of the jar is a yellow color and a bit waxy, while underneath it is more creamy and white.</li>
            <li>While I do lie this product, the high price would stop me from purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>My cuticles have done a complete turn-around and my nails are much stronger now too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having spent way more than I should have, I decided to try Qtica intense repair serum in a last ditch effort.  </li>
            <li>It sure makes a difference if you go a few days without using it.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to share my experience and let you know that there are definitely cheaper alternatives of just as good, if not better quality.</li>
            <li>I love the texture - it is very thick and you only need a tiny amount - and I think the scent is so nice.</li>
            <li>Have tried other Qtica products in the past, but a friend recommended this and it works great.  </li>
            <li>How did I live before Qtica.  </li>
            <li>I keep debuting this product because I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I was so hopeful that this would be my new cuticle cream</li>
            <li>, this is as near to a miracle product as one will ever find!  </li>
            <li>When your cuticles need a serious touch of love, absolutely go for Qtica.</li>
            <li>I have really dry cuticles, and this product gave me the right moisture.</li>
            <li>had a co-worker recommend the professional oil you brush on.  </li>
            <li>It made my nails hydrated, but as far as the skin, it didn&#x27;t help with the cracking.</li>
            <li>I would have used it multiple times a day but the smell was too much.</li>
            <li>Keeps cuticles soft, looks like you&#x27;ve already had a manicure</li>
            <li>When I traveled without it, I noticed my nail beds were much dryer, so I bought a 2nd one just for travel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Others mentioned it feeling greasy, but I found that only happens if you use too much.</li>
            <li>She is a professional esthetician and recommends the product to everyone she knows.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it many times but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This solves the most serious cuticle issues.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price and last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is not great, but the product is absorbed quickly so it does not get on clothes etc.</li>
            <li>It has been the only one product that really helped me to fix my cuticle problem I have from several years ago.</li>
            <li>When my cuticles get dry and crack, I put some of this on and they are back to normal in minutes.</li>
            <li>You might only need to apply it every other day if you don&#x27;t have as much need for hand cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I have had dry cuticles for over a year now and this is  the first thing that works (in less than a week)...</li>

            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep using it to see if it gets better.  </li>
            <li> Glad it&#x27;s worked so well for so many others, though.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll try using it twice a day for a better result.</li>
            <li> I wish it was more convenient to carry it around with me.</li>
            <li> This cream worked wonderful and helped get dry areas softer.</li>
            <li> but they then ended up bleeding and the skin around my nails was swollen, red, and incredibly sore.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy ~ smooth application ~ works fabulous!</li>
            <li> Have used other brands and this is the best yet.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I used this balm faithfully it quickly healed both!  </li>
            <li> glad that I&#x27;m married!  </li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer especially to be used this time of year.</li>
            <li> She told me and showed me on my own nails how it really does repair cuticles!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I keep a jar in my car and use it to smooth my cuticles when I feel tempted to pick them.</li>
            <li> Great product for nails, works if you apply it on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> and I see a significant improvement in my cuticle.</li>
            <li> Rich, creamy, and does the trick.</li>
            <li> I also love the Lush &amp;#34;Lemony Flutter Cuticle Butter&amp;#34;, which is also a much better price.</li>
            <li> Daily use of this balm has completely stopped the splits and my nails look great!  </li>
            <li> Works great on dry, flakey elbows too!</li>
            <li> Very effective for dry &amp; cracking cuticles.</li>
            <li> But still, more cracking even in summer, more infections seemed inevitable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, however I wish it was sold in more stores.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product that is rich and thick without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the very first application.</li>
            <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t melt in the hot car!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product do far!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cuticle cream I have ever used, and I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> I have never taken the time to review anything on-line and rarely give anything the highest rating.  </li>
            <li> well worth</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this cream after the reviews and comparing the ingredients in this cream versus my Avon Mira Cuticle and they matched better than most other creams.</li>
            <li> I used Working Hands and it helped me tremendously, and I noticed results after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars is because it&#x27;s slightly sticky so best for use at night before bed rather than throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Have to give it a little more time to see greater results I think.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just very, very greasy.</li>
            <li> It is greedy at first but it absorbs into your skin very fast-</li>
            <li> and I would most definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> it first feels sticky...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> It absorbed straight away.  </li>
            <li> First bought this is in my hairdresser shop.  </li>
            <li> This is the only cuticle cream I have been able to find in ages.  </li>
            <li> Qtica Intense Cuticle Repair Balm is a winner!</li>
            <li> Absolutely buy this cuticle cream!</li>
            <li> My nails felt better instantly!</li>
            <li> I started using this cuticle cream about 9 months ago, and it was the first time I had ever used cuticle cream before.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for many years and it is the only thing she uses on her cuticles.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I was at first put off by the price, but it works.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding it consistently at local retailers, so finding a reliable source on Amazon.com was perfect.  </li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t have to use very much.  </li>
            <li> and my cuticles are still dry and cracked, I would use it more often, but the greasiness becomes an issue then</li>
            <li> This cream is thick and nourishing with a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> you name it - it emulsifies dead skin and is so nicely lubricating I use it to massage bruises and to quickly buff my nails to a soft shine.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Our hospital uses a brand that is pure alcohol.  </li>
            <li> My nails look much healthier.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend  this balm!  </li>
            <li> If I use this faithfully every day, usually at bedtime my cuticles are very healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried for two weeks straight.  </li>
            <li> This has really helped me to not have hangnails this winter.</li>
            <li> it really works and I will be ordering it again when needed.</li>
            <li> Very helpful product.</li>
            <li> I moisturize my whole hands then put this around the cuticle and edges.  </li>
            <li> I use this nightly and have seen a real difference in my cuticles and my nails.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week and it absolutely works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been generous in applying and don&#x27;t expect to need it as much in summer with humidity returning.</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this from all the great reviews, but unfortunately it smells like an old lady.  </li>
            <li> I really, really hoped that this balm would help, and although it felt very nice and moisturizing, alas, it did nothing at all to help the problem with my cuticles and fingernails..  </li>
            <li> I actually like this better on my heels as it worked quickly to soften the dry skin I had.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, better than all of the other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> We live in a very dry climate, and with regular use it will keep your cuticles soft and attractive.</li>
            <li> This balm is very thick, with a pleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> I have a huge problem with dry flaking cuticles but this is helping a lot.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees for cuticles is similar and actually works better.  </li>
            <li> It did the job and smelled decent.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m usually a loyal Amazon customer, I just ordered the same product (2) from paylessbeauty.com for $14.20 a jar with no shipping charges.</li>
            <li> I am a little concerned about the fact that the balm at the top of the jar is a yellow color and a bit waxy, while underneath it is more creamy and white.</li>
            <li> While I do lie this product, the high price would stop me from purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> My cuticles have done a complete turn-around and my nails are much stronger now too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having spent way more than I should have, I decided to try Qtica intense repair serum in a last ditch effort.  </li>
            <li> It sure makes a difference if you go a few days without using it.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to share my experience and let you know that there are definitely cheaper alternatives of just as good, if not better quality.</li>
            <li> I love the texture - it is very thick and you only need a tiny amount - and I think the scent is so nice.</li>
            <li> Have tried other Qtica products in the past, but a friend recommended this and it works great.  </li>
            <li> How did I live before Qtica.  </li>
            <li> I keep debuting this product because I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful that this would be my new cuticle cream</li>
            <li> , this is as near to a miracle product as one will ever find!  </li>
            <li> When your cuticles need a serious touch of love, absolutely go for Qtica.</li>
            <li> I have really dry cuticles, and this product gave me the right moisture.</li>
            <li> had a co-worker recommend the professional oil you brush on.  </li>
            <li> It made my nails hydrated, but as far as the skin, it didn&#x27;t help with the cracking.</li>
            <li> I would have used it multiple times a day but the smell was too much.</li>
            <li> Keeps cuticles soft, looks like you&#x27;ve already had a manicure</li>
            <li> When I traveled without it, I noticed my nail beds were much dryer, so I bought a 2nd one just for travel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Others mentioned it feeling greasy, but I found that only happens if you use too much.</li>
            <li> She is a professional esthetician and recommends the product to everyone she knows.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it many times but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This solves the most serious cuticle issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price and last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is not great, but the product is absorbed quickly so it does not get on clothes etc.</li>
            <li> It has been the only one product that really helped me to fix my cuticle problem I have from several years ago.</li>
            <li> When my cuticles get dry and crack, I put some of this on and they are back to normal in minutes.</li>
            <li> You might only need to apply it every other day if you don&#x27;t have as much need for hand cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I have had dry cuticles for over a year now and this is  the first thing that works (in less than a week)...</li>
            <li> This cuticle cream doesn&#x27;t work any better or any worse that other cuticle creams.</li>
            <li> The Qtica cuticle balm goes on thick and emollient but it absorbs very fast.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It is no longer a creamy balm but dry, chunky and leaves my cuticles irritated and red.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my hands and cuticles are extra dry???  </li>
            <li> and they take so long to absorb.</li>
            <li> This softens my cuticles but has not completely eliminated the hangnails.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick consistency really helped my cuticles.  </li>
            <li> My cuticles were always dry</li>
            <li> My hands got so dry</li>
            <li> Prevents the dry cracks around my finger tips and cuticles.</li>
            <li> They get dry and crack and this feeds into my nail biting problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that I have to keep applying any product if I don&#x27;t want dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> It actually kept the cuticles from growing down on the nail and splitting.  </li>
            <li> AND ACTUALLY PROMOTES CUTICLE HEALING IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS.</li>
            <li> Last time I ordered through one of Amazon&#x27;s sellers and the price was less than $12 for two jars.</li>
            <li> I suffer my very dry cuticles @</li>
            <li> I have very dry cuticles and have a nervous habit of picking them when under stress.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hands and suffer from splits around my nails, causing bleeding.</li>
            <li> Putting this on my Cuticles a few times a day keeps them nice and avoids the ugly dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The way I&#x27;m using it, I&#x27;m guessing this little jar will last 2 years.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive, but worth every penny because it actually works!</li>
            <li> I sometimes but not daily mess with some other products, like Burt&#x27;s Bees, Josie Maran argan oil, Essie cuticle pen (or just nothing).</li>
            <li> they immediately get rough and sore.  </li>
            <li> only lasts a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> after I apply, I take a few minutes every now and then to rub it in and also use the chance to push back my cuticles.</li>
            <li> Plus, it lasts a very long time because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on all the other products like I did, especially if you need intensive therapy.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad fingernails which are constantly cracking and tearing down to (and below) the quick, and hangnails and cuticles which look as if I were digging rocks all day!  </li>
            <li> I bought 3 different hand lotions which softened my hands, but was not very effective at the inflamed, bleeding cuticle/skin around the nail</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other cuticle repair creams over the years, from expensive European shea butter creams to Burt&#x27;s Bees and nothing</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and nothing works as well.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount</li>
            <li> This has worked wonders on my dry cuticles within just a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with dry cuticles for years.</li>
            <li> I have also been using it for a few very dry, almost callused finger knuckles and it works there, too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make a mess or smear all over like other creams.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but you need such a small amount each time that it seems it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricy but</li>
            <li> ONE LITTLE JAR LASTS FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little greasy, meaning it doesn&#x27;t soak in</li>
            <li> but within a few minutes, it dries yet keeps your cuticles moist.  </li>
            <li> My cuticles had dried up, cracked, and tore.  </li>
            <li> It was messy and ended up all over the place.  </li>
            <li> Same poor result.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few alternatives but</li>
            <li> I work in a hospital where the soaps and antibacterial agents are harsh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for just a few days</li>
            <li> and since we are both retired, it is not easy.</li>
            <li> They put a small jar in a box with a false bottom to try to make it look bigger than it is, so they know they are stealing from you.</li>
            <li> ( it takes forever to use up a small jar)</li>
            <li> other thing that bothers me is that the box has a false bottom in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse who has to use hand sanitizer at least 10 times an hour while at work.  </li>
            <li> After two days, the area had lost the swollen, red nasty appearance and the area turned soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In one application, the pain decreased substantially and it wasn&#x27;t an oily/greasy mess!</li>
            <li> Very expensive, but I appreciate buying several and saving the shipping.</li>
            <li> If it were not so ridiculously overpriced, I would give it four stars, but getting ripped off makes me petty.</li>
            <li> I confess I also pick at them, but only when they are already in bad shape.</li>
            <li> I have been blessed with thick cuticles!  </li>
            <li> Alas, I fear there isn&#x27;t one on this earth.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> This was basically useless to me.</li>
            <li> My cuticles were so dry my hands looked awful.</li>
            <li> I even made it through finals (a notoriously awful time of year for nail-biters) without losing a single nail.  </li>
            <li> When the weather turns cold, the skin around my nails painfully crack and bleed.</li>
            <li> You can imagine how bad they looked as well</li>
            <li> This year they got particularly bad off, band aids, neosporin, argan oil -</li>
            <li> They got SO bad</li>
            <li> I have had ugly cuticles for years.  </li>
            <li> I get rears and pulls and my fingers were always painful.</li>
            <li> In terms of effectiveness, I rank them in just that order.</li>
            <li> I also put it on 2x a day on the worst areas.</li>
            <li> My cuticles - both fingers and toes - were in terrible shape and nothing seemed to work.  </li>
            <li> so my cuticles are horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Been using this product for years it is great.  My two daughters and three sisters always have a jar in their house, we all love it.  Great stocking stuffer especially to be used this time of year.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cuticle cream I have ever used, and I have tried quite a few. I noticed a difference after the very first application. I love the texture - it is very thick and you only need a tiny amount - and I think the scent is so nice. This does what a cuticle cream should do. I don&#x27;t really like cuticle oils because I always find them to be just too messy and they take so long to absorb. The Qtica cuticle balm goes on thick and emollient but it absorbs very fast. I just love it. It leaves my cuticles exceptionally moisturized from day to day and I would most definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> When the weather turns cold, the skin around my nails painfully crack and bleed. I decided to give this product a try as I have been so happy with the lip balm. Since I have been using it twice a day, no cracking and bleeding. I&#x27;m smiling!</li>
            <li> The lady who does my manicures used this on me.  I have really dry cuticles, and this product gave me the right moisture.</li>
            <li> I have never taken the time to review anything on-line and rarely give anything the highest rating.  I have tried so many cuticle products...This one is amazing.  As another person had said...it first feels sticky...but within a few minutes, it dries yet keeps your cuticles moist.  My cuticles have done a complete turn-around and my nails are much stronger now too. My nails look much healthier.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse who has to use hand sanitizer at least 10 times an hour while at work.  Our hospital uses a brand that is pure alcohol.  My cuticles had dried up, cracked, and tore.  I had hangnails that I had to keep trimming but they then ended up bleeding and the skin around my nails was swollen, red, and incredibly sore.  You can imagine how bad they looked as well--it was embarrasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a co-worker recommend the professional oil you brush on.  It made it a bit softer but most wouldn&#x27;t absorb.  It was messy and ended up all over the place.  I then tried some \\&quot;bee oil\\&quot; stuff.  Same poor result.  I bought 3 different hand lotions which softened my hands, but was not very effective at the inflamed, bleeding cuticle/skin around the nail area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having spent way more than I should have, I decided to try Qtica intense repair serum in a last ditch effort.  OH MY GOSH!  In one application, the pain decreased substantially and it wasn&#x27;t an oily/greasy mess! It absorbed straight away.  After two days, the area had lost the swollen, red nasty appearance and the area turned soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For healthy cuticles and repair of skin around the nail area, this is as near to a miracle product as one will ever find!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on all the other products like I did, especially if you need intensive therapy.  I keep this in my nursing scrubs and apply it once or twice a shift to counteract all the handwashing and hand sanitizer.  My hands look and feel wonderful.  You might only need to apply it every other day if you don&#x27;t have as much need for hand cleansing.  I will never try anything else.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product!!</li>
            <li> First bought this is in my hairdresser shop.  The manicurist recommended it.  She told me and showed me on my own nails how it really does repair cuticles!&lt;br /&gt;At that time I worked for a hospital, filling paper charts.  My cuticles were always dry and I had paper cuts.  I used this balm faithfully it quickly healed both!  The shop quit selling the balm  ( it takes forever to use up a small jar) but I found it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend  this balm!  It is a little pricy but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Next, I am going to try it on my cracked heals!</li>
            <li> This product works well and smells great. It leave your cuticles moisturized without feeling greasy. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> this is absolutely without a doubt the best cuticle cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m a licensed manicurist and trust me it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I was dismayed when my local salon stopped carrying it so I was pleased to find it here.  I keep a jar in my car and use it to smooth my cuticles when I feel tempted to pick them. This cream doesn&#x27;t melt in the hot car!</li>
            <li> Very effective for dry &amp; cracking cuticles.</li>
            <li> Great product, both for cuticles as well as nails</li>
            <li> I have really bad fingernails which are constantly cracking and tearing down to (and below) the quick, and hangnails and cuticles which look as if I were digging rocks all day!  I really, really hoped that this balm would help, and although it felt very nice and moisturizing, alas, it did nothing at all to help the problem with my cuticles and fingernails..  Sad.</li>
            <li> Great product for nails, works if you apply it on a regular basis.  I have been blessed with thick cuticles!  This product makes it more managable until I forget to use it.</li>
            <li> It actually works. I have had dry cuticles for over a year now and this is  the first thing that works (in less than a week)...</li>
            <li> This is the best cuticle cream I have ever found.  It seems to strengthen my nails in addition to keeping my cuticles in shape.</li>
            <li> If I use this faithfully every day, usually at bedtime my cuticles are very healthy. It sure makes a difference if you go a few days without using it. I will definitely re-purchase this. Have used other brands and this is the best yet.</li>
            <li> Nothing says &#x27;manly&#x27; like greasing up your cuticles at night and sleeping with gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works well.  It&#x27;s just very, very greasy.</li>
            <li> If I use this nightly my cuticles don&#x27;t get ragged.  If  I don&#x27;t or just use lotion (like when traveling) they immediately get rough and sore.  I have tried other products and nothing works as well.  I am happy to pay the price (and now have a jar in my travel kit.)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years. I highly recommend this product, however I wish it was sold in more stores.</li>
            <li> I have not found anything else that works better.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this....it works!  Plus, it lasts a very long time because a little goes a long way.  If you have any excess on your fingers, rub it off on your elbows for extra softness on another problem area!</li>
            <li> Very nice cuticle cream!  I am a nurse, and the alcohol-based handrub dries out my hands, as do the Michigan winters.  This cream is thick and nourishing with a pleasant scent.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because it&#x27;s slightly sticky so best for use at night before bed rather than throughout the day.  However, it is an excellent cream which does help to repair damaged cuticles; I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I liked this and I will buy it again.  It did the job and I like it.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful. As a nail biter it helped heal and stimulate my cuticles</li>
            <li> this my second time ordering the cuticle balm.  It is the best.</li>
            <li> This product is great! You only need a small amount and i only apply it about once every three weeks. The bottle will last forever! It&#x27;s a necessity during the winter months. My hands got so dry and my fingertips would crack. Not anymore!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in hopes that it would help my cracked cuticles and skin around my nails. This was basically useless to me. It made my nails hydrated, but as far as the skin, it didn&#x27;t help with the cracking. I used Working Hands and it helped me tremendously, and I noticed results after the first time I used it. Save yourself the money and hassle, and skip Qtica and go for the Okeefe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have had ugly cuticles for years.  Have tried other Qtica products in the past, but a friend recommended this and it works great.  Give it a week or two, but there will be a noticeable difference in hangnails and cuticle hardness.  I carry one in my purse and put another on my nightstand.</li>
            <li> Miracle. I have always suffered from cracked and irritated cuticles. I confess I also pick at them, but only when they are already in bad shape. This year they got particularly bad off, band aids, neosporin, argan oil - no help. They got SO bad I actually got an infection that required Rx. But still, more cracking even in summer, more infections seemed inevitable. Enter Qtica. Like others, I put it on and used cotton gloves at night. I also put it on 2x a day on the worst areas. It has been 4 days and I&#x27;m in near-perfect shape. Thank you Qtica. This solves the most serious cuticle issues. I will be making it part of my regular routine.</li>
            <li> I have ordered and used this repair balm for a year or more and thought it was the best cuticle cream on the market.  But the formula has obviously been changed.  It is no longer a creamy balm but dry, chunky and leaves my cuticles irritated and red.  I would no longer recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I suppose this product would work better if I could use it more often but my husband is allergic to fragrances and this is rather potent.  I can only use it when he isn&#x27;t around and since we are both retired, it is not easy.</li>
            <li> Product works well and is handy to carry in a purse.  Very expensive, but I appreciate buying several and saving the shipping.</li>
            <li> This ointment is amazing! It works on cuticles, nail ridges, scabby skin, bruises - you name it - it emulsifies dead skin and is so nicely lubricating I use it to massage bruises and to quickly buff my nails to a soft shine.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am a little concerned about the fact that the balm at the top of the jar is a yellow color and a bit waxy, while underneath it is more creamy and white. The jar had a seal on it, but there are no instructions as to whether any separation is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that bothers me is that the box has a false bottom in it. The jar itself has no labeling at all to indicate that it is actually 0.5 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I should return the product or keep it...</li>
            <li> I use this every night in the winter all over my hands and cuticles and then wear white cotton gloves.  Prevents the dry cracks around my finger tips and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Not greasy ~ smooth application ~ works fabulous!</li>
            <li> It has been the only one product that really helped me to fix my cuticle problem I have from several years ago.</li>
            <li> My cuticles - both fingers and toes - were in terrible shape and nothing seemed to work.  This balm is very thick, with a pleasant odor.  It rubs in and absorbs nicely and seems to be working - my cuticles are looking better after just a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried for two weeks straight.  My cuticles still break/chap.  Can&#x27;t blame it on not drinking enough water.  I drink enough for three people.</li>
            <li> great item  well buy again</li>
            <li> Have tried many cuticle cremes and this one ranks at the top of my list because of its emmuliant properties.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES THE JOB.  WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE AND ACTUALLY PROMOTES CUTICLE HEALING IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS. ONE LITTLE JAR LASTS FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it many times but a little goes a long way. I suffer my very dry cuticles @ my job doesn&#x27;t make any better, so I needed some kind of moisture for them. I&#x27;m in love with this product do far!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, feels even better going on.  Leaves my cuticles in better shape every time I use it.  I had a hard time finding it consistently at local retailers, so finding a reliable source on Amazon.com was perfect.  Doesn&#x27;t make a mess or smear all over like other creams.  Stays on where you put it and need it most--thanks to the beeswax I think.</li>
            <li> This is the only cuticle cream I have been able to find in ages.  I bought it after reading the nurse&#x27;s review.  It works well but doesn&#x27;t soak in.  For this reason I use it at night and apply hand cream over it.  The best product for cuticles that I have used Is the Avon Mira-Cuticle which is no longer available.  It actually kept the cuticles from growing down on the nail and splitting.  The Qtica  moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t control the cuticle growth.</li>
            <li> This softens my cuticles but has not completely eliminated the hangnails. I actually like this better on my heels as it worked quickly to soften the dry skin I had. I use at night on all my nail beds and heels. While I do lie this product, the high price would stop me from purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> This cuticle balm is great. When my cuticles get dry and crack, I put some of this on and they are back to normal in minutes. This has really helped me to not have hangnails this winter.</li>
            <li> The cuticle cream that I have used for years is no longer on the market.  I have tried a few alternatives but none compared to the product that I used to use until I tried Qtica.  It is a very good product that is rich and thick without being greasy.  I use it regularly and it is excellent.  Have already recommended to others.</li>
            <li> it really works and I will be ordering it again when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  The best ever</li>
            <li> you can buy a 0,25oz at $14,75</li>
            <li> This balm is about like a tube of burts bees lip balm in a jar. If it were not so ridiculously overpriced, I would give it four stars, but getting ripped off makes me petty. They put a small jar in a box with a false bottom to try to make it look bigger than it is, so they know they are stealing from you. Just buy a tube of Burt&#x27;s beeswax lip balm and put the ten bucks you save towards a manicure.</li>
            <li> This is nice cuticle cream. I just wish it didnt smell like baby powder! I would have used it multiple times a day but the smell was too much.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cuticle cream about a month ago after reading the customer reviews.  I have very dry cuticles and have a nervous habit of picking them when under stress.  This stuff is wonderful!  My hands looked so much better within a couple of days.  I personally like the fragrance and the sticky feeling only lasts a few minutes.  I keep one jar next to my bed and am buying another one for my desk at work.</li>
            <li> My cuticles are beyond repair, but I was in hopes for a miracle. Alas, I fear there isn&#x27;t one on this earth. However, this product does a wonderful job of keeping the brittle edges under control. So, young ladies out there, DON&#x27;T CHEW YOUR CUTICLES, or yours will look like mine some day !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Qtica Intense Cuticle Repair Balm is a winner! This has worked wonders on my dry cuticles within just a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother looking for anything else. This works! ~ The Boss and Mrs. B.</li>
            <li> I had bought a ton of cuticle creams and oil. My cuticles were so dry my hands looked awful. I get manicures every 2 weeks also. This cream worked wonderful and helped get dry areas softer. Read reviews before buying.</li>
            <li> I work in health care and wash my hands or alcohol scrub them 50+ times daily so my cuticles are horrible.  I get rears and pulls and my fingers were always painful. This product is the only one I have found that helps.  It used to be carried at Ulta and in their wisdom they stopped carrying it.  THANK YOU for having it.</li>
            <li> I received this product a week ago and I see a significant improvement in my cuticle. The smell is not great, but the product is absorbed quickly so it does not get on clothes etc. Will get a second jar to keep at my desk.</li>
            <li> How did I live before Qtica.  It smells delicious, it works great, and it is not too greasy.  WOWOW!  The cuticles look much better and this product should be sold in the stores too!</li>
            <li> Absolutely buy this cuticle cream! A tiny bit goes a long way! Works great on dry, flakey elbows too! I put this on both my fingers and my toes!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t the best of the best.  Burt&#x27;s Bees for cuticles is similar and actually works better.  And is quite a bit cheaper too!</li>
            <li> Very helpful product. Keeps cuticles soft, looks like you&#x27;ve already had a manicure</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with dry cuticles for years. They get dry and crack and this feeds into my nail biting problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cuticle repair balm for 3 weeks now and my nails are longer and healthier than I can remember them ever being! I even made it through finals (a notoriously awful time of year for nail-biters) without losing a single nail.  I&#x27;m about to order some for my mom and grandmother for Mother&#x27;s Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other cuticle repair creams over the years, from expensive European shea butter creams to Burt&#x27;s Bees and nothing has been this effective. My nails felt better instantly!</li>
            <li> I started using this cuticle cream about 9 months ago, and it was the first time I had ever used cuticle cream before. It was great! It did the job and smelled decent. However, this is the most expensive cuticle cream and I have found cheaper, better alternatives. Burt&#x27;s Bees has a great cuticle cream and it is much more inexpensive. I also love the Lush &amp;#34;Lemony Flutter Cuticle Butter&amp;#34;, which is also a much better price. So if you want to buy this product, go ahead! I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it. I just wanted to share my experience and let you know that there are definitely cheaper alternatives of just as good, if not better quality.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works great, it&#x27;s easy to use.  The scent is blah... But who sticks their finger in their nose?</li>
            <li> This cuticle cream doesn&#x27;t work any better or any worse that other cuticle creams. I find that I have to keep applying any product if I don&#x27;t want dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> I have a huge problem with dry flaking cuticles but this is helping a lot. Expensive, but you need such a small amount each time that it seems it will last a long time. also sometimes I just put a bit on my problem cuticles and for the rest a hand moisturizer suffices. so it will last a looong time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now. We live in a very dry climate, and with regular use it will keep your cuticles soft and attractive. I keep an extra jar in my purse. Last time I ordered through one of Amazon&#x27;s sellers and the price was less than $12 for two jars. Amazon&#x27;s own price now is $18.34 per jar. Although I&#x27;m usually a loyal Amazon customer, I just ordered the same product (2) from paylessbeauty.com for $14.20 a jar with no shipping charges.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  I work in a hospital where the soaps and antibacterial agents are harsh.  Putting this on my Cuticles a few times a day keeps them nice and avoids the ugly dry skin.  This is a great value because I put mine on 3-4+ times a day (mon-fri) and this tiny bottle lasts me ~5-6 months.  I love this stuff.  Smells great.  It is greedy at first but it absorbs into your skin very fast- especially of you need the moisture.  I keep debuting this product because I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Great product - use every night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick consistency really helped my cuticles.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Not greasy or sticky and you really don&#x27;t have to use very much.  It lasts a long time.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this from all the great reviews, but unfortunately it smells like an old lady.  Guess I&#x27;ll only be using this before I slip off to bed...glad that I&#x27;m married!  I&#x27;d never get a date again...unless it was with a person that enjoys grandma smells!</li>
            <li> I read everyone&#x27;s reviews before I purchased this balm.  It seemed perfect for what I need.  When I received it, the box said I would see results in five minutes.  Well, I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I haven&#x27;t seen any change.  Maybe my hands and cuticles are extra dry???  I&#x27;m going to keep using it to see if it gets better.  I don&#x27;t want to bother returning it.  Glad it&#x27;s worked so well for so many others, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for just a few days and I notice an improvement already.  I moisturize my whole hands then put this around the cuticle and edges.  Then I wear my moisturizing gloves.  FINALLY my fingers look healthier.</li>
            <li> Rich, creamy, and does the trick. I use this nightly and have seen a real difference in my cuticles and my nails. When I traveled without it, I noticed my nail beds were much dryer, so I bought a 2nd one just for travel. It&#x27;s worth the price and last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others mentioned it feeling greasy, but I found that only happens if you use too much. A simple touch in the jar gives me enough for all my nails.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for many years and it is the only thing she uses on her cuticles. She is a professional esthetician and recommends the product to everyone she knows. Give it a shot, especially at the price online, don&#x27;t buy it from a salon...unless it&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s. ;)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it twice a week and it absolutely works. I have also been using it for a few very dry, almost callused finger knuckles and it works there, too. I was at first put off by the price, but it works. I&#x27;ve been generous in applying and don&#x27;t expect to need it as much in summer with humidity returning. The way I&#x27;m using it, I&#x27;m guessing this little jar will last 2 years. It absorbs well -- after I apply, I take a few minutes every now and then to rub it in and also use the chance to push back my cuticles. I feel like my nails also get a bit of a treat -- especially after I&#x27;ve used nail polish remover, and I feel the effects into the next couple of days. In between days that I use Qtica I sometimes but not daily mess with some other products, like Burt&#x27;s Bees, Josie Maran argan oil, Essie cuticle pen (or just nothing). In terms of effectiveness, I rank them in just that order. When your cuticles need a serious touch of love, absolutely go for Qtica. It has totally saved me this winter.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, better than all of the other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands and suffer from splits around my nails, causing bleeding.Daily use of this balm has completely stopped the splits and my nails look great!  It is a little expensive, but worth every penny because it actually works!</li>
            <li> I used to use an Avon product that is no longer but it worked wonders. Healing was noticeable within a day or so. I decided to try this cream after the reviews and comparing the ingredients in this cream versus my Avon Mira Cuticle and they matched better than most other creams. The cream smells good, not too strong and it goes on smoothly without leaving a greasy feeling. I use it daily in the morning and notice that it helps keeps my cuticles moist but not like my prior Avon product. It hasn&#x27;t repaired my cuticles like others have said so maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe I&#x27;ll try using it twice a day for a better result. I was so hopeful that this would be my new cuticle cream but the search continues.</li>
            <li> Works well to moisturizer my cuticles at night before I go to bed. Have to give it a little more time to see greater results I think. I wish it was more convenient to carry it around with me.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Works wonderfully. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this product, it smells like beeswax, honey, and baby powder. it&#x27;s a little greasy, meaning it doesn&#x27;t soak in very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem with this cuticle cream, is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile now and my cuticles are still dry and cracked, I would use it more often, but the greasiness becomes an issue then, I don&#x27;t want cuticle cream all over my phone, remotes, or laptop.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of buying this again, I think I&#x27;m going to try Burts Bee&#x27;s or stick with coconut oil like I was using before.</li>
