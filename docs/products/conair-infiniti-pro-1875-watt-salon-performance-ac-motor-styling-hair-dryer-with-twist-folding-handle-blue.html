            <li>Very good hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The Infinitipro by Conair is a hair dryer that features an ingenuous design which makes it ideal for home or travel.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Plenty of power and the removable nozzle is great for styling without worrying about heat.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer has the makings of being a great one.</li>
            <li>It has a great blow, but it takes forever to heat up.</li>
            <li>these days, I try not to check bags when I fly, so space inside my suitcase is at a premium.</li>
            <li>What a great concept!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Without sacrificing any of the features you might expect from a great hair dryer, the compact design makes this product stand out from the competition.</li>
            <li>Great for traveling.</li>
            <li>the watage is great.</li>
            <li>It was was a bargain and gives great power and is lightweight.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>It dries hair great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why the packaging says AC motor and the blurb says DC - however it works great.  </li>

            <li>We&#x27;ve been using it for a month and it works great.</li>
            <li>and it has great blowing power.</li>

            <li>Does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This dryer works great, but the colour options are hideous.</li>
            <li>The attachment is great for concentrating on one area as to not make hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Great value and received promptly...</li>
            <li>The Conair dryer is great.  </li>
            <li>lol i read some of the reviews and went ahead and purchased it.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s still running great, and for the price</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s a great dryer.</li>

            <li>Very nice.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice hairdryer.</li>
            <li>it is very handy though.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Have had this for more than a year now with no problems as everything is still operating perfectly.  </li>
            <li>My hair is a medium bob style and  the rotating straightening piece is perfect for creating a stylish look.</li>
            <li>Very good product, blows air powerfully without burning your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It works great, looks great and the handle folds up nicely to make it compact.</li>
            <li>The Infinitpro is a good example...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good product by Conair.</li>
            <li>and it dries hair really good.  </li>
            <li>Lots of power does a GOOD JOB</li>
            <li>So far-pretty good.</li>
            <li>It was a good price</li>
            <li>I LOVED IT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to travel with because it folds up nicely.</li>
            <li>A GOOD PURCHASE - GAVE AS A GIFT</li>
            <li>Recommended by my hairdresser, as she purchased it for a vacation cruise &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise great value, great dryer, very powerful!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very pleased I bought it.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>LOVE this dryer!  </li>
            <li>otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li>With that being said, I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>love this product !</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this hairdryer!  </li>
            <li>Great power, easy to hold and store.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer and drys hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>the color is amazing</li>
            <li>Its absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>It also would would have been nice to have the diffuser attachment to create funkier hair styles.</li>
            <li>Nice feature with the swivel handle, to make packing it easier, for on the go people.  </li>
            <li>Nice color</li>
            <li>Excellent styler and works great on my short hair, too!</li>
            <li>The cord is durable and the settings are nice.</li>
            <li>And the compact feature comes in handy if you travel a lot.</li>
            <li>When folded it fits into its own carrier bag.  </li>
            <li>The folding handle and travel bag were a nice touch</li>
            <li>Thought it would be better to spend the money and get a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li>So I hadn&#x27;t updated my hair dryer in years (think 15), so I was really thrilled to receive this one.</li>
            <li>Verrrry nice zippered travel bag for dryer, one of the classiest I&#x27;ve ever seen.    </li>
            <li>One of the reasons I chose it was because of its ability to fold up and the nice travel bag they provide with it.</li>
            <li>Nice color.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it and immediately bought it.  </li>
            <li>I believe that this drier&#x27;s main greatest feature is that it is portable and can be taken in plane trips, any vacations etc and get saloon quality styling.   </li>
            <li>This is an excellent blow dryer, as it dries extremely quickly and creates a smooth, frizz-free shine.</li>
            <li>The best feature of this hair dryer is the Cool Shot feature, which blows cool air for just a moment.  </li>
            <li>Quality is good, sturdy, easy to use.</li>
            <li>in all a very good compact hair dryer that drys hair fast.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with it, very strong and lightweight.</li>
            <li>For at home use, though, or even for travel where bulk/weight are not a problem  this unit is an excellent value for a relatively modest price.</li>
            <li>It took a bit of doing to get the folding action to loosen up, but once I got the hang of it, it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the original Conair 1875.</li>
            <li>It has replaced the one I had, though while it still works fine, it can&#x27;t rival this one!</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels very cheap.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>eight feet would have been better.</li>
            <li>the drier really makes it a great buy.</li>
            <li>It is not the kind of light blow dryer I&#x27;d buy for travel.  </li>
            <li>and I feel confident in recommending it, plus</li>
            <li>give it a shot and all agreed it was top notch.    </li>
            <li>My girls love this hair blower -</li>
            <li>For now I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This is a good styling tool to give a pre-teen who wants their own.  </li>
            <li>This is a good hair dryer in a fun color.  </li>
            <li>but there are more compact hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>I love the attachments.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not in love with the dryer itself.</li>
            <li>My hair would fly all over the place and become very tangled</li>
            <li>OMG I LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER.  </li>
            <li>Made the dryer much more portable.</li>
            <li>Love this hair drier.</li>
            <li>Love that it folds.</li>
            <li>Love it as a home use dryer.  </li>
            <li>What more can I ask?  </li>
            <li>Your hand won&#x27;t fall off after using it! :)</li>
            <li>Perfect in either setting, even the cooler version actually still dries your hair</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>safe ALCI plug - will turn itself off if blow drier is dropped in water</li>
            <li>They also state that the dryer is using &#x27;ionic technology&#x27; which &#x27;promotes healthy, shining hair while fighting frizz&#x27;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>indicates that the makers are confident that they are selling you a quality device</li>
            <li>I love the power this dryer has.  </li>
            <li>Best hair dryer ever especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>What more can be said?</li>
            <li>Compared to the numerous brands I just tried this was still my favorite and am happy to have it!</li>
            <li>Love this dryer.</li>
            <li>and i recieved it on monday :))</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it</li>
            <li>I LOVE this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>and they love it too</li>
            <li>I love anything and everything</li>
            <li>really love how the handle turns and folds up.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It probably makes a better &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; dryer than anything.  </li>
            <li>:) And my hair seems just as healthy as ever, but I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li>AND THE COLOR IS BETTER</li>
            <li>Love the color and that it folds compactly.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my spare bathroom, and all my girlfriends love it.</li>
            <li>Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>Powerful and surprisingly lighter than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Its strong and dries hair quickly and its a gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>for this price its worth it!!</li>
            <li>&quot; So there you go, about the best one can say for a nice green folding hairdryer in this price range.</li>
            <li>I love that it folds up to store easily.  </li>
            <li>love the color, works fine, just what I wanted,  no problems with it at all.  </li>
            <li>The color is very cool</li>
            <li>Works great thus far</li>
            <li>The warm setting is just right</li>
            <li>That was probably the most valuable feature for the original Conair 1875.</li>
            <li>The original is much better.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer promotes many of the features of this unit as great for traveling, the folding handle, the bag that is included etc but the bottom line is that this unit is bulky, even with the hand turned and weighs enough that, in these days of strict baggage limits could pose a problem.  </li>
            <li>I love the twist on and off lid by the motor because it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I found this blow dryer to be easy to use and store.  </li>
            <li>That bag fits easily in any suitcase or briefcase (or purse if you carry one).  </li>
            <li>The handle does an easy twist to fold so it fits in the accompanying bag.  </li>
            <li>It says it will last longer than most dryers which is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact fold in design makes for easy storage in a drawer</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so strong that it tangles my hair, and since I need to add volume to my hair, I don&#x27;t like brushing it a lot while drying, which I have to do with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer worked fine for me.  </li>
            <li>The tote is fine</li>
            <li>My wife and daughters have many, and this one has quickly become the default.</li>
            <li>Faster drying time without any heat damage to my hair is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>Works really well and heats nicely.</li>
            <li>and they thought that was light...</li>
            <li>It sound stronger, with a quieter engine hum.</li>
            <li>Leaves it smooth &amp; shiney.  </li>
            <li>great hairdryer for the price, punches well above its weight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great purchase, I expect this item to last quite a while, as cheaper quality driers die on me after 2 years.</li>
            <li>Has enough power and does a great job drying</li>
            <li>that one is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>My wife with her beautiful long hair always uses a blow dryer after washing it.</li>
            <li>Passed it on to a young niece who loved the color.</li>
            <li>I love the color which is more intense than in the picture</li>
            <li>it is so far so good.</li>
            <li>Very useful.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>I bought this hairdryer because I had an older version that I liked, but needed to replace.  </li>
            <li>love that the handle folds up for easy storage, and it&#x27;s really lightweight.</li>
            <li>The attachments it comes with also work pretty nicely and fit pretty snug.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Always been a conair user and after my original conair blow dryer was torn up by the dog (which I had for 6 years)</li>
            <li>The motor is quiet, the dryer itself is pretty light, the blow is intense, and the best part?</li>
            <li>The cool setting provides a nice little gush of cooler air and the folding ability has been pretty handy (albeit mainly handy for going on trips).  </li>
            <li>The lint catcher is detachable to easily clean off the lint</li>
            <li>I gets nice and hot, but not to hot to were</li>
            <li>Besides a tote bag, it comes with snap-on concentrator for special styling needs.    </li>
            <li>She was right!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good dryer</li>
            <li>With its modern style setting look, it is just adorable.</li>
            <li>The portability of this styler should not fool you as you have a full 1875 watts.  </li>
            <li>4 year warranty is quite good when compared with what you get for similarly priced electronics.</li>
            <li>Cool shot to hold a style.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, but this one is my favorite because it dries my hair SO fast without drying it out.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;twisting&amp;#34; handle doesn&#x27;t really make it more travel-sized, just changes the shape.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good hair dryer, especially for the money.</li>
            <li>I came upon it in Costco for such a good deal, that I bought another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this full hair dryer that isn&#x27;t compact while retracted -and  has the full power of a normal hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>It does come with a travel pouch and a nice feature of easily twisting and untwisting the handle does make it a little more compact, but it is still rather bulky to stick in a gym bag or carry on suitcase.    </li>
            <li>I bought from Lucky Sales.</li>
            <li>and this dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done quickly, though.  </li>
            <li>and it is what sold me, but the video makes this dryer look more powerful than it really is.  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair really quickly...</li>
            <li>It puts out good heat and is not very loud.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this unit for home use, for travel, I&#x27;d suggest you find a more compact/lightweight unit and skip this one.</li>
            <li>The low setting is perfect: not too low and not too high and great for styling short hair.  </li>
            <li>And the best part is that it actually gets more powerful rather than less powerful when using the Cool Shot feature.  </li>
            <li>The unit is a very pretty color.  </li>
            <li>For home main usage, you may want one with great many features and frills, but this simple styler will serve you most of your needs already and is useful to take along as said above.</li>
            <li>The attachments that come with it are great, and it cuts down a ton on frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent long cord and quiet motor.  </li>
            <li>My daughter took the first one!  </li>
            <li>Even though this is a powerful drier that delivers very hot air</li>
            <li>And the hot doesn&#x27;t burn your eyelashes off!  </li>
            <li>I used this while vacationing with a friend and it was the first thing I came home and bought!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I will probably take the plunge and buy a higher-end hair dryer in the future, until then, this is OK and will get me through!</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is powerful.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to friends and family because it is a powerful hair dryer</li>
            <li>Even useful when not traveling.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a lightweight, powerful hairdryer, and this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One distinct feature is the &#x27;folding handle&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Nice folding handle if traveling is required as well as the short barrell.  </li>
            <li>i did a bit on research on some blow dryers and to be honest this one caught my eye only because the color</li>
            <li>It is really powerful.</li>
            <li>And the lower setting just didn&#x27;t feel warm enough.</li>
            <li>Was to powerful for mid-back length hair.  </li>
            <li>Airflow is powerful- dries my hair about 30% faster.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is MUCH more powerful than my old model ever was, even in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and powerful,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a powerful dryer.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s 4 YEARS which is not bad.</li>
            <li>It is definitely powerful in terms of airflow, maybe the most powerful of all hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned, but it does not get nearly hot enough to smooth or control my hair in any way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty quick.</li>
            <li>It gets super hot.</li>
            <li>This seems like a good quality buy, certainly for the price, but no professional dryer.</li>
            <li>I loved my other Conair hair dryer</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer right after my old Conair tourmaline died (that lasted almost eight years!) and wanted a powerful dryer that could easily be traveled with.</li>
            <li>is that the right word?</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy this right now.</li>
            <li>This is nice if you are starting to overheat from all of the hot air.  </li>
            <li>Great little dryer!</li>
            <li>I liked that if folded down, but it didn&#x27;t feel secure.</li>
            <li>I love how it folds down for better storage.</li>
            <li>She has been very happy with this one and it seems to dry her hair a lot faster than the other one did.</li>
            <li>Love the neon green color and love how the handle folds for travel.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t review it for a couple months to see if it died early, but no, it&#x27;s going strong.</li>
            <li>Way loud, but really strong</li>
            <li>She liked it so much that this is the only dryer she uses.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the fastest dryers I&#x27;ve used, and on high, the air has a strong, fast flow.</li>
            <li>I found the Infinitipro to be an extremely versatile hair dryer that was easy to use and especially easy to store due to the ability of the drier to fold at the handle.</li>
            <li>I like the hair dryer very much.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, coarse, porous hair, and I believe the drying time has been greatly reduced thanks to this handy tool.  </li>
            <li>It is full size, but not overly big and thus it is easy to handle and not tiresome to use.</li>
            <li>But most importantly, even though it seemed to dry my hair in a fairly short amount of time (not the fastest, but okay), there was just too much \\&quot;wind\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight but powerful.</li>
            <li>The only two things that could be better are the handle and the weight.</li>
            <li>it works well, generates all the hot air anyone could want - but you get the sense that Conair is stretching a bit to try to come up with something that stands out against the competition.     </li>
            <li>I have this exact product at home, so I know what it&#x27;s supposed to look like.</li>
            <li>Heat is hot but not scorching, does not burn hair.</li>
            <li>Hot air is needed for styling, which is not happening with this machine.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks much better using a different, hotter dryer.</li>
            <li>Have to say I chose it because of its design in the first place.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware when I bought this, but it has an attachment on the end to focus the heat for styling.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>do wish it had a hot or hotter setting though like the Infinity Pro by Conair</li>
            <li>selected this one because I was so pleased with the last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color and functionality of this dryer</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I first used this hair dryer at a friend&#x27;s cabin and I was hooked.</li>
            <li>On hot, it gets truly hot.  </li>
            <li>It was a nice design and really seems dry hair well.  </li>
            <li>The right amount of heat and it really is lightweight .</li>
            <li>It is a bit heavy and loud, but I still consider it a great buy.</li>
            <li>IT folds for easy travel and puts out a lot of air for quick dry.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a good basic hairdryer for quick drying without damaging the hair.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair so fast without being too hot.</li>
            <li>air button is a nice feature and comb diffuser has seen much use with other members of my family</li>
            <li>really love the attachment on this hair dryer it works very well when I am drying my hair to get it somewhat strait before I flat iron it.</li>
            <li>It is quite decent, but most of the hair dryers have that same power.</li>
            <li>The cool air finishing setting is also a nice option and does seem to set the styling,  This unit has some additional extra features that, while they don&#x27;t impact it&#x27;s basic performance are nice additions, the first is a circuit breaker switch on the wall plug as a safety factor, also the cord is long enough to allow ease of positioning.  </li>
            <li>SO easy to use, folds for smaller packing.</li>
            <li>This gets the job done, It dries my hair pretty fast, but my hair is very frizzy after which annoys me.  </li>
            <li>Has off, high, and low switch along with a cool shot that surpresses the heat for cool drying.  </li>
            <li>The high gives off a lot of heat and force but the low is too low heat wise.</li>
            <li>Now I understand that there is some claim about certain ceramic and ion technology that should give a smoother hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sort of already loose without showing off too many twists...  </li>
            <li>and I needed to pick up a new one right away because my hair is a disaster if I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer after washing.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer on high doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>It is very well built and has a very high quality feel to it.</li>
            <li>I use low setting and it dries my hair fast and at a comfortable temperature.</li>
            <li>Really like everything about this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The handle is quite smooth and I wish it had either a rubberized grip or different shape</li>
            <li>All the standard temp settings are there and the light and compact feel of</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it was worth the price unless you really are in love with the shiny apple green color.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Now I just have to hope that it will fit properly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this blow dryer!</li>
            <li>I should really order another</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really consider it a usable setting.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer has so much power but is also quieter than others.  </li>
            <li>Was a gift, granddaughter really like the power.</li>
            <li>I suppose I am looking for a dryer that gets hotter than this without so much air blowing at me.</li>
            <li>THANKS INFINITI PRO</li>
            <li>FOR KEEPING IT REAL</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bonus that it works very well, too.</li>
            <li>and it seems every blower would take a water break halfway through because it was being worked too much.</li>
            <li>, modern look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Negatives: None that I can think of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I took one star off because it just doesn&#x27;t quite measure up to my T3, but it really isn&#x27;t designed to compete in that class.</li>
            <li>I will likely keep it as a travel hair dryer, but I think I&#x27;d even prefer to use a cheap hotel hair dryer over this one...</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is powerful without being too loud.</li>
            <li>Also very convenient that it folds up.</li>
            <li>Got what I expected :)</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and portable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really appreciated</li>
            <li>Came with diffuser, which works very well.</li>
            <li>The color is a matter of preference, it is as seen in the photo, a metallic kind of sheen green, and we like the color, it stands out.  </li>
            <li>As far as being compact, it is better than the standard non folding hair dryer</li>
            <li>Powerful wind speed, it dries my long hair fairly quick even without the concentrator, and the foldable handle accommodates well for dorm storage.</li>
            <li>I wish it were just a little bit smaller, but it&#x27;s still a pretty good size.  </li>
            <li>Powerful to dry hair quickly.</li>
            <li>The dryer is too powerful to be used on high near my ears unless I use the diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it is rather long</li>
            <li>Wow this is hot.  </li>
            <li>It has two heat settings---high and low, and there is a button that turns off the heating element so that cool air continues to blow.</li>
            <li>Works fine but wish I had read a review that warned of the limited settings.</li>
            <li>By using the attachments it is possible to direct the airflow precisely where needed</li>
            <li>Build quality seems adequate - not terrific, but not the sort of thing that will fall apart in a week.</li>
            <li>In operation, I found the unit to work quickly and to be fairly quiet.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t particularly like to shlep this thing around.  </li>
            <li>At 1875 Watt, this packs enough power that matches most current hairdryers.</li>
            <li>The main reason I chose this dryer was because it said it came with two attachments, a concentrator and a diffuser.</li>
            <li>The photo shows another model and the product sent was the older model.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the idea that the unit&#x27;s handle folds into the body to conserve space in my drawer</li>
            <li>The controls are pretty straight forward, no different than most other hairdryers.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer looks cool but it doesn&#x27;t get very hot and seems to take much longer to dry hair than competing units with similar watt ratings.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely high powered.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this styler.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The high setting makes me feel like I&#x27;ve been through a tornado before leaving my house in the morning--</li>
            <li>and I love how it folds up and fits into a little bag for my gym bag.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to buy this dryer because of its claims to dry my hair faster.</li>
            <li>It dries hair much faster than my old trusty dryer.</li>
            <li>The styler is compact, light-weight, with minimal no fuss settings, and handle gets folded over so that it can fit neatly into the bag it comes with, so you can take it with you on trips.</li>
            <li>Love the metallic green, and the dryer ample job.</li>
            <li>LOVE the spunky metallic green color, not gaudy at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small, lightweight size.  </li>
            <li>AI love the green color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the only reason I won a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t allow you to adjust the temp (cool, warm, hot), but it does have a cold shot button.  </li>
            <li>For whatever reason the air does not get as hot as the original and the low setting is a little bit strong for a low setting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right blow dryer, but it came with only 1 attachment.</li>
            <li>The twist-handle folds down easily</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a solid hairdryer that does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>Very nice compact &amp; lightweight hair dryer, hangs easily from a command hook from the provided loop at base of handle.</li>
            <li>This little apple green styler does a great job of drying and styling my hair.</li>
            <li>the new one has the folding handle and diffuser part.</li>
            <li>Now the new 1875 has its cord sprawled all over the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait for the new one to arrive</li>
            <li>It does not get as hot as I would like but the blowing power is almost too much, I have long hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Is a bit heavier than my old conair, but worth it for teh extra body.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I had saved my old one, or I would have had to leave the house in freezing weather with a wet head.</li>
            <li>The dryer also isn&#x27;t very loud so that is another plus.  </li>
            <li>No power, no heat, no directed air flow, and it&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li>First of all, it does not look new, does not have a folding hand, and it&#x27;s blue.</li>
            <li>it was what I expected and dry me hair done very quick!</li>
            <li>Pretty standard in terms of functions.  </li>
            <li>Too hot &amp; left my shoulder length hair of medium texture looking</li>
            <li>I have had better conair products in the past.</li>
            <li>Adorable apple green!    </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d definitely opt for a higher wattage unit if you are going to be using this every day.</li>
            <li>THEN SHOWN MORE LIKE NEON GREEN!  </li>
            <li>The Ionic technology makes it dry hair very quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t become hot like other hairdryers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be taking this on trips, packed in its tidy little travel bag!</li>
            <li>/&gt;the rotating handle is a little strange, but it is a nice feature when it does need to be folded &amp; stashed away.</li>
            <li>My hair gets dried very quickly.</li>
            <li>Heat setting is just right -- not too hot, and concentrator helps making using a barrel brush for blowing out a little easier.  </li>
            <li>Would prefer a more neutral colour, like a pearl white or onyx black.</li>
            <li>Low air pressure and low heat combine to make a lengthy process out of what ought to be a quick morning ritual.</li>
            <li>Provides adequate fan power and heat while the overall design seems solid.  </li>
            <li>I like the folding handle but don&#x27;t feel like the dryer gets hot enough to dry my hair very fast.</li>
            <li>This blow drier delivers a powerful blast of hot air that quickly dries my hair, a seemingly basic task that unfortunately has been beyond many other driers.  </li>
            <li>The unique part is that you can twist the handle and store it in the black bag that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>The attachable concentrator snaps on and rotates to direct the airflow where you want it for drying with a brush.</li>
            <li>I do like the attachments I use both of them frequently and with the attachments on the blowing power</li>
            <li>I tried to repair the old one, but it kept shorting out after I worked on it.</li>
            <li>I have used plenty of hair dryers in my time and this one is by far the loudest.</li>
            <li>For someone needing a gentle low, it would be fine.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see anything professional about this dryer.</li>
            <li>My old one was really loud.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer because my old one stopped working.  </li>
            <li>However, it burnt out within a year, possibly because I dropped it, but this time I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much cash to replace it and</li>
            <li>Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler,</li>
            <li>Truthfully, it&#x27;s too big and heavy for me to use it for travel.</li>
            <li>Have owned a few hair dryers and this one has definitely been my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if you don&#x27;t have thick hair like me it would perform more to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I like the cool down \\&quot;set style\\&quot; setting.</li>
            <li>However this is solidly built with all of the right basic functions for a home use hair dryer.</li>
            <li>My hair gets dry, but not in a pretty way.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, good little hairdryer...just be careful with long hair.</li>
            <li>MUCH smaller than the older one I had, and not nearly as heavy.</li>
            <li>Besides the standard high and low settings, it has a cool shot button to just dry hair without heat.</li>
            <li>All of these features seem pretty typical for this type of product, and as it gets your hair dry quickly with a minimum amount of fuss, I can&#x27;t complain about this aspect of the product.     </li>
            <li>This is slightly smaller with about 10 watts more power and a directional air controller, but overall not worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really live up, but my main complaint is that the high setting was SO high that it blew my hair around so much that all I was doing was ripping my hair out trying to de-tangle it from all the blowing around.</li>
            <li>In fact, I have to be careful when using this dryer on high speed, as it quickly tangles my long hair into knots.  </li>
            <li>most travel dryers are pretty feeble.</li>
            <li>If price is a big concern, this is a decent unit</li>
            <li>The choices between hot, warm, cold, and high and low flow have made it versatile through all my haircuts.</li>
            <li>The one I replaced had heat settings (high, med, low) as this one does not.</li>
            <li>Just one button for low and high</li>
            <li>High or low.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this powerful little blowdryer.  </li>
            <li>, it was light weight, small and came with a diffuser and another gadget.</li>
            <li>If you are not crazy about the folding handle, you can go for the competitors at a slightly lower price.</li>
            <li>If you need a hair dryer and like the bold green color - recommended.</li>
            <li>The motor does get a funny scent if it is used for a longer period of time but that might be expected because my dryer is only about 2 weeks old.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it seems to be constructed well and has never failed to work.</li>
            <li>Gift for wife who states she loves the way her hair looks despite no apparent difference in high and low heat setting[s], thus, can only rate as high as 4 stars.</li>
            <li>There are really only two settings - high and low.</li>
            <li>There is only a setting for high and low fan speed.</li>
            <li>You can only turn it on low or high.</li>
            <li>only two speeds Low or High.</li>
            <li>You can only choose High or Low speeds.  </li>
            <li>Then later realized this was the old model of the product and</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my wife&#x27;s old hair dryer that had a short in the cord.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is its really loud.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the construction of the actual dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious to see if it will last more than a few months.</li>
            <li>Its as loud as a regular hair dryer</li>
            <li>The unit includes a travel bag, however the first time I tried to use it, the zipper popped open and now can&#x27;t be closed.</li>
            <li>The bright green color is something you either love or hate.     </li>
            <li>COOL COLOR GREEN!</li>
            <li>I place a knee high hose on the defuser to dry my curly hair.</li>
            <li>hair is not as frizzy dries fast and not as loud as my previous one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing you don&#x27;t know how bad your old hair dryer was until you purchase a new one!</li>
            <li>I normally keep my hair wrapped in a towel and then blow dry after I&#x27;ve applied my make up.</li>
            <li>First of all, while Conair may want you to think that this Infinitpro hairdryer is travel-oriented by designing the handle to neatly fold and also including a tote, this hairdryer is actually quite bulky in size and not exactly lightweight.</li>
            <li>It really is quieter than any other one I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>It only has a few settings - Hi and low plus a cool shot override button - all I ever use anyway.</li>
            <li>Two speeds, low and high, are plenty for my medium-thick, long hair, and a nozzle if I need it.</li>
            <li>It is probably about average for a dryer of this size, but I have another 1875 watt dryer that&#x27;s much lighter, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>The metallic apple green color is just too hot.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is small but powerful.  </li>
            <li>It really does cut down on my hair drying time.</li>
            <li>My old hair dryer took 20 min to blow dry my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>The 1875 watt motor is powerful and the noise level is about average compared to other dryers.</li>
            <li>My only down side is its main \\&quot;feature\\&quot;, the twist handle.</li>
            <li>It says it uses ion technology, but my last Conair that was labeled ionic worked so much better and dried my hair faster with hardly any frizz.  </li>

            <li> Prolly the best hair dryer I have used.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t very impressed.</li>

            <li> Great Product!  </li>

            <li> Very good hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The Infinitipro by Conair is a hair dryer that features an ingenuous design which makes it ideal for home or travel.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Plenty of power and the removable nozzle is great for styling without worrying about heat.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has the makings of being a great one.</li>
            <li> It has a great blow, but it takes forever to heat up.</li>
            <li> these days, I try not to check bags when I fly, so space inside my suitcase is at a premium.</li>
            <li> What a great concept!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Without sacrificing any of the features you might expect from a great hair dryer, the compact design makes this product stand out from the competition.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> the watage is great.</li>
            <li> It was was a bargain and gives great power and is lightweight.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> It dries hair great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the packaging says AC motor and the blurb says DC - however it works great.  </li>
            <li> LOL  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it for a month and it works great.</li>
            <li> and it has great blowing power.</li>
            <li> Great dryer - does its job - no complaints..</li>

            <li> Does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer works great, but the colour options are hideous.</li>
            <li> The attachment is great for concentrating on one area as to not make hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Great value and received promptly...</li>
            <li> The Conair dryer is great.  </li>
            <li> lol i read some of the reviews and went ahead and purchased it.</li>
            <li> Great Blow Dryer-right amount of power, heat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still running great, and for the price</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s a great dryer.</li>

            <li> Very nice.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice hairdryer.</li>
            <li> it is very handy though.</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Have had this for more than a year now with no problems as everything is still operating perfectly.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a medium bob style and  the rotating straightening piece is perfect for creating a stylish look.</li>
            <li> Very good product, blows air powerfully without burning your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It works great, looks great and the handle folds up nicely to make it compact.</li>
            <li> The Infinitpro is a good example...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good product by Conair.</li>
            <li> and it dries hair really good.  </li>
            <li> Lots of power does a GOOD JOB</li>
            <li> So far-pretty good.</li>
            <li> It was a good price</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to travel with because it folds up nicely.</li>
            <li> A GOOD PURCHASE - GAVE AS A GIFT</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairdresser, as she purchased it for a vacation cruise &amp; loved it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise great value, great dryer, very powerful!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very pleased I bought it.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> LOVE this dryer!  </li>
            <li> otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li> With that being said, I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> love this product !</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this hairdryer!  </li>
            <li> Great power, easy to hold and store.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer and drys hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li> the color is amazing</li>
            <li> Its absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> It also would would have been nice to have the diffuser attachment to create funkier hair styles.</li>
            <li> Nice feature with the swivel handle, to make packing it easier, for on the go people.  </li>
            <li> Nice color</li>
            <li> Excellent styler and works great on my short hair, too!</li>
            <li> The cord is durable and the settings are nice.</li>
            <li> And the compact feature comes in handy if you travel a lot.</li>
            <li> When folded it fits into its own carrier bag.  </li>
            <li> The folding handle and travel bag were a nice touch</li>
            <li> Thought it would be better to spend the money and get a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li> So I hadn&#x27;t updated my hair dryer in years (think 15), so I was really thrilled to receive this one.</li>
            <li> Verrrry nice zippered travel bag for dryer, one of the classiest I&#x27;ve ever seen.    </li>
            <li> One of the reasons I chose it was because of its ability to fold up and the nice travel bag they provide with it.</li>
            <li> Nice color.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find it and immediately bought it.  </li>
            <li> I believe that this drier&#x27;s main greatest feature is that it is portable and can be taken in plane trips, any vacations etc and get saloon quality styling.   </li>
            <li> This is an excellent blow dryer, as it dries extremely quickly and creates a smooth, frizz-free shine.</li>
            <li> The best feature of this hair dryer is the Cool Shot feature, which blows cool air for just a moment.  </li>
            <li> Quality is good, sturdy, easy to use.</li>
            <li> in all a very good compact hair dryer that drys hair fast.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with it, very strong and lightweight.</li>
            <li> For at home use, though, or even for travel where bulk/weight are not a problem  this unit is an excellent value for a relatively modest price.</li>
            <li> It took a bit of doing to get the folding action to loosen up, but once I got the hang of it, it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as the original Conair 1875.</li>
            <li> It has replaced the one I had, though while it still works fine, it can&#x27;t rival this one!</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li> It feels very cheap.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> eight feet would have been better.</li>
            <li> the drier really makes it a great buy.</li>
            <li> It is not the kind of light blow dryer I&#x27;d buy for travel.  </li>
            <li> and I feel confident in recommending it, plus</li>
            <li> give it a shot and all agreed it was top notch.    </li>
            <li> My girls love this hair blower -</li>
            <li> For now I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> This is a good styling tool to give a pre-teen who wants their own.  </li>
            <li> This is a good hair dryer in a fun color.  </li>
            <li> but there are more compact hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> I love the attachments.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not in love with the dryer itself.</li>
            <li> My hair would fly all over the place and become very tangled</li>
            <li> OMG I LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER.  </li>
            <li> Made the dryer much more portable.</li>
            <li> Love this hair drier.</li>
            <li> Love that it folds.</li>
            <li> Love it as a home use dryer.  </li>
            <li> What more can I ask?  </li>
            <li> Your hand won&#x27;t fall off after using it! :)</li>
            <li> Perfect in either setting, even the cooler version actually still dries your hair</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> safe ALCI plug - will turn itself off if blow drier is dropped in water</li>
            <li> They also state that the dryer is using &#x27;ionic technology&#x27; which &#x27;promotes healthy, shining hair while fighting frizz&#x27;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> indicates that the makers are confident that they are selling you a quality device</li>
            <li> I love the power this dryer has.  </li>
            <li> Best hair dryer ever especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> What more can be said?</li>
            <li> Compared to the numerous brands I just tried this was still my favorite and am happy to have it!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.</li>
            <li> and i recieved it on monday :))</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it</li>
            <li> I LOVE this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> and they love it too</li>
            <li> I love anything and everything</li>
            <li> really love how the handle turns and folds up.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It probably makes a better &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; dryer than anything.  </li>
            <li> :) And my hair seems just as healthy as ever, but I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li> AND THE COLOR IS BETTER</li>
            <li> Love the color and that it folds compactly.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my spare bathroom, and all my girlfriends love it.</li>
            <li> Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Powerful and surprisingly lighter than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Its strong and dries hair quickly and its a gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> for this price its worth it!!</li>
            <li> &quot; So there you go, about the best one can say for a nice green folding hairdryer in this price range.</li>
            <li> I love that it folds up to store easily.  </li>
            <li> love the color, works fine, just what I wanted,  no problems with it at all.  </li>
            <li> The color is very cool</li>
            <li> Works great thus far</li>
            <li> The warm setting is just right</li>
            <li> That was probably the most valuable feature for the original Conair 1875.</li>
            <li> The original is much better.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer promotes many of the features of this unit as great for traveling, the folding handle, the bag that is included etc but the bottom line is that this unit is bulky, even with the hand turned and weighs enough that, in these days of strict baggage limits could pose a problem.  </li>
            <li> I love the twist on and off lid by the motor because it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I found this blow dryer to be easy to use and store.  </li>
            <li> That bag fits easily in any suitcase or briefcase (or purse if you carry one).  </li>
            <li> The handle does an easy twist to fold so it fits in the accompanying bag.  </li>
            <li> It says it will last longer than most dryers which is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact fold in design makes for easy storage in a drawer</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so strong that it tangles my hair, and since I need to add volume to my hair, I don&#x27;t like brushing it a lot while drying, which I have to do with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer worked fine for me.  </li>
            <li> The tote is fine</li>
            <li> My wife and daughters have many, and this one has quickly become the default.</li>
            <li> Faster drying time without any heat damage to my hair is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> Works really well and heats nicely.</li>
            <li> and they thought that was light...</li>
            <li> It sound stronger, with a quieter engine hum.</li>
            <li> Leaves it smooth &amp; shiney.  </li>
            <li> great hairdryer for the price, punches well above its weight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great purchase, I expect this item to last quite a while, as cheaper quality driers die on me after 2 years.</li>
            <li> Has enough power and does a great job drying</li>
            <li> that one is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> My wife with her beautiful long hair always uses a blow dryer after washing it.</li>
            <li> Passed it on to a young niece who loved the color.</li>
            <li> I love the color which is more intense than in the picture</li>
            <li> it is so far so good.</li>
            <li> Very useful.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer because I had an older version that I liked, but needed to replace.  </li>
            <li> love that the handle folds up for easy storage, and it&#x27;s really lightweight.</li>
            <li> The attachments it comes with also work pretty nicely and fit pretty snug.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Always been a conair user and after my original conair blow dryer was torn up by the dog (which I had for 6 years)</li>
            <li> The motor is quiet, the dryer itself is pretty light, the blow is intense, and the best part?</li>
            <li> The cool setting provides a nice little gush of cooler air and the folding ability has been pretty handy (albeit mainly handy for going on trips).  </li>
            <li> The lint catcher is detachable to easily clean off the lint</li>
            <li> I gets nice and hot, but not to hot to were</li>
            <li> Besides a tote bag, it comes with snap-on concentrator for special styling needs.    </li>
            <li> She was right!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good dryer</li>
            <li> With its modern style setting look, it is just adorable.</li>
            <li> The portability of this styler should not fool you as you have a full 1875 watts.  </li>
            <li> 4 year warranty is quite good when compared with what you get for similarly priced electronics.</li>
            <li> Cool shot to hold a style.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, but this one is my favorite because it dries my hair SO fast without drying it out.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;twisting&amp;#34; handle doesn&#x27;t really make it more travel-sized, just changes the shape.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good hair dryer, especially for the money.</li>
            <li> I came upon it in Costco for such a good deal, that I bought another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this full hair dryer that isn&#x27;t compact while retracted -and  has the full power of a normal hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> It does come with a travel pouch and a nice feature of easily twisting and untwisting the handle does make it a little more compact, but it is still rather bulky to stick in a gym bag or carry on suitcase.    </li>
            <li> I bought from Lucky Sales.</li>
            <li> and this dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done quickly, though.  </li>
            <li> and it is what sold me, but the video makes this dryer look more powerful than it really is.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair really quickly...</li>
            <li> It puts out good heat and is not very loud.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this unit for home use, for travel, I&#x27;d suggest you find a more compact/lightweight unit and skip this one.</li>
            <li> The low setting is perfect: not too low and not too high and great for styling short hair.  </li>
            <li> And the best part is that it actually gets more powerful rather than less powerful when using the Cool Shot feature.  </li>
            <li> The unit is a very pretty color.  </li>
            <li> For home main usage, you may want one with great many features and frills, but this simple styler will serve you most of your needs already and is useful to take along as said above.</li>
            <li> The attachments that come with it are great, and it cuts down a ton on frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent long cord and quiet motor.  </li>
            <li> My daughter took the first one!  </li>
            <li> Even though this is a powerful drier that delivers very hot air</li>
            <li> And the hot doesn&#x27;t burn your eyelashes off!  </li>
            <li> I used this while vacationing with a friend and it was the first thing I came home and bought!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I will probably take the plunge and buy a higher-end hair dryer in the future, until then, this is OK and will get me through!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is powerful.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to friends and family because it is a powerful hair dryer</li>
            <li> Even useful when not traveling.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lightweight, powerful hairdryer, and this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One distinct feature is the &#x27;folding handle&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Nice folding handle if traveling is required as well as the short barrell.  </li>
            <li> i did a bit on research on some blow dryers and to be honest this one caught my eye only because the color</li>
            <li> It is really powerful.</li>
            <li> And the lower setting just didn&#x27;t feel warm enough.</li>
            <li> Was to powerful for mid-back length hair.  </li>
            <li> Airflow is powerful- dries my hair about 30% faster.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is MUCH more powerful than my old model ever was, even in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and powerful,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powerful dryer.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s 4 YEARS which is not bad.</li>
            <li> It is definitely powerful in terms of airflow, maybe the most powerful of all hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned, but it does not get nearly hot enough to smooth or control my hair in any way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty quick.</li>
            <li> It gets super hot.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good quality buy, certainly for the price, but no professional dryer.</li>
            <li> I loved my other Conair hair dryer</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer right after my old Conair tourmaline died (that lasted almost eight years!) and wanted a powerful dryer that could easily be traveled with.</li>
            <li> is that the right word?</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy this right now.</li>
            <li> This is nice if you are starting to overheat from all of the hot air.  </li>
            <li> Great little dryer!</li>
            <li> I liked that if folded down, but it didn&#x27;t feel secure.</li>
            <li> I love how it folds down for better storage.</li>
            <li> She has been very happy with this one and it seems to dry her hair a lot faster than the other one did.</li>
            <li> Love the neon green color and love how the handle folds for travel.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t review it for a couple months to see if it died early, but no, it&#x27;s going strong.</li>
            <li> Way loud, but really strong</li>
            <li> She liked it so much that this is the only dryer she uses.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the fastest dryers I&#x27;ve used, and on high, the air has a strong, fast flow.</li>
            <li> I found the Infinitipro to be an extremely versatile hair dryer that was easy to use and especially easy to store due to the ability of the drier to fold at the handle.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer very much.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, porous hair, and I believe the drying time has been greatly reduced thanks to this handy tool.  </li>
            <li> It is full size, but not overly big and thus it is easy to handle and not tiresome to use.</li>
            <li> But most importantly, even though it seemed to dry my hair in a fairly short amount of time (not the fastest, but okay), there was just too much \\&quot;wind\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight but powerful.</li>
            <li> The only two things that could be better are the handle and the weight.</li>
            <li> it works well, generates all the hot air anyone could want - but you get the sense that Conair is stretching a bit to try to come up with something that stands out against the competition.     </li>
            <li> I have this exact product at home, so I know what it&#x27;s supposed to look like.</li>
            <li> Heat is hot but not scorching, does not burn hair.</li>
            <li> Hot air is needed for styling, which is not happening with this machine.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks much better using a different, hotter dryer.</li>
            <li> Have to say I chose it because of its design in the first place.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware when I bought this, but it has an attachment on the end to focus the heat for styling.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> do wish it had a hot or hotter setting though like the Infinity Pro by Conair</li>
            <li> selected this one because I was so pleased with the last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color and functionality of this dryer</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I first used this hair dryer at a friend&#x27;s cabin and I was hooked.</li>
            <li> On hot, it gets truly hot.  </li>
            <li> It was a nice design and really seems dry hair well.  </li>
            <li> The right amount of heat and it really is lightweight .</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy and loud, but I still consider it a great buy.</li>
            <li> IT folds for easy travel and puts out a lot of air for quick dry.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a good basic hairdryer for quick drying without damaging the hair.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair so fast without being too hot.</li>
            <li> air button is a nice feature and comb diffuser has seen much use with other members of my family</li>
            <li> really love the attachment on this hair dryer it works very well when I am drying my hair to get it somewhat strait before I flat iron it.</li>
            <li> It is quite decent, but most of the hair dryers have that same power.</li>
            <li> The cool air finishing setting is also a nice option and does seem to set the styling,  This unit has some additional extra features that, while they don&#x27;t impact it&#x27;s basic performance are nice additions, the first is a circuit breaker switch on the wall plug as a safety factor, also the cord is long enough to allow ease of positioning.  </li>
            <li> SO easy to use, folds for smaller packing.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done, It dries my hair pretty fast, but my hair is very frizzy after which annoys me.  </li>
            <li> Has off, high, and low switch along with a cool shot that surpresses the heat for cool drying.  </li>
            <li> The high gives off a lot of heat and force but the low is too low heat wise.</li>
            <li> Now I understand that there is some claim about certain ceramic and ion technology that should give a smoother hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of already loose without showing off too many twists...  </li>
            <li> and I needed to pick up a new one right away because my hair is a disaster if I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer after washing.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer on high doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li> It is very well built and has a very high quality feel to it.</li>
            <li> I use low setting and it dries my hair fast and at a comfortable temperature.</li>
            <li> Really like everything about this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The handle is quite smooth and I wish it had either a rubberized grip or different shape</li>
            <li> All the standard temp settings are there and the light and compact feel of</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it was worth the price unless you really are in love with the shiny apple green color.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Now I just have to hope that it will fit properly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this blow dryer!</li>
            <li> I should really order another</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really consider it a usable setting.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has so much power but is also quieter than others.  </li>
            <li> Was a gift, granddaughter really like the power.</li>
            <li> I suppose I am looking for a dryer that gets hotter than this without so much air blowing at me.</li>
            <li> THANKS INFINITI PRO</li>
            <li> FOR KEEPING IT REAL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bonus that it works very well, too.</li>
            <li> and it seems every blower would take a water break halfway through because it was being worked too much.</li>
            <li> , modern look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Negatives: None that I can think of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I took one star off because it just doesn&#x27;t quite measure up to my T3, but it really isn&#x27;t designed to compete in that class.</li>
            <li> I will likely keep it as a travel hair dryer, but I think I&#x27;d even prefer to use a cheap hotel hair dryer over this one...</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is powerful without being too loud.</li>
            <li> Also very convenient that it folds up.</li>
            <li> Got what I expected :)</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and portable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really appreciated</li>
            <li> Came with diffuser, which works very well.</li>
            <li> The color is a matter of preference, it is as seen in the photo, a metallic kind of sheen green, and we like the color, it stands out.  </li>
            <li> As far as being compact, it is better than the standard non folding hair dryer</li>
            <li> Powerful wind speed, it dries my long hair fairly quick even without the concentrator, and the foldable handle accommodates well for dorm storage.</li>
            <li> I wish it were just a little bit smaller, but it&#x27;s still a pretty good size.  </li>
            <li> Powerful to dry hair quickly.</li>
            <li> The dryer is too powerful to be used on high near my ears unless I use the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it is rather long</li>
            <li> Wow this is hot.  </li>
            <li> It has two heat settings---high and low, and there is a button that turns off the heating element so that cool air continues to blow.</li>
            <li> Works fine but wish I had read a review that warned of the limited settings.</li>
            <li> By using the attachments it is possible to direct the airflow precisely where needed</li>
            <li> Build quality seems adequate - not terrific, but not the sort of thing that will fall apart in a week.</li>
            <li> In operation, I found the unit to work quickly and to be fairly quiet.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t particularly like to shlep this thing around.  </li>
            <li> At 1875 Watt, this packs enough power that matches most current hairdryers.</li>
            <li> The main reason I chose this dryer was because it said it came with two attachments, a concentrator and a diffuser.</li>
            <li> The photo shows another model and the product sent was the older model.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the idea that the unit&#x27;s handle folds into the body to conserve space in my drawer</li>
            <li> The controls are pretty straight forward, no different than most other hairdryers.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer looks cool but it doesn&#x27;t get very hot and seems to take much longer to dry hair than competing units with similar watt ratings.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely high powered.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this styler.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The high setting makes me feel like I&#x27;ve been through a tornado before leaving my house in the morning--</li>
            <li> and I love how it folds up and fits into a little bag for my gym bag.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to buy this dryer because of its claims to dry my hair faster.</li>
            <li> It dries hair much faster than my old trusty dryer.</li>
            <li> The styler is compact, light-weight, with minimal no fuss settings, and handle gets folded over so that it can fit neatly into the bag it comes with, so you can take it with you on trips.</li>
            <li> Love the metallic green, and the dryer ample job.</li>
            <li> LOVE the spunky metallic green color, not gaudy at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small, lightweight size.  </li>
            <li> AI love the green color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the only reason I won a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t allow you to adjust the temp (cool, warm, hot), but it does have a cold shot button.  </li>
            <li> For whatever reason the air does not get as hot as the original and the low setting is a little bit strong for a low setting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right blow dryer, but it came with only 1 attachment.</li>
            <li> The twist-handle folds down easily</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a solid hairdryer that does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> Very nice compact &amp; lightweight hair dryer, hangs easily from a command hook from the provided loop at base of handle.</li>
            <li> This little apple green styler does a great job of drying and styling my hair.</li>
            <li> the new one has the folding handle and diffuser part.</li>
            <li> Now the new 1875 has its cord sprawled all over the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for the new one to arrive</li>
            <li> It does not get as hot as I would like but the blowing power is almost too much, I have long hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Is a bit heavier than my old conair, but worth it for teh extra body.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I had saved my old one, or I would have had to leave the house in freezing weather with a wet head.</li>
            <li> The dryer also isn&#x27;t very loud so that is another plus.  </li>
            <li> No power, no heat, no directed air flow, and it&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li> First of all, it does not look new, does not have a folding hand, and it&#x27;s blue.</li>
            <li> it was what I expected and dry me hair done very quick!</li>
            <li> Pretty standard in terms of functions.  </li>
            <li> Too hot &amp; left my shoulder length hair of medium texture looking</li>
            <li> I have had better conair products in the past.</li>
            <li> Adorable apple green!    </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d definitely opt for a higher wattage unit if you are going to be using this every day.</li>
            <li> THEN SHOWN MORE LIKE NEON GREEN!  </li>
            <li> The Ionic technology makes it dry hair very quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t become hot like other hairdryers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be taking this on trips, packed in its tidy little travel bag!</li>
            <li> /&gt;the rotating handle is a little strange, but it is a nice feature when it does need to be folded &amp; stashed away.</li>
            <li> My hair gets dried very quickly.</li>
            <li> Heat setting is just right -- not too hot, and concentrator helps making using a barrel brush for blowing out a little easier.  </li>
            <li> Would prefer a more neutral colour, like a pearl white or onyx black.</li>
            <li> Low air pressure and low heat combine to make a lengthy process out of what ought to be a quick morning ritual.</li>
            <li> Provides adequate fan power and heat while the overall design seems solid.  </li>
            <li> I like the folding handle but don&#x27;t feel like the dryer gets hot enough to dry my hair very fast.</li>
            <li> This blow drier delivers a powerful blast of hot air that quickly dries my hair, a seemingly basic task that unfortunately has been beyond many other driers.  </li>
            <li> The unique part is that you can twist the handle and store it in the black bag that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> The attachable concentrator snaps on and rotates to direct the airflow where you want it for drying with a brush.</li>
            <li> I do like the attachments I use both of them frequently and with the attachments on the blowing power</li>
            <li> I tried to repair the old one, but it kept shorting out after I worked on it.</li>
            <li> I have used plenty of hair dryers in my time and this one is by far the loudest.</li>
            <li> For someone needing a gentle low, it would be fine.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything professional about this dryer.</li>
            <li> My old one was really loud.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because my old one stopped working.  </li>
            <li> However, it burnt out within a year, possibly because I dropped it, but this time I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much cash to replace it and</li>
            <li> Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler,</li>
            <li> Truthfully, it&#x27;s too big and heavy for me to use it for travel.</li>
            <li> Have owned a few hair dryers and this one has definitely been my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if you don&#x27;t have thick hair like me it would perform more to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I like the cool down \\&quot;set style\\&quot; setting.</li>
            <li> However this is solidly built with all of the right basic functions for a home use hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair gets dry, but not in a pretty way.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, good little hairdryer...just be careful with long hair.</li>
            <li> MUCH smaller than the older one I had, and not nearly as heavy.</li>
            <li> Besides the standard high and low settings, it has a cool shot button to just dry hair without heat.</li>
            <li> All of these features seem pretty typical for this type of product, and as it gets your hair dry quickly with a minimum amount of fuss, I can&#x27;t complain about this aspect of the product.     </li>
            <li> This is slightly smaller with about 10 watts more power and a directional air controller, but overall not worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really live up, but my main complaint is that the high setting was SO high that it blew my hair around so much that all I was doing was ripping my hair out trying to de-tangle it from all the blowing around.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have to be careful when using this dryer on high speed, as it quickly tangles my long hair into knots.  </li>
            <li> most travel dryers are pretty feeble.</li>
            <li> If price is a big concern, this is a decent unit</li>
            <li> The choices between hot, warm, cold, and high and low flow have made it versatile through all my haircuts.</li>
            <li> The one I replaced had heat settings (high, med, low) as this one does not.</li>
            <li> Just one button for low and high</li>
            <li> High or low.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this powerful little blowdryer.  </li>
            <li> , it was light weight, small and came with a diffuser and another gadget.</li>
            <li> If you are not crazy about the folding handle, you can go for the competitors at a slightly lower price.</li>
            <li> If you need a hair dryer and like the bold green color - recommended.</li>
            <li> The motor does get a funny scent if it is used for a longer period of time but that might be expected because my dryer is only about 2 weeks old.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it seems to be constructed well and has never failed to work.</li>
            <li> Gift for wife who states she loves the way her hair looks despite no apparent difference in high and low heat setting[s], thus, can only rate as high as 4 stars.</li>
            <li> There are really only two settings - high and low.</li>
            <li> There is only a setting for high and low fan speed.</li>
            <li> You can only turn it on low or high.</li>
            <li> only two speeds Low or High.</li>
            <li> You can only choose High or Low speeds.  </li>
            <li> Then later realized this was the old model of the product and</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my wife&#x27;s old hair dryer that had a short in the cord.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is its really loud.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the construction of the actual dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see if it will last more than a few months.</li>
            <li> Its as loud as a regular hair dryer</li>
            <li> The unit includes a travel bag, however the first time I tried to use it, the zipper popped open and now can&#x27;t be closed.</li>
            <li> The bright green color is something you either love or hate.     </li>
            <li> COOL COLOR GREEN!</li>
            <li> I place a knee high hose on the defuser to dry my curly hair.</li>
            <li> hair is not as frizzy dries fast and not as loud as my previous one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing you don&#x27;t know how bad your old hair dryer was until you purchase a new one!</li>
            <li> I normally keep my hair wrapped in a towel and then blow dry after I&#x27;ve applied my make up.</li>
            <li> First of all, while Conair may want you to think that this Infinitpro hairdryer is travel-oriented by designing the handle to neatly fold and also including a tote, this hairdryer is actually quite bulky in size and not exactly lightweight.</li>
            <li> It really is quieter than any other one I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It only has a few settings - Hi and low plus a cool shot override button - all I ever use anyway.</li>
            <li> Two speeds, low and high, are plenty for my medium-thick, long hair, and a nozzle if I need it.</li>
            <li> It is probably about average for a dryer of this size, but I have another 1875 watt dryer that&#x27;s much lighter, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> The metallic apple green color is just too hot.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is small but powerful.  </li>
            <li> It really does cut down on my hair drying time.</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer took 20 min to blow dry my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> The 1875 watt motor is powerful and the noise level is about average compared to other dryers.</li>
            <li> My only down side is its main \\&quot;feature\\&quot;, the twist handle.</li>
            <li> It says it uses ion technology, but my last Conair that was labeled ionic worked so much better and dried my hair faster with hardly any frizz.  </li>
            <li> so far has not shut off due to over heating.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft after and it took only 3 min to completely blow dry and style with a round brush.</li>
            <li> The swivel handle can be folded so that the whole thing can go into a small tote for travel or storage.</li>
            <li> Hope it last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really any smaller than a normal dryer, it just folds in half to change its shape.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blow dryer a few months ago loved the product until it randomly DIED the other day.</li>
            <li> I have lots of hair, not enough power to dry my hair under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> so it only took a minute to dry.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight entry into the blowdryer category doesn&#x27;t have enough oomph to blow even the finest hair dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the size as it is powerful enough to easily dry my longish and very thick hair and</li>
            <li> Love the cold shot.</li>
            <li> You can twist it (careful or you can break it) in a way that turns the handle parallel with the body and therefore makes it easier to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li> You are going to pay for shipping to the service center and include $7 to have the unit shipped back.</li>
            <li> Really like the metallic apple color too, makes a boring hairdryer look like a pretty cool appliance.    </li>
            <li> Also, in order to use the air only feature with no heat, the cooling button has to be pressed and held down to use this basic function.</li>
            <li> so you have to hold it a little askew to get the direct blast from the dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, straight hair that goes halfway down my back, and it takes around 10 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> so if I use it on high it does tend to blow so hard it knots my hair.  </li>
            <li> It only offers two speeds-- high and low, and doesn&#x27;t offer different temperatures (other than the cold shot).</li>
            <li> It also took way longer to dry it.</li>
            <li> If you have thicker hair, it will probably require a longer dry time.</li>
            <li> I think the last few times I packed it, I just left it as is.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this dryer is just average.</li>
            <li> Today I decided to blow dry before applying my make up, and it took me 3 minutes and 28 seconds to go from soaking wet to dry.</li>
            <li> and hopefully will last a lot longer than other dryers!</li>
            <li> The only negative is that this hair dryer is a bit big and bulky, but this is not a major problem.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- 2 heat/speed settings&lt;br /&gt;- cold air button (turns off the heat)&lt;br /&gt;- easy to remove air filter</li>
            <li> after having my previous blow dryer for almost 6 years, it finally died on me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I am disappointed, but my last Conair was better.  </li>
            <li> I had other family members with long hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so unhappy with this hair dryer that I wound up ordering a new one online and spending about three times as much.</li>
            <li> The little big that comes with</li>
            <li> When turned on this blow dryer sounds different than any other I have previously owned.</li>
            <li> It folds up to fit in your luggage, it has two heat settings and cold air as blasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I hate this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The handle folds which made me think this was a dryer to take when traveling, but it&#x27;s heavy--a half pound heavier than my much larger 1875 dryer which costs less.</li>
            <li> This was too heavy and loud for me to use on my long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a medium bob and the dry time was cut in half.</li>
            <li> Not only did I receive the WRONG product, but it was also used when it was supposed to be NEW.</li>
            <li> i have long thick hair and my hair was dry in less than 15 minutes and it was soft and had less frizz !!</li>
            <li> The feature differentiates it from other competitors is the twist folding handle.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; technology is also in other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> One other reviewer mentions it weighs over 2 lbs</li>
            <li> My long hair dries in just a few minutes</li>
            <li> , it hangs about 2 inches past my bra strap in the back.</li>
            <li> But other than that</li>
            <li> The only down side it is could be a little quitter!  </li>
            <li> The cooling button on the back is a bit hard to keep depressed for an extended amount of time, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this one a pass and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Just twist the handle to fold down, retract the cord and then pack the unit into the included zip pouch.</li>
            <li> I broke down and got this dryer to take with me while traveling.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s not hot!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer puts out a ton of heat for such a small product!  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any frizzing, or overly dried hair, quite possibly due to using the attachments to precisely direct the air flow.  </li>
            <li> so it takes up less storage space or for travel.</li>
            <li> Slightly heavier than a DC motor,</li>
            <li> zippered black nylon travel tote&lt;br /&gt;- English/Spanish instructions sheet&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle on the unit is placed at an odd angle</li>
            <li> The cold shot isn&#x27;t exactly cold--the heat is turned off, that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> which is quite helpful when working with long or thick hair.  </li>
            <li> SO I CAN USE ALL AT ONCE AND WASTE LESS TIME</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little heavier than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I find the twist and stow feature to be a little tricky, which is why I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> It is a little heavy, though.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s semi lightweight but the weight distribution makes it a little awkward, kind of top-heavy, so it&#x27;s still awkward to use.</li>
            <li> The shiny green apple color is eye-catching.</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s difficult to produce a completely differentiated hair drier these days.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something compact and lightweight, and you don&#x27;t mind the metallic green color, this is the hair drier for you.</li>
            <li> Even lugging this thing to the gym everyday would be a work out.</li>
            <li> The motor seems hard-working enough that I have never experienced any overheating issues.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time but was missing the diffuser part and the travel tote as mentioned in the description.</li>
            <li> After going through a few hairdryers, I picked this one up.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer 3 yrs ago in green.</li>
            <li> dried out &amp; frizzy.</li>
            <li> Then there is the retracted cord that is missing.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy for someone who has to round</li>
            <li> As one other reviewer mentioned, the dust filter is also a bit weak, consisting of a pair of thin metal discs that are somewhat difficult to clean.     </li>
            <li> cut my drying time in half!</li>
            <li> I have LOTS of thick, course, wavy hair and this appliance dries it in half the time (or less) than all of my previous ones without excessive heat.  </li>
            <li> This was a decent enough hairdryer with one annoying aspect that marred the user experience.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rather stiff to operate, and I get the sense that it will not stand up to long-term folding.</li>
            <li> I had this hair dryer for a couple of years and the plug went bad, so I tried replacing it with several different brands.  </li>
            <li> PROBABLY COLD AND SOAKING WET OUTSIDE</li>
            <li> My thick hair drys faster and is less frizzy with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really nothing bad to say about this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I find the hair dryer to be heavier than others I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any louder than a usual blow dryer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but it&#x27;s awkward enough that I would have returned this</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE spending money on something that blows hot air.</li>
            <li> The negative has to do with the weight.</li>
            <li> There is also the button in the back for a shot of cold air.</li>
            <li> i have thick hair and it always seems like I have to spend FOREVER drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and tends to hold water...</li>
            <li> I have really thick, wavy hair and this travel dryer</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;m really disappointed because I wanted a new dryer with a folding handle, and thought this would work for me.</li>
            <li> I do not have real thick hair so drying time less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is not a lightweight but not so heavy that it is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> The cold is actually NOT hot.</li>
            <li> I hate to have to return it, but my neck was sore from all the uncomfortable de-tangling as a result of just too much wind.</li>
            <li> The weak spot seems to be the folding handle...</li>
            <li> but this one is VERY hard to swivel to fold.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Might work if you have medium to thin hair.</li>
            <li> Not happy because I didn&#x27;t receive all the parts and accessories as described.</li>
            <li> This causes a person&#x27;s fingers to get tired, holding a button over using a sliding switch.</li>
            <li> The green color is ugly.  </li>
            <li> I will buy expensive shampoo and hair products, but I just can&#x27;t spend the money on a dryer.</li>
            <li> False advertising !</li>
            <li> The cold shot is also a helpful feature.</li>
            <li> The Cold Shot button works well to help lock in style at the end of your drying session.</li>
            <li> When drying my hair it wobbled and I was afraid it would break.</li>
            <li> It really is cold.  </li>
            <li> and Cold.  </li>
            <li> The cold shot is cold.  </li>
            <li> Like that the cord retracts instead of having to wrap it around the dryer which is bad for the appliance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too terribly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this hair dryer because of the lack of heat it generates.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> However, I hate what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Terrible!  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, its terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really like everything about this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have lots of hair, not enough power to dry my hair under 10 minutes. Might work if you have medium to thin hair.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight but powerful. My hair gets dried very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer.  It&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve bought.  My daughter took the first one!  Plenty of power and the removable nozzle is great for styling without worrying about heat.</li>
            <li> Love the metallic green, and the dryer ample job. The cold shot is also a helpful feature. However, I was expecting a much different hair dryer. The cord does not retract into the handle as advertised. Also, the dryer is much larger and heavier than I hoped it would be. It also would would have been nice to have the diffuser attachment to create funkier hair styles. The travel bag is well made. Truthfully, it&#x27;s too big and heavy for me to use it for travel.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this hairdryer. The Ionic technology makes it dry hair very quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t become hot like other hairdryers I&#x27;ve tried. Faster drying time without any heat damage to my hair is a huge plus for me. The 1875 watt motor is powerful and the noise level is about average compared to other dryers. The Cold Shot button works well to help lock in style at the end of your drying session. The attachable concentrator snaps on and rotates to direct the airflow where you want it for drying with a brush. The twist-handle folds down easily so it takes up less storage space or for travel. (It also includes a travel tote) The shiny green apple color is eye-catching. The only two things that could be better are the handle and the weight. The handle is quite smooth and I wish it had either a rubberized grip or different shape so it was easier to hold. It&#x27;s also a little heavier than I&#x27;d like. It is probably about average for a dryer of this size, but I have another 1875 watt dryer that&#x27;s much lighter, which I prefer. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good basic hairdryer for quick drying without damaging the hair.</li>
            <li> Wow this is hot.  Dries your hair in no time.  Nice feature with the swivel handle, to make packing it easier, for on the go people.  I like it.  Review by Yolanda.</li>
            <li> This blow drier delivers a powerful blast of hot air that quickly dries my hair, a seemingly basic task that unfortunately has been beyond many other driers.  By using the attachments it is possible to direct the airflow precisely where needed which is quite helpful when working with long or thick hair.  Even though this is a powerful drier that delivers very hot air I have not experienced any frizzing, or overly dried hair, quite possibly due to using the attachments to precisely direct the air flow.  The cool air finishing setting is also a nice option and does seem to set the styling,  This unit has some additional extra features that, while they don&#x27;t impact it&#x27;s basic performance are nice additions, the first is a circuit breaker switch on the wall plug as a safety factor, also the cord is long enough to allow ease of positioning.  The handle can be folded for packing and for positioning the unit.  This is not a lightweight but not so heavy that it is difficult to use.  The manufacturer promotes many of the features of this unit as great for traveling, the folding handle, the bag that is included etc but the bottom line is that this unit is bulky, even with the hand turned and weighs enough that, in these days of strict baggage limits could pose a problem.  For at home use, though, or even for travel where bulk/weight are not a problem  this unit is an excellent value for a relatively modest price.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has the makings of being a great one. It has a great blow, but it takes forever to heat up. After 10 minutes of use, the heat was still lacking, leaving my hair damp. I&#x27;d give this one a pass and not worth the money. Nice color though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s difficult to produce a completely differentiated hair drier these days. The Infinitpro is a good example...it works well, generates all the hot air anyone could want - but you get the sense that Conair is stretching a bit to try to come up with something that stands out against the competition.     Build quality seems adequate - not terrific, but not the sort of thing that will fall apart in a week. The weak spot seems to be the folding handle...it&#x27;s rather stiff to operate, and I get the sense that it will not stand up to long-term folding. As one other reviewer mentioned, the dust filter is also a bit weak, consisting of a pair of thin metal discs that are somewhat difficult to clean.     The unit includes a travel bag, however the first time I tried to use it, the zipper popped open and now can&#x27;t be closed. Still, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s relatively larger than I&#x27;d want for travel purposes...these days, I try not to check bags when I fly, so space inside my suitcase is at a premium. The bright green color is something you either love or hate.     In operation, I found the unit to work quickly and to be fairly quiet. The six foot cord is a bit short for me - eight feet would have been better. It has HIGH/LOW settings, and a push-button that disables the heating unit for cooler air. All of these features seem pretty typical for this type of product, and as it gets your hair dry quickly with a minimum amount of fuss, I can&#x27;t complain about this aspect of the product.     If you need a hair dryer and like the bold green color - recommended.</li>
            <li> I found the Infinitipro to be an extremely versatile hair dryer that was easy to use and especially easy to store due to the ability of the drier to fold at the handle. All the standard temp settings are there and the light and compact feel of the drier really makes it a great buy. If you&#x27;re looking for something compact and lightweight, and you don&#x27;t mind the metallic green color, this is the hair drier for you.</li>
            <li> This is a basic hair dryer. The feature differentiates it from other competitors is the twist folding handle. The power is 1875 watt. It is quite decent, but most of the hair dryers have that same power. It may be because the same AC motor is sued. It has two heat settings with a button to blow air only. The \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; technology is also in other hair dryers.  All in all, this is a basic solid hair dryer. If you are not crazy about the folding handle, you can go for the competitors at a slightly lower price.</li>
            <li> Needs three dryer speeds.  I place a knee high hose on the defuser to dry my curly hair.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer worked fine for me.  The cold shot isn&#x27;t exactly cold--the heat is turned off, that&#x27;s it.  The unit is a very pretty color.  The handle folds which made me think this was a dryer to take when traveling, but it&#x27;s heavy--a half pound heavier than my much larger 1875 dryer which costs less. The tote is fine but I wouldn&#x27;t particularly like to shlep this thing around.  It is not the kind of light blow dryer I&#x27;d buy for travel.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it was worth the price unless you really are in love with the shiny apple green color.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely high powered.  It does not get as hot as I would like but the blowing power is almost too much, I have long hair so if I use it on high it does tend to blow so hard it knots my hair.  I do like the attachments I use both of them frequently and with the attachments on the blowing power is not enough to tangle my hair so I would recommend using the attachments, or using the dryer on the low setting because it works well.  I love the twist on and off lid by the motor because it is easy to clean.  The motor does get a funny scent if it is used for a longer period of time but that might be expected because my dryer is only about 2 weeks old.  The dryer also isn&#x27;t very loud so that is another plus.  Overall it is a good dryer and I feel confident in recommending it, plus the color is amazing it stands out.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is powerful. It dries hair much faster than my old trusty dryer. The swivel handle can be folded so that the whole thing can go into a small tote for travel or storage. Besides the standard high and low settings, it has a cool shot button to just dry hair without heat. It is very well built and has a very high quality feel to it. No wonder it is backed by a 4 year warranty!    Besides a tote bag, it comes with snap-on concentrator for special styling needs.    The metallic apple green color is just too hot. With its modern style setting look, it is just adorable. Love it!</li>
            <li> My wife gives me this feedback.  The styler is compact, light-weight, with minimal no fuss settings, and handle gets folded over so that it can fit neatly into the bag it comes with, so you can take it with you on trips. Very useful.  It does the job as advertised and so far has not shut off due to over heating. The color is a matter of preference, it is as seen in the photo, a metallic kind of sheen green, and we like the color, it stands out.  I believe that this drier&#x27;s main greatest feature is that it is portable and can be taken in plane trips, any vacations etc and get saloon quality styling.   For home main usage, you may want one with great many features and frills, but this simple styler will serve you most of your needs already and is useful to take along as said above.</li>
            <li> The Infinitipro by Conair is a hair dryer that features an ingenuous design which makes it ideal for home or travel. Just twist the handle to fold down, retract the cord and then pack the unit into the included zip pouch. What a great concept!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without sacrificing any of the features you might expect from a great hair dryer, the compact design makes this product stand out from the competition. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I found this blow dryer to be easy to use and store.  Pretty standard in terms of functions.  Comes with an attachment for focusing the air.  I just have a question as to why the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button on hair dryers don&#x27;t stay depressed?  You would think it&#x27;d be a function where you don&#x27;t have to keep it pressed in with your finger while you use the dryer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer itself is sturdy and feels durable in my hand.  The unique part is that you can twist the handle and store it in the black bag that comes with it.  Very nice.  The bag is durable and has a zipper opening so that the dryer won&#x27;t fall out when transporting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product by Conair.</li>
            <li> The controls are pretty straight forward, no different than most other hairdryers.  Has off, high, and low switch along with a cool shot that surpresses the heat for cool drying.  Works really well and heats nicely. I have short hair so it only took a minute to dry.  I had other family members with long hair give it a shot and all agreed it was top notch.    Really like the metallic apple color too, makes a boring hairdryer look like a pretty cool appliance.    The negative has to do with the weight. This is not what I would consider a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; hairdryer. One other reviewer mentions it weighs over 2 lbs and they thought that was light... I totally disagree. If you travel a lot you know that 2 lbs added to your suitcase can make a big difference. Even lugging this thing to the gym everyday would be a work out. It does come with a travel pouch and a nice feature of easily twisting and untwisting the handle does make it a little more compact, but it is still rather bulky to stick in a gym bag or carry on suitcase.    I highly recommend this unit for home use, for travel, I&#x27;d suggest you find a more compact/lightweight unit and skip this one.</li>
            <li> The dryer is too powerful to be used on high near my ears unless I use the diffuser.  With the diffuser, it works, but I have a massive puffy head of hair.</li>
            <li> I find the hair dryer to be heavier than others I have used in the past.  I have always had one with the folding handle (for easier storage) but this one is VERY hard to swivel to fold.  Hoping it will loosen up with use.</li>
            <li> First of all, while Conair may want you to think that this Infinitpro hairdryer is travel-oriented by designing the handle to neatly fold and also including a tote, this hairdryer is actually quite bulky in size and not exactly lightweight. Having said that, there is nothing to dislike about it once you are settled on using it at home. At 1875 Watt, this packs enough power that matches most current hairdryers. It has two heat settings---high and low, and there is a button that turns off the heating element so that cool air continues to blow. The motor seems hard-working enough that I have never experienced any overheating issues. Now I understand that there is some claim about certain ceramic and ion technology that should give a smoother hair. Perhaps it&#x27;s my hair, but in practice, I don&#x27;t notice any difference from my existing hairdryer I bought several years back from a brand starting V-S.    Overall, I think this is a solid hairdryer that does the job just fine. However, don&#x27;t expect any novelty.</li>
            <li> The main reason I chose this dryer was because it said it came with two attachments, a concentrator and a diffuser. The diffuser was not included at all. Very disappointing. I have ordered a separate diffuser attachment. Now I just have to hope that it will fit properly.</li>
            <li> My wife with her beautiful long hair always uses a blow dryer after washing it. So this works perfect for the always have with you styler. It works great, looks great and the handle folds up nicely to make it compact. The lint catcher is detachable to easily clean off the lint and it also comes with a bag which helps keep the cord with the unit. Excellent styler and works great on my short hair, too!</li>
            <li> When turned on this blow dryer sounds different than any other I have previously owned. It sound stronger, with a quieter engine hum. The color is very cool and I like the turn and fold handle. The cord is durable and the settings are nice. The warm setting is just right and I like the cool down \\&quot;set style\\&quot; setting. It is full size, but not overly big and thus it is easy to handle and not tiresome to use. Highly recommend this blow dryer!</li>
            <li> My girls love this hair blower - is that the right word? I should really order another so they will stop arguing over it&#x27;s use. Quality is good, sturdy, easy to use.</li>
            <li> For now I am satisfied.  I replaced one con-air with another.  The one I replaced had heat settings (high, med, low) as this one does not. I&#x27;m not too terribly disappointed.  My only down side is its main \\&quot;feature\\&quot;, the twist handle. It seems like over some time enough twisting could render it defective. It&#x27;s sort of already loose without showing off too many twists...  Otherwise great value, great dryer, very powerful! Great look!</li>
            <li> This is a good styling tool to give a pre-teen who wants their own.  Just one button for low and high and it dries hair really good.  There is also the button in the back for a shot of cold air.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice hairdryer. My wife and daughters have many, and this one has quickly become the default. When I asked them why, I got the shoulder roll and \\&quot;I dunno. I like it.\\&quot; So there you go, about the best one can say for a nice green folding hairdryer in this price range. It works, it&#x27;s lightweight, and gets the job done. Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> it was what I expected and dry me hair done very quick!</li>
            <li> I received the product on time but was missing the diffuser part and the travel tote as mentioned in the description. Also the handle was not foldable as shown. Then later realized this was the old model of the product and the new one has the folding handle and diffuser part. Not happy because I didn&#x27;t receive all the parts and accessories as described. False advertising ! The photo shows another model and the product sent was the older model.</li>
            <li> After going through a few hairdryers, I picked this one up. I like the twist feature of the handle because it makes it easier to store on a shelf. I also like the compact size. There are really only two settings - high and low. The cooling button on the back is a bit hard to keep depressed for an extended amount of time, so I don&#x27;t really consider it a usable setting. Maybe after using it a lot it would be easier.</li>
            <li> This is a good hair dryer in a fun color.  The best feature of this hair dryer is the Cool Shot feature, which blows cool air for just a moment.  This is nice if you are starting to overheat from all of the hot air.  And the best part is that it actually gets more powerful rather than less powerful when using the Cool Shot feature.  The only negative is that this hair dryer is a bit big and bulky, but this is not a major problem.  Overall, I like and recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Lightweight entry into the blowdryer category doesn&#x27;t have enough oomph to blow even the finest hair dry. Low air pressure and low heat combine to make a lengthy process out of what ought to be a quick morning ritual.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer 3 yrs ago in green. Best dryer I have ever used. We moved almost cross country &amp; somehow it was lost. So I made the mistake of going to a store &amp; buying a Revlon dryer. Terrible!  Too hot &amp; left my shoulder length hair of medium texture looking dried out &amp; frizzy. It also took way longer to dry it. This one is the best. Got it in red. Dries my hair so fast without being too hot. Leaves it smooth &amp; shiney.  Love it!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really nothing bad to say about this blow dryer. It&#x27;s great for the price! And the compact feature comes in handy if you travel a lot.</li>
            <li> This was described correctly.  It was a nice design and really seems dry hair well.  This product arrived when it was suppose to.  I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Not only did I receive the WRONG product, but it was also used when it was supposed to be NEW. I have this exact product at home, so I know what it&#x27;s supposed to look like. The product that I received did not have the twist handle, and it came with 2 of the same attachments. I bought from Lucky Sales. DO NOT buy from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reordered this item from another company and still didn&#x27;t get what I wanted. It&#x27;s the right blow dryer, but it came with only 1 attachment. Disappointed. Guess I&#x27;ll just have to order from folica.com.</li>
            <li> i have thick hair and it always seems like I have to spend FOREVER drying my hair.  This blow dryer is small but powerful.  I love that it folds up to store easily.  My long hair dries in just a few minutes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing you don&#x27;t know how bad your old hair dryer was until you purchase a new one! This hairdryer has so much power but is also quieter than others.  My old hair dryer took 20 min to blow dry my thin, fine hair. This one only took 5 min! Love the neon green color and love how the handle folds for travel.  Works great!</li>
            <li> The description says a diffuser is included but it is not in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Heavy for person with arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;Not so quiet.</li>
            <li> If you travel and would like to style your hair at your destination then the Infinitipro by Conair 1875 is for you.  The foldable handle is perhaps the best invention since the invention of the blow dryer itself.  When folded it fits into its own carrier bag.  That bag fits easily in any suitcase or briefcase (or purse if you carry one).  The portability of this styler should not fool you as you have a full 1875 watts.  That&#x27;s a lot of power to blow and to heat!  I would highly recommend this styler.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that the color looks great!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer performs well. It puts out good heat and is not very loud. I do not have real thick hair so drying time less than 5 minutes. As far as being compact, it is better than the standard non folding hair dryer but there are more compact hair dryers.  Of course with 1875 watts smaller compact dryers do not compare.  The green color is ugly.  I would recommend this to friends and family because it is a powerful hair dryer</li>
            <li> SO easy to use, folds for smaller packing. Heat is hot but not scorching, does not burn hair. I love the attachments. One of the best dryers I have bought. COOL COLOR GREEN!</li>
            <li> Was a gift, granddaughter really like the power.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  The low setting is perfect: not too low and not too high and great for styling short hair.  It is a little heavy, though.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer right after my old Conair tourmaline died (that lasted almost eight years!) and wanted a powerful dryer that could easily be traveled with. The folding handle and travel bag were a nice touch but I&#x27;m not in love with the dryer itself. It&#x27;s not really any smaller than a normal dryer, it just folds in half to change its shape. Also, it&#x27;s semi lightweight but the weight distribution makes it a little awkward, kind of top-heavy, so it&#x27;s still awkward to use. But most importantly, even though it seemed to dry my hair in a fairly short amount of time (not the fastest, but okay), there was just too much \\&quot;wind\\&quot;. My hair would fly all over the place and become very tangled so I had to constantly brush and re-direct the dryer. It was a pain. I suppose I am looking for a dryer that gets hotter than this without so much air blowing at me. Overall, this dryer is just average. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days so I cannot comment on its shelf-life.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my wife&#x27;s old hair dryer that had a short in the cord. I tried to repair the old one, but it kept shorting out after I worked on it. Thought it would be better to spend the money and get a good hair dryer. She has been very happy with this one and it seems to dry her hair a lot faster than the other one did.</li>
            <li> I have had better conair products in the past.</li>
            <li> Very good hair dryer. Slightly heavier than a DC motor, but we knew that going in. Works great thus far and hopefully will last a lot longer than other dryers!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this hair dryer because of the lack of heat it generates.  It is definitely powerful in terms of airflow, maybe the most powerful of all hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned, but it does not get nearly hot enough to smooth or control my hair in any way.  My hair gets dry, but not in a pretty way. Hot air is needed for styling, which is not happening with this machine.  My hair looks much better using a different, hotter dryer.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair dryer. Temp control perfect and the watage is great. Powerful to dry hair quickly. Colors are great too!</li>
            <li> OMG I LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER.  I BOUGHT 4 SO I CAN USE ALL AT ONCE AND WASTE LESS TIME BLOW DRYING MY HAIR.  WHERE WOULD I BE WITHOUT THIS HAIR DRYER?  PROBABLY COLD AND SOAKING WET OUTSIDE SOMEWHERE.  THANKS INFINITI PRO FOR KEEPING IT REAL</li>
            <li> This was too heavy and loud for me to use on my long, thick hair.  Passed it on to a young niece who loved the color.</li>
            <li> Greatest blow dryer I have ever owned! It was was a bargain and gives great power and is lightweight.I have very thick hair and it makes my hair very smooth. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Have owned a few hair dryers and this one has definitely been my favorite.  Provides adequate fan power and heat while the overall design seems solid.  The cool setting provides a nice little gush of cooler air and the folding ability has been pretty handy (albeit mainly handy for going on trips).  The attachments it comes with also work pretty nicely and fit pretty snug.  Have had this for more than a year now with no problems as everything is still operating perfectly.  Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a solid and well priced hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original Conair 1875. Makeovers and upgrades don&#x27;t always yield the best results. For instance, this 1875 replica. Lacks the basic functions a blow dryer should have, such as temperature adjustment. There is only a setting for high and low fan speed. Also, in order to use the air only feature with no heat, the cooling button has to be pressed and held down to use this basic function. This causes a person&#x27;s fingers to get tired, holding a button over using a sliding switch. Then there is the retracted cord that is missing. That was probably the most valuable feature for the original Conair 1875. Made the dryer much more portable. Even useful when not traveling. Now the new 1875 has its cord sprawled all over the bathroom counter. The original is much better. This is slightly smaller with about 10 watts more power and a directional air controller, but overall not worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer. It gets the job done. The only downfall is its really loud. I have used plenty of hair dryers in my time and this one is by far the loudest. The hair dryer on high doesn&#x27;t get too hot. I feel the low setting is a bit too low but that is my opinion. For someone needing a gentle low, it would be fine.&lt;br /&gt; Just be prepared to put cotton in your ears when you start this dryer up!</li>
            <li> Love this hair drier. Have to say I chose it because of its design in the first place. It&#x27;s a bonus that it works very well, too.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love that it folds. A bit heavy for someone who has to round brush a lot of hair like I do.</li>
            <li> Did not like this. I liked that if folded down, but it didn&#x27;t feel secure. When drying my hair it wobbled and I was afraid it would break. It also didn&#x27;t have enough settings.</li>
            <li> Powerful wind speed, it dries my long hair fairly quick even without the concentrator, and the foldable handle accommodates well for dorm storage.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lightweight, powerful hairdryer, and this fits the bill.  I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Says quiet on description however it was the loudest hair dryer ever!  They should remove quiet from the description!</li>
            <li> It dries hair great. Wish I would have paid attention that you can&#x27;t adjust the heat. You can only turn it on low or high.</li>
            <li> Love it as a home use dryer.  Not compact enough to qualify as a travel dryer in my book but it&#x27;s the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I have LOTS of thick, course, wavy hair and this appliance dries it in half the time (or less) than all of my previous ones without excessive heat.  Love the cold shot. It really is cold.  Get this dryer.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Noisy. I don&#x27;t see anything professional about this dryer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the packaging says AC motor and the blurb says DC - however it works great.  It does have a large-ish plug which I assume is a transformer from AC to DC.  I love the color which is more intense than in the picture - think Granny Smith Apple. I thought it would be smaller than it is since it is sort of billed as a travel dryer.  The handle does an easy twist to fold so it fits in the accompanying bag.  I don&#x27;t mind the size as it is powerful enough to easily dry my longish and very thick hair and most travel dryers are pretty feeble. What more can I ask?  It says it will last longer than most dryers which is great. It only has a few settings - Hi and low plus a cool shot override button - all I ever use anyway.</li>
            <li> So I hadn&#x27;t updated my hair dryer in years (think 15), so I was really thrilled to receive this one. I would highly recommend it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t die on me when I am using it (overheating). This is a big one for me. I have very long hair and it seems every blower would take a water break halfway through because it was being worked too much. Not this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice, modern look. LOVE the spunky metallic green color, not gaudy at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small, lightweight size.  MUCH smaller than the older one I had, and not nearly as heavy. Your hand won&#x27;t fall off after using it! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usable Attachment.  I wasn&#x27;t aware when I bought this, but it has an attachment on the end to focus the heat for styling. Since I have hair that curves in and frames the face, this is PERFECT for getting that look!  I only have to go over it once in order for it to be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot and Cold.  The cold is actually NOT hot. Yes, it&#x27;s not hot! Amazing! LOL  And the hot doesn&#x27;t burn your eyelashes off!  Perfect in either setting, even the cooler version actually still dries your hair well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: None that I can think of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend it! Great blow dryer!</li>
            <li> Like anything hair dryers range in price and you worry about getting a poor piece of equipment if it is too cheap. However this is solidly built with all of the right basic functions for a home use hair dryer. We&#x27;ve been using it for a month and it works great. It&#x27;s compact fold in design makes for easy storage in a drawer and it has great blowing power. It is recommended, in any color that suits you.</li>
            <li> Very good product, blows air powerfully without burning your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of this hair dryer. Hope it last a long time.</li>
            <li> Prolly the best hair dryer I have used. My hair is so soft after and it took only 3 min to completely blow dry and style with a round brush. I love this product. Highly recommend!! I did not buy from Amazon tho got it at Kohls. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer that I received does not match the description. First of all, it does not look new, does not have a folding hand, and it&#x27;s blue.</li>
            <li> This dryer replaced the one I bought in College years ago also a conair. It folds up to fit in your luggage, it has two heat settings and cold air as blasts. My Dog likes it, and runs when he sees me taking it out. I haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> LOVE this dryer!  I&#x27;ve had one for about 10 years and just got another one!  IT folds for easy travel and puts out a lot of air for quick dry. The only down side it is could be a little quitter!  otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li> Before my subjective impressions, let&#x27;s note the specs first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 1875W AC motor (powerful)&lt;br /&gt;- 2 heat/speed settings&lt;br /&gt;- cold air button (turns off the heat)&lt;br /&gt;- easy to remove air filter&lt;br /&gt;- safe ALCI plug - will turn itself off if blow drier is dropped in water&lt;br /&gt;- one &#x27;concentrator&#x27; accessory included&lt;br /&gt;- zippered black nylon travel tote&lt;br /&gt;- English/Spanish instructions sheet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makers claim that the motor has a 3x longer life when compared to DC Motor hairdryer models. They also state that the dryer is using &#x27;ionic technology&#x27; which &#x27;promotes healthy, shining hair while fighting frizz&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One distinct feature is the &#x27;folding handle&#x27;. You can twist it (careful or you can break it) in a way that turns the handle parallel with the body and therefore makes it easier to pack when traveling. It&#x27;s also easier to store it in a drawer when not traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 year warranty is quite good when compared with what you get for similarly priced electronics. First, it&#x27;s 4 YEARS which is not bad. Second, even if you can&#x27;t produce a receipt, they promise to honor the warranty based on the unit&#x27;s manufacture date. You are going to pay for shipping to the service center and include $7 to have the unit shipped back. And, of course, they will not cover any damage that you may inflict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no &#x27;negatives&#x27; I detected. The INFINITY iPRO gets you all the power you need, the noise level is on par to similar devices and the 4 year warranty indicates that the makers are confident that they are selling you a quality device and it appears to be so. The travel-ready folding handle and the included tote bag are pluses which earn the iPRO its 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Brush your teeth, it&#x27;s the law! &amp;lt;&amp;lt;</li>
            <li> This little apple green styler does a great job of drying and styling my hair. Adorable apple green!    Two speeds, low and high, are plenty for my medium-thick, long hair, and a nozzle if I need it. Cool shot to hold a style.  Excellent long cord and quiet motor.  It took a bit of doing to get the folding action to loosen up, but once I got the hang of it, it works perfectly.  Verrrry nice zippered travel bag for dryer, one of the classiest I&#x27;ve ever seen.    I took one star off because it just doesn&#x27;t quite measure up to my T3, but it really isn&#x27;t designed to compete in that class. I&#x27;ll definitely be taking this on trips, packed in its tidy little travel bag!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I hate this hair dryer. I bought it because mine broke one morning and I needed to pick up a new one right away because my hair is a disaster if I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer after washing. One of the reasons I chose it was because of its ability to fold up and the nice travel bag they provide with it. However, I hate what it does to my hair. It only offers two speeds-- high and low, and doesn&#x27;t offer different temperatures (other than the cold shot). I didn&#x27;t notice this before I purchased it as I assumed any hair dryer at this price would offer different temperatures. The high setting makes me feel like I&#x27;ve been through a tornado before leaving my house in the morning-- it&#x27;s so strong that it tangles my hair, and since I need to add volume to my hair, I don&#x27;t like brushing it a lot while drying, which I have to do with this hair dryer. Additionally, it takes some time to heat up, so that means extra time that it spends tangling my hair. I&#x27;m so unhappy with this hair dryer that I wound up ordering a new one online and spending about three times as much. I can&#x27;t wait for the new one to arrive so I can stop using the Conair. I will likely keep it as a travel hair dryer, but I think I&#x27;d even prefer to use a cheap hotel hair dryer over this one...</li>
            <li> This hair dryer looks cool but it doesn&#x27;t get very hot and seems to take much longer to dry hair than competing units with similar watt ratings. Maybe I received a defective unit but I wasn&#x27;t very impressed. Other than that, it seems to be constructed well and has never failed to work. If price is a big concern, this is a decent unit but I&#x27;d definitely opt for a higher wattage unit if you are going to be using this every day.</li>
            <li> The right amount of heat and it really is lightweight .</li>
            <li> I love the power this dryer has.  Cuts drying time by a third.  Nice folding handle if traveling is required as well as the short barrell.  Does not perform like a travel dryer - excellent.</li>
            <li> The item I received did NOT have 3 heat settings - it only had one switch for the speed setting, \\&quot;Off, Low, and High.\\&quot; I&#x27;m really disappointed because I wanted a new dryer with a folding handle, and thought this would work for me. I&#x27;m returning it immediately.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer very much.  My old one was really loud.  This is not at all.  Nice color.  Very pleased I bought it.</li>
            <li> When it comes to hair dryers, I have to be the weirdest person ever. I absolutely HATE spending money on something that blows hot air. I will buy expensive shampoo and hair products, but I just can&#x27;t spend the money on a dryer. With that being said, I love this hair dryer! I normally keep my hair wrapped in a towel and then blow dry after I&#x27;ve applied my make up. Today I decided to blow dry before applying my make up, and it took me 3 minutes and 28 seconds to go from soaking wet to dry. Obviously not everyone will have the same results. I have fine hair and it is rather long, it hangs about 2 inches past my bra strap in the back. If you have thicker hair, it will probably require a longer dry time. It really does cut down on my hair drying time. I went from around 15-20 minutes to 3 minutes and 28 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the construction of the actual dryer. Eh. It feels very cheap. I&#x27;m curious to see if it will last more than a few months.</li>
            <li> Lots of power does a GOOD JOB</li>
            <li> Great dryer - does its job - no complaints..&lt;br /&gt;weight and feel are great - so no issues.&lt;br /&gt;the rotating handle is a little strange, but it is a nice feature when it does need to be folded &amp; stashed away.</li>
            <li> Does a great job. Simple to use.</li>
            <li> This was a decent enough hairdryer with one annoying aspect that marred the user experience.  The handle on the unit is placed at an odd angle so you have to hold it a little askew to get the direct blast from the dryer.  It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but it&#x27;s awkward enough that I would have returned this had I purchased it.</li>
            <li> My thick hair drys faster and is less frizzy with this hair dryer.  I wish it were just a little bit smaller, but it&#x27;s still a pretty good size.  Great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I used this while vacationing with a friend and it was the first thing I came home and bought!  Great power, easy to hold and store.</li>
            <li> bulky and too noisy..</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer ever especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  I broke down and got this dryer to take with me while traveling.  I loved my other Conair hair dryer so decided to find something that could pack in a suitcase.  This hair dryer puts out a ton of heat for such a small product!  I love it.  It is perfect for the traveler as well as someone who appreciates a great product!</li>
            <li> No power, no heat, no directed air flow, and it&#x27;s very loud. I am wishing  that I hadn&#x27;t forgotten to return it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because my old one stopped working.  This seems like a good quality buy, certainly for the price, but no professional dryer.</li>
            <li> So far-pretty good. I have been using this dryer for a couple of months now and it gets the job done. What more can be said? It was a good price and it dries my hair..</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It blows heat at your hair which evaporates the water in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Its absolutely amazing. I have thick hair and this dries my hair quickly. Also adds shine.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i dint like is the switch button.&lt;br /&gt;But for this price its worth it!!</li>
            <li> This dryer works great, but the colour options are hideous. Would prefer a more neutral colour, like a pearl white or onyx black.</li>
            <li> I had this hair dryer for a couple of years and the plug went bad, so I tried replacing it with several different brands.  I ended up returning every one I bought and then decided to look at Amazon to see if it was even possible to buy the same model again.  I was thrilled to find it and immediately bought it.  For whatever reason the air does not get as hot as the original and the low setting is a little bit strong for a low setting.  Compared to the numerous brands I just tried this was still my favorite and am happy to have it!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer and drys hair very quickly.  The attachment is great for concentrating on one area as to not make hair frizzy.  Love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I use low setting and it dries my hair fast and at a comfortable temperature. Great value and received promptly...AI love the green color.</li>
            <li> The Conair dryer is great.  I particularly like the idea that the unit&#x27;s handle folds into the body to conserve space in my drawer</li>
            <li> it is so far so good.</li>
            <li> after having my previous blow dryer for almost 6 years, it finally died on me. i did a bit on research on some blow dryers and to be honest this one caught my eye only because the color lol i read some of the reviews and went ahead and purchased it. it was suppose to arrive on a friday and i recieved it on monday :)) that was a plus, after usuing it I LOVED IT, it was light weight, small and came with a diffuser and another gadget. i have long thick hair and my hair was dry in less than 15 minutes and it was soft and had less frizz !! love this product !</li>
            <li> I like the folding handle but don&#x27;t feel like the dryer gets hot enough to dry my hair very fast.</li>
            <li> love the color, works fine, just what I wanted,  no problems with it at all.  I am pleased with it</li>
            <li> This hairdryer exceeded my expectations.  It is really powerful. I love how it folds down for better storage.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to buy this dryer because of its claims to dry my hair faster. It didn&#x27;t really live up, but my main complaint is that the high setting was SO high that it blew my hair around so much that all I was doing was ripping my hair out trying to de-tangle it from all the blowing around. And the lower setting just didn&#x27;t feel warm enough. I hate to have to return it, but my neck was sore from all the uncomfortable de-tangling as a result of just too much wind.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this blow dryer. It really is quieter than any other one I&#x27;ve owned. The attachments that come with it are great, and it cuts down a ton on frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the handle folds up for easy storage, and it&#x27;s really lightweight. You don&#x27;t feel like your arm is going to fall off while drying your hair. It&#x27;s also pretty quick. I have thick, straight hair that goes halfway down my back, and it takes around 10 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> great hairdryer for the price, punches well above its weight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;although a separate heat and speed setting would be optimal the combined settings do the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cold air button is a nice feature and comb diffuser has seen much use with other members of my family and they love it too</li>
            <li> This is an excellent blow dryer, as it dries extremely quickly and creates a smooth, frizz-free shine. My hair is a medium bob style and  the rotating straightening piece is perfect for creating a stylish look. Great purchase, I expect this item to last quite a while, as cheaper quality driers die on me after 2 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I bought this blow dryer only because of the color. I love anything and everything green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the attachment on this hair dryer it works very well when I am drying my hair to get it somewhat strait before I flat iron it. It&#x27;s pretty much the only reason I won a hair dryer. I gets nice and hot, but not to hot to were I feel like I&#x27;m about to burn myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love how the handle turns and folds up. It fits in my bathroom drawer perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d reccamend this to anyone who just needs a simple blow dryer for simple things. Also if you need to save on space because of the folding handle.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this powerful little blowdryer.  I have thick, coarse, porous hair, and I believe the drying time has been greatly reduced thanks to this handy tool.  Heat setting is just right -- not too hot, and concentrator helps making using a barrel brush for blowing out a little easier.  I find the twist and stow feature to be a little tricky, which is why I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars.  I would recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I like it! I didn&#x27;t review it for a couple months to see if it died early, but no, it&#x27;s going strong. Way loud, but really strong and I love how it folds up and fits into a little bag for my gym bag. Me likey!</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer I have ever had. Works wonderful. Came on time. No Problems. And I have recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Was to powerful for mid-back length hair.  only two speeds Low or High.</li>
            <li> Love this full hair dryer that isn&#x27;t compact while retracted -and  has the full power of a normal hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Love the color&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it had a hot or hotter setting though like the Infinity Pro by Conair 1875 watt Hair Dryer - Purple, which I also have&lt;br /&gt;all in all a very good compact hair dryer that drys hair fast.</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my daughter.  She absolutely loves it. Has enough power and does a great job drying</li>
            <li> Great Blow Dryer-right amount of power, heat. cut my drying time in half! Awesome price you can&#x27;t beat amazon on the product selection at the best price.</li>
            <li> Gift for wife who states she loves the way her hair looks despite no apparent difference in high and low heat setting[s], thus, can only rate as high as 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is powerful without being too loud. I&#x27;ve tried others, but this one is my favorite because it dries my hair SO fast without drying it out. It&#x27;s great to travel with because it folds up nicely. A weekend guest asked to borrow my blow dryer and we actually ordered one for her from Amazon before she left! My hair is thick and tends to hold water...this dryer is the best one I have found.</li>
            <li> Airflow is powerful- dries my hair about 30% faster.  Took some getting used to but after a week I found it gives lots of lift that lasts. (My hair is fine)&lt;br /&gt;Is a bit heavier than my old conair, but worth it for teh extra body.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer because I had an older version that I liked, but needed to replace.  This hair dryer is MUCH more powerful than my old model ever was, even in the beginning.  In fact, I have to be careful when using this dryer on high speed, as it quickly tangles my long hair into knots.  It gets the job done quickly, though.  It&#x27;s lightweight and powerful, no complaints there.  The &amp;#34;twisting&amp;#34; handle doesn&#x27;t really make it more travel-sized, just changes the shape.  I think the last few times I packed it, I just left it as is.  Anyhow, good little hairdryer...just be careful with long hair.</li>
            <li> The only benefit to this item is the color.  Otherwise, its terrible.  Its as loud as a regular hair dryer so if you&#x27;re looking for quiet look elsewhere.  It is also about a pound heavier than my last hairdryer of the same size.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer. Very powerful.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I am disappointed, but my last Conair was better.  However, it burnt out within a year, possibly because I dropped it, but this time I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much cash to replace it and that one is no longer available.  FYI--The one I had and bought on Amazon was:  Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I selected this one because I was so pleased with the last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color and functionality of this dryer are it&#x27;s best features.  It probably makes a better &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; dryer than anything.  It doesn&#x27;t allow you to adjust the temp (cool, warm, hot), but it does have a cold shot button.  You can only choose High or Low speeds.  I totally missed those details in the online description that before my purchase.  I did watch the video and it is what sold me, but the video makes this dryer look more powerful than it really is.  Perhaps if you don&#x27;t have thick hair like me it would perform more to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, I don&#x27;t think it is even close to salon performance.  It says it uses ion technology, but my last Conair that was labeled ionic worked so much better and dried my hair faster with hardly any frizz.  This gets the job done, It dries my hair pretty fast, but my hair is very frizzy after which annoys me.  I will probably take the plunge and buy a higher-end hair dryer in the future, until then, this is OK and will get me through!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised. It folds but you definitely need strength to open and shut it. I leave it snapped open for convenience but I get scared that I&#x27;m going to snap it every time that I go to close or open it. The little big that comes with it is very handy though. :) And my hair seems just as healthy as ever, but I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li> Very nice compact &amp; lightweight hair dryer, hangs easily from a command hook from the provided loop at base of handle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blow dryer a few months ago loved the product until it randomly DIED the other day. Fortunately I had saved my old one, or I would have had to leave the house in freezing weather with a wet head. Not pleased.</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL AND THE COLOR IS BETTER THEN SHOWN MORE LIKE NEON GREEN!  DEFINITELY A GOOD PURCHASE - GAVE AS A GIFT</li>
            <li> Dries my hair really quickly...not as &amp;#34;whisper quiet&amp;#34; as I had hoped it would be.  Love the color and that it folds compactly.</li>
            <li> This is a really good hair dryer, especially for the money. Its strong and dries hair quickly and its a gorgeous color. It is a bit heavy and loud, but I still consider it a great buy. Also very convenient that it folds up. I got it for my mom but whenever I&#x27;m home, I use it too.</li>
            <li> There are two speeds. High or low. The high gives off a lot of heat and force but the low is too low heat wise. Works fine but wish I had read a review that warned of the limited settings.</li>
            <li> I like the product. Got what I expected :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my spare bathroom, and all my girlfriends love it.</li>
            <li> hair is not as frizzy dries fast and not as loud as my previous one</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy this right now.</li>
            <li> I received this courtesy of Amazon vine and promptly gave it to my wife to try out.  She liked it so much that this is the only dryer she uses.  For a price so low (under $30) what&#x27;s not to like?  It is very lightweight and portable.  Like that the cord retracts instead of having to wrap it around the dryer which is bad for the appliance.  I expect this to last another couple of years.  Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> I first used this hair dryer at a friend&#x27;s cabin and I was hooked. The motor is quiet, the dryer itself is pretty light, the blow is intense, and the best part? It gets super hot. You can barely hold your hand under it for too long. I immediately went home and bought it online. I have a medium bob and the dry time was cut in half. My hair seemed fuller and shinier. My roommate was so jealous that she ran out and bought one as well. We both are big into hair tools and are now the biggest fan of this hair dryer. I came upon it in Costco for such a good deal, that I bought another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this dryer, is that it does not come with the defuser attachment. Please, Conair, gimme a defuser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this dryer to anyone with hair.</li>
            <li> Always been a conair user and after my original conair blow dryer was torn up by the dog (which I had for 6 years) I chose this one to replace it . So far I&#x27;m very happy with it, very strong and lightweight. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any louder than a usual blow dryer but it&#x27;s not quiet either. My only qualm is you can&#x27;t change the temperature but not a big deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hairdryer for three years now.  It&#x27;s still running great, and for the price, I think it&#x27;s a great dryer. I have thick, coarse, wavy hair. During the time I&#x27;ve owned this dryer I&#x27;ve had hairstyles shorter than my ears and hairstyles all the way to my waist. The choices between hot, warm, cold, and high and low flow have made it versatile through all my haircuts. It&#x27;s one of the fastest dryers I&#x27;ve used, and on high, the air has a strong, fast flow. On hot, it gets truly hot.  (But I&#x27;ve never had to worry about overheating.) The cold shot is cold.  My only dissatisfaction is with the claim that it&#x27;s an ionic hairdryer. They must have put a tiny amount of ceramic or tourmaline into the unit to claim that it&#x27;s ionic--it does not affect it&#x27;s performance.  But other than that I&#x27;ve really appreciated it&#x27;s reliability.  For the price, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairdresser, as she purchased it for a vacation cruise &amp; loved it. She was right! It&#x27;s a powerful dryer. It has replaced the one I had, though while it still works fine, it can&#x27;t rival this one! Came with diffuser, which works very well. Great little dryer!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this hairdryer!  It is compact and convenient but does not sacrifice any power.  I have really thick, wavy hair and this travel dryer is the best I have found.  I now have multiple!</li>
            <li> Powerful and surprisingly lighter than I thought it would be.</li>
