            <li>the grippy handle is very nice.</li>
            <li>Anti-static is nice too!</li>
            <li>Love this brush!</li>
            <li>Lovely colors go with my bathroom decor!</li>
            <li>On this one, they&#x27;re nice</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all still on there, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>and it gives a nice scalp massage.</li>
            <li>This is probably best suited for people with very sensitive scalps or thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for a child or sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>It just kind of slides over the top of my hair.</li>
            <li>This brush is so comfortable!</li>
            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>but now I love these brushes and would never want to use anything else.</li>
            <li>They are easy on the scalp and seem to work better while blow drying.</li>
            <li>As for the static free properties, I don&#x27;t know if it lives up to that hype.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist ordered the first one I had, but after trying two others this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Based on some other user reviews, I have to agree that it is probably best for people with not-super-thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>light, and</li>
            <li>I love the Fast Flow brushes</li>
            <li>Love this line in particular.</li>
            <li>These brushes have a very large size bead on the end.</li>
            <li>The ends on the bristles are very large and my hair is very thin, so this did not work the best it could.</li>
            <li>I like the regular Cricket brush better.</li>
            <li>It felt funny at first</li>
            <li>It might work better for someone with very fine, thin hair, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li>The ball tips on this are so large it doesnt even really pass thru your hair,  </li>
            <li>so I guess it won&#x27;t have much chance to lose the nubs.</li>
            <li>I wanted a gentle brush, but this one is too gentle.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes and this is extra soft.  </li>
            <li>I like cricket&#x27;s other products better.</li>
            <li>and it does seem to cut down on the static from blowdrying.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s great for thick curly hair but for straight fine hair, I found it was not good.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable on the scalp but the other one wasn&#x27;t scratchy</li>
            <li>I found the larger round bits at the end of each bristle nice because it&#x27;s almost like getting a scalp massage when I brush my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it pulls less hair out every time, and I would recommend it to anyone with long hair curly or straight.</li>
            <li>Gets through knots in my fine hair with little pain.</li>
            <li>Pulls through Tangles and snarls with ease-husband caught using it frequently</li>
            <li>but I noticed in compairison to my current brush the brissels on this brush are ziz-zag vs. straight rows.  </li>
            <li>I love Cricket brushes but usually get only the red ones.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s made well, it doesn&#x27;t go through my hair, which is fine, shoulder-length, medium thick.</li>
            <li>The balls on the brush were very large and it felt award, I didn&#x27;t use the item I just held in in my hand and was not comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried their green &#x27;comfort&#x27; variety of static-free brush</li>

            <li> I like cricket&#x27;s other products better. The ends on the bristles are very large and my hair is very thin, so this did not work the best it could.</li>
            <li> The balls on the brush were very large and it felt award, I didn&#x27;t use the item I just held in in my hand and was not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! My hair stylist ordered the first one I had, but after trying two others this is my favorite! The handle has a great grip and it is a great vent brush.</li>
            <li> I love Cricket brushes but usually get only the red ones. I decided to try this one and was sorely disappointed. I have baby fine hair. This brush just slid over my hair. It did nothing. And brushing my hair once it was dry was just as bad. I threw it in the closet and went back to my red one. Maybe it&#x27;s great for thick curly hair but for straight fine hair, I found it was not good.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and this is extra soft.  Perfect for a child or sensitive scalp.  Lovely colors go with my bathroom decor!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried their green &#x27;comfort&#x27; variety of static-free brush and I&#x27;m going back to the red ones.  I have long, thick hair and with the larger babbles on the end, sometimes the brush itself gets tangled in my hair when I&#x27;m blowdrying.  Didn&#x27;t happen with the red one with smaller end caps.  It is comfortable on the scalp but the other one wasn&#x27;t scratchy so it&#x27;s not worth the potential tangles.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Ulta. Based on some other user reviews, I have to agree that it is probably best for people with not-super-thick hair. I found the larger round bits at the end of each bristle nice because it&#x27;s almost like getting a scalp massage when I brush my hair. I have thinner hair and I didn&#x27;t find that these kept the brush from truly detangling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very light, and the grippy handle is very nice. Anti-static is nice too!</li>
            <li> The ball tips on this are so large it doesnt even really pass thru your hair,  Useless.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;ALWFUL&amp;#34; could not use, not worth sending back-thru in the get lost draw!</li>
            <li> This brush is so comfortable! Pulls through Tangles and snarls with ease-husband caught using it frequently</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it pulls less hair out every time, and I would recommend it to anyone with long hair curly or straight.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  Gets through knots in my fine hair with little pain.</li>
            <li> Balls too big on end. Get caught in hair and not soft on scalp</li>
            <li> I like the regular Cricket brush better. I didn&#x27;t buy this for the comfort - I hoped the nubs on the bristles might last longer. But the brush is too wimpy for my thick hair so I guess it won&#x27;t have much chance to lose the nubs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and it does seem to cut down on the static from blowdrying.</li>
            <li> I chose one star because it doesn&#x27;t brush my hair!  Never thought that would be possible but I noticed in compairison to my current brush the brissels on this brush are ziz-zag vs. straight rows.  In no way will this get through wet hair, dry hair it works only if my hair is not incredibly knotty.</li>
            <li> This is probably best suited for people with very sensitive scalps or thicker hair.  I love the Fast Flow brushes but this is not really usable for me.</li>
            <li> The nubs (what are those called anyway?) on the brush are why I bought the brush. Previous brushes I&#x27;ve owned the nubs always fall off. On this one, they&#x27;re nice but they&#x27;re really big. They&#x27;re all still on there, so that&#x27;s nice. But typically with brushes you can feel the spokes touch your scalp and it gives a nice scalp massage. Not the case with this brush. As for the static free properties, I don&#x27;t know if it lives up to that hype.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this brush. Although it&#x27;s made well, it doesn&#x27;t go through my hair, which is fine, shoulder-length, medium thick. It might work better for someone with very fine, thin hair, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. I wanted a gentle brush, but this one is too gentle. It just kind of slides over the top of my hair.</li>
            <li> No hair pulling with this product it.  Love this line in particular.</li>
            <li> These brushes have a very large size bead on the end. It felt funny at first but now I love these brushes and would never want to use anything else. They are easy on the scalp and seem to work better while blow drying.</li>
