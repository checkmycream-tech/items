            <li>I love Nature&#x27;s Gate Products.</li>
            <li>Made my head itch which saddened me because I love Chamomile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Previously I have used everything from top of the line shampoos &amp; conditioners to the $3.99 bottle at CVS.</li>
            <li>smell is okay,</li>
            <li>Make no mistake; this conditioner is wonderful as is, but my long curls needs a bit more</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>This smells really good and conditions my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to commit, but the price was good and with 3 bottles sent, it really is a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have pop out so strong when i use this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Still, not bad at all, and I am still using it, but I prefer something with more moisturizing power.  </li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>The scent of this conditioner is beautiful, it leaves my hair so very soft that I am actually having to use more product to keep my curls together!</li>
            <li>Then you&#x27;ll see some huge changes in your hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I did enjoy this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>The price is very right, and with Amazon Prime I received it 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li>It rinses absolutely clean.</li>
            <li>I gave this a five star rate because it is an amazing conditioner for my hair type, i have natural hair and the curls</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and the smell is heavenly -- herbally, but not fake-y sweet.</li>
            <li>has the most sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>My favorite conditioner so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not ready to commit to the home remedy shampoos and not conditioning, so this is a good choice for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair still felt dry after a week of use, but it had a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner didn&#x27;t impress my hair very much, though.  </li>
            <li>I have a filter for the top of my shower drain and every time I use the conditioner yellow needs show up in it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>but since it&#x27;s not fake stuff</li>
            <li>Good for the price, not disappointing, just not amazing to me.</li>
            <li>and this stuff is pretty gentle.  </li>
            <li>I generally have very dry and easily damaged hair, but this conditioner helps keep it feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>My number one hair conditioner -- I have fine hair and there are only two conditioners I bother using anymore, and this is one of them.</li>
            <li>as, I seem to get an inordinate amount of knots in my hair after use - as if it&#x27;s drying out my hair too much, but that could just be my hair type.</li>
            <li>It must be a very lightweight conditioner.  </li>
            <li>my husband really likes it</li>
            <li>Surprised that a sulfate free conditioner can make my hair so soft, and it helps with detangling.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with this product because it gives me the conditioning I need with just a little drop.</li>
            <li>Nothing really special here, but these work as expected.  </li>
            <li>Natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a really classy looking bottle.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but makes my hair super oily :(</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent more money for less results.  </li>
            <li>and when I do I will be able to group it with other items and cut down on the amount of packages that are shipped.</li>
            <li>I use this to wash my hair instead of shampoo and it has helped my hair not to dry out as much.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and naturally graying and naturally dry.  </li>

            <li> I use this to wash my hair instead of shampoo and it has helped my hair not to dry out as much.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and naturally graying and naturally dry.  </li>
            <li> hair is cut just above my shoulders, and I have pretty thick hair that I blow dry and use a flat iron on every day.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or damaged hair you should consider trying to only use conditioner to wash your hair with, once you get use to it you will like it I think.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter, whom has very long hair, and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> It made my scalp itchy after leaving my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I started to become very conscious of the products I am using and thought it might be time to move onto an option that at least contains organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in Virginia and it is very humid, so I have to or it will go crazy.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I am a little iffy about is the texture of the conditioner when on my hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not over powering.</li>
            <li> Plus, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Panthenol ruins my hair (Pantene Pro V for example uses it), so I can&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was average.  </li>
            <li> brand of shampoo and conditioner, overall, seem a bit weak against my long, very thick hair; which is why they were given almost the same review -</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve dried and styled it, you see your hair, not a bunch of wax or oily residue that won&#x27;t rinse out.</li>
            <li> I think that I may end up adding a small amount of almond oil to the mixture to encourage slightly smother detangling.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this has panthenol as an ingredient until I got it home. Panthenol ruins my hair (Pantene Pro V for example uses it), so I can&#x27;t use this product. Boo!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m torn between a 4.5 and a 5 star review. The scent of this conditioner is beautiful, it leaves my hair so very soft that I am actually having to use more product to keep my curls together! The only thing that I am a little iffy about is the texture of the conditioner when on my hair. I think that I may end up adding a small amount of almond oil to the mixture to encourage slightly smother detangling. Make no mistake; this conditioner is wonderful as is, but my long curls needs a bit more oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a truly organic conditioner, do not hesitate to purchase this!</li>
            <li> I did enjoy this conditioner. It&#x27;s organic, vegan-friendly, and the smell is rich and lovely - and those are all exceptional pros and if I think about it, I can look over some of the things that have bothered me about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such as, I seem to get an inordinate amount of knots in my hair after use - as if it&#x27;s drying out my hair too much, but that could just be my hair type. It&#x27;s a bit of a bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand of shampoo and conditioner, overall, seem a bit weak against my long, very thick hair; which is why they were given almost the same review - but it may just be my hair type, and not the products fault.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was average.  The ingredients were all good and appropriate for an organic product, and the scent was very natural and delicious, exactly like a chamomile flower.  The conditioner didn&#x27;t impress my hair very much, though.  My hair still felt dry after a week of use, but it had a nice shine.  It must be a very lightweight conditioner.  Still, not bad at all, and I am still using it, but I prefer something with more moisturizing power.  Good for the price, not disappointing, just not amazing to me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells heavenly. I love this company and their hair products. They smell so good and they are organic. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> It made my scalp itchy after leaving my hair dry. I have a filter for the top of my shower drain and every time I use the conditioner yellow needs show up in it. They&#x27;re feel and look plastic. It makes me wonder if owners changed. I can&#x27;t keep using it, how can I trust this crp?</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and naturally graying and naturally dry.  I use this to wash my hair instead of shampoo and it has helped my hair not to dry out as much.  If you have dry or damaged hair you should consider trying to only use conditioner to wash your hair with, once you get use to it you will like it I think.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but makes my hair super oily :(</li>
            <li> This conditioner has done wonders for the hair in my household. I use it at a leave-in and now my toddlers(who has the most sensitive skin) hair no longer breaks  and mine and my 7 year-olds hair is softer and thicker.  I&#x27;ve spent more money for less results.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair feel amazing. Ive never had hair like this. I take lowdose chemo and it make my hair unmanagable until now. Thank u thank u!</li>
            <li> Great smelling hair conditioner. Makes my hair very smooth and frizz free. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> AMAZING conditioner. I can&#x27;t believe how good it feels in my hair! Surprised that a sulfate free conditioner can make my hair so soft, and it helps with detangling. I generally have very dry and easily damaged hair, but this conditioner helps keep it feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> I gave this a five star rate because it is an amazing conditioner for my hair type, i have natural hair and the curls i have pop out so strong when i use this conditioner. Love Love Love LOv3</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner so far. It smells awesome. Plus, a little bit goes a long way. I bought it for my daughter, whom has very long hair, and she loves it too. It&#x27;s great for colored or bleached hair as well. Also, buy a shower filter to remove the hardness and chlorines from your water. Then you&#x27;ll see some huge changes in your hair and skin. I totally recommend this stuff!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites!!  Leaves hair feeling soft and smelling good. I love Nature&#x27;s Gate Products. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This smells really good and conditions my hair very well.</li>
            <li> Natural. Leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth. Would highly recommend to others. Order came in timely fashion. Great price. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Made my head itch which saddened me because I love Chamomile. Smells great. If you have sensitive scalps or scalp psoriasis, I would be careful.</li>
            <li> After trying lots of expensive conditioners for my thick, coarse hair the Nature&#x27;s Gate works great.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Nothing really special here, but these work as expected.  I have really fine hair and this stuff is pretty gentle.  For the price, it&#x27;s a great bargain.</li>
            <li> My number one hair conditioner -- I have fine hair and there are only two conditioners I bother using anymore, and this is one of them. The price is very reasonable and the smell is heavenly -- herbally, but not fake-y sweet. It rinses absolutely clean. Once you&#x27;ve dried and styled it, you see your hair, not a bunch of wax or oily residue that won&#x27;t rinse out. It&#x27;s also a really classy looking bottle. I hope Nature&#x27;s Gate keeps making this!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on organic/natural shampoo and conditioner before I purchased this (and it&#x27;s shampoo). I was hesitant to commit, but the price was good and with 3 bottles sent, it really is a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously I have used everything from top of the line shampoos &amp; conditioners to the $3.99 bottle at CVS. I started to become very conscious of the products I am using and thought it might be time to move onto an option that at least contains organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is cut just above my shoulders, and I have pretty thick hair that I blow dry and use a flat iron on every day. I live in Virginia and it is very humid, so I have to or it will go crazy. I am really satisfied with this product because it gives me the conditioning I need with just a little drop. I&#x27;m not ready to commit to the home remedy shampoos and not conditioning, so this is a good choice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is okay, my husband really likes it but since it&#x27;s not fake stuff it&#x27;s really not over powering. It rinses out nicely while still keeping manageability. The price is very right, and with Amazon Prime I received it 2 day shipping. Since there are 3 bottles, I won&#x27;t have to order for a while and when I do I will be able to group it with other items and cut down on the amount of packages that are shipped.</li>
