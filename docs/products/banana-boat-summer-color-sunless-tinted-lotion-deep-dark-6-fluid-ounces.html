            <li>We can be tan &amp; smell good without the sun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just as good as the $35 bottle of Tan Physics</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and freckles...</li>
            <li>your good.</li>
            <li>I rubbed in on my skin &amp; it isn&#x27;t sticky, it smells sooo good and the scent lingers all day.</li>
            <li>I go through bottles of these during the summer, better than the &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; self tanners out there, and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li>But I love it for my body!</li>
            <li>sure you wash your hands afterwards though!</li>
            <li>and it spreads better too!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I will order more!</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing...</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING</li>
            <li>no offensive smell, nice fragrance....</li>
            <li>The color is really nice too.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice color, but doesn&#x27;t immediately stain hands if washed.</li>
            <li>Got a couple of nice streaky marks on an off-white tank.</li>
            <li>This is a really good cheap self tanner!</li>
            <li>Unless you like spending money you don&#x27;&#x27;t need to, buy this one and use the money you saved on a really nice lunch.</li>
            <li>and it really is the best out there.</li>
            <li>It has a nice caramel color so you can see where you&#x27;ve applied it</li>

            <li>This product has the best smell of feel of any tanner I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>great product  and very fast delivery</li>
            <li>&quot; the smell is awesome, kind of floral but not strong just pleasant.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re very fair, just go for the lighter one and apply more frequently.</li>
            <li>I really really love this self tanner.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t stink like most self tanning lotions do.</li>
            <li>No streaks - make sure you rub it in.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you rub it in around your elbows, wrists and hairline because thats where it makes it look most orange-ish.</li>
            <li>I cant find it in many stores</li>
            <li>Well it is WAY BETTER than most self tanning lotions</li>
            <li>I found Jergens products better results then</li>
            <li>Definitely the best self tanner out there!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite self-tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>when I woke up the next morning I had a wonderful tan!</li>
            <li>my favorite sunless tanning</li>
            <li>There is nothing better than this.</li>
            <li>My legs really look great.    </li>
            <li>LOVE the light/med.</li>
            <li>I love this tanner.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It goes on better that way.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your hands after, they will turn orange.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I will experiment with some better application techniques to try and get a more blended appearance, so my thoughts on this lotion may change....</li>
            <li>I have tried so many tanning lotions out there</li>
            <li>No nasty smell, no streaking, no \\&quot;muddy\\&quot; color after applying it</li>
            <li>so I was definately pleased to find that this product didn&#x27;t give me any orange tint</li>
            <li>This is ok for winter time</li>
            <li>I completely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and have reordered many times.</li>
            <li>Tried many products, streaky, orange, flakes ect...</li>
            <li>but for the most part I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the way this works for me</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I was very excited tto read this lotion does not stain or leave an orange/dirty look.</li>
            <li>It gives pretty good color.</li>
            <li>good bottle,worked well thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, if your looking for darker color I would recommend XENTAN.</li>
            <li>pretty good stuff</li>
            <li>and it looked great very natural color.</li>
            <li>for 20% off, free shipping over $25 AND free gifts!    </li>
            <li>this looks so natural and awesome, first application.</li>
            <li>I applied twice before bed, and once the next morning after a shower, and I got the perfect golden brown tan.</li>
            <li>Not blotchy, doesn&#x27;t rub off easily  </li>
            <li>I tan easily and never burn.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, not orange or streaky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans easily off your hands when you&#x27;re done applying&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lotion is tinted so you can easily tell if it was rubbed in or not.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would highly recommend it as your alternative to sun tanning!!!</li>
            <li>I decided to try it anyway since it was relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>After showering...it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great product overall, might not work for the majority of my skin</li>
            <li>Started on my shins, lightly did the tops of my feet &amp; toes and moved my way up...dried for about 5-10 minutes...</li>
            <li>By the way, my skin is fairly light</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly-</li>
            <li>but I thought it was too light for summer.</li>
            <li>My skin is light tanned and it does give me that sun kissed color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a good product for a good price and the tan does look real.</li>
            <li>one more thing, I HIGHLY recommend washing your hands when finished right away with warm water &amp; soap, your palms will have tanner on them-</li>
            <li>I was very nervous because i have never done self tanners before, but it was very easy to apply and there was no streaks.</li>
            <li>Give great nice tan color for my pale skin, i am looking like after vacation!</li>
            <li>product is very good, but to make it even better and last longer, mix it 50/50 with Jergens Natural Glow Medium/Tan self tanner.  </li>
            <li>I am a 1/4 Japanese and tan nicely in the summer!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more aware of my skin changing...</li>
            <li>-7$. Worth a try!</li>
            <li>Presumably it would have gotten darker with more lotion or more frequent application...</li>
            <li>This by far is the best tanning lotion around, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>After having read all the good reviews, I decided to pick up a bottle locally since it was available at Target.</li>
            <li>After trying pretty much every self tanner imaginable in every price range I can finally say I&#x27;ve found THE BEST!!  </li>
            <li>Specially on my knees, ellbows, knuckles and ankles.</li>
            <li>I am scared of wrinkles, so I don&#x27;t go tanning and where sunscreen nearly every day (all year long), but this stuff is incredible!     </li>
            <li>I had a nice natural looking tan...</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m only fair because I wear sunblock all the time.</li>
            <li>I bought this item so I wouldn&#x27;t need to tan in the booths as much because I love to be tan.</li>
            <li>I think it has a pretty strong smell, but I like it -</li>
            <li>This is great because it soaks into my skin similarly to other lotions and does not leave a grimey residue.</li>
            <li>It does not streak, leaves you with a vibrant glow and healthy look.  </li>
            <li>It also dries super quick, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard there pretty cheap at Walmart</li>
            <li>this stuff does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>This budget-friendly self-tanning lotion is actually an incredible deal because unlike some of the expensive tanning lotion brands/products out there, this goes on smoothly, blends exceptionally well, and barely streaks if at all.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin with pink undertones, and this tanner looks natural on me.  </li>
            <li>I am not streaked or orange, but merely golden.</li>
            <li>I would reccommend this to anyone looking for a nice, non-streaking tan in a short amount of time!</li>
            <li>This lotion isn&#x27;t sticky and absorbs pretty quick, leaving your skin feeling moisturized and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone, specially since real tanning is damaging your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for the past 5 years and it looks great on legs and arms.  </li>
            <li>My new fave, cheap too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also light skin with pink undertones but tan super easy.</li>
            <li>Before I put it on, I made sure my skin was clean (but not straight out of the shower--</li>
            <li>First, the price is awesome---I got it at walmart for $6.42.  </li>
            <li>But with this one, no matter how many showers I take after the initial night that I let it soak in, it does not rub off...</li>
            <li>with the first application, just &amp;#34;light to medium&amp;#34; which is what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I am a tanning bed abuser...</li>
            <li>First of all, its a bronzer</li>
            <li>first self tanner</li>
            <li>at first</li>
            <li>so I put it on twice the first day (</li>
            <li>I put lotion on first, and then apply it.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone :)</li>
            <li>Gave me an instant glow and more as I applied each day for about 3 days.</li>
            <li>It went on &amp;#34;splotchily&amp;#34; and was more orange than the brown one get from a proper sun tan.  </li>
            <li>I overall LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>so you con see where exactly you are applying it.</li>
            <li>I tried this stuff because of the good reviews and frankly, I just want something I can apply every few days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally really pale but tan with a good lotion.</li>
            <li>and it did the trick I feel that glow needed and not to much and no streaking or orange color for me, just the right balance</li>
            <li>Omg love this product smell isn&#x27;t bad and drys pretty quick works great just use gloves</li>
            <li>you have to apply it as quickly as possible and make sure you rub it in very well and then wash your hands immediately</li>
            <li>Even the same brand with the blue label for fair skin...</li>
            <li>this had the best reviews for a self tanner that was reasonably priced since I had never used one before and was skeptical about turning orange.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this lotion a shot after reading all of the positive reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li>I put a thin layer on and it gave me a great glow the next day, after a shower is always better since you smell</li>
            <li>it gets me nice and dark.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and since the lotion itself is a deep brown you can see where your applying the lotion to prevent streaks.</li>
            <li>With other self tanners I used before, after a day or maybe after the second shower I took after using self tanner, they used to kind of rub off on certain parts of my body, so that it looked like I had some kind of skin problems or something, white spots and so on.</li>
            <li>I realized this was drying my skin having snakeskin/scaley look in certain areas of my legs, so I scrubbed the area with my bath sponge and it removed the scaley appearance.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried several self-tanners and have found Banana Boat (Deep Dark) to be the best.  </li>
            <li>If you use the Banana Boat ALONE, it doesn&#x27;t last very long (3 days) AND it can look splotchy (even with good preparation of skin and exfoliation beforehand).  </li>
            <li>I thought it would give me a more of a mocha than honey color based on it being for a deep and dark tan, but I love it so much that I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, dries within a half hour completely, doesn&#x27;t stink, doesn&#x27;t stain where it isn&#x27;t supposed to, and gives me a beautiful dark tan :) even in the winter with my ghost white skin it gives me a glow like I&#x27;ve been in Brazil for 10 weeks!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it that often overall, but whenever I DO use it -- I&#x27;m back in Vegas in 2001 and that gaga in love feeling crops up again!  </li>
            <li>I only use it for my face and neck because my arms and legs are fine for me.</li>
            <li>it reminds me of my honeymoon because I used it to look nice and a little thinner, so I associate it with my honeymoon.  </li>
            <li>wait until your skin cools off so it doesn&#x27;t come off with the rubbing), I put regular lotion on my feet, elbows, knees, and hairline of my face so the tanner stayed light in those areas.  </li>
            <li>if anything it fades after a while, just like a real tan would.</li>
            <li>It works real well to add that splash of color on your face</li>
            <li>You can use as much as you&#x27;d like and it gets you to what color you want.</li>
            <li>I am always paranoid to put it straight on my face (that&#x27;s with any self-tanning lotion)</li>
            <li>*Tinted so you can see where it is, but not so much you can&#x27;t leave the house before washing it off  *</li>
            <li>I really like the product...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>As for the smell, it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>The tan looks so real.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t have a self tanner smell at all.</li>
            <li>It has only a light smell contrasted with some others, &amp; the smell seems to fade the longer</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need to tan as much.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>and it really helped my color.</li>
            <li>I would warn not to apply too much of this because you could look a bit orange.</li>
            <li>Blend very well.</li>
            <li>I love you get instant natural looking color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally olive-skinned, so ONCE more before I went to bed, I applied a third coat.</li>
            <li>I would recommend reapplying the sunless tanning lotion every few days to keep a nice tan.</li>
            <li>so when you apply it, its a deep dark brown so its easy to make sure you rub it all in.</li>
            <li>I started off with exfoliated skin and applied twice within 12 hours, then applied to clean skin daily after that and never built up a suntanned look.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff but a little to much glitter</li>
            <li>Makes your skin really soft and it dries fast to keep from coming off on clothes, color also develops fast.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>Easy to cream on; blends well, natural looking color (I use deep dark color), smells nice, not greasy, I use this product instead of body lotion after shaving my legs, it has terrific moisturizing properties.    </li>
            <li>Works as well as high dollar products.  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I think it&#x27;s a high quality self-tanner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, and if you have any questions about it you can always comment on my review</li>
            <li>I highly recommend exfoliating every so often and moisturizing every time before applying this product.</li>
            <li>so this adds a little more to my tan.</li>
            <li>Nice dark tan with only one or two applications.</li>
            <li>Apart from the awful smell and yellowishness, its a pretty good product because it looks more natural (not too natural on me (yet)) than an average self tanning lotion for a good price.</li>
            <li>Also, im yellow right now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many self tanning lotions- mist spray, gel, and pads cheap and expensive ones, this is the only self tanning lotion that gives you a golden tan without streaks, smell and that orangey look.</li>
            <li>I live in MD</li>
            <li>So before I bought something else I trolled Amazon reviews for a new self tanner- after reading and rereading ALOT I decided to give Banana Boat a try...</li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn I guess.</li>
            <li>#34;You trying a new self-tanner?&amp;#34;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I was desperate to find another solution to having glowing beautiful skin even during the winter.</li>
            <li>Oderless, streak-free, and most importantly, NOT ORANGE!</li>
            <li>and I seriously can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Cons: Fades after 2 or 3 showers; does not eliminate freckles or blotches - to cover freckles and blotches for one day, I use Sally Hansen&#x27;s spray-on pantyhose on top of the Banana Boat Self-Tanning Deep Dark lotion.</li>
            <li>just be sure to shake the bottle thoroughly before you open it as the mix separates a little with time&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love tanning despite all of the negative feedback about harmful UV rays causing cancer, aging skin and causing wrinkles at a young age.</li>
            <li>You see real color instantly and it looks natural.  </li>
            <li>It is inexpensive, does not streak and looks completely natural on my skin.</li>
            <li>There is no ORANGE tint to your skin and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>And the color is so natural.  </li>
            <li>i only use it on my face and neck because the rest of my body tans very well.</li>
            <li>I put it on before bed (after exfoliating) and then woke up to a completely natural looking honey-golden tan.</li>
            <li>In between applications, once I get the color I like, I use the Jergens \\&quot;Natural Glow\\&quot; to keep the tan from fading.</li>
            <li>&amp; this one looks so natural and never orange or streaky.</li>
            <li>Everybody I&#x27;ve talked to about this product is so surprised to find out</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a tanning bed because the color this self tanner gives you is sooo natural.  </li>
            <li>If you are going to plan on using this a lot id buy 2 since it will go fast doing your entire body all the time.</li>
            <li>Also it completely blends in the skin leaving no streaks</li>
            <li>so you can wear clothes directly after you apply it.</li>
            <li>You get great dark color instantly, your tan last a few days.</li>
            <li>BUT, if you use them mixed TOGETHER, you get a smooth, LONG LASTING finish!  </li>
            <li>I seriously cant tell you how much I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend doing two coats the first night, and maybe a third coat the second night.</li>
            <li>So the last couple of times I was lazy, I put the cream on but didn&#x27;t take tons of time making sure everything was even...</li>
            <li>Only tanner I have used in 20 years of using them that has a realistic brown color.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, the only thing that bothered me after applying it was the smell, but I understand that there is probably no self tanner in the world that will not smell a little bit.</li>
            <li>*long lasting (can last 5 days easily)  *goes on DARK and looks REAL!  </li>
            <li>I always felt like there was a slight film laying on top of my skin with other things.</li>
            <li>However it is very pricey which has forced me into using it only for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natually SUPER pale</li>
            <li>fresh and self tanners always leave a little tint on your palms and between your fingers, after you shower though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve every used required me to wear gloves or scrub my hands afterwards but with banana boat you can apply with bare hands.  </li>
            <li>I think if I applied this in summer when I&#x27;ve already got a base tan going on, the color would blend more nicely into the skin especially around those dry areas.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give a super harsh color in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>If you use the Jergens ALONE, it&#x27;s not dark enough.  </li>
            <li>and I applied it daily and could barely keep a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I bought the deep dark, and it gives you a very brown looking tan.</li>
            <li>and when I am careful, it looks very natural and lasts for several days!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really has a smell at all, maybe a little bit but not noticeable.</li>

            <li> We can be tan &amp; smell good without the sun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just as good as the $35 bottle of Tan Physics</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and freckles...</li>
            <li> your good.</li>
            <li> I rubbed in on my skin &amp; it isn&#x27;t sticky, it smells sooo good and the scent lingers all day.</li>
            <li> I go through bottles of these during the summer, better than the &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; self tanners out there, and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> But I love it for my body!</li>
            <li> sure you wash your hands afterwards though!</li>
            <li> and it spreads better too!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I will order more!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing...</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING</li>
            <li> no offensive smell, nice fragrance....</li>
            <li> The color is really nice too.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice color, but doesn&#x27;t immediately stain hands if washed.</li>
            <li> Got a couple of nice streaky marks on an off-white tank.</li>
            <li> This is a really good cheap self tanner!</li>
            <li> Unless you like spending money you don&#x27;&#x27;t need to, buy this one and use the money you saved on a really nice lunch.</li>
            <li> and it really is the best out there.</li>

            <li> great product  and very fast delivery</li>
            <li> &quot; the smell is awesome, kind of floral but not strong just pleasant.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re very fair, just go for the lighter one and apply more frequently.</li>
            <li> I really really love this self tanner.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t stink like most self tanning lotions do.</li>
            <li> No streaks - make sure you rub it in.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you rub it in around your elbows, wrists and hairline because thats where it makes it look most orange-ish.</li>
            <li> I cant find it in many stores</li>
            <li> Well it is WAY BETTER than most self tanning lotions</li>
            <li> I found Jergens products better results then</li>
            <li> Definitely the best self tanner out there!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self-tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> when I woke up the next morning I had a wonderful tan!</li>
            <li> my favorite sunless tanning</li>

            <li> I love this tanner.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It goes on better that way.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your hands after, they will turn orange.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I will experiment with some better application techniques to try and get a more blended appearance, so my thoughts on this lotion may change....</li>
            <li> I have tried so many tanning lotions out there</li>
            <li> No nasty smell, no streaking, no \\&quot;muddy\\&quot; color after applying it</li>
            <li> so I was definately pleased to find that this product didn&#x27;t give me any orange tint</li>
            <li> This is ok for winter time</li>
            <li> I completely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it and have reordered many times.</li>
            <li> Tried many products, streaky, orange, flakes ect...</li>
            <li> but for the most part I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the way this works for me</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I was very excited tto read this lotion does not stain or leave an orange/dirty look.</li>
            <li> It gives pretty good color.</li>
            <li> good bottle,worked well thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, if your looking for darker color I would recommend XENTAN.</li>
            <li> pretty good stuff</li>
            <li> and it looked great very natural color.</li>
            <li> for 20% off, free shipping over $25 AND free gifts!    </li>
            <li> this looks so natural and awesome, first application.</li>
            <li> I applied twice before bed, and once the next morning after a shower, and I got the perfect golden brown tan.</li>
            <li> Not blotchy, doesn&#x27;t rub off easily  </li>
            <li> I tan easily and never burn.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, not orange or streaky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleans easily off your hands when you&#x27;re done applying&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lotion is tinted so you can easily tell if it was rubbed in or not.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would highly recommend it as your alternative to sun tanning!!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try it anyway since it was relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> After showering...it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great product overall, might not work for the majority of my skin</li>
            <li> Started on my shins, lightly did the tops of my feet &amp; toes and moved my way up...dried for about 5-10 minutes...</li>
            <li> By the way, my skin is fairly light</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly-</li>
            <li> but I thought it was too light for summer.</li>
            <li> My skin is light tanned and it does give me that sun kissed color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a good product for a good price and the tan does look real.</li>
            <li> one more thing, I HIGHLY recommend washing your hands when finished right away with warm water &amp; soap, your palms will have tanner on them-</li>
            <li> I was very nervous because i have never done self tanners before, but it was very easy to apply and there was no streaks.</li>
            <li> Give great nice tan color for my pale skin, i am looking like after vacation!</li>
            <li> product is very good, but to make it even better and last longer, mix it 50/50 with Jergens Natural Glow Medium/Tan self tanner.  </li>
            <li> I am a 1/4 Japanese and tan nicely in the summer!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more aware of my skin changing...</li>
            <li> -7$. Worth a try!</li>
            <li> Presumably it would have gotten darker with more lotion or more frequent application...</li>
            <li> This by far is the best tanning lotion around, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> After having read all the good reviews, I decided to pick up a bottle locally since it was available at Target.</li>
            <li> After trying pretty much every self tanner imaginable in every price range I can finally say I&#x27;ve found THE BEST!!  </li>
            <li> Specially on my knees, ellbows, knuckles and ankles.</li>
            <li> I am scared of wrinkles, so I don&#x27;t go tanning and where sunscreen nearly every day (all year long), but this stuff is incredible!     </li>
            <li> I had a nice natural looking tan...</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m only fair because I wear sunblock all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this item so I wouldn&#x27;t need to tan in the booths as much because I love to be tan.</li>
            <li> I think it has a pretty strong smell, but I like it -</li>
            <li> This is great because it soaks into my skin similarly to other lotions and does not leave a grimey residue.</li>
            <li> It does not streak, leaves you with a vibrant glow and healthy look.  </li>
            <li> It also dries super quick, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard there pretty cheap at Walmart</li>
            <li> this stuff does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> This budget-friendly self-tanning lotion is actually an incredible deal because unlike some of the expensive tanning lotion brands/products out there, this goes on smoothly, blends exceptionally well, and barely streaks if at all.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with pink undertones, and this tanner looks natural on me.  </li>
            <li> I am not streaked or orange, but merely golden.</li>
            <li> I would reccommend this to anyone looking for a nice, non-streaking tan in a short amount of time!</li>
            <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t sticky and absorbs pretty quick, leaving your skin feeling moisturized and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone, specially since real tanning is damaging your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past 5 years and it looks great on legs and arms.  </li>
            <li> My new fave, cheap too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also light skin with pink undertones but tan super easy.</li>
            <li> Before I put it on, I made sure my skin was clean (but not straight out of the shower--</li>
            <li> First, the price is awesome---I got it at walmart for $6.42.  </li>
            <li> But with this one, no matter how many showers I take after the initial night that I let it soak in, it does not rub off...</li>
            <li> with the first application, just &amp;#34;light to medium&amp;#34; which is what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I am a tanning bed abuser...</li>
            <li> First of all, its a bronzer</li>
            <li> first self tanner</li>
            <li> at first</li>
            <li> so I put it on twice the first day (</li>
            <li> I put lotion on first, and then apply it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone :)</li>
            <li> Gave me an instant glow and more as I applied each day for about 3 days.</li>
            <li> It went on &amp;#34;splotchily&amp;#34; and was more orange than the brown one get from a proper sun tan.  </li>
            <li> I overall LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> so you con see where exactly you are applying it.</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff because of the good reviews and frankly, I just want something I can apply every few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally really pale but tan with a good lotion.</li>
            <li> and it did the trick I feel that glow needed and not to much and no streaking or orange color for me, just the right balance</li>
            <li> Omg love this product smell isn&#x27;t bad and drys pretty quick works great just use gloves</li>
            <li> you have to apply it as quickly as possible and make sure you rub it in very well and then wash your hands immediately</li>
            <li> Even the same brand with the blue label for fair skin...</li>
            <li> this had the best reviews for a self tanner that was reasonably priced since I had never used one before and was skeptical about turning orange.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this lotion a shot after reading all of the positive reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li> I put a thin layer on and it gave me a great glow the next day, after a shower is always better since you smell</li>
            <li> it gets me nice and dark.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and since the lotion itself is a deep brown you can see where your applying the lotion to prevent streaks.</li>
            <li> With other self tanners I used before, after a day or maybe after the second shower I took after using self tanner, they used to kind of rub off on certain parts of my body, so that it looked like I had some kind of skin problems or something, white spots and so on.</li>
            <li> I realized this was drying my skin having snakeskin/scaley look in certain areas of my legs, so I scrubbed the area with my bath sponge and it removed the scaley appearance.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried several self-tanners and have found Banana Boat (Deep Dark) to be the best.  </li>
            <li> If you use the Banana Boat ALONE, it doesn&#x27;t last very long (3 days) AND it can look splotchy (even with good preparation of skin and exfoliation beforehand).  </li>
            <li> I thought it would give me a more of a mocha than honey color based on it being for a deep and dark tan, but I love it so much that I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, dries within a half hour completely, doesn&#x27;t stink, doesn&#x27;t stain where it isn&#x27;t supposed to, and gives me a beautiful dark tan :) even in the winter with my ghost white skin it gives me a glow like I&#x27;ve been in Brazil for 10 weeks!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it that often overall, but whenever I DO use it -- I&#x27;m back in Vegas in 2001 and that gaga in love feeling crops up again!  </li>
            <li> I only use it for my face and neck because my arms and legs are fine for me.</li>
            <li> it reminds me of my honeymoon because I used it to look nice and a little thinner, so I associate it with my honeymoon.  </li>
            <li> wait until your skin cools off so it doesn&#x27;t come off with the rubbing), I put regular lotion on my feet, elbows, knees, and hairline of my face so the tanner stayed light in those areas.  </li>
            <li> if anything it fades after a while, just like a real tan would.</li>
            <li> It works real well to add that splash of color on your face</li>
            <li> You can use as much as you&#x27;d like and it gets you to what color you want.</li>
            <li> I am always paranoid to put it straight on my face (that&#x27;s with any self-tanning lotion)</li>
            <li> *Tinted so you can see where it is, but not so much you can&#x27;t leave the house before washing it off  *</li>
            <li> I really like the product...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> As for the smell, it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> The tan looks so real.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t have a self tanner smell at all.</li>
            <li> It has only a light smell contrasted with some others, &amp; the smell seems to fade the longer</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need to tan as much.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> and it really helped my color.</li>
            <li> I would warn not to apply too much of this because you could look a bit orange.</li>
            <li> Blend very well.</li>
            <li> I love you get instant natural looking color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally olive-skinned, so ONCE more before I went to bed, I applied a third coat.</li>
            <li> I would recommend reapplying the sunless tanning lotion every few days to keep a nice tan.</li>
            <li> so when you apply it, its a deep dark brown so its easy to make sure you rub it all in.</li>
            <li> I started off with exfoliated skin and applied twice within 12 hours, then applied to clean skin daily after that and never built up a suntanned look.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but a little to much glitter</li>
            <li> Makes your skin really soft and it dries fast to keep from coming off on clothes, color also develops fast.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li> Easy to cream on; blends well, natural looking color (I use deep dark color), smells nice, not greasy, I use this product instead of body lotion after shaving my legs, it has terrific moisturizing properties.    </li>
            <li> Works as well as high dollar products.  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I think it&#x27;s a high quality self-tanner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, and if you have any questions about it you can always comment on my review</li>
            <li> I highly recommend exfoliating every so often and moisturizing every time before applying this product.</li>
            <li> so this adds a little more to my tan.</li>
            <li> Nice dark tan with only one or two applications.</li>
            <li> Apart from the awful smell and yellowishness, its a pretty good product because it looks more natural (not too natural on me (yet)) than an average self tanning lotion for a good price.</li>
            <li> Also, im yellow right now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many self tanning lotions- mist spray, gel, and pads cheap and expensive ones, this is the only self tanning lotion that gives you a golden tan without streaks, smell and that orangey look.</li>
            <li> I live in MD</li>
            <li> So before I bought something else I trolled Amazon reviews for a new self tanner- after reading and rereading ALOT I decided to give Banana Boat a try...</li>
            <li> Oh well, live and learn I guess.</li>
            <li> #34;You trying a new self-tanner?&amp;#34;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find another solution to having glowing beautiful skin even during the winter.</li>
            <li> Oderless, streak-free, and most importantly, NOT ORANGE!</li>
            <li> and I seriously can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Cons: Fades after 2 or 3 showers; does not eliminate freckles or blotches - to cover freckles and blotches for one day, I use Sally Hansen&#x27;s spray-on pantyhose on top of the Banana Boat Self-Tanning Deep Dark lotion.</li>
            <li> just be sure to shake the bottle thoroughly before you open it as the mix separates a little with time&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love tanning despite all of the negative feedback about harmful UV rays causing cancer, aging skin and causing wrinkles at a young age.</li>
            <li> You see real color instantly and it looks natural.  </li>
            <li> It is inexpensive, does not streak and looks completely natural on my skin.</li>
            <li> There is no ORANGE tint to your skin and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> And the color is so natural.  </li>
            <li> i only use it on my face and neck because the rest of my body tans very well.</li>
            <li> I put it on before bed (after exfoliating) and then woke up to a completely natural looking honey-golden tan.</li>
            <li> In between applications, once I get the color I like, I use the Jergens \\&quot;Natural Glow\\&quot; to keep the tan from fading.</li>
            <li> &amp; this one looks so natural and never orange or streaky.</li>
            <li> Everybody I&#x27;ve talked to about this product is so surprised to find out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a tanning bed because the color this self tanner gives you is sooo natural.  </li>
            <li> If you are going to plan on using this a lot id buy 2 since it will go fast doing your entire body all the time.</li>
            <li> Also it completely blends in the skin leaving no streaks</li>
            <li> so you can wear clothes directly after you apply it.</li>
            <li> You get great dark color instantly, your tan last a few days.</li>
            <li> BUT, if you use them mixed TOGETHER, you get a smooth, LONG LASTING finish!  </li>
            <li> I seriously cant tell you how much I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend doing two coats the first night, and maybe a third coat the second night.</li>
            <li> So the last couple of times I was lazy, I put the cream on but didn&#x27;t take tons of time making sure everything was even...</li>
            <li> Only tanner I have used in 20 years of using them that has a realistic brown color.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, the only thing that bothered me after applying it was the smell, but I understand that there is probably no self tanner in the world that will not smell a little bit.</li>
            <li> *long lasting (can last 5 days easily)  *goes on DARK and looks REAL!  </li>
            <li> I always felt like there was a slight film laying on top of my skin with other things.</li>
            <li> However it is very pricey which has forced me into using it only for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natually SUPER pale</li>
            <li> fresh and self tanners always leave a little tint on your palms and between your fingers, after you shower though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve every used required me to wear gloves or scrub my hands afterwards but with banana boat you can apply with bare hands.  </li>
            <li> I think if I applied this in summer when I&#x27;ve already got a base tan going on, the color would blend more nicely into the skin especially around those dry areas.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a super harsh color in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> If you use the Jergens ALONE, it&#x27;s not dark enough.  </li>
            <li> and I applied it daily and could barely keep a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought the deep dark, and it gives you a very brown looking tan.</li>
            <li> and when I am careful, it looks very natural and lasts for several days!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really has a smell at all, maybe a little bit but not noticeable.</li>
            <li> I went by the golden rule, shower exfoliate, dry off completely then cream all areas that have thin skin and/or bending parts (elbows, knees, toes, heels, wrists, fingers &amp; nail beds)</li>
            <li> Becoming difficult to find.</li>
            <li> The only cons are that it rubs off after its been on too long, and it streaks if you dont rub it in all the way.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected if you&#x27;re not careful when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Lasts Long, deep color.</li>
            <li> I live in California, so I see real tans ALL THE TIME, and seriously: This stuff looks LEGIT!    </li>
            <li> I have really fair, thin skin and having color is tough for me.</li>
            <li> I apply regular lotion and let that dry for about 30 minutes before I apply the self tanner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wear white the first day you put it on - never a good idea, I don&#x27;t care what the reviews say.</li>
            <li> I love to build this up to get a dark tan and it lasts for quite a while, a few days at least.</li>
            <li> I have tried A LOT of sunless tanning items, and only Banana Boat&#x27;s Deep Dark sunless tanning lotion did the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Jergens sunless tanner and Hemp sunless moisturizer and neither one gave me instant dark color like this product...and neither gave me deep of a color - even gradually.</li>
            <li> I did get some minor streak-age around my wrists and on my feet</li>
            <li> People cannot tell that it&#x27;s not a natural tan.  </li>
            <li> so it still lasts you a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish I had heard of this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Other than that it did give me some color, just not enough.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and sit around for about 10 min for it to dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> This seems to dry my skin</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a big deal when you don&#x27;t want to go through the trouble twice a week, plus you aren&#x27;t exposing yourself to continually topically applying whatever parabens or chemicals are contained in the product(s)</li>
            <li> I tried several other types, and they didn&#x27;t get dark enough.  </li>
            <li> applied a single coat of the stuff all over, including my face.</li>
            <li> The only thing is you have to be careful about getting it on your hands/palms &amp; it smells like tanning lotion but not that bad :)</li>
            <li> I went to my local Target and picked up a bottle for around $6...more product and less money then</li>
            <li> I could not live without it!</li>
            <li> so i do a little squirt and a pump of my regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as most of them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell is potent but could be a lot worse.&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad self tanner for the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different self tanning lotions and they have all smelled.</li>
            <li> I expected the tanner to somewhat lighten up the stretch marks</li>
            <li> Apply minimally until you&#x27;ve reached desired color.</li>
            <li> the other reviewers said that the smell only lasts a little while.</li>
            <li> I let it dry a half hour before I dress.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t look pale one night then really dark the next morning.</li>
            <li> (other sunless tanners sometimes do this)  </li>
            <li> Doesnt look fake or orange and pretty fool proof.</li>
            <li> I did feel like I had to apply it every other day tho when the bottle just says 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> Before i felt so awkward because my face was obviously that much lighter than the rest of my body</li>
            <li> Any other &#x27;dark&#x27; self tanner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a ballroom dancer, and I need something dark for those skimpy Latin costumes.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, I used to use Loreal Sublime Bronze, but that one isn&#x27;t as dark and is a bit orange.     </li>
            <li> I purchased this item for medium to dark skin</li>
            <li> It seems to last through at least one shower, with some slight effect even after two showers</li>
            <li> or your hands will be slightly stained for a day or two.</li>
            <li> It Black</li>
            <li> It still shows up as slightly orange on my skin, but less so than others I&#x27;ve tried &amp; the comments from others are always, &amp;#34;You&#x27;ve been getting some sun!&amp;#34; and not &amp;</li>
            <li> It comes off on my clothes less than some others.  </li>
            <li> A little dark for my face.</li>
            <li> It smells a little ipon application</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s always missing at the store, even when all the other Banana Boat products are there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and its heavy on the skin..</li>
            <li> There were a few times</li>
            <li> I have been pale - to orange - to not knowing what my race is anymore</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this would work if your pale wanting to be tan.</li>
            <li> I was worried this wouldn&#x27;t be as deep dark as promised, but alas it IS!</li>
            <li> Only con is that it smells a little weird when it sets in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive on this site because of the shipping fee so see if you can get it at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> and I usually wear foundations in the ivory range.</li>
            <li> I had weird white leopard spots after using this.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used it for the past couple of years and when I was cleaning out my drawer in my bathroom</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for some reason, when you see a Banana Boat product collection/display at a drug store like Walgreens or CVS, they usually don&#x27;t have THIS product.  </li>
            <li> Did not smell horrible as many others do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t apply it too often because it takes a while to dry, annnnd because the slow, tedious process of applying it to your skin is not fun when you&#x27;re feeling lazy.</li>
            <li> It came in time but when you apply it it came off very uneven and streaky and orange even though that I exfoliated and shaved an hour before.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m very pale.</li>
            <li> and i always use sunblock so it was hard to get it even.</li>
            <li> I put this on my face since that&#x27;s the one place that&#x27;s hard for me to tan</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores because it&#x27;s usually sold out!</li>
            <li> I was not sure I would like this less expensive lotion, but it worked as well as the department store brands I am used to.  </li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> Patchy, streaky, orange, smelly crap just like every other tanner.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product does look orange on me.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt make you look fake.</li>
            <li> As with any tanner, your hands will be disgusting the next day if you don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tell them my secret!  </li>
            <li> Since the Wal-mart by me didn&#x27;t sell it (which the next day I went in a found out they did, its a grocery store, but their website is horrible)</li>
            <li> No more nasty tanner smell!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already obsessed and addicted!!!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of spray tans and self tanning lotions/sprays because of the fear of turning orange or having streaks.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t bad, maybe just the slightest hint of orange.</li>
            <li> I put in on my foot to test it because I&#x27;ve heard bad things about these types of products</li>
            <li> I am still shocked I look tan.</li>
            <li> Cons:  Causes my face to breakout. :(</li>
            <li> I already have a base tan</li>
            <li> AWFUL smell</li>
            <li> I am also blown away by it not having that nasty fake-tan smell!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best self-tanning lotion out there. Becoming difficult to find. I love you get instant natural looking color and it develops to an even darker color over time. I go through bottles of these during the summer, better than the &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; self tanners out there, and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanner!!!  First, the price is awesome---I got it at walmart for $6.42.  It is oderless!!!!  Thank goodness!  No more nasty tanner smell!  I have very fair skin with pink undertones, and this tanner looks natural on me.  I tried several other types, and they didn&#x27;t get dark enough.  I&#x27;m a ballroom dancer, and I need something dark for those skimpy Latin costumes.  This one did the trick!  It has a bronzer so you can see where you&#x27;re putting it, and it goes on flawlessly.  Before I put it on, I made sure my skin was clean (but not straight out of the shower--wait until your skin cools off so it doesn&#x27;t come off with the rubbing), I put regular lotion on my feet, elbows, knees, and hairline of my face so the tanner stayed light in those areas.  Then, I put the sunless tanner on my legs.  Washed/scrubbed my hands.  Put it on my back and stomach.  Washed/scrubbed my hands.  Face.  Arms.  Washed/scrubbed my hands.  Then, I put a dot on the back of one of my hands and rubbed the backs of my hands and wrists together.  Then, walk around naked for 15-30 minutes.  I have a flawless tan!  This is the best tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this after mistaking it for another Banana Boat product I heard about on sunless.com. I decided to try it anyway since it was relatively cheap. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I showered and exfoliated and moisturixed, pre-tan, because no self-tanner works properly unless you \\&quot;prep\\&quot; your skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I applied a single coat of the stuff all over, including my face. Waited three hours and applied a second coat. I&#x27;m naturally olive-skinned, so ONCE more before I went to bed, I applied a third coat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The next morning I woke up. I looked in the mirror and screamed- I looked orange, but it turned out to just be the color guide for applying. After showering...it looks fantastic. I am not streaked or orange, but merely golden. It gives pretty good color. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re olive skinned I would recommend doing two coats the first night, and maybe a third coat the second night. Just keep applying every night till you reach your desired darkness, then apply 1-2 times a week to maintain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!!</li>
            <li> I really really love this self tanner. It is inexpensive, does not streak and looks completely natural on my skin. With other self tanners I used before, after a day or maybe after the second shower I took after using self tanner, they used to kind of rub off on certain parts of my body, so that it looked like I had some kind of skin problems or something, white spots and so on. But with this one, no matter how many showers I take after the initial night that I let it soak in, it does not rub off...if anything it fades after a while, just like a real tan would. It is easy to apply, the only thing that bothered me after applying it was the smell, but I understand that there is probably no self tanner in the world that will not smell a little bit. After taking a shower the next morning, the smell was gone anyway. I apply regular lotion and let that dry for about 30 minutes before I apply the self tanner. Specially on my knees, ellbows, knuckles and ankles. It comes out perfectly even and doesnt look orangy at all.  I would recommend this product to anyone, specially since real tanning is damaging your skin.  Great product. Great price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product 1. Because it had a lot of good reviews 2. Because I&#x27;m very pale. It came in time but when you apply it it came off very uneven and streaky and orange even though that I exfoliated and shaved an hour before. NOT HAPPY AT ALL!! *RETURN*</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried several self-tanners and have found Banana Boat (Deep Dark) to be the best.  It does not streak, leaves you with a vibrant glow and healthy look.  There is no ORANGE tint to your skin and it looks natural. It gives you the opportunity to look darker it depends on how often you choose to apply it! I love this product and would highly recommend it as your alternative to sun tanning!!!</li>
            <li> I have really fair, thin skin and having color is tough for me. Unfortunately, this product does look orange on me. That&#x27;s not to say it doesn&#x27;t give others great color and a nice glow. It works real well to add that splash of color on your face and it doesn&#x27;t stink like most self tanning lotions do. It goes on easy and since the lotion itself is a deep brown you can see where your applying the lotion to prevent streaks. Makes your skin really soft and it dries fast to keep from coming off on clothes, color also develops fast. Great product overall, might not work for the majority of my skin but I&#x27;m still using it on my face!</li>
            <li> I was not sure I would like this less expensive lotion, but it worked as well as the department store brands I am used to.  It was also not &amp;#34;deep dark&amp;#34; with the first application, just &amp;#34;light to medium&amp;#34; which is what I wanted.  Presumably it would have gotten darker with more lotion or more frequent application...no offensive smell, nice fragrance....I would choose it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this before I went to Florida in February.  I live in MD and I don&#x27;t use tanning beds so I decided to go this route so my legs wouldn&#x27;t be so white!  I am a 1/4 Japanese and tan nicely in the summer!  This is however the best product I have ever used and it  gave me great results in about 2 days.  No streaks - make sure you rub it in.  And the color is so natural.  I am going to order a pack of three and not sit on the beach for 4 hours and bake myself.  I didn&#x27;t use it on my face so I can&#x27;t comment on how it works there....  But I love it for my body!</li>
            <li> I have used a LOT of tanning lotions, and this one is the best. It gets you tan and it doesnt make you look fake. You can use as much as you&#x27;d like and it gets you to what color you want. I was VERY white &amp; within 2 days i looked like I had gone to florida for a WEEK! The only cons are that it rubs off after its been on too long, and it streaks if you dont rub it in all the way. It also makes your hands look like you had been working in the garden all day. Make sure you rub it in around your elbows, wrists and hairline because thats where it makes it look most orange-ish. This by far is the best tanning lotion around, especially for the price. I cant find it in many stores so I order mine online! I would reccommend this to anyone looking for a nice, non-streaking tan in a short amount of time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I am a tanning bed abuser...I love tanning despite all of the negative feedback about harmful UV rays causing cancer, aging skin and causing wrinkles at a young age. I was desperate to find another solution to having glowing beautiful skin even during the winter. I was very skeptical of spray tans and self tanning lotions/sprays because of the fear of turning orange or having streaks. I decided to give this lotion a shot after reading all of the positive reviews on amazon. This product is absolutely amazing...after ONE application I was so happy I almost cried. I had a nice natural looking tan...the lotion spread evenly all over my body and I didn&#x27;t have any streaks. The only downfall to the lotion applies to all tanning lotions....you have to apply it as quickly as possible and make sure you rub it in very well and then wash your hands immediately or your hands will be slightly stained for a day or two. And obviously you&#x27;ll need someone else to apply the lotion on your back. The color lasted for about a week with only one application. I use it twice a week and it works wonderfully and I said goodbye to my hollywood tans membership.</li>
            <li> I was very excited tto read this lotion does not stain or leave an orange/dirty look. Well it is WAY BETTER than most self tanning lotions but it has the odor to it, too. I tried to hide it by putting on Designer Skin&#x27;s Paint It Black 50X ( since it smells SOOO good) and I could manage it a bit but still, I CAN SMELL IT. Also, im yellow right now.  Not orange. But yellow. Im olive skinned and now looking  a bit yellowish but Im gonna apply it tonight as well and see what happens. Apart from the awful smell and yellowishness, its a pretty good product because it looks more natural (not too natural on me (yet)) than an average self tanning lotion for a good price. I would recommend it if you can find a solution for the smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff will leave you orangey. I would not bother with this stuff. I found Jergens products better results then this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and it works well for me.  It is like instant color.  You need to wear gloves when putting it on or you will have stained hands.</li>
            <li> It looked muddy to me.  and its heavy on the skin.. but it works, after 3 hrs you can shower and still have color..</li>
            <li> I have tried A LOT of sunless tanning items, and only Banana Boat&#x27;s Deep Dark sunless tanning lotion did the trick. Oderless, streak-free, and most importantly, NOT ORANGE! I applied twice before bed, and once the next morning after a shower, and I got the perfect golden brown tan. Definitely the best self tanner out there!</li>
            <li> I have tried all the self tanners out there. I have been pale - to orange - to not knowing what my race is anymore lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one tanner I do recommend though! First of all, its a bronzer so when you apply it, its a deep dark brown so its easy to make sure you rub it all in. It also dries super quick, which is a plus. The color is really nice too. I am always paranoid to put it straight on my face (that&#x27;s with any self-tanning lotion) so i do a little squirt and a pump of my regular lotion. mix it all together, and rub it in all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you wash your hands afterwards though! As with any tanner, your hands will be disgusting the next day if you don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Gives a nice color, but doesn&#x27;t immediately stain hands if washed. Works as well as high dollar products.  Not stinky.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self-tanning lotion.  You see real color instantly and it looks natural.  It&#x27;s my go-to for self-tanners.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and sit around for about 10 min for it to dry. Go to bed and wake up to a tan face. i only use it on my face and neck because the rest of my body tans very well. So people have been complimenting me on my tan and it makes me feel good. Before i felt so awkward because my face was obviously that much lighter than the rest of my body and i always use sunblock so it was hard to get it even.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but a little to much glitter so I mix it with my lotion and it spreads better too!</li>
            <li> This budget-friendly self-tanning lotion is actually an incredible deal because unlike some of the expensive tanning lotion brands/products out there, this goes on smoothly, blends exceptionally well, and barely streaks if at all.  I did get some minor streak-age around my wrists and on my feet/ankles but that&#x27;s to be expected if you&#x27;re not careful when you apply it. I don&#x27;t apply it too often because it takes a while to dry, annnnd because the slow, tedious process of applying it to your skin is not fun when you&#x27;re feeling lazy. Don&#x27;t wear white the first day you put it on - never a good idea, I don&#x27;t care what the reviews say. Got a couple of nice streaky marks on an off-white tank. Nonetheless, I think it&#x27;s a high quality self-tanner.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past 5 years and it looks great on legs and arms.  A little dark for my face.</li>
            <li> Love Banana Boat Summer Color Self Tanning Lotion is wonderful! I could not live without it!</li>
            <li> Every year I say I&#x27;m NOT going in the sun but this year I meant it! I&#x27;m also light skin with pink undertones but tan super easy. As I&#x27;m getting older I&#x27;m more aware of my skin changing...first self tanner I bought this year was by Neutrogena- uhgggg I used it for 2 weeks- GREAT color, AWFUL smell and I was itchy ALL the time! So before I bought something else I trolled Amazon reviews for a new self tanner- after reading and rereading ALOT I decided to give Banana Boat a try...I went to my local Target and picked up a bottle for around $6...more product and less money then Neutrogena- at first I thought, \\&quot;nooooooooo, it can&#x27;t be this easy\\&quot; the smell is awesome, kind of floral but not strong just pleasant. I went by the golden rule, shower exfoliate, dry off completely then cream all areas that have thin skin and/or bending parts (elbows, knees, toes, heels, wrists, fingers &amp; nail beds) I use Nivea CREAM. Started on my shins, lightly did the tops of my feet &amp; toes and moved my way up...dried for about 5-10 minutes...when I woke up the next morning I had a wonderful tan! I do this about 2-3 times a week. I love this stuff! So the last couple of times I was lazy, I put the cream on but didn&#x27;t take tons of time making sure everything was even...this stuff does exactly what it says! NO streaks! Everything blended! AND NO ITCHING! I&#x27;m so amazed with this product- I&#x27;ll continue to buy &amp; use it thru winter on my legs &amp; arms- OH one more thing, I HIGHLY recommend washing your hands when finished right away with warm water &amp; soap, your palms will have tanner on them- Good Luck People! We can be tan &amp; smell good without the sun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.6.2014 UPDATE: YUPYUPYUP! Still LOVE this stuff!!! still smelling good and tan :o)</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff because of the good reviews and frankly, I just want something I can apply every few days and that&#x27;s that.     Well, I actually ordered this off [...] for 20% off, free shipping over $25 AND free gifts!    I was worried this wouldn&#x27;t be as deep dark as promised, but alas it IS! I am still shocked I look tan. I am scared of wrinkles, so I don&#x27;t go tanning and where sunscreen nearly every day (all year long), but this stuff is incredible!     I live in California, so I see real tans ALL THE TIME, and seriously: This stuff looks LEGIT!    I&#x27;ll prob post some photos of my skin before and after soon :D   But anyways here is a short lists of Pros about this product:  *long lasting (can last 5 days easily)  *goes on DARK and looks REAL!  *Tinted so you can see where it is, but not so much you can&#x27;t leave the house before washing it off  *Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (other sunless tanners sometimes do this)  *Not blotchy, doesn&#x27;t rub off easily  *Affordable!   Cons:  Causes my face to breakout. :( If they had a face version of this product it would be ***PERFECT!***    Anyways, I used to use Loreal Sublime Bronze, but that one isn&#x27;t as dark and is a bit orange.     This is def. my favorite sunless tanning product~!!! :D I highly recommend this, and if you have any questions about it you can always comment on my review lol. :D</li>
            <li> There is nothing better than this. This is THE best wipe-on tan on the market.  It has great, natural-looking color which lasts for a couple of days.  People cannot tell that it&#x27;s not a natural tan.  My legs really look great.    Pros: Easy to cream on; blends well, natural looking color (I use deep dark color), smells nice, not greasy, I use this product instead of body lotion after shaving my legs, it has terrific moisturizing properties.    Cons: Fades after 2 or 3 showers; does not eliminate freckles or blotches - to cover freckles and blotches for one day, I use Sally Hansen&#x27;s spray-on pantyhose on top of the Banana Boat Self-Tanning Deep Dark lotion.</li>
            <li> great sun product, found out about on youtube and decided to try. Give great nice tan color for my pale skin, i am looking like after vacation! so happy!</li>
            <li> I really like the product...it gets me nice and dark. I already have a base tan so this adds a little more to my tan. It&#x27;s too expensive on this site because of the shipping fee so see if you can get it at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> This product is the best and the cheepest self-tanner I&#x27;ve tried so far. I put it on before bed (after exfoliating) and then woke up to a completely natural looking honey-golden tan. I thought it would give me a more of a mocha than honey color based on it being for a deep and dark tan, but I love it so much that I don&#x27;t mind. This product has the best smell of feel of any tanner I&#x27;ve tried so far. I always felt like there was a slight film laying on top of my skin with other things. This is great because it soaks into my skin similarly to other lotions and does not leave a grimey residue. I am also blown away by it not having that nasty fake-tan smell! I can&#x27;t believe this is such a bargan product! By the way, my skin is fairly light and I usually wear foundations in the ivory range. However, I&#x27;m only fair because I wear sunblock all the time. I tan easily and never burn.</li>
            <li> great seller, recommended</li>
            <li> This is a really good cheap self tanner! You get great dark color instantly, your tan last a few days. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I had weird white leopard spots after using this. LOVE the light/med. My whitey skin can&#x27;t adjust to this one. If you&#x27;re very fair, just go for the lighter one and apply more frequently.</li>
            <li> I started using this product years ago while I was looking for a way to get tan and I had no time to lay in the sun. I hadn&#x27;t used it for the past couple of years and when I was cleaning out my drawer in my bathroom I found it again. I decided to try it again as I wanted to wear a sundress for Easter. It worked GREAT!!! I have been told how wonderful my tan looks and even asked if I have been going tanning. I have a olive tone to my skin so I put it on twice the first day (once in the morning and once in the evening) and then put it on again the next morning. I don&#x27;t use it on my face, I use a seperate make up bronzer there. In between applications, once I get the color I like, I use the Jergens \\&quot;Natural Glow\\&quot; to keep the tan from fading. I would recommend reapplying the sunless tanning lotion every few days to keep a nice tan. As for the smell, it doesn&#x27;t really bother me. I have tried a few different self tanning lotions and they have all smelled. I did find like the other reviewers said that the smell only lasts a little while.</li>
            <li> I love this tanner. It&#x27;s quick, dries within a half hour completely, doesn&#x27;t stink, doesn&#x27;t stain where it isn&#x27;t supposed to, and gives me a beautiful dark tan :) even in the winter with my ghost white skin it gives me a glow like I&#x27;ve been in Brazil for 10 weeks!!!</li>
            <li> I use this lotion a lot!  Since I stopped going to the tanning salon , I picked up this lotion instead!  My friends are constantly commenting on how tan I am!  Lol.  I don&#x27;t tell them my secret!  I love it!  Buy it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The tan looks so real. Plus it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as most of them. I bought the deep dark, and it gives you a very brown looking tan. I put lotion on first, and then apply it. It goes on better that way. Make sure you wash your hands after, they will turn orange.</li>
            <li> works well however color is somewhat too orange for my pleasure</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for medium to dark skin and I applied it daily and could barely keep a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;. I started off with exfoliated skin and applied twice within 12 hours, then applied to clean skin daily after that and never built up a suntanned look. Other than that it did give me some color, just not enough.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t specifically order this from amazon, but I have bought it from my local grocery store. It doesn&#x27;t give a super harsh color in a short amount of time. You don&#x27;t look pale one night then really dark the next morning. But you can tell a difference. I love to build this up to get a dark tan and it lasts for quite a while, a few days at least. It is very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t have a self tanner smell at all. I don&#x27;t think it really has a smell at all, maybe a little bit but not noticeable. I would definitely recommend this to anyone :)</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  To my mind it&#x27;s just as good as the $35 bottle of Tan Physics I also purchased.  Unless you like spending money you don&#x27;&#x27;t need to, buy this one and use the money you saved on a really nice lunch.</li>
            <li> great product  and very fast delivery</li>
            <li> Only tanner I have used in 20 years of using them that has a realistic brown color. It smells a little ipon application but once it dries it goes away.</li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t like the smell.  Some people say it smells like bananas.  One reviewer says it has NO smell.  I think it has a pretty strong smell, but I like it - it reminds me of my honeymoon because I used it to look nice and a little thinner, so I associate it with my honeymoon.  I don&#x27;t use it that often overall, but whenever I DO use it -- I&#x27;m back in Vegas in 2001 and that gaga in love feeling crops up again!  Scents do that, you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for some reason, when you see a Banana Boat product collection/display at a drug store like Walgreens or CVS, they usually don&#x27;t have THIS product.  I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s always missing at the store, even when all the other Banana Boat products are there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good, but to make it even better and last longer, mix it 50/50 with Jergens Natural Glow Medium/Tan self tanner.  If you use the Jergens ALONE, it&#x27;s not dark enough.  If you use the Banana Boat ALONE, it doesn&#x27;t last very long (3 days) AND it can look splotchy (even with good preparation of skin and exfoliation beforehand).  BUT, if you use them mixed TOGETHER, you get a smooth, LONG LASTING finish!  Instead of lasting 3 days, it lasts 5-6 days.  That&#x27;s a big deal when you don&#x27;t want to go through the trouble twice a week, plus you aren&#x27;t exposing yourself to continually topically applying whatever parabens or chemicals are contained in the product(s) twice a week...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  I would like to see Banana Boat get with the program and remove all the parabens so they don&#x27;t \\&quot;miss the boat.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Patchy, streaky, orange, smelly crap just like every other tanner. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. Did not smell horrible as many others do. Gave me an instant glow and more as I applied each day for about 3 days. I workout A LOT and it never once came off on my clothes! I&#x27;m talking LOTS of sweat sessions! I will order more!</li>
            <li> I do like this sunless tanner, but I still keep running back to St. Tropez bronzing mousse. I have used St.Tropez bronzing mousse for years and it really is the best out there. However it is very pricey which has forced me into using it only for special occasions. I wanted to find something that was inexpensive and could use it on a weekly basis. The color isn&#x27;t bad, maybe just the slightest hint of orange. It&#x27;s slightly obvious I&#x27;ve got on sunless tanner, especially on my hands and wrist. I think if I applied this in summer when I&#x27;ve already got a base tan going on, the color would blend more nicely into the skin especially around those dry areas. I will experiment with some better application techniques to try and get a more blended appearance, so my thoughts on this lotion may change.... I say just go for it and spend the money on this. You might as well try it and then you&#x27;ll never be left wondering. If you don&#x27;t like it then oh well who cares, you&#x27;re only out 6-7$. Worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many tanning lotions out there &amp; this one looks so natural and never orange or streaky. I am only wanting to buy this stuff. The only thing is you have to be careful about getting it on your hands/palms &amp; it smells like tanning lotion but not that bad :)</li>
            <li> good bottle,worked well thanks!</li>
            <li> After trying pretty much every self tanner imaginable in every price range I can finally say I&#x27;ve found THE BEST!!  No nasty smell, no streaking, no \\&quot;muddy\\&quot; color after applying it and it actaully gives a LOT of color that LASTS.  Everybody I&#x27;ve talked to about this product is so surprised to find out I don&#x27;t use a tanning bed because the color this self tanner gives you is sooo natural.  This is also the only self tanner that I&#x27;ve used where I don&#x27;t have a problem with getting darker splotches on my knees and even my feet don&#x27;t get that &#x27;self tanner&#x27; look.  This lotion isn&#x27;t sticky and absorbs pretty quick, leaving your skin feeling moisturized and fresh.  It has a nice caramel color so you can see where you&#x27;ve applied it and it blends in great so it doesn&#x27;t look like you have self tanner on.  I&#x27;m natually SUPER pale so I was definately pleased to find that this product didn&#x27;t give me any orange tint what so ever.  Any other &#x27;dark&#x27; self tanner I&#x27;ve every used required me to wear gloves or scrub my hands afterwards but with banana boat you can apply with bare hands.  This stuff is AMAZING and I seriously can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I put in on my foot to test it because I&#x27;ve heard bad things about these types of products and I should have listened to what I heard:  It went on &amp;#34;splotchily&amp;#34; and was more orange than the brown one get from a proper sun tan.  Oh well, live and learn I guess.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, not orange or streaky.&lt;br /&gt;It does take several coats to make you noticeably tanner.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot in the bottle though so it still lasts you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is potent but could be a lot worse.&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad self tanner for the price.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find the perfect self-tanner but this has been the closest so far:&lt;br /&gt;* It goes on smoothly- just be sure to shake the bottle thoroughly before you open it as the mix separates a little with time&lt;br /&gt;* It has only a light smell contrasted with some others, &amp; the smell seems to fade the longer it&#x27;s on&lt;br /&gt;* It cleans easily off your hands when you&#x27;re done applying&lt;br /&gt;* It still shows up as slightly orange on my skin, but less so than others I&#x27;ve tried &amp; the comments from others are always, &amp;#34;You&#x27;ve been getting some sun!&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;You trying a new self-tanner?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;* It comes off on my clothes less than some others.  I let it dry a half hour before I dress.  It only seems to rub off on white clothes if I&#x27;m sweating in them,&lt;br /&gt;* It seems to last through at least one shower, with some slight effect even after two showers</li>
            <li> I was very nervous because i have never done self tanners before, but it was very easy to apply and there was no streaks. The lotion is tinted so you can easily tell if it was rubbed in or not. It did not turn me orange at all. I showered and shaved after waiting 3 hours and the tanner still stayed on!</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and freckles... I don&#x27;t tan, just get red. I&#x27;ve tried every self tanner out there.. Even the same brand with the blue label for fair skin... This one is the best.  It doesnt streak.. Takes a while to fade.. Only con is that it smells a little weird when it sets in.  I overall LOVE this product. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores because it&#x27;s usually sold out!</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever tried will always use this great coverage no streaking</li>
            <li> I bought this item so I wouldn&#x27;t need to tan in the booths as much because I love to be tan. I put a thin layer on and it gave me a great glow the next day, after a shower is always better since you smell fresh and self tanners always leave a little tint on your palms and between your fingers, after you shower though your good. I put this on my face since that&#x27;s the one place that&#x27;s hard for me to tan and it looked great very natural color. Since I&#x27;m already tan this works great I don&#x27;t know how this would work if your pale wanting to be tan. I&#x27;m naturally really pale but tan with a good lotion. Like I said I&#x27;m using this for the upkeep of my tan so I don&#x27;t need to tan as much. Great product I would recommend! If you are going to plan on using this a lot id buy 2 since it will go fast doing your entire body all the time. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, if your looking for darker color I would recommend XENTAN. This is ok for winter time but I thought it was too light for summer.</li>
            <li> I completely love this product. My skin is light tanned and it does give me that sun kissed color. Also it completely blends in the skin leaving no streaks + it has a color so you con see where exactly you are applying it. I totally recomend this product!</li>
            <li> pretty good stuff thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help cover up the stretch marks on my stomach from my pregnancy.  I expected the tanner to somewhat lighten up the stretch marks but this product didn&#x27;t work at all for that.  Actually, the product wasn&#x27;t noticable at all after I applied several layers.</li>
            <li> Omg love this product smell isn&#x27;t bad and drys pretty quick works great just use gloves so u don&#x27;t stain your hands will be buying again I&#x27;ve heard there pretty cheap at Walmart so I&#x27;ll check that out if needed sooner while I wait for orders bein shipped</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I rubbed in on my skin &amp; it isn&#x27;t sticky, it smells sooo good and the scent lingers all day. d: I actually wore clothes after I rubbed it into my skin and it didn&#x27;t affect the tan or lotion in any way so you can wear clothes directly after you apply it. The tan showed in two hours and didn&#x27;t come off in the shower either. I love it. It&#x27;s such a good product for a good price and the tan does look real.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many self tanning lotions- mist spray, gel, and pads cheap and expensive ones, this is the only self tanning lotion that gives you a golden tan without streaks, smell and that orangey look. I love it and have reordered many times.</li>
            <li> I seriously cant tell you how much I LOVE this stuff.  Tried many products, streaky, orange, flakes ect... this looks so natural and awesome, first application. Doesnt look fake or orange and pretty fool proof. My new fave, cheap too. I&#x27;m already obsessed and addicted!!!</li>
            <li> this had the best reviews for a self tanner that was reasonably priced since I had never used one before and was skeptical about turning orange. Since the Wal-mart by me didn&#x27;t sell it (which the next day I went in a found out they did, its a grocery store, but their website is horrible) I bought it online and it really helped my color. There were a few times my b/f told me I looked a lil orange but for the most part I wasn&#x27;t. I did feel like I had to apply it every other day tho when the bottle just says 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> Wish I had heard of this product a long time ago. I have been using it ever since I got it and when I am careful, it looks very natural and lasts for several days! YIPPIE!!!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the way this works for me I am med faired skin and needed some color and it did the trick I feel that glow needed and not to much and no streaking or orange color for me, just the right balance I only use it for my face and neck because my arms and legs are fine for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Jergens sunless tanner and Hemp sunless moisturizer and neither one gave me instant dark color like this product...and neither gave me deep of a color - even gradually. I am pleased with this product. After having read all the good reviews, I decided to pick up a bottle locally since it was available at Target. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 3 weeks. I would warn not to apply too much of this because you could look a bit orange. Apply minimally until you&#x27;ve reached desired color. Blend very well. I highly recommend exfoliating every so often and moisturizing every time before applying this product. This seems to dry my skin so I use the Hemp sunless tanner on days I don&#x27;t apply this. I think 1-2 times weekly use of this product would be sufficient. I realized this was drying my skin having snakeskin/scaley look in certain areas of my legs, so I scrubbed the area with my bath sponge and it removed the scaley appearance.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I think this is a very good sunless tanner that doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> Nice dark tan with only one or two applications.</li>
            <li> Lasts Long, deep color. However, deep color stains your hands while applying.. Wash thoroughly after. I&#x27;ve been a religious user for years now! Love it</li>
