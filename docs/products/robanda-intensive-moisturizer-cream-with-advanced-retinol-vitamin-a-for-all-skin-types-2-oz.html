            <li>Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used too.</li>
            <li>It was great.  </li>
            <li>She was happy with  the results as well.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the moisturizer, the scent is pleasant, and does a wonderful job on the face and neck area...</li>
            <li>It was my good fortune to find it here at Amazon</li>
            <li>It feels good, let&#x27;s see how it works.</li>
            <li>My pores are refined, my skin is smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li>It does not smell good.</li>
            <li>Good Product.  </li>
            <li>My husband said it smells like something his grandma used which I responded his grandma was a wise woman.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, both here and in the UK and it feels amazing!</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, mild scent, and feels good on the face.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a reduction in eye puffness &amp; fine lines!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cream, it&#x27;s not greasy at all, absorbs very fast and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>When I returned to purchase more, it could not be found.</li>
            <li>but the cost is quite a bit more.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product line for many years (10+).</li>
            <li>Now I need more</li>
            <li>Love this cream....</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>Would love to review this</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I still love it, and hope that they will consider repackaging it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my face gets more greasy/ shiny during the day since I&#x27;ve started using this product.</li>
            <li>i love the way this cream smoothes onto my skin.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that it also moisturize my skin which always get dry and itchy during the winter.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with retinol and the change it made in the first 48 hrs was incredible.</li>
            <li>I think that if this product were better packaged it would be far more effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be best packaged in an airtight, opaque pump system like what Green Cream comes in.</li>
            <li>I do like the way it makes my face feel (smooth and hydrated).  </li>
            <li>When I first used the product, I found my face was more shiny/ oily during the day; but now, that&#x27;s not the case.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous creams, and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>The slight  scent of this  face cream is light and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Her skin looks smooth and fresh and the under eye lines are dramatically improved.     </li>
            <li>It leaves a nice soft .</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The price point is great compared to those other brands.</li>
            <li>I tried many creams before such as,bare rnerals, clinique and ester lauder, all cost a fortune, and this one gives me much better results.</li>
            <li>If you are dry skin challenged, I really recommend this product as a great solution</li>
            <li>Most importantly I see great results after using it for only a few days</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m quite pleased with the cream so far.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before , so I am reordering it because it seems to work better than  many other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Since then, I have purchased other Robanda products and found them to be ,a good investment for my skin care.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product, and you&#x27;ll won&#x27;t have to buy the more expensive lines of creams.</li>
            <li>First found this at another store and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>I was trying so many different ones that I could afford anyway.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands but this one with its simplicity and high level of pure retinol  does what it is supposed to do- remove fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Most seem to just sit on top, and not really moisturize, but this one goes deep into my skin, and really makes a difference!</li>
            <li>This is the first cream that I have used that I can really see a difference.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I had to overlook the cost difference.  </li>
            <li>Bit pricy but works really well.  </li>
            <li>This product really delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from it</li>
            <li>but it really helped after like two or three weeks.</li>
            <li>He says his skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li>I have Really dry flaky skin that seems easily irritated</li>
            <li>but already I noticed my skin is more hydrated, its a lot softer and the wrinkles seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anything from Robanda.</li>
            <li>This brand is highly under-rated.</li>
            <li>This would be a miracle product if they just put a little more into the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just sinks in and my skin Is smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY OLD</li>
            <li>This is the first one that I&#x27;m noticing a difference in the severity of my wrinkles, especially around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>A huge waste of money - do not fall for the product claims as it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I have only been using for a week so really don&#x27;t know how to rate this item.  </li>
            <li>(I am 43 years old.)</li>
            <li>I am 29 and I use this at night after an oily toner for mature skin from body shop.</li>
            <li>people comment how young I look.  </li>
            <li>do not waste your money .</li>
            <li>It leaves it feeling soft</li>
            <li>Moreover, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind and smells nice to me.</li>
            <li>I also have very dark under-eye circles on some days, and the eye gel improves the dark rings on contact which is amazing.</li>
            <li>No more drying out in a couple of hours like I have experienced with other creams, some a lot more expensive than this cream.</li>
            <li>It may not be for everyone especially for one who has very sensitive skin; but I don&#x27;t find any harshness in anyway...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough  to know if it&#x27;s reducing any wrinkles, and it really doesn&#x27;t have an aroma as some creams do.  </li>
            <li>Only been using it for a couple of weeks - so far no change at all -</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Only been using it for a couple of weeks - so far no change at all -</li>
            <li> Robanda Intensive Moisturizer cream keeps my skin feeling moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> but I am also a seriously dry person</li>
            <li> This is bad because the jar system pretty much guarantees that bacteria are going to get into it, and then onto your face.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> my skin feels hydratet but also tight, my pores look much smaller.</li>
            <li> A little of this products goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Due to that side effect, I am having to adjust my makeup regime (hence the 4 star review).  </li>
            <li> and I usually purchased night creams for the extra moisture until I found this product!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s half gone.  </li>
            <li> Whenever my skin itches I just put a little on and the itch will go away in a minute.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s a little firmer.  </li>
            <li> I use this cream at night, as I&#x27;m not sure if it contains SPF for the Arizona sunshine.</li>
            <li> I usually put it before going to bed and in the morning</li>
            <li> so I am hard to please in that department.  </li>
            <li> so maybe it&#x27;s just tooooo late for me.</li>
            <li> and I received it too late to return.</li>
            <li> It is rather thick to put on and does not absorb well on the skin.  </li>
            <li> the worse .</li>
            <li> The jar system is also bad because it exposes the product to air, which degrades the retinol and makes it less effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not like , smell really bad .</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First found this at another store and decided to try it.  It was great.  When I returned to purchase more, it could not be found. It was my good fortune to find it here at Amazon but the cost is quite a bit more.  I like it so much that I had to overlook the cost difference.  Since then, I have purchased other Robanda products and found them to be ,a good investment for my skin care.</li>
            <li> Not what it said it was</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a week so really don&#x27;t know how to rate this item.  It feels good, let&#x27;s see how it works.</li>
            <li> I have used this product line for many years (10+). I have tried many other brands but this one with its simplicity and high level of pure retinol  does what it is supposed to do- remove fine lines and wrinkles. The price point is great compared to those other brands. I also have very dark under-eye circles on some days, and the eye gel improves the dark rings on contact which is amazing. The slight  scent of this  face cream is light and beautiful. Most importantly I see great results after using it for only a few days (I am 43 years old.) Bought the eye gel and this face cream for my mom who was complaining about her complexion. She was happy with  the results as well. Her skin looks smooth and fresh and the under eye lines are dramatically improved.     I highly recommend anything from Robanda. This brand is highly under-rated.</li>
            <li> I have Really dry flaky skin that seems easily irritated and my doctor suggested a retinol moisturizer for the scales. This is my first experience with retinol and the change it made in the first 48 hrs was incredible. I am 29 and I use this at night after an oily toner for mature skin from body shop. It just sinks in and my skin Is smooth in the morning. I could wear foundation now and I only bought this brand cause it was $6 at marshals by my house. Now I need more</li>
            <li> Love this cream....I have used it for about 6 mo. &amp; I can see a big difference in my skin....people comment how young I look.  When applied you can feel it working, tingling &amp; tightening....This will be my night cream forever.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a drastic change after using this product.  I have noticed a reduction in eye puffness &amp; fine lines! Will continue to use &amp; buy this brand!!</li>
            <li> I use this cream at night, as I&#x27;m not sure if it contains SPF for the Arizona sunshine. I have tried many products, both here and in the UK and it feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Bit pricy but works really well.  If you are dry skin challenged, I really recommend this product as a great solution</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a couple of weeks - so far no change at all - and it&#x27;s half gone.  But I keep hoping.  I&#x27;m VERY OLD so maybe it&#x27;s just tooooo late for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before , so I am reordering it because it seems to work better than  many other moisturizers.  I usually&lt;br /&gt;apply in the morning under my makeup and at night .  It leaves a nice soft . feel to my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first cream that I have used that I can really see a difference. This is my second jar and i will continue to use it. Received it promptly after ordering .</li>
            <li> Morning after I used the cream I woke up&lt;br /&gt;to find a rash on my face. I returnd the products&lt;br /&gt;Their return was not acknowledged. I asked to be&lt;br /&gt;omitted from the program.. last week, while hospitalized&lt;br /&gt;Both hand and face creams were received in my mailbox.&lt;br /&gt;I also received an $ 84 charge on my VISA card, Please&lt;br /&gt;credit this immediately. I am returning the 2 creams immediately&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> This item was ordered because they did not have the Robanda product that I wanted, so I got this as a substitute..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous creams, and this one is by far the best! Most seem to just sit on top, and not really moisturize, but this one goes deep into my skin, and really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> This product really delivers what it promises. My skin has never looked better and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  It totally works. Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used too.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to put vitamin A cream on my arms to help cure the acnes, so I got this. I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from it but it really helped after like two or three weeks. The best part is that it also moisturize my skin which always get dry and itchy during the winter. Whenever my skin itches I just put a little on and the itch will go away in a minute. Moreover, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind and smells nice to me.</li>
            <li> Do not like , smell really bad . As human urine . the worse . do not waste your money . I wish htere was  a way of returning this junk.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the moisturizer, the scent is pleasant, and does a wonderful job on the face and neck area...It may not be for everyone especially for one who has very sensitive skin; but I don&#x27;t find any harshness in anyway...\\&quot;For all skin types.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, and you&#x27;ll won&#x27;t have to buy the more expensive lines of creams.</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing.  It is not as hydrating as I thought it would be but I am also a seriously dry person so I am hard to please in that department.  My pores are refined, my skin is smooth and flawless. I will re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Would love to review this but the picture shown here is NOT the product I received and I received it too late to return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the moisturizer cream for 2 weeks but already I noticed my skin is more hydrated, its a lot softer and the wrinkles seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li> A huge waste of money - do not fall for the product claims as it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It does not smell good. It is rather thick to put on and does not absorb well on the skin.  I have used Elmis product and was trying to find something cheaper, this is not even close.</li>
            <li> I am actually seeing results with this cream.  I was trying so many different ones that I could afford anyway.  This is the first one that I&#x27;m noticing a difference in the severity of my wrinkles, especially around my mouth.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I hope that by 6 to 8 weeks, othere people with notice the results.  I&#x27;m going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I look much younger using this product. It is not greasy it does not clog your pores I would recommend this product fo all</li>
            <li> I love this product. It contains so many soothing ingredients that skin irritation is extremely unlikely. It has a pleasant, mild scent, and feels good on the face. This would be a miracle product if they just put a little more into the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a jar. This is bad because the jar system pretty much guarantees that bacteria are going to get into it, and then onto your face. The jar system is also bad because it exposes the product to air, which degrades the retinol and makes it less effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be best packaged in an airtight, opaque pump system like what Green Cream comes in. I think that if this product were better packaged it would be far more effective. Regardless, I still love it, and hope that they will consider repackaging it.</li>
            <li> Good Product.  I do like the way it makes my face feel (smooth and hydrated).  I have noticed that my face gets more greasy/ shiny during the day since I&#x27;ve started using this product. Due to that side effect, I am having to adjust my makeup regime (hence the 4 star review).  A little of this products goes a long way.  I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update** After using this cream for 6 weeks or so, I find my skin glows and have received compliments.  Again, I really like the way the cream feels when applied (not sticky or heavy).  When I first used the product, I found my face was more shiny/ oily during the day; but now, that&#x27;s not the case.  I believe my skins has adjusted to the product. Adjusted my review to a 5 star.</li>
            <li> i love the way this cream smoothes onto my skin.  It leaves it feeling soft and I think it&#x27;s a little firmer.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough  to know if it&#x27;s reducing any wrinkles, and it really doesn&#x27;t have an aroma as some creams do.  However, I&#x27;m quite pleased with the cream so far.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and I usually purchased night creams for the extra moisture until I found this product! Robanda Intensive Moisturizer cream keeps my skin feeling moisturized all day long. No more drying out in a couple of hours like I have experienced with other creams, some a lot more expensive than this cream. I love this product and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream, it&#x27;s not greasy at all, absorbs very fast and leaves my skin feeling great. I tried many creams before such as,bare rnerals, clinique and ester lauder, all cost a fortune, and this one gives me much better results. I usually put it before going to bed and in the morning my skin feels hydratet but also tight, my pores look much smaller. My husband said it smells like something his grandma used which I responded his grandma was a wise woman. Now he uses it too and loves it. He says his skin feels much smoother.</li>
