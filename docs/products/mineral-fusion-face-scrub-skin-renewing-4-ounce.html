            <li>I switched to Andalou and that works great for my skin.</li>

            <li>Plus it smells so good.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Leaves face with just the right surface for the best shave ever!</li>
            <li>I also use the mineral powder foundation and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I love this scrub !</li>
            <li>Great product, works well, leaves my skin nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s by far the best for my combination and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>BEST FOR SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li>The smell is mild and pleasant as well.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel really good and clean without making me break out.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many skin care lines for my face which is oily and acne prone.  </li>
            <li>I love love this along with the moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I love Mineral Fusion face scrub.  </li>
            <li>Not the most aggressive face scrub, but more so than most.  </li>
            <li>Most face scrubs don&#x27;t seem to scrub at all, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter loves this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scrub.</li>
            <li>I love Mineral Fusion everything, and this face wash is no exception.</li>
            <li>My face always feels so smooth after I&#x27;ve used this scrub.</li>
            <li>A staple in my house…leaves skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Find nothing special about the product.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the perfect animal-friendly scrub to replace my old favorite (Lush&#x27;s herbalism) clogs my drain, expires too quickly, and is too difficult/expensive to get in my current city.</li>
            <li>My favorite scrub that I&#x27;ve found for my combination, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>other reviewers have mentioned this is just a scrub, so don&#x27;t expect it to do more than exfoliate, but using an additional cleanser and moisturizer is fine with me.</li>
            <li>Mt skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>OK, a basic moisturizing cream without a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I also really appreciate that it states that it&#x27;s vegan right on the packaging.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>And always looks so much smoother too.</li>
            <li>GENTLE.</li>
            <li>It has a GREAT smell that I struggle to describe, only that it smells like other high-end facial products I have used before.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only cleanser that keeps my skin clear and pimple free.</li>
            <li>This product is very similar in texture and viscosity, except with a mild herbal scent, not from added fragrance but just from the ingredients themselves.  </li>
            <li>Wish it came in a bigger tube bc if you use it on your body you will use the tube up quickly .</li>
            <li>I also like that the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li>I was using this with the face wash and toner and developed a rash.</li>
            <li>My skin just might to be too sensitive for all the minerals in here.</li>
            <li>Gentle for daily use.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use twice a week, and has lasted me quite a while.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer complained of runny texture, but the product I received is fine.  </li>
            <li>The price is so much cheaper than a lot of other cleansers so its a win-win for me.</li>
            <li>another facial peel product I liked but found it too expensive.</li>

            <li> A staple in my house…leaves skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This is the best purchase I have ever made!  I have tried so many skin care lines for my face which is oily and acne prone.  I love love this along with the moisturizers.  I switch between the skin balancing and the mattifying oil control.  I also use the mineral powder foundation and I love it!  I am so happy I gave these a try!</li>
            <li> My favorite scrub that I&#x27;ve found for my combination, sensitive skin. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love Mineral Fusion face scrub.  I have very oily skin and it&#x27;s the only cleanser that keeps my skin clear and pimple free. I also like that the ingredients are all natural. The price is so much cheaper than a lot of other cleansers so its a win-win for me.</li>
            <li> When I was diagnosed with a gluten intolerance that shows up on my skin, I scrambled to find a substitute for my St. Ives scrub. I love this stuff! Mt skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I use it every day to set up my beard for shaving.  Not the most aggressive face scrub, but more so than most.  Most face scrubs don&#x27;t seem to scrub at all, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love! I have been looking for the perfect animal-friendly scrub to replace my old favorite (Lush&#x27;s herbalism) clogs my drain, expires too quickly, and is too difficult/expensive to get in my current city. This is about the 8th one I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s by far the best for my combination and acne-prone skin. So far it&#x27;s the only scrub that has managed to thoroughly get rid of the flaky patches on my face without being too harsh or drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned this is just a scrub, so don&#x27;t expect it to do more than exfoliate, but using an additional cleanser and moisturizer is fine with me. I also really appreciate that it states that it&#x27;s vegan right on the packaging. The smell is mild and pleasant as well.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter loves this stuff.  I used to have to pick it up when I would be in larger cities, since our small town does not carry it.  But this product is cheaper and easier to get on line.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a weekly-ish scrub but I like it so much it&#x27;s tempting to use everyday. Environmental Working Group rates it a 2.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I am happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> Find nothing special about the product. Gave it a try. Will not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Had another facial peel product I liked but found it too expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not agree with my skin. I was using this with the face wash and toner and developed a rash. My skin just might to be too sensitive for all the minerals in here. I gave the three products to my friend and she loves them and they agree with her skin. I switched to Andalou and that works great for my skin.</li>
            <li> This arrived yesterday I used it for the first time this morning. I really like it I already notice a difference in my skin. It is a lot smoother which for me is a plus. I am plagued with troubled skin, dry in some areas, oily in others breakouts sometimes. I will re-order this item.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scrub. It makes my face feel really good and clean without making me break out. Plus it smells so good. I use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Smells great and feels great. Gentle for daily use. This is what I take my bb or cc cream off with. Works well with Mineral Fusion Toner.</li>
            <li> The consistency is not very good,it&#x27;s too liquid, it doesn&#x27;t stay in the tube, a lost a lot of product because of that.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully!  This is not a cleanser, lotion, or the like.  It is only a scrub.  If that is what you are looking for, here it is!  It has a GREAT smell that I struggle to describe, only that it smells like other high-end facial products I have used before.  Gentle enough to use twice a week, and has lasted me quite a while.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well, leaves my skin nice and smooth.  Another reviewer complained of runny texture, but the product I received is fine.  I used to use St. Ives apricot scrub but switched to Mineral Fusion based on Skin Deep ratings.  This product is very similar in texture and viscosity, except with a mild herbal scent, not from added fragrance but just from the ingredients themselves.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Perfect for men. Leaves face with just the right surface for the best shave ever!</li>
            <li> I love Mineral Fusion everything, and this face wash is no exception. I&#x27;ve started switching all my products to be vegan, organic, etc... as much as possible and I haven&#x27;t had any crazy breakouts or anything since using this scrub, despite it not claiming to have any acne fighter in it.</li>
            <li> My face always feels so smooth after I&#x27;ve used this scrub. And always looks so much smoother too. Love it!! Use it daily!</li>
            <li> GENTLE. BEST FOR SENSITIVE SKIN. OTHER SCRUBS FEEL LIKE YOU ARE RUBBING ROCKS ON YOUR FACE LOL</li>
            <li> I love this scrub ! It&#x27;s not too gentle and not too harsh . I use it on my face and body. Wish it came in a bigger tube bc if you use it on your body you will use the tube up quickly . Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> OK, a basic moisturizing cream without a lot of chemicals.</li>
