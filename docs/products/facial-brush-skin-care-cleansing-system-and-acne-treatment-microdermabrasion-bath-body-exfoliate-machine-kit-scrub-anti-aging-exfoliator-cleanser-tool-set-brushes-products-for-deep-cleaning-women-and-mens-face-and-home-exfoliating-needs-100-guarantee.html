            <li>A battery charging system like the a Clairisonic is more convenient in that aspect.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>Easy to use and care for.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I bought six more for presents.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you get the most powerful batteries.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot, so these is easy to pack.</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t let the great price fool you, this brush gets the job done and will have yourskin feeling soft and blemish free in no time.</li>
            <li>If you had the time to give yourself a good facial treatment, then I would guess it would be a nice massage when used with some moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.    </li>
            <li>Nice brush, first time I have ever used one</li>
            <li>I really liked this at first</li>
            <li>This is truly an great product and a must have if you want to keep you skin clean and looking young.</li>
            <li>but in the end, it is sturdy, works great and is incredibly soothing: the bristles are soft yet exfoliating and the lotion sponge is like a very comforting soft face massage.</li>
            <li>It does not have an electric recharging system, just batteries the owner installs, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li>the batteries are holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>My brush also seemed to have lost some power after about a month, and they immediately sent me a new unit without me even asking, to make sure I was takin care of with an effective, working brush.</li>
            <li>Everything about this little tool is perfect.</li>
            <li>so the appearance of my skin is a major factor in having a successful career.  </li>
            <li>My skin became soft, smooth, bright and shining.</li>
            <li>Has made a huge difference In skin tone and texture in just a week .</li>
            <li>Great facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>Great until it just stopped working 3 months later.</li>
            <li>It lasted 4ish months of light use.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, these are priced well</li>
            <li>Worth the money and surprisingly enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>and my face was incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>Great facial exfoliating brush.  </li>
            <li>Both are raving at how smooth their face is after each use.</li>
            <li>This works perfectly to remove dirt and dead cells.</li>
            <li>Customer Service is also great when you register your system with Desetoasis International Marketing, LLC.  </li>
            <li>It just feels cheap.</li>
            <li>The vendor is so conscientious and gave me fantastic service.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased very similar brush systems and am quite happy with this one.</li>
            <li>The best part of this unit are reasonably  priced sturdy construction, waterproof, variety of attachments that snap on and off with ease and the great looking skin results&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been suffering from a lot of breakouts I tried the small bush first on my face.</li>
            <li>It removes dead skin cells incredibly well!</li>
            <li>However, if I pressed it too lightly to my skin, it would start skipping across the surface.</li>
            <li>The company follow up has been fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great facial cleansing system!  </li>
            <li>At a $200 price difference, I honestly don&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like having a facial at home, great tool for pampering yourself.</li>
            <li>This brush is good as far as the power it has &amp; the battery life .</li>
            <li>my skin is soft and radiant... good product</li>
            <li>SO FAR SO GOOD. ..  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so I very rarely use it.</li>
            <li>I Like Using The Brush; Its Very Powerful; I Just Dislike The Fact That The Batteries Fall Out If The Brush Drops</li>
            <li>My face felt smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>The brush for my face was a bit abrasive at first but has become more comfortable with use.</li>
            <li>I regret now buying the one with more speed options however, even the one with one speed works brilliant, I washed the small face brush with shower gel and proceeded to use it.</li>
            <li>Nice face scrubber decent battery life.</li>
            <li>Have used twice in the past 5days since receiving it and already feeling/seeing great results!</li>
            <li>Their girlfriends would love it if they did, that&#x27;s if they don&#x27;t steal it from them first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>So, i am assuming that this product is an inexpensive version of the original</li>
            <li>As this product is made for use in the shower, it is a significant problem.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and easy to use...simply put, it just plain ole feels good!</li>
            <li>This particular scrubber is pretty good.</li>
            <li>LOVING my new face brush.  </li>
            <li>this will help you keep your skin really clean, all 3 brushes do their jobs use the lotions  to work ito your face</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and refreshed after using the brush during my morning shower.  </li>
            <li>I clean the brushes after every use with anti-bacterial soap.</li>
            <li>I use a mild cleanser on my face and it has helped with the distribution and the way it makes my face feel really smooth.</li>
            <li>AND YOU FEEL THE CLEAN WHEN YOU ARE</li>
            <li>My face feels and looks clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves me feeling a oft and clean.</li>
            <li>Skin feels clean.</li>
            <li>I let it spin for about 2 minutes, washed my face clean.</li>
            <li>While the Clairisonic Vibrates to clean, this unit spins.</li>
            <li>but so far I love it!</li>
            <li>Great quality and works well when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li>Soft and kind to my face.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning, especially with some soap on it.</li>
            <li>It does the job, but prepare to take your sweet time at it.</li>
            <li>others have noticed and are good enough to tell me they notice.</li>
            <li>My skin is absorbing my moisturizer better.</li>
            <li>Useful and cheap product.</li>
            <li>I also recently was given the Clairisonic Pro as a gift so I can give a good report on the comparison of the two products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this system so much, I gave my &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; system to my friend.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, very reasonable price</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this and like all the different brush sizes, seems to apply my makeup very smoothly</li>
            <li>My face felt clean and oil free after the first wash, I immediately felt the difference.</li>
            <li>My face felt clean and oil free after the first wash, I immediately felt the difference.</li>
            <li>She actually said that it was better that the ones on the TV because it had more attachments and that she could use the pumice stone attachment for her feet.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I see a difference in my skin much more vibrant.</li>
            <li>my face has been clearer and the batteries don&#x27;t die quickly</li>
            <li>This cleansing system is awesome, very easy to use, really cleans and exfoliates your face, the body brush makes your skin so soft after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps it needs to be more high powered to perform well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I finally decided to get this.</li>
            <li>Nice skin cleansing brush and more reasonably priced than similar brushes.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin from the very first time I tried the the skin care system.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend especially for the great price.</li>
            <li>I had received emails from them after registering my system reminding me to write my review here on Amazon and asking if I was satisfied with my system &amp; getting special offers.</li>
            <li>I love this new item that I got.</li>
            <li>Very professional , I love it .</li>
            <li>A bit of a breakout after the first use, but I suspect that is the impurity exiting the system!</li>
            <li>Fell apart on first use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>The same or BETTER than it&#x27;s rival!  </li>
            <li>I ordered a new one and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Its gentle on my face but exfoliates well, is great for dry brushing and for using in the shower.</li>
            <li>I find my skin very smooth and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Wife loves this product, only purchased the one speed version but seems to be more than adequate and the unit is comfortable in her hands during use.  </li>
            <li>great little brush for the price</li>
            <li>Great little gadget for the price.</li>
            <li>I received my shipment on time and when i use it for first time i feel my  skin fresh and clean .</li>
            <li>;)  super easy transaction and fast shipment too .</li>
            <li>I def enjoy this so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been fun for us to learn together and works well.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price for such a nice spa like feel!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love my face brush, my face feels really soft when I use the brush.  </li>
            <li>Since i have such dry-peely skin (&amp; any kind of lotion/moisturizer makes me break out)</li>
            <li>even tried it on my face and it is pretty cool and powerful too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I love it so far no problem.</li>
            <li>I wish I spent more on a better product.</li>
            <li>I do like this system a lot, I like how it makes my skin look fresh.</li>
            <li>and my skin has felt soft and smooth all day!</li>
            <li>Rare these days.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about this cleaner.</li>
            <li>I used this product for 1st time and it&#x27;s worth trying it.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>That would of course raise the price, but I think it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m quite pleased the system.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, there isn&#x27;t much power with this device (not much torque or speed), so it isn&#x27;t very effective as a body brush and not at all as a pumice tool (unless babies get callouses).  </li>
            <li>This is a great item for hard to clean skin.</li>
            <li>All the other brushes and especially the sponge to apply moisturizer work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>At first we were very excited about the new purchse and skin cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>Good for other uses.</li>
            <li>WOW, WOW, this is one of the best products I have received in a long time.  </li>
            <li>the shipping was fast and I was excited to use the product.</li>
            <li>reading reviews about this product, i was excited to use it, but unfortunatelly was very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could see the difference in my skin right away.  </li>
            <li>My skin has drastically improved with a combo of this and the right soap.</li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;June 1</li>
            <li>i noticed the difference on my skin right away.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box this thing didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>, I will buy butters to start right away ^_^</li>
            <li>Body brush just right.</li>
            <li>I am prone to acne and this cleared right up.</li>
            <li>Has everything you need right at your fingertips.  </li>
            <li>very good quality and fast shipping but better now use everyday on face since it&#x27;s deep cleaning!!</li>
            <li>This one seems about the same, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was not sure when I received the product, but when I used it, I was very pleased!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to start working on my dry feet next with the pumice wheel and am expecting very good results.  </li>
            <li>The brush spins faster, the bristles are a little more abrasive (not overly so), and it feels much more durable.  </li>
            <li>I will be returning and spending a little more money on a better quality product.</li>
            <li>The company reached out to me and said it sounded like there was an issue with it and sent me a new one free of charge.  </li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I have been sesrching for once again thank you for having it in stock, and at the right price.</li>
            <li>but IF you are a person with sensitive skin I would get a more gentle product.</li>
            <li>I use it every night on my face and it feels so much softer and I&#x27;ve had family members ask me if I were pregnant because they say my face looks</li>
            <li>Feels nice to not have to use a dry brush to exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li>The different attachments are great and if you want replacement attachments they are only about 10 bucks on amazon!</li>
            <li>A handy and inexpensive facial cleansing system that really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for the price, but is only useful as a face brush IMO.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased this online, it was really arrived quickly to me.  </li>
            <li>Most of all, I love the fact that its much cheaper than other name brand counterparts!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>The brush isn&#x27;t very gentle.  </li>
            <li>fuzzy &amp;#34;  because of dry skin and after the first use of this it was amazing how soft and smooth it felt.</li>
            <li>and it gets my face nice and clean and gets rid of the dead cells.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little product and I love it, so far.  </li>
            <li>Quck shipping and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Except if I go to a European salon :)</li>
            <li>On the first day stop working.</li>
            <li>exactly what it looks like in the picture.</li>
            <li>I have never used the Clarisonic, so I can&#x27;t compare this product to it, but I found that it works pretty well for the cost.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I asked for.</li>
            <li>I love this product, my skin looks and feels different...</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>This is the second brush I have bought because I love the results.</li>
            <li>The pumice works just ok, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of pumice stones any way.</li>
            <li>The first three days I broke out</li>
            <li>I am the slow one lol.</li>
            <li>Really!  </li>
            <li>This one broke anyway the first time it fell in the shower - never had that problem with the mia</li>
            <li>and I sure hope it is and will last longer than the olay one that I had.</li>
            <li>If not, I&#x27;d recommend investing a bit more into something like a sonic exfoliator or simply a 24 oz.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>Works well, love the different attachments.  </li>
            <li>I felt the difference after my first time using it.</li>
            <li>I first bought one for myself.  </li>
            <li>After the first week my husband commented, \\&quot;Your facial skin looks healthy; it has sheen to it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was ok would of gave 5 stars if it was different speeds.</li>
            <li>I had some problems with my first unit, but it was correctly in a speedy fashion by their customer service.</li>
            <li>This is mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li>It stated waterproof but in first week the pumice stone fell out.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to get a few more breakouts, but that&#x27;s because your face is getting super clean.</li>
            <li>This is my first skin care system.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li>I love the different brushes it comes with.</li>
            <li>I love my facial brush! !</li>
            <li>Fast shipping !</li>
            <li>Love the big body brush.</li>
            <li>You will see an improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed!</li>
            <li>purchased for wife as xmas present, will know more after she opens it.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is better than a Clarisonic that didn&#x27;t last but a year!</li>
            <li>My only wish was that it had more power, and could spin the attachments faster.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d saved the money and just purchased a much higher end system.  </li>
            <li>Love this facial brush and the attachments.</li>
            <li>Still on the first set of batteries.  </li>
            <li>My first one worked when it wanted.</li>
            <li>good things, use it everyday.</li>
            <li>Have not used this much as I fractured my ankle right after I got this</li>
            <li>Good idea but motor is weak and stops almost at the touch, would not recommend to anyone another cheap china product</li>
            <li>I only use this brush in the morning when I wash my face at the bathroom sink and use the Proactiv brush in the shower for a nice deep clean.  </li>
            <li>so i guess its a good thing that its not easy to come off.</li>
            <li>This is a remarkable cleansing system and I highly recommend it for everyday use.</li>
            <li>This is a remarkable cleansing system and I highly recommend it for everyday use.</li>
            <li>My husband really seen some great results from using the pumice attachment on his heavily hard heels and  callouses on his feet.</li>
            <li>product seems to be of very high quality and should last for many years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure guys would love it too if they could get past their ego!</li>
            <li>But overall, well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I am loving my shower time my skin feels and looks so soft, only been using for about a week now.</li>
            <li>The quality of this system is superior to my last facial cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the large body brush once a week and literally noticed a difference after the first time.</li>
            <li>I like thank you so much ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a few from other companies &amp; I must say, this is the best one yet!</li>
            <li>Have only used the facial brush and the body &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; brush so far, but both work very nicely and do what product promises.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good hard to replace the batteries</li>
            <li>This facial cleansing system works just as efficiently as many of the other systems which cost much more.</li>
            <li>My husband being diabetic, love it when I use it on his feet to remove the callouses and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The battery panel is easy to remove and batteries simple to install.  </li>
            <li>Even though it is so cheap, this device seems pretty solidly made.</li>
            <li>the handle to get most of the water off, then set it out on a shelf or counter to dry.</li>
            <li>Once the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;outer layer of dry skin has been removed with the brush, my skin absorbs acne medicine, serum, and moisturizer so much better.</li>
            <li>The large brush doesn&#x27;t work as well as it stops when you put any presser on it-</li>
            <li>BTW I do use the large brush on body trunk and extremities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I kept the large brush for the body.  </li>
            <li>My first brush stopped working exactly two months after I received it; I contacted Desertoasis about the problem and was promptly sent a new brush, which has been working fantastically.  </li>
            <li>I love my new Facial &amp; Body Cleansing System!</li>
            <li>I purchased this one after replacing my Proactiv brush that broke, but I ultimately purchased the new and improved Proactiv brush and love it.  </li>
            <li>the battery cap was hard to remove at first but other than that it is a great product!</li>
            <li>This brush has proved to be a smart buy for me both because of its effectiveness and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how much power was packed in this handy little device.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels so good on my skin that it&#x27;s hard to stop using it.</li>
            <li>The larger brush I&#x27;ve used on my chest and arms once or twice a week - it&#x27;s a little more abrasive than the facial brush and does a good job of exfoliating and smoothing.</li>
            <li>Not really enough power for the callous remover, not for my huge feet callouses anyway...</li>
            <li>Daughter really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin on my face</li>
            <li>very practical</li>
            <li>there is a real danger of falling off the stool I sit on in the shower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about exfoliating</li>
            <li>The first day, I did not wake up with a shiny oily face like I normally would.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but my skin is so much clearer.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I ordered this to see if cheaper versions work - and not so much.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend getting this system for any age group who wants their skin feeling renewed.</li>
            <li>Thanks for sending valuable information</li>
            <li>I really like this unit.</li>
            <li>The construction is cheap, very low quality plastic.</li>
            <li>Now iI&#x27;m curious about the one with more speeds.&lt;br /&gt;Received</li>
            <li>I have a condition that makes my skin very susceptible to sores and bleeding: LYMPHEDEMA.</li>
            <li>I was very excite to try this product.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just get this straight, this kit was not for me.</li>
            <li>One of my others that I owned which I paid twice as much for, had 2 speeds and on the highest speed, it wasn&#x27;t as fast as this one is.</li>
            <li>It was very usefull and it helps a lot</li>
            <li>and my face feels so much cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li>I really (really) like it.</li>
            <li>It really helped my complexion and skin tone while it worked.  </li>
            <li>I really like the difference that this product has made in my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Really like this product, well for the four months it worked.</li>
            <li>Have to say i was stunned how fast it arrived...</li>
            <li>I would recommend this system to anyone who wants a quality unit for an affordable price.</li>
            <li>It really rubs and twists the skin&lt;</li>
            <li>Maybe they will sell them that way when I am ready for replacement parts.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Now, my mom wants one and my brother</li>
            <li>haha..</li>
            <li>It works very well for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt my face and is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought the Skin Cleansing System because I was really out of options.</li>
            <li>and I am so amazed at how much my skin has improved.</li>
            <li>but it takes a while to do your whole body.  </li>
            <li>I put the 4 batteries in, put my cleanser on top the brush, and wet It  </li>
            <li>Works really well to exfoliate the face and neck...</li>
            <li>I love the big brush attachment and can&#x27;t wait until other large attachments are available.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t find the sponge attachment very useful or lasting.</li>
            <li>i love this product so much that the i order two, one as a gift, the other as a backup for me, just in case.</li>
            <li>I use this every other day and I love it.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this facial brush as a promotional item</li>
            <li>One other thing I love about this company is the customer service.</li>
            <li>This cleans pores and helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles while leaving your skin extra soft and radiant.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>You are going to live it !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference and highly recommend it to anyone, like myself, with normal - oily skin  </li>
            <li>My pores look a lot better, the blackheads are less.</li>
            <li>It works I am very satisfied with the product my face feels soft no more acne</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this past weekend and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I really only use the facial cleaning brush, but I LOVE it in the mornings when I&#x27;m not taking a shower, but still need to wash my face.</li>
            <li>Facial brush a tad bit rough, but effective.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Next I tried the big body brush in the shower with one of my favorite scrubs, I felt like I just came from the spa.</li>
            <li>Next I tried the big body brush in the shower with one of my favorite scrubs, I felt like I just came from the spa.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the body brush, it&#x27;s so luxurious.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for about a week, but it cleans my skin much better than simply rubbing the cleanser around with my hands.  </li>
            <li>Used regularly it makes your skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li>main difference between the two units are the brush heads.</li>
            <li>This brush has more options for brush heads, as it comes with a bigger body brush, face brush, facial sponge, and a pumice stone attachment.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and seller.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to everyone of all skin types.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use a high amt.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this system.</li>
            <li>The sponge cleans easily with plain water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared with other facial cleansing systems this unit feels stronger; my skin is getting a good workout.  </li>
            <li>Ive used lots of units,  but this one far outbeats them all! !</li>
            <li>I do wish it had a little more power</li>
            <li>However the facial brushes feel a little rough on my face &amp; the pumice stone does not do a very good job.</li>
            <li>If you have the money to spend on something high end, it&#x27;s probably worth it, but if not, this is definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect much-- The box looks a little cheap--</li>
            <li>I was worried that the bristles would be to soft or that it wouldn&#x27;t spin as fast as I would like</li>
            <li>Does everything (and more) than far more expensive models.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised by how much I like this tool.</li>
            <li>Be sure not to hold the brush to firmly to you skin, the unit will stop.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>not so powerful for larger areas of the body.</li>
            <li>I may have to get this again as a fun present for my mom and sis:</li>
            <li>The facial brush was too soft and it didn&#x27;t do a good job of removing the dead skin.  </li>
            <li>I received the item very quickly but unfortunately it did not work no matter how many batteries I tried.  </li>
            <li>I want to feel extra clean and free of dead skin.  </li>
            <li>It removed all dead skin and left skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Not like the Clarisonic, as it is less powerful and the brushes just don&#x27;t seem to be the right sensitivity.</li>
            <li>and I had to end up spending the money anway on a new one.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I received my new system yesterday.</li>
            <li>Lasted  about 2weeks after putting in New battery quit running.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.  </li>
            <li>The 4 AA&#x27;s lasted about 2 weeks before I had to put new ones in.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a complete new system, but that&#x27;s what I got!</li>
            <li>He said the brush was gentle and very soothing like several hands were at work.</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s nice to know that they really do stand behind their products.</li>
            <li>All the cheap, Chinese knock-off face scrubbers out there are basically the same.</li>
            <li>This was by far our most harsh winter</li>
            <li>Poor quality, should have paid more and gotten something useful.</li>
            <li>Four brushes, the different brushes makes it very useful for your entire body&lt;</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>The pumice stone works fine and it takes a lot less energy than trying to do it by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my second one because somebody dropped and broke the first one.</li>
            <li>And the Vitagoods brush is for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with such a device</li>
            <li>the results so far!</li>
            <li>Friends at dinner last night commented on how pretty my skin looked.  </li>
            <li>I have used the pumice attachment on dry feet, and I feel that it will smooth and reduce smaller calluses, but doesn&#x27;t really attack the larger ones very well.</li>
            <li>I really like it for my daily use and highly recommend to my friends and to you all.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and is not too harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It comes with everything-face sponge, pumice, small brush, and a nice big brush.</li>
            <li>The positive about this is it comes with extra attachments.</li>
            <li>Bought a different and quickly went back to this one</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily and sensitive skin, and the facial brush is gentle enough to massage my face, but strong enough to deep clean my pores, remove dead skin build up, and leave it looking refreshed, clean, and glowing.</li>
            <li>I use the facial brush with a light touch, sweeping from the center of my face outward and upward.</li>
            <li>Clear skin soap added with Vitamin E oil;</li>
            <li>After one use,  your body feels so soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li>Bought my daughter one also...........wonderful product.............have highly sensitive skin, and is prone to break outs......</li>
            <li>It helps to any residue left from makeup and dry skin, leaving your face feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>So I decided to search for something Similar but without the high price tag; even though, I have a coupon  code for it!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li>It really makes a big difference, my skin is noticeably smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>As far as cleaning my pores, I don&#x27;t think it does the job.</li>
            <li>Though the speed at which it operates is moderate and reasonable.</li>
            <li>Works well, leaves skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>A natural anti-aging product that is affordable and non-ablative.</li>
            <li>Washing neck, front to back easily accomplished, too.</li>
            <li>update - heard a loud \\&quot;pop\\&quot; coming from bathroom.</li>
            <li>i use it with clearasil for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never applied moisturizer in this manner and feel like I&#x27;m getting a soft professional massage.  </li>
            <li>The brush leaves my face so soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Although it only has one speed, that is all it really needs.</li>
            <li>I really like the facial system by youthful advantage.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product and am pleasantly surprised at the change in the feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li>and then I used the soft sponge to put on moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li>Spins just fast enough for the heads that are included with it.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so soft</li>
            <li>So far, I like it.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter is pretty bummed since she is such a avid face washer and used it daily.</li>
            <li>So I guess I will have to use Duct tape to hold the end on which as far as I&#x27;m concerned</li>
            <li>it pushed the batteries completely out of the unit.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t completely submerged it in water either.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could buy just the individual replacement heads instead of the whole set.  </li>
            <li>Have noticed big improvement with my face feeling much smoother.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m surprised that no one is taking that men should use this.</li>
            <li>and i feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for everyday use and still leaves skin feeling cleaned and refreshed with a smooth touch.</li>
            <li>I am a professional model and actor</li>
            <li>The brushes are too soft</li>
            <li>Only after a few uses, I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Apply pressure if you want it to go even more slowly, and it will comply.</li>
            <li>I walk a tightrope between not scrubbing enough to remove black crusty skin that forms after a successful bout with cellulitis and creating sores that weeps a light green fluid that is the product of white cells that fought the cellulitis back to a state of dormancy.</li>
            <li>I have other facial brushes, they are smaller and have more power</li>
            <li>Although I have to be careful as I have extremely dry/sensitive skin, I am in love with this brush.</li>
            <li>I am having a fantastic year due to my use of Youthful Advantage on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased the youthful advantage facial brush and Body Cleansing Skin care and thought how good can it be for such a small device that works with batteries.</li>
            <li>I feel as though my face benefits from both, but this unit may even outperform the Clairisonic when it comes to the clean feel, but the brush heads are also a little harsher on the face and body</li>
            <li>I have only used the small brush so far, but I am glad I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I just recently bought a new Korean facial product and it goes together very we&#x27;ll...</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to clean his face without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>but small attachments are fine.</li>
            <li>It seems to help get my face clean and take off dead skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Too heavy for my liking and didn&#x27;t do anything special for my skin.</li>
            <li>I placed a 1/4 inch long by 1/8 inch in diameter screw right in the spot where the ridges are located for your thumb to push to open the battery case.</li>
            <li>The on/off button is a little weird—I think a simple up/down switch would have been better, but it&#x27;s not really a big issue.</li>
            <li>bristles of the small brush are gentle yet powerful enough to remove dead skin cells and clean out pores; I feel it gently massaging my face and see actual immediate results.  </li>
            <li>I have clear skin in general but every now</li>
            <li>My legs are almost back to normal</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a few more breakouts, but its the same concept after a facial.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get my hands back to normal, but I did.</li>
            <li>I bought this item thinking that it would at least be somewhat reliable and equivalent to some of the better facial brushes.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on the smaller scrubber are very soft.</li>
            <li>it cleans well and leaves my skin fresh and tight.</li>
            <li>I was given this as a gift and not only does it cleanse deeply, but it exfoliates removing the dead skin while leaving the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The faulty piece is on its way back to the manufacturer; and, I&#x27;m using my new facial brush, appreciating the level of cleanliness it offers.</li>
            <li>My guess is that they are pressing too hard against the skin...you need to use a light touch and let the bristles do the work.</li>
            <li>The brushes on the Clairisonic will probably last a little longer due to the fact they just vibrate and don&#x27;t rub against the skin quite as much, but this also could be less effective when it comes to cleaning.</li>
            <li>Not sure if that&#x27;s a great recommendation or not lol.  </li>
            <li>I feel like Ive been to a professional to get a facial!</li>
            <li>I even got 2 extra for my kids( they are 24 and 28 years old)</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S ONLY A WEEK SO FAR, ..  </li>
            <li>Feels the same as my old Mia Clarisonic - oops.  </li>
            <li>I am a 54 year young male</li>
            <li>And I love the pumice attachment no more rough heels.</li>
            <li>The first time I noticed a tiny wet area</li>
            <li>I possibly got a defective product, but when I received it, I tried 3 different sets of new batteries and none of them worked,&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>my face was rough and has discoloration which makes my pores look extra large and looked unclean...</li>
            <li>The replacement one is better (seems to stay closed where the batteries go), but I do not like it because it spins WAY TOO SLOW.  </li>
            <li>had a little problem with the battery cover seating properly, so they replaced it right away.</li>
            <li>product pulls the brush thru my hair with no sweat and scrubs the accumulated dirt and dead skin cells from my face quickly and easily enough that I have enough energy left over to shave and finish my shower.</li>
            <li>Immediately returned this uniy because the battery compartment would not close properly and when I got batteries into it and turned it on it barely rotated the brush.</li>
            <li>I was very careful to make sure it was closed tightly after each battery change.</li>
            <li>I know that is not very long and who knows how it will hold up over time.</li>
            <li>I have used a scrub with the body brush and it leaves my arms and legs feeling soft even with the dry Colorado air.</li>
            <li>Even if I have to hunt it down occasionally because my daughter likes it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Although I have only been using this system for a few days, but after the first use I could tell a big difference in the smoothness of my face, which helps my skin absorb moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on a daily basis, and it does seem to help a little bit with diminishing the appearance of large pores, as well.</li>
            <li>I had an issue with the first one due to the handle not staying closed with the batteries in it.  </li>
            <li>I simply can&#x27;t scrub my face and scalp hard or long enough to get clean because I get so short of breath</li>

            <li> A battery charging system like the a Clairisonic is more convenient in that aspect.  </li>

            <li> works great,checked other products and this had the best warranty and attachments.</li>

            <li> Easy to use and care for.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I bought six more for presents.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you get the most powerful batteries.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot, so these is easy to pack.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t let the great price fool you, this brush gets the job done and will have yourskin feeling soft and blemish free in no time.</li>
            <li> If you had the time to give yourself a good facial treatment, then I would guess it would be a nice massage when used with some moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.    </li>
            <li> Nice brush, first time I have ever used one</li>
            <li> I really liked this at first</li>
            <li> This is truly an great product and a must have if you want to keep you skin clean and looking young.</li>
            <li> but in the end, it is sturdy, works great and is incredibly soothing: the bristles are soft yet exfoliating and the lotion sponge is like a very comforting soft face massage.</li>
            <li> It does not have an electric recharging system, just batteries the owner installs, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li> the batteries are holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine</li>
            <li> My brush also seemed to have lost some power after about a month, and they immediately sent me a new unit without me even asking, to make sure I was takin care of with an effective, working brush.</li>
            <li> Everything about this little tool is perfect.</li>
            <li> so the appearance of my skin is a major factor in having a successful career.  </li>
            <li> My skin became soft, smooth, bright and shining.</li>
            <li> Has made a huge difference In skin tone and texture in just a week .</li>
            <li> Great facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> Great until it just stopped working 3 months later.</li>
            <li> It lasted 4ish months of light use.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, these are priced well</li>
            <li> Worth the money and surprisingly enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> and my face was incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> Great facial exfoliating brush.  </li>
            <li> Both are raving at how smooth their face is after each use.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly to remove dirt and dead cells.</li>
            <li> Customer Service is also great when you register your system with Desetoasis International Marketing, LLC.  </li>
            <li> It just feels cheap.</li>
            <li> The vendor is so conscientious and gave me fantastic service.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased very similar brush systems and am quite happy with this one.</li>
            <li> The best part of this unit are reasonably  priced sturdy construction, waterproof, variety of attachments that snap on and off with ease and the great looking skin results&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been suffering from a lot of breakouts I tried the small bush first on my face.</li>
            <li> It removes dead skin cells incredibly well!</li>
            <li> However, if I pressed it too lightly to my skin, it would start skipping across the surface.</li>
            <li> The company follow up has been fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great facial cleansing system!  </li>
            <li> At a $200 price difference, I honestly don&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like having a facial at home, great tool for pampering yourself.</li>
            <li> This brush is good as far as the power it has &amp; the battery life .</li>
            <li> my skin is soft and radiant... good product</li>
            <li> SO FAR SO GOOD. ..  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> so I very rarely use it.</li>
            <li> I Like Using The Brush; Its Very Powerful; I Just Dislike The Fact That The Batteries Fall Out If The Brush Drops</li>
            <li> My face felt smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> The brush for my face was a bit abrasive at first but has become more comfortable with use.</li>
            <li> I regret now buying the one with more speed options however, even the one with one speed works brilliant, I washed the small face brush with shower gel and proceeded to use it.</li>
            <li> Nice face scrubber decent battery life.</li>
            <li> Have used twice in the past 5days since receiving it and already feeling/seeing great results!</li>
            <li> Their girlfriends would love it if they did, that&#x27;s if they don&#x27;t steal it from them first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> So, i am assuming that this product is an inexpensive version of the original</li>
            <li> As this product is made for use in the shower, it is a significant problem.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and easy to use...simply put, it just plain ole feels good!</li>
            <li> This particular scrubber is pretty good.</li>
            <li> LOVING my new face brush.  </li>
            <li> this will help you keep your skin really clean, all 3 brushes do their jobs use the lotions  to work ito your face</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and refreshed after using the brush during my morning shower.  </li>
            <li> I clean the brushes after every use with anti-bacterial soap.</li>
            <li> I use a mild cleanser on my face and it has helped with the distribution and the way it makes my face feel really smooth.</li>
            <li> AND YOU FEEL THE CLEAN WHEN YOU ARE</li>
            <li> My face feels and looks clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves me feeling a oft and clean.</li>
            <li> Skin feels clean.</li>
            <li> I let it spin for about 2 minutes, washed my face clean.</li>
            <li> While the Clairisonic Vibrates to clean, this unit spins.</li>
            <li> but so far I love it!</li>
            <li> Great quality and works well when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> Soft and kind to my face.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning, especially with some soap on it.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but prepare to take your sweet time at it.</li>
            <li> others have noticed and are good enough to tell me they notice.</li>
            <li> My skin is absorbing my moisturizer better.</li>
            <li> Useful and cheap product.</li>
            <li> I also recently was given the Clairisonic Pro as a gift so I can give a good report on the comparison of the two products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this system so much, I gave my &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; system to my friend.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, very reasonable price</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and like all the different brush sizes, seems to apply my makeup very smoothly</li>
            <li> My face felt clean and oil free after the first wash, I immediately felt the difference.</li>
            <li> My face felt clean and oil free after the first wash, I immediately felt the difference.</li>
            <li> She actually said that it was better that the ones on the TV because it had more attachments and that she could use the pumice stone attachment for her feet.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> I see a difference in my skin much more vibrant.</li>
            <li> my face has been clearer and the batteries don&#x27;t die quickly</li>
            <li> This cleansing system is awesome, very easy to use, really cleans and exfoliates your face, the body brush makes your skin so soft after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps it needs to be more high powered to perform well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I finally decided to get this.</li>
            <li> Nice skin cleansing brush and more reasonably priced than similar brushes.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin from the very first time I tried the the skin care system.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend especially for the great price.</li>
            <li> I had received emails from them after registering my system reminding me to write my review here on Amazon and asking if I was satisfied with my system &amp; getting special offers.</li>
            <li> I love this new item that I got.</li>
            <li> Very professional , I love it .</li>
            <li> A bit of a breakout after the first use, but I suspect that is the impurity exiting the system!</li>
            <li> Fell apart on first use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> The same or BETTER than it&#x27;s rival!  </li>
            <li> I ordered a new one and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Its gentle on my face but exfoliates well, is great for dry brushing and for using in the shower.</li>
            <li> I find my skin very smooth and soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product, only purchased the one speed version but seems to be more than adequate and the unit is comfortable in her hands during use.  </li>
            <li> great little brush for the price</li>
            <li> Great little gadget for the price.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment on time and when i use it for first time i feel my  skin fresh and clean .</li>
            <li> ;)  super easy transaction and fast shipment too .</li>
            <li> I def enjoy this so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been fun for us to learn together and works well.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price for such a nice spa like feel!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love my face brush, my face feels really soft when I use the brush.  </li>
            <li> Since i have such dry-peely skin (&amp; any kind of lotion/moisturizer makes me break out)</li>
            <li> even tried it on my face and it is pretty cool and powerful too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I love it so far no problem.</li>
            <li> I wish I spent more on a better product.</li>
            <li> I do like this system a lot, I like how it makes my skin look fresh.</li>
            <li> and my skin has felt soft and smooth all day!</li>
            <li> Rare these days.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this cleaner.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 1st time and it&#x27;s worth trying it.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> That would of course raise the price, but I think it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m quite pleased the system.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, there isn&#x27;t much power with this device (not much torque or speed), so it isn&#x27;t very effective as a body brush and not at all as a pumice tool (unless babies get callouses).  </li>
            <li> This is a great item for hard to clean skin.</li>
            <li> All the other brushes and especially the sponge to apply moisturizer work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> At first we were very excited about the new purchse and skin cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> Good for other uses.</li>
            <li> WOW, WOW, this is one of the best products I have received in a long time.  </li>
            <li> the shipping was fast and I was excited to use the product.</li>
            <li> reading reviews about this product, i was excited to use it, but unfortunatelly was very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could see the difference in my skin right away.  </li>
            <li> My skin has drastically improved with a combo of this and the right soap.</li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br /&gt;June 1</li>
            <li> i noticed the difference on my skin right away.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box this thing didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> , I will buy butters to start right away ^_^</li>
            <li> Body brush just right.</li>
            <li> I am prone to acne and this cleared right up.</li>
            <li> Has everything you need right at your fingertips.  </li>
            <li> very good quality and fast shipping but better now use everyday on face since it&#x27;s deep cleaning!!</li>
            <li> This one seems about the same, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was not sure when I received the product, but when I used it, I was very pleased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start working on my dry feet next with the pumice wheel and am expecting very good results.  </li>
            <li> The brush spins faster, the bristles are a little more abrasive (not overly so), and it feels much more durable.  </li>
            <li> I will be returning and spending a little more money on a better quality product.</li>
            <li> The company reached out to me and said it sounded like there was an issue with it and sent me a new one free of charge.  </li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I have been sesrching for once again thank you for having it in stock, and at the right price.</li>
            <li> but IF you are a person with sensitive skin I would get a more gentle product.</li>
            <li> I use it every night on my face and it feels so much softer and I&#x27;ve had family members ask me if I were pregnant because they say my face looks</li>
            <li> Feels nice to not have to use a dry brush to exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> The different attachments are great and if you want replacement attachments they are only about 10 bucks on amazon!</li>
            <li> A handy and inexpensive facial cleansing system that really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price, but is only useful as a face brush IMO.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased this online, it was really arrived quickly to me.  </li>
            <li> Most of all, I love the fact that its much cheaper than other name brand counterparts!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t very gentle.  </li>
            <li> fuzzy &amp;#34;  because of dry skin and after the first use of this it was amazing how soft and smooth it felt.</li>
            <li> and it gets my face nice and clean and gets rid of the dead cells.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little product and I love it, so far.  </li>
            <li> Quck shipping and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Except if I go to a European salon :)</li>
            <li> On the first day stop working.</li>
            <li> exactly what it looks like in the picture.</li>
            <li> I have never used the Clarisonic, so I can&#x27;t compare this product to it, but I found that it works pretty well for the cost.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I asked for.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my skin looks and feels different...</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> This is the second brush I have bought because I love the results.</li>
            <li> The pumice works just ok, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of pumice stones any way.</li>
            <li> The first three days I broke out</li>
            <li> I am the slow one lol.</li>
            <li> Really!  </li>
            <li> This one broke anyway the first time it fell in the shower - never had that problem with the mia</li>
            <li> and I sure hope it is and will last longer than the olay one that I had.</li>
            <li> If not, I&#x27;d recommend investing a bit more into something like a sonic exfoliator or simply a 24 oz.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> Works well, love the different attachments.  </li>
            <li> I felt the difference after my first time using it.</li>
            <li> I first bought one for myself.  </li>
            <li> After the first week my husband commented, \\&quot;Your facial skin looks healthy; it has sheen to it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was ok would of gave 5 stars if it was different speeds.</li>
            <li> I had some problems with my first unit, but it was correctly in a speedy fashion by their customer service.</li>
            <li> This is mediocre at best.  </li>
            <li> It stated waterproof but in first week the pumice stone fell out.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to get a few more breakouts, but that&#x27;s because your face is getting super clean.</li>
            <li> This is my first skin care system.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> I love the different brushes it comes with.</li>
            <li> I love my facial brush! !</li>
            <li> Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> Love the big body brush.</li>
            <li> You will see an improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed!</li>
            <li> purchased for wife as xmas present, will know more after she opens it.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is better than a Clarisonic that didn&#x27;t last but a year!</li>
            <li> My only wish was that it had more power, and could spin the attachments faster.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d saved the money and just purchased a much higher end system.  </li>
            <li> Love this facial brush and the attachments.</li>
            <li> Still on the first set of batteries.  </li>
            <li> My first one worked when it wanted.</li>
            <li> good things, use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Have not used this much as I fractured my ankle right after I got this</li>
            <li> Good idea but motor is weak and stops almost at the touch, would not recommend to anyone another cheap china product</li>
            <li> I only use this brush in the morning when I wash my face at the bathroom sink and use the Proactiv brush in the shower for a nice deep clean.  </li>
            <li> so i guess its a good thing that its not easy to come off.</li>
            <li> This is a remarkable cleansing system and I highly recommend it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This is a remarkable cleansing system and I highly recommend it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> My husband really seen some great results from using the pumice attachment on his heavily hard heels and  callouses on his feet.</li>
            <li> product seems to be of very high quality and should last for many years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure guys would love it too if they could get past their ego!</li>
            <li> But overall, well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I am loving my shower time my skin feels and looks so soft, only been using for about a week now.</li>
            <li> The quality of this system is superior to my last facial cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the large body brush once a week and literally noticed a difference after the first time.</li>
            <li> I like thank you so much ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few from other companies &amp; I must say, this is the best one yet!</li>
            <li> Have only used the facial brush and the body &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; brush so far, but both work very nicely and do what product promises.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good hard to replace the batteries</li>
            <li> This facial cleansing system works just as efficiently as many of the other systems which cost much more.</li>
            <li> My husband being diabetic, love it when I use it on his feet to remove the callouses and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The battery panel is easy to remove and batteries simple to install.  </li>
            <li> Even though it is so cheap, this device seems pretty solidly made.</li>
            <li> the handle to get most of the water off, then set it out on a shelf or counter to dry.</li>
            <li> Once the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;outer layer of dry skin has been removed with the brush, my skin absorbs acne medicine, serum, and moisturizer so much better.</li>
            <li> The large brush doesn&#x27;t work as well as it stops when you put any presser on it-</li>
            <li> BTW I do use the large brush on body trunk and extremities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kept the large brush for the body.  </li>
            <li> My first brush stopped working exactly two months after I received it; I contacted Desertoasis about the problem and was promptly sent a new brush, which has been working fantastically.  </li>
            <li> I love my new Facial &amp; Body Cleansing System!</li>
            <li> I purchased this one after replacing my Proactiv brush that broke, but I ultimately purchased the new and improved Proactiv brush and love it.  </li>
            <li> the battery cap was hard to remove at first but other than that it is a great product!</li>
            <li> This brush has proved to be a smart buy for me both because of its effectiveness and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how much power was packed in this handy little device.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels so good on my skin that it&#x27;s hard to stop using it.</li>
            <li> The larger brush I&#x27;ve used on my chest and arms once or twice a week - it&#x27;s a little more abrasive than the facial brush and does a good job of exfoliating and smoothing.</li>
            <li> Not really enough power for the callous remover, not for my huge feet callouses anyway...</li>
            <li> Daughter really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin on my face</li>
            <li> very practical</li>
            <li> there is a real danger of falling off the stool I sit on in the shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about exfoliating</li>
            <li> The first day, I did not wake up with a shiny oily face like I normally would.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but my skin is so much clearer.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to see if cheaper versions work - and not so much.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend getting this system for any age group who wants their skin feeling renewed.</li>
            <li> Thanks for sending valuable information</li>
            <li> I really like this unit.</li>
            <li> The construction is cheap, very low quality plastic.</li>
            <li> Now iI&#x27;m curious about the one with more speeds.&lt;br /&gt;Received</li>
            <li> I have a condition that makes my skin very susceptible to sores and bleeding: LYMPHEDEMA.</li>
            <li> I was very excite to try this product.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just get this straight, this kit was not for me.</li>
            <li> One of my others that I owned which I paid twice as much for, had 2 speeds and on the highest speed, it wasn&#x27;t as fast as this one is.</li>
            <li> It was very usefull and it helps a lot</li>
            <li> and my face feels so much cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li> I really (really) like it.</li>
            <li> It really helped my complexion and skin tone while it worked.  </li>
            <li> I really like the difference that this product has made in my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, well for the four months it worked.</li>
            <li> Have to say i was stunned how fast it arrived...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this system to anyone who wants a quality unit for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> It really rubs and twists the skin&lt;</li>
            <li> Maybe they will sell them that way when I am ready for replacement parts.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Now, my mom wants one and my brother</li>
            <li> haha..</li>
            <li> It works very well for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt my face and is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought the Skin Cleansing System because I was really out of options.</li>
            <li> and I am so amazed at how much my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> but it takes a while to do your whole body.  </li>
            <li> I put the 4 batteries in, put my cleanser on top the brush, and wet It  </li>
            <li> Works really well to exfoliate the face and neck...</li>
            <li> I love the big brush attachment and can&#x27;t wait until other large attachments are available.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t find the sponge attachment very useful or lasting.</li>
            <li> i love this product so much that the i order two, one as a gift, the other as a backup for me, just in case.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day and I love it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this facial brush as a promotional item</li>
            <li> One other thing I love about this company is the customer service.</li>
            <li> This cleans pores and helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles while leaving your skin extra soft and radiant.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> You are going to live it !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference and highly recommend it to anyone, like myself, with normal - oily skin  </li>
            <li> My pores look a lot better, the blackheads are less.</li>
            <li> It works I am very satisfied with the product my face feels soft no more acne</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this past weekend and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I really only use the facial cleaning brush, but I LOVE it in the mornings when I&#x27;m not taking a shower, but still need to wash my face.</li>
            <li> Facial brush a tad bit rough, but effective.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Next I tried the big body brush in the shower with one of my favorite scrubs, I felt like I just came from the spa.</li>
            <li> Next I tried the big body brush in the shower with one of my favorite scrubs, I felt like I just came from the spa.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the body brush, it&#x27;s so luxurious.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for about a week, but it cleans my skin much better than simply rubbing the cleanser around with my hands.  </li>
            <li> Used regularly it makes your skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> main difference between the two units are the brush heads.</li>
            <li> This brush has more options for brush heads, as it comes with a bigger body brush, face brush, facial sponge, and a pumice stone attachment.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product and seller.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to everyone of all skin types.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use a high amt.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this system.</li>
            <li> The sponge cleans easily with plain water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared with other facial cleansing systems this unit feels stronger; my skin is getting a good workout.  </li>
            <li> Ive used lots of units,  but this one far outbeats them all! !</li>
            <li> I do wish it had a little more power</li>
            <li> However the facial brushes feel a little rough on my face &amp; the pumice stone does not do a very good job.</li>
            <li> If you have the money to spend on something high end, it&#x27;s probably worth it, but if not, this is definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much-- The box looks a little cheap--</li>
            <li> I was worried that the bristles would be to soft or that it wouldn&#x27;t spin as fast as I would like</li>
            <li> Does everything (and more) than far more expensive models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised by how much I like this tool.</li>
            <li> Be sure not to hold the brush to firmly to you skin, the unit will stop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I love it.</li>
            <li> not so powerful for larger areas of the body.</li>
            <li> I may have to get this again as a fun present for my mom and sis:</li>
            <li> The facial brush was too soft and it didn&#x27;t do a good job of removing the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I received the item very quickly but unfortunately it did not work no matter how many batteries I tried.  </li>
            <li> I want to feel extra clean and free of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> It removed all dead skin and left skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Not like the Clarisonic, as it is less powerful and the brushes just don&#x27;t seem to be the right sensitivity.</li>
            <li> and I had to end up spending the money anway on a new one.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I received my new system yesterday.</li>
            <li> Lasted  about 2weeks after putting in New battery quit running.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.  </li>
            <li> The 4 AA&#x27;s lasted about 2 weeks before I had to put new ones in.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a complete new system, but that&#x27;s what I got!</li>
            <li> He said the brush was gentle and very soothing like several hands were at work.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s nice to know that they really do stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> All the cheap, Chinese knock-off face scrubbers out there are basically the same.</li>
            <li> This was by far our most harsh winter</li>
            <li> Poor quality, should have paid more and gotten something useful.</li>
            <li> Four brushes, the different brushes makes it very useful for your entire body&lt;</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> The pumice stone works fine and it takes a lot less energy than trying to do it by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second one because somebody dropped and broke the first one.</li>
            <li> And the Vitagoods brush is for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with such a device</li>
            <li> the results so far!</li>
            <li> Friends at dinner last night commented on how pretty my skin looked.  </li>
            <li> I have used the pumice attachment on dry feet, and I feel that it will smooth and reduce smaller calluses, but doesn&#x27;t really attack the larger ones very well.</li>
            <li> I really like it for my daily use and highly recommend to my friends and to you all.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and is not too harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It comes with everything-face sponge, pumice, small brush, and a nice big brush.</li>
            <li> The positive about this is it comes with extra attachments.</li>
            <li> Bought a different and quickly went back to this one</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily and sensitive skin, and the facial brush is gentle enough to massage my face, but strong enough to deep clean my pores, remove dead skin build up, and leave it looking refreshed, clean, and glowing.</li>
            <li> I use the facial brush with a light touch, sweeping from the center of my face outward and upward.</li>
            <li> Clear skin soap added with Vitamin E oil;</li>
            <li> After one use,  your body feels so soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li> Bought my daughter one also...........wonderful product.............have highly sensitive skin, and is prone to break outs......</li>
            <li> It helps to any residue left from makeup and dry skin, leaving your face feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> So I decided to search for something Similar but without the high price tag; even though, I have a coupon  code for it!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li> It really makes a big difference, my skin is noticeably smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> As far as cleaning my pores, I don&#x27;t think it does the job.</li>
            <li> Though the speed at which it operates is moderate and reasonable.</li>
            <li> Works well, leaves skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> A natural anti-aging product that is affordable and non-ablative.</li>
            <li> Washing neck, front to back easily accomplished, too.</li>
            <li> update - heard a loud \\&quot;pop\\&quot; coming from bathroom.</li>
            <li> i use it with clearasil for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never applied moisturizer in this manner and feel like I&#x27;m getting a soft professional massage.  </li>
            <li> The brush leaves my face so soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Although it only has one speed, that is all it really needs.</li>
            <li> I really like the facial system by youthful advantage.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and am pleasantly surprised at the change in the feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li> and then I used the soft sponge to put on moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li> Spins just fast enough for the heads that are included with it.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft</li>
            <li> So far, I like it.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter is pretty bummed since she is such a avid face washer and used it daily.</li>
            <li> So I guess I will have to use Duct tape to hold the end on which as far as I&#x27;m concerned</li>
            <li> it pushed the batteries completely out of the unit.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t completely submerged it in water either.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could buy just the individual replacement heads instead of the whole set.  </li>
            <li> Have noticed big improvement with my face feeling much smoother.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m surprised that no one is taking that men should use this.</li>
            <li> and i feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for everyday use and still leaves skin feeling cleaned and refreshed with a smooth touch.</li>
            <li> I am a professional model and actor</li>
            <li> The brushes are too soft</li>
            <li> Only after a few uses, I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Apply pressure if you want it to go even more slowly, and it will comply.</li>
            <li> I walk a tightrope between not scrubbing enough to remove black crusty skin that forms after a successful bout with cellulitis and creating sores that weeps a light green fluid that is the product of white cells that fought the cellulitis back to a state of dormancy.</li>
            <li> I have other facial brushes, they are smaller and have more power</li>
            <li> Although I have to be careful as I have extremely dry/sensitive skin, I am in love with this brush.</li>
            <li> I am having a fantastic year due to my use of Youthful Advantage on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased the youthful advantage facial brush and Body Cleansing Skin care and thought how good can it be for such a small device that works with batteries.</li>
            <li> I feel as though my face benefits from both, but this unit may even outperform the Clairisonic when it comes to the clean feel, but the brush heads are also a little harsher on the face and body</li>
            <li> I have only used the small brush so far, but I am glad I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I just recently bought a new Korean facial product and it goes together very we&#x27;ll...</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to clean his face without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> but small attachments are fine.</li>
            <li> It seems to help get my face clean and take off dead skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my liking and didn&#x27;t do anything special for my skin.</li>
            <li> I placed a 1/4 inch long by 1/8 inch in diameter screw right in the spot where the ridges are located for your thumb to push to open the battery case.</li>
            <li> The on/off button is a little weird—I think a simple up/down switch would have been better, but it&#x27;s not really a big issue.</li>
            <li> bristles of the small brush are gentle yet powerful enough to remove dead skin cells and clean out pores; I feel it gently massaging my face and see actual immediate results.  </li>
            <li> I have clear skin in general but every now</li>
            <li> My legs are almost back to normal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a few more breakouts, but its the same concept after a facial.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get my hands back to normal, but I did.</li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking that it would at least be somewhat reliable and equivalent to some of the better facial brushes.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on the smaller scrubber are very soft.</li>
            <li> it cleans well and leaves my skin fresh and tight.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift and not only does it cleanse deeply, but it exfoliates removing the dead skin while leaving the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The faulty piece is on its way back to the manufacturer; and, I&#x27;m using my new facial brush, appreciating the level of cleanliness it offers.</li>
            <li> My guess is that they are pressing too hard against the skin...you need to use a light touch and let the bristles do the work.</li>
            <li> The brushes on the Clairisonic will probably last a little longer due to the fact they just vibrate and don&#x27;t rub against the skin quite as much, but this also could be less effective when it comes to cleaning.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s a great recommendation or not lol.  </li>
            <li> I feel like Ive been to a professional to get a facial!</li>
            <li> I even got 2 extra for my kids( they are 24 and 28 years old)</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S ONLY A WEEK SO FAR, ..  </li>
            <li> Feels the same as my old Mia Clarisonic - oops.  </li>
            <li> I am a 54 year young male</li>
            <li> And I love the pumice attachment no more rough heels.</li>
            <li> The first time I noticed a tiny wet area</li>
            <li> I possibly got a defective product, but when I received it, I tried 3 different sets of new batteries and none of them worked,&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> my face was rough and has discoloration which makes my pores look extra large and looked unclean...</li>
            <li> The replacement one is better (seems to stay closed where the batteries go), but I do not like it because it spins WAY TOO SLOW.  </li>
            <li> had a little problem with the battery cover seating properly, so they replaced it right away.</li>
            <li> product pulls the brush thru my hair with no sweat and scrubs the accumulated dirt and dead skin cells from my face quickly and easily enough that I have enough energy left over to shave and finish my shower.</li>
            <li> Immediately returned this uniy because the battery compartment would not close properly and when I got batteries into it and turned it on it barely rotated the brush.</li>
            <li> I was very careful to make sure it was closed tightly after each battery change.</li>
            <li> I know that is not very long and who knows how it will hold up over time.</li>
            <li> I have used a scrub with the body brush and it leaves my arms and legs feeling soft even with the dry Colorado air.</li>
            <li> Even if I have to hunt it down occasionally because my daughter likes it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Although I have only been using this system for a few days, but after the first use I could tell a big difference in the smoothness of my face, which helps my skin absorb moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on a daily basis, and it does seem to help a little bit with diminishing the appearance of large pores, as well.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with the first one due to the handle not staying closed with the batteries in it.  </li>
            <li> I simply can&#x27;t scrub my face and scalp hard or long enough to get clean because I get so short of breath</li>
            <li> and i wouldn&#x27;t reccomend using it more than once a day or every other day, as it might make your skin a little raw.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it any of the other attachments, but so far it has exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I left it open to dry for several days and even tried to use a Qtip to help the drying.</li>
            <li> Last but not least was the pumice stone, which removed the dead skin and callouses with ease.</li>
            <li> Last but not least was the pumice stone, which removed the dead skin and callouses with ease.</li>
            <li> I did receive good customer support from this company and they were disappointed that this unit did not function properly.</li>
            <li> But because it is an implement with a handle, it is much neater to use than a dripping wet wash cloth running down your arms to your elbows..</li>
            <li> I do suffer  from hyperpigmentation on small areas of my skin but not too much</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m qualified to say much else.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the real thing or a knock off.  </li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to try it fully.</li>
            <li> After a long day at work with a  make up covered face, or after the gym, I can count on my facial brush to get all the junk out of my pores.</li>
            <li> And after of my time of using it, I noticed a marked decline in black heads and pimples.</li>
            <li> They also are smaller after being cleansed, and dry out faster.</li>
            <li> Was purchased as a gift for a female friend who has dry skin and requires to feel &amp;#34;comfortable instead of scaly&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have had this one a little less than a month &amp; already I can see a huge improvement in my facial lines and small wrinkles and my feet are not as itchy &amp; dry as they used to be since using the big body brush &amp; pumice stone on them.</li>
            <li> Other similar products make my face red.  </li>
            <li> The batteries extend too far above the unit and the latching mechanism is not strong enough to keep it  closed.  </li>
            <li> So far this little machine seems to be quite robust.</li>
            <li> One cautionary bit of advice - do be careful of your hair when using the facial brush.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I waitef this long.</li>
            <li> The skin care system is a professional cleaning system has rotating head provide a micro massage of the skin that removes dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Now I could see if I had it for a long time</li>
            <li> Looking to replace the brushes soon but its not clear from the packaging where to buy the replacements for this unit.</li>
            <li> I bought this to intensify the (expensive) facial cleansing and moisturizing product I&#x27;ve used for the past year which I totally love.</li>
            <li> You should correct the English on the box so it doesn&#x27;t appear like a foreign &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to replace a different system that I received as a gift many years ago which finally died. :(  </li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t one fleck of dry skin.</li>
            <li> Helps to exfoliate dead skin cells and comes with multiple different brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I use this brush every single day.  </li>
            <li> Being the &amp;#34;mad scientist&amp;#34; at heart in my home experimenting all the time, I stripped him down, slathered him with coconut oil and hyaluronic acid and then turned the product on using the bigger brush.</li>
            <li> Last week I noticed a small crack had come in the back of the battery door.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates the blemishes and they appear less red.</li>
            <li> The foot brush is too weak and doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I wish it had was a little higher/faster setting for using the stone attachment.</li>
            <li> I had to get my husband to squeeze it hard enough to get it open and put batteries in.</li>
            <li> Excellent..as expected</li>
            <li> After using this unit,  it feels like you just stepped out of a spa and your skin shines like you spent thousands of dollars.  </li>
            <li> compartment  closed or it pops off.</li>
            <li> After using my regular face wash I noticed my face felt softer and it removed a lot of dead skin around my nose.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not really a problem for me</li>
            <li> Waste of money overall</li>
            <li> To add to that they offer a pumice stone to remove callouses on your feet, elbows and any rough patches on your body.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only been a few days since I&#x27;ve started to use this youthful advantage product.</li>
            <li> Not too rough.</li>
            <li> Could not keep the battery compartment closed.</li>
            <li> Not much power and not rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I do my research carefully before buying anything that&#x27;s going to touch it.</li>
            <li> And yes, the battery cover takes effort to get off, which I expected with a water proof product.</li>
            <li> Battery compartment keeps slipping off and it doesn&#x27;t even have a waterproof seal.</li>
            <li> The compartment where the batteries are held will not even stay closed once the batteries are installed.  </li>
            <li> I tried to be careful and nothing worked, it still got water in it.</li>
            <li> Got rid of rough spots on my feet.</li>
            <li> even with careful use, water drips into battery compartment and then system eventually stops working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a glamor girl, but this has become a part of my morning and night ritual that I look forward to.</li>
            <li> Shipped as expected.</li>
            <li> After a week of using the facial brush with the Ocean Drive skin care line, my skin is as soft and supple as a baby&#x27;s behind.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is it has no holder/stand, which I&#x27;ve seen with other similar products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few of these over the last few years and this is the first one that hasn&#x27;t been a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> I use it as long as it takes to go over my face well, less than five minutes.</li>
            <li> other then that</li>
            <li> I went through a ton of reviews on this and the other products like this</li>
            <li> I would recommend if you have extremely oily skin like I do.</li>
            <li> I bring it in the tub with me and use the other brushes/tools that came with it.</li>
            <li> would have given it five stars if I had used the other attachments.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I like the product.</li>
            <li> So.. I had a couple other guys try around Christmas...</li>
            <li> WET!</li>
            <li> The brushes and other attachments are great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have only used the small brush and sponge on my face</li>
            <li> The other attachments are an additional benefit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than other branded ones, i dont know</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I am peeling due to some prescribed acne medication.</li>
            <li> just what I expected!</li>
            <li> so I was very careful to close and check it closely.</li>
            <li> This product damaged my skin and left it with broken red patches.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders for my skin all over, a game changing product for me personally, I find myself looking forward to the next time I&#x27;m going to be using it</li>
            <li> Can use less face scrub/soap with this because the spinning bubbles it up making a little go a long way.</li>
            <li> I had to be careful not to press down on it, or it would bog down.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;m left with little grey pores and some are cleaned but not all.</li>
            <li> My other half loves it and uses it every day</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the sponge attachment grew mold for some reason after I used it with my face cream</li>
            <li> I have used the clarisonic mia and settled for this after the mia broke down on me (after two years of use).  </li>
            <li> My acne is less of a problem than it used to be, and others have noticed my healthy-looking skin.</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning &amp; at night with my Phisoderm  Cream Cleaner &amp; Black Opal  </li>
            <li> I received this cleansing system about a week and half ago</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, brighter and I have less irritations.</li>
            <li> Just received this product and have used it half a dozen times.</li>
            <li> Now, common sense told me a few things; if it is going in a circular motion, keep my hair pulled back or it&#x27;s gonna grab it and hurt.</li>
            <li> Previously I could not get the cap to budge.</li>
            <li> I have to use much less product.</li>
            <li> Not super powerful...hope it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the unit only lasted for a short time and after trying to clean it and replace the batteries it still doesnt work :(</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;d need a tight seal.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t make it stay tight to hold batteries</li>
            <li> both said it was wedged too tightly, might cause damage to keep trying.</li>
            <li> It seems the battery area isn&#x27;t as water tight as it needs to be.</li>
            <li> After only one use, my dull skin is glowing!  </li>
            <li> It has definately made a difference in my face where my wrinkles are less motivate just after one use, in smoothness, and the pumice stones takes away all your dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a little ruff for my face and for my liking.</li>
            <li> I have always been self conscience of it because the look like little pimples.</li>
            <li> Just use a little exfoliating cream with it</li>
            <li> A little disappointed  that the original packaging was covered with youthful advantage sticker.</li>
            <li> and then splashed a little bit of water on my face.</li>
            <li> The brush brush was a little harsh in the beginning</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this.</li>
            <li> I was not happy about the facial brush.</li>
            <li> I suppose it has to be firm hold because its waterproof and I use it in the bathtub.</li>
            <li> on/off button problems like a few have mentioned.</li>
            <li> (Used it to remove dead skin.)&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well the pumice stone works to remove the dead skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> but after a few months the cover for the battery just falls off.</li>
            <li> I had seen her looking at a few sets like this one at the store</li>
            <li> Another brush can help with  foot problems, as removal of callus&#x27; and the softening of the skin that tends to become dried and hardened on the bottom of the feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this product and sent back for refund.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it will be trashed, too much trouble to return it.</li>
            <li> I used the pumice attachment on my feet to remove dead skin, and it did do the job.  </li>
            <li> When I opened to replace the inside of the battery chamber was all green.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a phone number or email for customer service at the youthful advantage website and was not able to return this product to Amazon even though I owned it less than 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> So, due to the extremely slow spin speed I do not recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want to get too dramatic and say that my skin is GLOWING, but I have definitely noticed a &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; look since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this a 4 star was because the battery holder was impossible for me to open.</li>
            <li> Using a hard, scrubbing motion will bog down the unit and render it ineffective.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment was a little difficult to open</li>
            <li> the brush was little too hard for skin..</li>
            <li> The brush was too harsh to be used on something delicate as your face.</li>
            <li> and I can see that it is cleansing away excessive dirt.</li>
            <li> As with all of them, the weird sponge attachment is pretty useless, but I get a lot of use out of the rest.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am going to the spa everyday!</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to keep the hair around my face from getting grabbed, even though I have my hair tied back.</li>
            <li> within 3 uses the small brush head lost its shape .</li>
            <li> I used the small brush this morning to exfoliate my face</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> Some of these facial brushes are veryyy expensive.  </li>
            <li> Areas of my skin where I had small break outs are now clearer.  </li>
            <li> No more dullness to it.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered before the scheduled delivery date.</li>
            <li> I use the small brush to cleanse and exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li> When I scrub too hard this putrid greenish liquid comes out by the quarts and floods the bed while sleep.</li>
            <li> Total disappointment.</li>
            <li> I use regular face wash with the brush and ponds cold cream with the pad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it every day for 2-3 minutes and my skin has not had any negative effects.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;ve never had skin issues until my late 20s.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment slowly collected water and rusted the battery compartment and seeped rust colored water once I discovered the flaw.</li>
            <li> slow.</li>
            <li> To paraphrase one reviewer, its default speed is slow.</li>
            <li> I slowly massaged the oil in, head to toe.</li>
            <li> The rotation is so slow and the pumice stone has no benefit for removing calluses.</li>
            <li> Also, after putting the batteries it, the bottom of the handle wouldn&#x27;t stay on so now its wrapped in tape and its brand new :(</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed so far.</li>
            <li> I had bought two Spa Sonic Systems in the past four months, and both of them are now broken.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for over a year and find that I get random breakouts a lot less.</li>
            <li> I found it also needs a set screw to help keep the battery cover from coming off during serious scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I like this, but the motor is slow or weak.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about this is how weak it is.</li>
            <li> Of course husband said the weak motor is a joke, but he doesn&#x27;t get to use it, just me.</li>
            <li> Before I got a chance to use it, I tried it on my hubby who was exhausted and sore after a very hard day at work.</li>
            <li> it works very slowly.</li>
            <li> My face is my calling card and lately, my face looks tired; its creases and wrinkles appear exaggerated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the sponge attachment for applying lotion, because it just seems unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Never happy with these things.</li>
            <li> Product arrived broken in box because Attachments are glued with a thin layer of adhesive.</li>
            <li> Compared to my Clarisonic it just feels broken.</li>
            <li> Broken after a month of use.</li>
            <li> and unit none the worse for his efforts, whatever they were, but I suspect tools were involved.   </li>
            <li> I am addicted to this</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this product and know that the results rival any $100+</li>
            <li> So back this item is going.&lt;br /&gt;How sad. :(</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the outcomes of using the product.</li>
            <li> and then I would get a random pimple.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased the expensive brand of product that does this...</li>
            <li> but the package seems not best quality.</li>
            <li> Seem to be having a difficult time attempting to return  it...</li>
            <li> I did not like it at all, very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointing because it is supposed to be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> Disappointed  in the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> always hated puting the cream on my hands</li>
            <li> This skin cleansing system is awful!</li>
            <li> My 55+ skin needs help and always loves spa facials, but I hate the expense!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks now and I am AMAZED!!! I just recently bought a new Korean facial product and it goes together very we&#x27;ll...my face was rough and has discoloration which makes my pores look extra large and looked unclean...I also have ice picked acne scars that are visible....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my face looks a lot clearer and cleaner...it also feels 90% smoother:) you can still see my pores and scars, but they &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; more clean..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 4 because I noticed that the bristles are made to be replaced...after 3 uses of the facial bristle, I can see the strands wearing off...hmmmmm</li>
            <li> Good idea but motor is weak and stops almost at the touch, would not recommend to anyone another cheap china product</li>
            <li> Excellent..as expected</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 year son and I to share. I was looking for something to clean his face without harsh chemicals. It&#x27;s been fun for us to learn together and works well.</li>
            <li> This stopped working after 2 months. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this. Total disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the facial brush skin care, it&#x27;s works great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this 4 in 1 skin cleansing system.  Ive used lots of units,  but this one far outbeats them all! ! The 3 inch sponge for the body is so awesome. After one use,  your body feels so soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  It&#x27;s got great speed and exfoliates.  It has definately made a difference in my face where my wrinkles are less motivate just after one use, in smoothness, and the pumice stones takes away all your dead skin cells.  After using this unit,  it feels like you just stepped out of a spa and your skin shines like you spent thousands of dollars.  I didn&#x27;t even ask  for anything extra. There was a surprise from Youthful Advantage. The company sent me a sample of there coconut lip balm and all i can say is yummy,  so soft and smells delicious!  Thank you,  Youthful Advantage. Im looking forward to trying all your products! !</li>
            <li> Works great. Lots of attachments. takes 4 double A batteries</li>
            <li> Love it works great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is you have to hold battery  compartment  closed or it pops off. Love the way skin feels.</li>
            <li> Bought my daughter one also...........wonderful product.............have highly sensitive skin, and is prone to break outs......this has been a wonder!</li>
            <li> this will help you keep your skin really clean, all 3 brushes do their jobs use the lotions  to work ito your face it will do the rest</li>
            <li> Quck shipping and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> this product really deep cleans and has helped minimize the larger pores on my face...I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference and highly recommend it to anyone, like myself, with normal - oily skin  A+</li>
            <li> I use this every other day and I love it. It helps to any residue left from makeup and dry skin, leaving your face feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I was not happy about the facial brush.</li>
            <li> Daughter really likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product. As represented</li>
            <li> Service was great. Giving to my daughter for x-mas. Thx</li>
            <li> It works I am very satisfied with the product my face feels soft no more acne</li>
            <li> the brush was little too hard for skin..</li>
            <li> Good product... My wife likes it and she says it&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li> My first brush stopped working exactly two months after I received it; I contacted Desertoasis about the problem and was promptly sent a new brush, which has been working fantastically.  My skin feels clean and refreshed after using the brush during my morning shower.  My acne is less of a problem than it used to be, and others have noticed my healthy-looking skin. This brush has proved to be a smart buy for me both because of its effectiveness and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Works great but doesn&#x27;t come with batteries. Order those too if you need them.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, first time I have ever used one and so I do not have anything to compare it to. But it seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Great facial cleaner. Get the same result after a facial treatment. Except if I go to a European salon :) They the best</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Purchased as a gift for my mother and she loves it.</li>
            <li> It was a xmas gift for my wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. I have very oily skin on my face so I feel like I&#x27;m constantly battling my face. I looked up a lot of different cleaner tools and picked this one because of its features. I have not been disappointed so far. The battery compartment was a little difficult to open but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s waterproof and you&#x27;d need a tight seal. I clean the brushes after every use with anti-bacterial soap. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with my different face washes to see what works best. I wouldn&#x27;t use an exfoliant with the face brush. After using my regular face wash I noticed my face felt softer and it removed a lot of dead skin around my nose. I use the sponge attachment to put on my moisturizer. I have used a scrub with the body brush and it leaves my arms and legs feeling soft even with the dry Colorado air. The pumice stone works fine and it takes a lot less energy than trying to do it by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Four brushes, the different brushes makes it very useful for your entire body&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s waterproof, I&#x27;ve used the body brush attachment in the shower with no problems&lt;br /&gt;3. Price, it doesn&#x27;t break the bank to buy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Requires batteries, but I use rechargeable batteries so it&#x27;s not really a problem for me</li>
            <li> Bought this item as a gift. The giftee loved it. She actually said that it was better that the ones on the TV because it had more attachments and that she could use the pumice stone attachment for her feet. She said that she didn&#x27;t want to get out of the shower when using it. Glad I purchased it for her and I didn&#x27;t have to pay the $129+ price tag.</li>
            <li> This product damaged my skin and left it with broken red patches. The brush was too harsh to be used on something delicate as your face.</li>
            <li> I could see the difference in my skin right away.  It was glowing.  Other similar products make my face red.  These brushes are just perfect.  I purchased 2 sets of replacements already.</li>
            <li> I had to return it to Amazon bc the brush literally fell and crumbled in our hand.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Great until it just stopped working 3 months later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy at all. On the first day stop working. I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised I just wish it had multiple settings.Used it on my mom who never exfoliated before and shes now a fan.</li>
            <li> I like thank you so much ;)</li>
            <li> SO happy with this product! Speedy delivery and exactly what it looks like in the picture. Have used twice in the past 5days since receiving it and already feeling/seeing great results! Highly recommend it :-)</li>
            <li> Mine was great for a while. It&#x27;s not waterproof. The battery compartment slowly collected water and rusted the battery compartment and seeped rust colored water once I discovered the flaw. If it were truly waterproof, I otherwise would have loved it. It lasted 4ish months of light use.</li>
            <li> great little brush for the price</li>
            <li> The brush is a great product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford the Clarisonic system, so I purchased Youthful Advantage after reading reviews and researching prices. I have never used the Clarisonic, so I can&#x27;t compare this product to it, but I found that it works pretty well for the cost. I&#x27;ve read reviews in which it&#x27;s said that there isn&#x27;t enough power to rotate the brush once you press it against your skin, however I&#x27;ve had no problem with this. My guess is that they are pressing too hard against the skin...you need to use a light touch and let the bristles do the work. Using a hard, scrubbing motion will bog down the unit and render it ineffective. I use the facial brush with a light touch, sweeping from the center of my face outward and upward. I find my skin very smooth and soft afterwards. I&#x27;ve used this on a daily basis, and it does seem to help a little bit with diminishing the appearance of large pores, as well. The larger brush I&#x27;ve used on my chest and arms once or twice a week - it&#x27;s a little more abrasive than the facial brush and does a good job of exfoliating and smoothing. I have used the pumice attachment on dry feet, and I feel that it will smooth and reduce smaller calluses, but doesn&#x27;t really attack the larger ones very well. I think if you had a good pedicure once in a while, this would be great for maintenance in between. I haven&#x27;t used the sponge attachment for applying lotion, because it just seems unnecessary. If you had the time to give yourself a good facial treatment, then I would guess it would be a nice massage when used with some moisturizer. One cautionary bit of advice - do be careful of your hair when using the facial brush. It can get tangled in the unit if not pulled back.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product and service.</li>
            <li> I love this!  It works great and leaves smooth skin. It&#x27;s a hassle for me to get out but I try to use it every day</li>
            <li> I like this product but it has only two speed, and thats rip your face off and off. I am use to it now but IF you are a person with sensitive skin I would get a more gentle product. The positive about this is it comes with extra attachments. Good for other uses.</li>
            <li> This works great and my skin feels wonderful.  Not a miracle worker but deep cleans and leaves it glowing.  The large brush doesn&#x27;t work as well as it stops when you put any presser on it- there&#x27;s not enough torque. but small attachments are fine.</li>
            <li> workes better than I antipicated. My skin has drastically improved with a combo of this and the right soap.</li>
            <li> I just love this brush. This is my second one because somebody dropped and broke the first one. Fortunately, these are priced well so it was not a catastrophe.</li>
            <li> easy to use, good quality!</li>
            <li> I love this thing...it got great reviews so I thought I would give it a try.  Soft and kind to my face.  I like how my face feels after.  I will be buying one for my daughter to birthday or something.  Worth the money and surprisingly enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> I like it. I give it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a little ruff for my face and for my liking. I wish the brush was a bit softer. other then that, I love that I can leave it in the shower and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> So far this little machine seems to be quite robust. It does a good job of cleaning, especially with some soap on it. Seems to be clarifying and to ing my skin well. A bit of a breakout after the first use, but I suspect that is the impurity exiting the system!</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face, body and feet</li>
            <li> Exactly what I asked for.</li>
            <li> Really Love this item. I&#x27;ve been very happy with how it worked and my face feels so clean and smooth after using it. Was very happy with the price because other ones I looked at or $50 or more. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Quality product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> this thing is awesome! it feels amazing on your face, you can use your own cream on the brush and it really works its way into your pours. always hated puting the cream on my hands but this works better and i dont have to get that stuff on my hands anymore. the only thing is it took me my mom and dad to get the bottom of the device off to get the batteries in. you are supposed to push in on a space and pull but there is no give to the place where you push. it is waterproof so i guess its a good thing that its not easy to come off. definately would purchase again</li>
            <li> I love this product, my skin looks and feels different...the sponge works well also to apply my night cream. very practical</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Never happy with these things. Don&#x27;t know why I order one every 5 yrs or so.</li>
            <li> The box seems to have been opened when I receive it. Not impressed with the outcomes of using the product.</li>
            <li> This facial cleansing system works just as efficiently as many of the other systems which cost much more. We have only had is for a short while so we will update our experience with it as time goes by.</li>
            <li> I bought this facial brush because I struggle with ingrown hairs on the back of my legs. I have always been self conscience of it because the look like little pimples. I had a massage therapist tell me to use a scrub brush. I use the large body brush once a week and literally noticed a difference after the first time. My legs are almost back to normal and I&#x27;m very pleased. There are many attachments and they are all great! The facial one is perfect when I use my microderm abrasion cream. I feel like Ive been to a professional to get a facial! The only reason I gave this a 4 star was because the battery holder was impossible for me to open. I had to get my husband to squeeze it hard enough to get it open and put batteries in. I suppose it has to be firm hold because its waterproof and I use it in the bathtub. Anyway, I love it and recommend it for body scrubs, facials, and feet!</li>
            <li> Great product. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. It leaves the skin so smooth. Comes with 3 attachments. Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> The brushes and attachments make for a very nice product.</li>
            <li> This is a great item for hard to clean skin. works fantastic and make the skin fell rejuvenated and healthy.</li>
            <li> OKay, I was looking for the Vitagoods Spin For Perfect Skin review but didn&#x27;t find many on Amazon. So I decided to search for something Similar but without the high price tag; even though, I have a coupon  code for it! Anyway, I searched in the Amazon Box and found so many to choose from but the Youthful Advantage seem to have really great reviews! I decided to go with that product. So glad I did! It really works! I use it in the morning &amp; at night with my Phisoderm  Cream Cleaner &amp; Black Opal  Clear skin soap added with Vitamin E oil; Amazing!!!!!!!! I see a difference in my skin much more vibrant. I do suffer  from hyperpigmentation on small areas of my skin but not too much and I can see that it is cleansing away excessive dirt. I am very happy with my purchase I would recommend Youthful Advantage. The price point is reasonable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SN: still going to order the Vitagood. The only difference between the 2 is that Vitagoods has t2 brush heads instead of 1. And the Vitagoods brush is for sensitive skin!  Gotta use that Coupon......lol!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I have been sesrching for once again thank you for having it in stock, and at the right price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend. As far as I know it has worked without fault and is excellent</li>
            <li> This is the second brush I have bought because I love the results. I have clear skin in general but every now and then I would get a random pimple. I have been using this brush for over a year and find that I get random breakouts a lot less. It leaves my skin soft and clear. I&#x27;ve recommended this to a friend because I love the results. Just use a little exfoliating cream with it and you should notice a difference</li>
            <li> Off label use: At 72 yoa and with end stages COPD I simply can&#x27;t scrub my face and scalp hard or long enough to get clean because I get so short of breath there is a real danger of falling off the stool I sit on in the shower. I am male so keeping my hair cut short in a &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product pulls the brush thru my hair with no sweat and scrubs the accumulated dirt and dead skin cells from my face quickly and easily enough that I have enough energy left over to shave and finish my shower. BTW I do use the large brush on body trunk and extremities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s waterproof...Many kudos!!!</li>
            <li> Have not used this much as I fractured my ankle right after I got this so I need to get back to using it again. It works well for body, face, and the pumice stone is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had mine for a couple of days but so far I love it! I was worried that the bristles would be to soft or that it wouldn&#x27;t spin as fast as I would like but those worries have been put to rest. It functions just as I had hoped. I went through a ton of reviews on this and the other products like this and I am happy that I chose this one. The pumice works just ok, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of pumice stones any way. All the other brushes and especially the sponge to apply moisturizer work wonderfully. It really makes a big difference, my skin is noticeably smoother and softer. I&#x27;m just hoping I don&#x27;t run in to  on/off button problems like a few have mentioned. I did get a nice note from the company though and feel that they will remedy any issues I might have.</li>
            <li> I use the body brush on my face versus on my body.  The facial brush was too soft and it didn&#x27;t do a good job of removing the dead skin.  My skin looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> This cleansing system is awesome, very easy to use, really cleans and exfoliates your face, the body brush makes your skin so soft after just a few uses. I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a spa like experience at home..</li>
            <li> WOW, WOW, this is one of the best products I have received in a long time.  I am loving my shower time my skin feels and looks so soft, only been using for about a week now.</li>
            <li> This brush is good as far as the power it has &amp; the battery life . However the facial brushes feel a little rough on my face &amp; the pumice stone does not do a very good job.</li>
            <li> very good quality and fast shipping but better now use everyday on face since it&#x27;s deep cleaning!!</li>
            <li> I def enjoy this so much. I don&#x27;t know much about exfoliating but I use this daily. The first three days I broke out but I did not stop using it. It&#x27;s been a week and my acne has simmered. I truly like it! I would recommend if you have extremely oily skin like I do. The first day, I did not wake up with a shiny oily face like I normally would. And for that, I&#x27;m so pleased! As far as cleaning my pores, I don&#x27;t think it does the job. I mean, I&#x27;m left with little grey pores and some are cleaned but not all. So I give 4 stars cause it helps with my greasiness haha.</li>
            <li> I was not sure when I received the product, but when I used it, I was very pleased! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> LOVING my new face brush.  Haven&#x27;t used it any of the other attachments, but so far it has exceeded my expectations.  Well worth the money and so glad I didn&#x27;t spend more.</li>
            <li> I received my product only 3 days ago.  After only one use, my dull skin is glowing!  I love it!  Great customer service too.  Always kept me up to date on what was going on with my order and answered all of my questions within minutes.  I highly recommend the product and seller.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve only used the facial brush but my skin is so much clearer.  I even got 2 extra for my kids( they are 24 and 28 years old)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to store, clean and use! I love the feeling I get every time after I&#x27;ve used it! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks radiant after use.  Can&#x27;t believe I waitef this long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in treatment, but my skin look much better.</li>
            <li> I bought this to intensify the (expensive) facial cleansing and moisturizing product I&#x27;ve used for the past year which I totally love. Using the cleansing brush and sponge system daily for only 3 weeks has totally lightened and brightened my complexion.  Make-up application is totally flawless since I&#x27;ve been using this system.  I recommend it for anyone.  Will be purchasing for my teenage nieces to fight those blemishes and acne.</li>
            <li> The was the fastest delivery. It is a good product. I wish it had two speeds. Be sure not to hold the brush to firmly to you skin, the unit will stop. I love using it to put cream on. I would buy again. Dave from youthful Advantage contacted me to see if everything is ok. This is great customer service. I am the slow one lol.</li>
            <li> Although I have only been using this system for a few days, but after the first use I could tell a big difference in the smoothness of my face, which helps my skin absorb moisturizers.  The vendor Desetoasis International Marketing follows up with emails to ensure that I am not having any problems with this system, and gives helpful hints on using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few of these over the last few years and this is the first one that hasn&#x27;t been a complete disappointment. As with all of them, the weird sponge attachment is pretty useless, but I get a lot of use out of the rest. It doesn&#x27;t have more than one speed, unfortunately. Though the speed at which it operates is moderate and reasonable. The on/off button is a little weird—I think a simple up/down switch would have been better, but it&#x27;s not really a big issue. Some of these things cost a fortune and skimping will probably only cost you in the end. If you have the money to spend on something high end, it&#x27;s probably worth it, but if not, this is definitely the way to go. You won&#x27;t find a better deal.</li>
            <li> I love the big brush attachment and can&#x27;t wait until other large attachments are available. I have some cleansers but I would be interested in recommended ones that work best with this system.</li>
            <li> I simply love!&lt;br /&gt;My skin looked and felt great after using.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price for such a nice spa like feel!&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this facial brush as a promotional item and I&#x27;m happy to report my findings.&lt;br /&gt;The brush feels nice and relaxing on my face and I do feel that it&#x27;s making a difference in the overall appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to get too dramatic and say that my skin is GLOWING, but I have definitely noticed a &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; look since I&#x27;ve been using it. I am happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked at various facial brushes for several months and I finally decided to buy one. I chose this one based on the features, the price, and the reviews.  I got it the day before yesterday and used it on my face immediately and my face was incredibly smooth. I use facial scrubs a couple of times a week and I thought they worked great but this was amazing. I used the body brush yesterday morning with the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I finally decided to get this.</li>
            <li> My daughter got me this for mothers day and it&#x27;s the best gift ever. I use it every night on my face and it feels so much softer and I&#x27;ve had family members ask me if I were pregnant because they say my face looks like it&#x27;s glowing. Not sure if that&#x27;s a great recommendation or not lol.  I bring it in the tub with me and use the other brushes/tools that came with it. It&#x27;s like giving yourself a massage. Really!  Everything about this little tool is perfect. Even if I have to hunt it down occasionally because my daughter likes it as much as I do. Guess I know what to give her on her birthday.  This is the perfect gift for moms or their daughter&#x27;s, anyone who wants to feel pampered. I&#x27;m pretty sure guys would love it too if they could get past their ego! Their girlfriends would love it if they did, that&#x27;s if they don&#x27;t steal it from them first.</li>
            <li> I have used the clarisonic mia and settled for this after the mia broke down on me (after two years of use).  I ordered this to see if cheaper versions work - and not so much.  My face noticed the difference of not having the mia and I had to end up spending the money anway on a new one.  This one broke anyway the first time it fell in the shower - never had that problem with the mia and it was dropped several times over its lifetime.  Waste of money overall so I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my face works great. I recommend it to anyone it made my skin cleaner and shinny.</li>
            <li> I started using this product from two days and i already love this... my skin is soft and radiant... good product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it...it has only one speed..slow. And at the minimum pressure put on the spinning brush it stops. I have other facial brushes, they are smaller and have more power and I pressed them against my face and they keep spinning. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well, leaves skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment on time and when i use it for first time i feel my  skin fresh and clean .</li>
            <li> Feels nice to not have to use a dry brush to exfoliate my skin. I do wish it had a little more power but it is enough to get what I need done. It is also nice for a face exfoliator a couple times a week. And I love the pumice attachment no more rough heels.</li>
            <li> Very good product, received in a timely manner. I was looking for a water proof system, it stated it was water proof and I sure hope it is and will last longer than the olay one that I had.</li>
            <li> I picked one of these up to accompany an epilator. It does the job, but prepare to take your sweet time at it. To paraphrase one reviewer, its default speed is slow. Apply pressure if you want it to go even more slowly, and it will comply. If you&#x27;re patient, go for it. If not, I&#x27;d recommend investing a bit more into something like a sonic exfoliator or simply a 24 oz. jar of organic elbow grease.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift and not only does it cleanse deeply, but it exfoliates removing the dead skin while leaving the skin soft and smooth. A natural anti-aging product that is affordable and non-ablative. To add to that they offer a pumice stone to remove callouses on your feet, elbows and any rough patches on your body. HIGHLY recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product but no batteries</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about whether or not it is beneficial. It was purchased as a gift.  However the process of ordering and receipt was excellent.</li>
            <li> Awesome Skin Cleansing System Facial Brush &amp; Body System.  Easy to use and care for.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I received this cleansing system about a week and half ago and I have to say this product is phenomenal! I noticed the difference in my skin after the first use. My skin is softer, brighter and I have less irritations. I use regular face wash with the brush and ponds cold cream with the pad. This has become a part of my beauty regimen, I use the facial brush and moisturizing pad every morning and night and even have gotten my husband using it as well!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it has solved a skin problem because I have never had a skin problem in my life! But because it is an implement with a handle, it is much neater to use than a dripping wet wash cloth running down your arms to your elbows.. Washing neck, front to back easily accomplished, too. If they ever have a Miss Octogenarian contest I am sure to win it - but they will l have to hurry. I am on a collision course with 87 right now.&lt;br /&gt;June 1 update - heard a loud \\&quot;pop\\&quot; coming from bathroom. Investigated. Cleansing system cap (where batteries are stored) had flown off, two batteries on the floor along with the cap. Obviously defective latching on inside of cap. Can&#x27;t make it stay tight to hold batteries in - so basically  I paid about $10 a face washing as I can see no 800# on literature to call them. What is the area code for China? (Joke)</li>
            <li> Flimsy- stopped working after a week. Buy the Clarisonic instead. It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Great product for exfoliating!</li>
            <li> Love all the attachments!</li>
            <li> Works well.  (Used it to remove dead skin.)&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing system.  I would not be with out it.</li>
            <li> Awesome set...love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for exfoliating and cleansing.  The pumice wheel can be used for feet and elbows.  The polisher is also a nice addition.  I am most pleased with this product.  Shipping was fast and the packaging was good.</li>
            <li> This is an okay brush. Too heavy for my liking and didn&#x27;t do anything special for my skin. Although the price is reasonable, it&#x27;s still a waste of money if I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast and I was excited to use the product. I use a mild cleanser on my face and it has helped with the distribution and the way it makes my face feel really smooth. I researched this product before I bought it. Only downside is that I wish there was a bigger pumice stone.</li>
            <li> Works well, love the different attachments.  Only negative is it has no holder/stand, which I&#x27;ve seen with other similar products.</li>
            <li> I have used this Facial Brush and Body cleansing system twice now and can already feel the difference in the way my skin feels.  It&#x27;s amazing how something that feels this good can also be good for your skin.  The good part is, it&#x27;s not just for your face.  I can&#x27;t believe how well the pumice stone works to remove the dead skin on my feet.  My husband being diabetic, love it when I use it on his feet to remove the callouses and dry skin.  This cleansing system works great on any part of my body I want to feel extra clean and free of dead skin.  I would recommend getting this system for any age group who wants their skin feeling renewed.</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS CLEANSING SYSTEM FACIAL BRUSH TO REPLACE A PRODUCT OF SAME WITH ANOTHER BRAND I BOUGHT FOR MY HUSBAND.  I GOT YOURS DO TO YOU HAVE AN ON AND OFF SWITCH. SO.. SO FAR SO GOOD. ..  IT&#x27;S ONLY A WEEK SO FAR, ..  SHIPPING WAS GREAT.. ORDERED IT IN THE MORNING AND GOT IT THAT SAME NIGHT.. AWESOME !!</li>
            <li> Great! already seeing results and it&#x27;s only been a few days since I&#x27;ve started to use this youthful advantage product.</li>
            <li> I have had a facial complexion brush for over thirty years.  I have a second home and sometimes forget to pack my complexion brush.  I have searched for years to find a brush of this quality.  I used it for the first time this past weekend and absolutely love it.  I might admit that I love it more than my original complexion brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to be of very high quality and should last for many years.  I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> The product has been a great purchase. I would recommend this product to others.  Great price for this product. All I needed was for a carrying case to accompany the product.</li>
            <li> THE FACE BRUSH IS MY FAVORITE!!! LATHERS SOAP WELL AND YOU FEEL THE CLEAN WHEN YOU ARE DONE.THE FOOT ABRASIVE BRUSH ALSO WORKS GREAT. I DONT WASH WITHOUT IT. TAKE IT INTO SHOWER OR OVER SINK.</li>
            <li> I did not like it at all, very poor quality. I couldn&#x27;t even place the batteries! I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it. My skin looks and feels better great product. Buy with confidence.great customer support. Thanks for sending valuable information</li>
            <li> Great facial exfoliating brush.  I use this daily as part of my morning skincare regiment.  Helps to exfoliate dead skin cells and comes with multiple different brush heads.  I also use the pumice stone to exfoliate my feet which works well too.</li>
            <li> I really like this unit. I felt the difference after my first time using it. Highly recommend it to everyone of all skin types.</li>
            <li> I first bought one for myself.  I liked it so much that I bought six more for presents.  Does that tell you how great it is?!</li>
            <li> I love my face brush, my face feels really soft when I use the brush.  The brush brush was a little harsh in the beginning but there again it really lathers up the soap and leaves your skin feeling great.  I would highly recommend the skin cleansing system to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush system!! I feel like I am going to the spa everyday! Highly recommend especially for the great price.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it.......works flawlessly in the shower, batteries last...........</li>
            <li> I really liked this at first but after a few months the cover for the battery just falls off. It falls off when I grab it, it falls off when I try to use it. It just doesn&#x27;t stay on anymore.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Package arrived sooner than expected in excellent shape. Before I got a chance to use it, I tried it on my hubby who was exhausted and sore after a very hard day at work. Being the &amp;#34;mad scientist&amp;#34; at heart in my home experimenting all the time, I stripped him down, slathered him with coconut oil and hyaluronic acid and then turned the product on using the bigger brush. I slowly massaged the oil in, head to toe. He said the brush was gentle and very soothing like several hands were at work. Next thing I heard was snoring. (Said all that to say he loved it! ) Now it&#x27;s my turn to use it (I bought it for me.)</li>
            <li> Amazing! i noticed the difference on my skin right away. i use it with clearasil for sensitive skin and ive noticed my acne was going away within the week. Since i have such dry-peely skin (&amp; any kind of lotion/moisturizer makes me break out) i use the pumice head for my face instead of my feet which is recommended. the battery cap was hard to remove at first but other than that it is a great product!</li>
            <li> Just received this yesterday and used the facial cleansing brush this morning.  It is a much softer brush than I&#x27;ve been using and feels good on my skin.  I&#x27;m expecting great things.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it five stars if I had used the other attachments.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be a great as the one I used.</li>
            <li> Works great, clearer skin, and always a nice refreshed feeling after use.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box this thing didn&#x27;t work. I switched battery and nothing happened. The construction is cheap, very low quality plastic. I purchased as a gift to my wife, what a dissapoinment.</li>
            <li> Nice skin cleansing brush and more reasonably priced than similar brushes. I have noticed improvement in my skin since using it. However, I didn&#x27;t find the sponge attachment very useful or lasting. Looking to replace the brushes soon but its not clear from the packaging where to buy the replacements for this unit.</li>
            <li> I like it so far. Easy to use. Not too rough. Can use less face scrub/soap with this because the spinning bubbles it up making a little go a long way. I wish it had a stand come with it. Or a suction cup to hang in the shower or something. Now iI&#x27;m curious about the one with more speeds.&lt;br /&gt;Received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I walk by a mirror maybe 30 times a day and look at my face.  My face is my calling card and lately, my face looks tired; its creases and wrinkles appear exaggerated.  When my face looks like this my mood isn&#x27;t too good.  My current facial cleansing system isn&#x27;t doing the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Youthful Advantage Cleansing Skin Care System about three weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles of the small brush are gentle yet powerful enough to remove dead skin cells and clean out pores; I feel it gently massaging my face and see actual immediate results.  After the first week my husband commented, \\&quot;Your facial skin looks healthy; it has sheen to it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While washing my face I spend about 30 to 60 seconds with the rotating brush at the area between my brows at the bridge of my nose to help relax those deep stress creases.  Results vary but I do see those lines decreasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the cleanse I apply a hydrating moisturizer using the rotating face sponge.  I&#x27;ve never applied moisturizer in this manner and feel like I&#x27;m getting a soft professional massage.  I do know that regularly massaging skin helps increase circulation which stimulates blood flow.  The result is supple and radiant skin.  The sponge cleans easily with plain water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared with other facial cleansing systems this unit feels stronger; my skin is getting a good workout.  The on/off button has a better touch; it&#x27;s easy to turn on and off.  One speed is sufficient (for me).  The unit needs 4 AA batteries (not included).  The battery panel is easy to remove and batteries simple to install.  The quality of this system is superior to my last facial cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a great gift idea and inexpensive introduction to pampering face care.  The best is that friends and family notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product, lines are already disappearing and i feel like this is another way to love my body...an all over body care product : )</li>
            <li> I have a condition that makes my skin very susceptible to sores and bleeding: LYMPHEDEMA. I walk a tightrope between not scrubbing enough to remove black crusty skin that forms after a successful bout with cellulitis and creating sores that weeps a light green fluid that is the product of white cells that fought the cellulitis back to a state of dormancy. When I scrub too hard this putrid greenish liquid comes out by the quarts and floods the bed while sleep. I told you all of this to explain how important it is to find just the right tool to scrub and successful walk that tightrope, without going over every time. AMEN ken. PS I found it also needs a set screw to help keep the battery cover from coming off during serious scrubbing. I placed a 1/4 inch long by 1/8 inch in diameter screw right in the spot where the ridges are located for your thumb to push to open the battery case. IT&#x27;S STILL THE BEST I&#x27;VE USED EVER. THANK YOU TO THE SELLERS AND MANUFACTURES OF THIS PRODUCT....I PRAY THOSE OUT THERE WITH LYMPHEDEMA FIND THIS REVIEW..</li>
            <li> It was ok would of gave 5 stars if it was different speeds. Dislike the fact that it uses 4 batteries!</li>
            <li> Just received this product and have used it half a dozen times. Already noticing results. The pores on my nose are visibly smaller. In addition, I have received two helpful emails from the seller about how to use the scrubber to its best advantage. Fantastic customer service!</li>
            <li> This works great! I use it in the evenings. The body brush is wonderful.</li>
            <li> very impressed with their customer service!  love the product</li>
            <li> Product arrived broken in box because Attachments are glued with a thin layer of adhesive. Flimsy product that looks like a toy rather than a hygienic device. Returned immediately.</li>
            <li> I found the facial brush to be too rough on the face, and I don&#x27;t have a sensitive skin. The foot brush is too weak and doesn&#x27;t take much. The price is good, and delivery was fast. I wish some kind of pouch would be included to store the items.</li>
            <li> I was very excite to try this product. When it arrived, I inserted the batteries and it did not work, just as another reviewer had mentioned. After I played around with it a while, it would come on but seemed as tho there was a short in it. So, I&#x27;m going to exchange it and hope that the next one is better because this product has the best reviews!</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter are extremely happy with this product. They have only used it for a week. I know that is not very long and who knows how it will hold up over time. Both are raving at how smooth their face is after each use. This seller is A+. They give extra information after your purchase. This seems to be a great product.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just get this straight, this kit was not for me. It was for my girlfriend. And she loves it. I saw it and thought it would be a great gift. I had seen her looking at a few sets like this one at the store and so I thought I would buy it for her. Turns out she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I even tried it on my face and it is pretty cool and powerful too.&lt;br /&gt;I did have to buy four AA batteries for it. But a great set.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  The brush leaves my face so soft and supple.  Great exfoliation. The pumice attachment is great for a &amp;#34;once in a while&amp;#34; treatment as my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> I had some problems with my first unit, but it was correctly in a speedy fashion by their customer service. Very effective for skin exfoliation and am glad I have purchased.</li>
            <li> My unit came with a battery cover that does not stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requesting refund.</li>
            <li> I have never seen an item of lower quality.  This broke in 3 days of moderate use. The head just stopped turning..</li>
            <li> I purchase 2 cleansing systems for me &amp; my boyfriend we love it!!! We use the face and body exfoliator mostly and would purchase again in a heartbeat!!</li>
            <li> good product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I really love this cleansing skin care system.  It is easy to use and is not too harsh on my skin.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is the first cleansing brush system I&#x27;ve purchased and it seems to work great!</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to keep the hair around my face from getting grabbed, even though I have my hair tied back. Other than that I like the product.</li>
            <li> I had never owned a scrubber....but I have a great one now!!!  what a delight ......I am 75 and love the way my skin feels and looks.....others have noticed and are good enough to tell me they notice.</li>
            <li> A very good tool in my beauty routine to exfoliote and for the morning and evening cleansing of my face. Included are a body brush to use in the shower and one to use  with my moisturizer. Another brush can help with  foot problems, as removal of callus&#x27; and the softening of the skin that tends to become dried and hardened on the bottom of the feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every woman needs such a tool in her daily beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Great product. It was for a Christmas gift and the recipient was excited!</li>
            <li> Hubby got me this for Christmas! Of course I asked for it! I love it</li>
            <li> Good cleanser for clean face. This works perfectly to remove dirt and dead cells. I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;But within 3 uses the small brush head lost its shape .</li>
            <li> This exfoliating set has it all.  Very good value.</li>
            <li> This is mediocre at best.  It stated waterproof but in first week the pumice stone fell out. I kept the large brush for the body.  Discarded the rest and purchased a Clarisonic facial system which I am very happy with.</li>
            <li> the take careful care about the stuff to make sure they arrive safe, the quality is very good I love it , I will buy butters to start right away ^_^</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  I am very pleased with it.  I wanted something to scrub my face &amp; exfoliate.  I would definiately</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described.  It is comfortable and easy to use...simply put, it just plain ole feels good!</li>
            <li> Worth the money. Been using for about a week now and my skin definitely looks brighter. Only complaint is that the sponge attachment grew mold for some reason after I used it with my face cream and I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> The different attachments are great and if you want replacement attachments they are only about 10 bucks on amazon! My skin feels different and my face feels cleaner! I&#x27;m Loving it!</li>
            <li> I was contacted before I actually got the product--how&#x27;s that for prompt.&lt;br /&gt;I had a little problem with the battery cover seating properly, so they replaced it right away. The faulty piece is on its way back to the manufacturer; and, I&#x27;m using my new facial brush, appreciating the level of cleanliness it offers.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this product and sent back for refund. Could not keep the battery compartment closed.</li>
            <li> I love my new Facial &amp; Body Cleansing System! I&#x27;ve owned a few from other companies &amp; I must say, this is the best one yet! Although it only has one speed, that is all it really needs. One of my others that I owned which I paid twice as much for, had 2 speeds and on the highest speed, it wasn&#x27;t as fast as this one is. It feels so good on my skin that it&#x27;s hard to stop using it. I have had this one a little less than a month &amp; already I can see a huge improvement in my facial lines and small wrinkles and my feet are not as itchy &amp; dry as they used to be since using the big body brush &amp; pumice stone on them. Customer Service is also great when you register your system with Desetoasis International Marketing, LLC.  I had received emails from them after registering my system reminding me to write my review here on Amazon and asking if I was satisfied with my system &amp; getting special offers. Last week I noticed a small crack had come in the back of the battery door. I was worried that water would start leaking into the battery compartment. So I emailed the guy that had been emailing me from Desetoasis International Marketing, LLC about this crack. All he ask was that I send him a picture of the crack and he said that he&#x27;d replace it. So I did that &amp; I received my new system yesterday. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a complete new system, but that&#x27;s what I got! So, it&#x27;s nice to know that they really do stand behind their products. Not too many companies do that anymore! Especially without having to send the damaged one back. Therefore, if you&#x27;re looking for a good skin cleansing system, I highly recommend this Skin Cleansing System!</li>
            <li> It was very usefull and it helps a lot</li>
            <li> I asked for a refund. I couldn&#x27;t open the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this item.</li>
            <li> receive the product and I love it so far no problem. I think in the future if you up grade this product I think it should have a carry bag or case to store the product in once you open it.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with the first one due to the handle not staying closed with the batteries in it.  The company reached out to me and said it sounded like there was an issue with it and sent me a new one free of charge.  The replacement one is better (seems to stay closed where the batteries go), but I do not like it because it spins WAY TOO SLOW.  I purchased this one after replacing my Proactiv brush that broke, but I ultimately purchased the new and improved Proactiv brush and love it.  I only use this brush in the morning when I wash my face at the bathroom sink and use the Proactiv brush in the shower for a nice deep clean.  So, due to the extremely slow spin speed I do not recommend this product.  However, I will say the customer service is good.</li>
            <li> I really like the facial system by youthful advantage. My skin feels fleaner and smoother than it does when washing with a scrubby</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and am pleasantly surprised at the change in the feel of my skin.  Its been amazing!</li>
            <li> I really only use the facial cleaning brush, but I LOVE it in the mornings when I&#x27;m not taking a shower, but still need to wash my face. I&#x27;ve noticed a few more breakouts, but its the same concept after a facial. You&#x27;re going to get a few more breakouts, but that&#x27;s because your face is getting super clean. My pores look a lot better, the blackheads are less. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made since I deployed!</li>
            <li> Its a nice product. Much better price than the name brand. It seems to help get my face clean and take off dead skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for four days and my face feels so much cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li> Good product, works as promised and does great with smoothing out my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the coils that connect to the battery fell off but I can put it into place and it still works.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased the expensive brand of product that does this... I can&#x27;t imagine it could do anything different than this one dos.  This has all the attachments and I do use all but one!  Love it!</li>
            <li> You should correct the English on the box so it doesn&#x27;t appear like a foreign &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; product. Its ok. I wish I spent more on a better product. Not much power and not rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Immediately returned this uniy because the battery compartment would not close properly and when I got batteries into it and turned it on it barely rotated the brush. I did receive good customer support from this company and they were disappointed that this unit did not function properly. They did offer to replace the unit but I declined because I did not think this unit had enough power to properly scrub the skin as advertised. I would buy from this company again if the product had more power.</li>
            <li> Great price and easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is my first skin care system. I really (really) like it. I&#x27;m almost 64, my skin is important to me, so I take good care of it. I do my research carefully before buying anything that&#x27;s going to touch it. Now, common sense told me a few things; if it is going in a circular motion, keep my hair pulled back or it&#x27;s gonna grab it and hurt. Don&#x27;t use a high amt. of abrasive while you&#x27;re learning. And do not take a brush that&#x27;s whipping around and put it on a pimple or sore and expect it to not hurt or improve it. Do not use it for forty minutes and expect to not have a red face. I use it as long as it takes to go over my face well, less than five minutes. I had a mosquito bite on my cheek and avoided it.  The product works well. My face feels and looks clean. I can tell that it&#x27;s getting to the pores on my nose and cleaning them out (yes!). My skin is absorbing my moisturizer better. I do like this system a lot, I like how it makes my skin look fresh. And I like pampering myself. Big thumbs up. And yes, the battery cover takes effort to get off, which I expected with a water proof product. But follow the directions and no problem!  When this wears out, I&#x27;ll buy another one. Cannot beat the price for what it does!</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 6 weeks.  The motor turns on but does not spin the hex nut that spins the brush.  It really helped my complexion and skin tone while it worked.  I&#x27;ll probably buy another similar product but stick with a name brand.  :(  Does their customer service read these reviews?  Can you help?</li>
            <li> this product works great it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> Love this. Leaves me feeling a oft and clean. Helps with bumps on my arms!</li>
            <li> Although I have to be careful as I have extremely dry/sensitive skin, I am in love with this brush. I have used it on my face where I have no eczema and I have noticed an improvement in tone and softness.</li>
            <li> I was waiting more good brush. it works very slowly. I dont like it.</li>
            <li> I had bought two Spa Sonic Systems in the past four months, and both of them are now broken.  I was looking for an alternative, and this one turned out to be so much better.  The brush spins faster, the bristles are a little more abrasive (not overly so), and it feels much more durable.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like the difference that this product has made in my skin. I wanted a more expensive system but just couldn&#x27;t. Im glad that I didn&#x27;t. This works excellent for me!</li>
            <li> It broke within a month.  Will buy another one soon.</li>
            <li> Love the rotating brush. I searched for a product that had some great power. The rotating brushes are super great. The price was perfect for the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality product!</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price.  It does not have an electric recharging system, just batteries the owner installs, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush to help with my skin and it came in two days! I love the different brushes it comes with. I used the small brush this morning to exfoliate my face and then I used the soft sponge to put on moisturizer afterwards and my skin has felt soft and smooth all day! The brush makes the products you use go into your pores so it stays on better and longer.  I recommend this to anyone with problem skin.</li>
            <li> Very professional , I love it .</li>
            <li> We love this system.  It is just what we wanted &amp; couldn&#x27;t find in any store in town.</li>
            <li> All the cheap, Chinese knock-off face scrubbers out there are basically the same. Choose based on the attachments you want.    This particular scrubber is pretty good. Spins just fast enough for the heads that are included with it. The bristles on the smaller scrubber are very soft. It&#x27;s basically the only attachment that my wife and I use, but it&#x27;s enough. The battery life also seems pretty good, been using semi-daily for about a month now and it&#x27;s still going strong.    Even though it is so cheap, this device seems pretty solidly made. It&#x27;s got some heft when you hold it in your hand and the plastic does not creak or flex like you might expect. In order to maximize the life of this scrubber, I recommend NOT leaving it in the shower when you&#x27;re done using it. Take the attachment off, shake it and the handle to get most of the water off, then set it out on a shelf or counter to dry.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. This is my first experience with such a device so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m qualified to say much else. Works well. My skin has never been so soft</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these brushes, one for my son who has austium, he loves it. and one for me.  I recommend this product for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Lasted  about 2weeks after putting in New battery quit running.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very reasonable price</li>
            <li> Takes AA batteries. Fell apart on first use!</li>
            <li> Great brush. I can see a difference in my skin texture and the way it feels and looks when I put on makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not like the Clarisonic, as it is less powerful and the brushes just don&#x27;t seem to be the right sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Very good to your face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> Glad we purchased this unit. Works good. Skin feels clean.</li>
            <li> I love my facial brush! ! Cleans my face so well, feels refreshed.</li>
            <li> The brushes and pumice stone attachments are great. What I don&#x27;t like about this is how weak it is. Compared to my Clarisonic it just feels broken. Not only that but the battery cover won&#x27;t stay on. Every time I turn the thing on the battery cover pops off. It just feels cheap. I guess you get what you pay for here. I will be returning and spending a little more money on a better quality product.</li>
            <li> I love this new item that I got. I have only had it for about a week but I have seen an improvement in my skin. The brush for my face was a bit abrasive at first but has become more comfortable with use. I have yet to use the pumas rock that was included in the kit. But overall, well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good hard to replace the batteries</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Especially good for exfoliation and keeping skin bright!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent facial cleansing brush. I am very satisfied. My skin became soft, smooth, bright and shining. I recommend it to all women !!! It helps to enjoy the beautiful skin every day. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Great product ! I love it. Works great in the shower too . Has made a huge difference In skin tone and texture in just a week . Will be buying a couple as Christmas gifts ;)  super easy transaction and fast shipment too .</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product, only purchased the one speed version but seems to be more than adequate and the unit is comfortable in her hands during use.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to consume a lot of power as it&#x27;s been close to two months of daily use and the batteries are holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> Battery compartment keeps slipping off and it doesn&#x27;t even have a waterproof seal. Quite disappointing because it is supposed to be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> I possibly got a defective product, but when I received it, I tried 3 different sets of new batteries and none of them worked,&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews about this product, i was excited to use it, but unfortunatelly was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The merchandise looked okay, just okay, but the package seems not best quality. So, i am assuming that this product is an inexpensive version of the original one.&lt;br /&gt;However, i could not contact the seller to return the item, so i contacted the Amazon team - and they solved the problem immediately. The item is returned.&lt;br /&gt;However, the manager from seller did contact me afterwards, but nothing was needed at that time.</li>
            <li> I had a Clarisonic for two years until I wore it out!  I tried this system and am very impressed.  It does a great job with a fraction of the price!!</li>
            <li> It does work. Just make sure that you get the most powerful batteries. Have only tried the scrub head at this point.</li>
            <li> Great product ! Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> I like this, but the motor is slow or weak.</li>
            <li> Broken after a month of use. It just stopped working. I changed batteries a couple of times but it wont turn back on. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I use this brush every single day.  All the attachments are fantastic and work great.  Most of all, I love the fact that its much cheaper than other name brand counterparts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rec&#x27;d several emails asking for my review of this item. Cannot review it because I can&#x27;t get the battery cap off it. Perhaps when company comes for Christmas, a manly-man can give it a try. Otherwise, it will be trashed, too much trouble to return it. Yes, I read the Instructions, read the Answers here about the difficulty of removing cap. It refuses to budge.  UPDATE:  January 2, 2015  Previously I could not get the cap to budge. Husband refused to try, said what good is a product you can&#x27;t operate yourself? So.. I had a couple other guys try around Christmas... both said it was wedged too tightly, might cause damage to keep trying. Aargh!   Manipulative me, knowing husband can&#x27;t resist a challenge... I placed the unit on the table and left it there. He soon picked it up, made some manly grunting noises...with zero results.. so unit and husband disappeared into garage. I have no idea what he did, but I knew he would beat it into submission, or kill it. Happily, he returned with the cap OFF! ... YAY! .. and unit none the worse for his efforts, whatever they were, but I suspect tools were involved.   Outcome: I used it on face and arms. Facial brush a tad bit rough, but effective. Body brush just right. Of course husband said the weak motor is a joke, but he doesn&#x27;t get to use it, just me. So far, I like it.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!! my face has been clearer and the batteries don&#x27;t die quickly</li>
            <li> I received my Facial brush kit and it is just what I wanted for a gift...... thank you.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this i just received it and im so very pleased i used it on my stomach just once yet and my stomack already looks like i never had a baby:) i will be usinq it more till i qet the results i want!</li>
            <li> The skin care system is a professional cleaning system has rotating head provide a micro massage of the skin that removes dead skin cells. This cleans pores and helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles while leaving your skin extra soft and radiant. I noticed a difference in my skin from the very first time I tried the the skin care system. It left my face feeling soft and smooth. There wasn&#x27;t one fleck of dry skin. I recently purchased the youthful advantage facial brush and Body Cleansing Skin care and thought how good can it be for such a small device that works with batteries. I could not believe how much power was packed in this handy little device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been suffering from a lot of breakouts I tried the small bush first on my face. My face felt clean and oil free after the first wash, I immediately felt the difference. Next I tried the big body brush in the shower with one of my favorite scrubs, I felt like I just came from the spa. Last but not least was the pumice stone, which removed the dead skin and callouses with ease. This is a remarkable cleansing system and I highly recommend it for everyday use.And after of my time of using it, I noticed a marked decline in black heads and pimples.</li>
            <li> Great little gadget for the price. Does everything (and more) than far more expensive models. The included brush heads are a nice addition. Well made and works great. Love the big body brush. You will see an improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and LOVE IT!  Makes my skin feel wonderful!  What&#x27;s also amazing is that I still haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries.  The vendor is so conscientious and gave me fantastic service.  I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> I love it and use it every day</li>
            <li> A little disappointed  that the original packaging was covered with youthful advantage sticker.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I use it every night. Good price and product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my appearance seem more attractive&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to store, clean and use! I love the feeling I get every time after I&#x27;ve used it! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good brush for a great price. Bought a different and quickly went back to this one</li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to try it fully. I purchased it to replace a different system that I received as a gift many years ago which finally died. :(  This one seems about the same, very easy to use. I really like it.</li>
            <li> At first we were very excited about the new purchse and skin cleaning system.  Unfortunately the unit only lasted for a short time and after trying to clean it and replace the batteries it still doesnt work :( My teenage daughter is pretty bummed since she is such a avid face washer and used it daily.</li>
            <li> Quit working the second time I used it.  Replacing the batteries did not help.  Disappointed  in the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Received defective, the battery cover does not stay on with batteries in it. Seem to be having a difficult time attempting to return  it...</li>
            <li> This works well. Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This a very competent tool.  When my Clarisonic broke, I was&#x27;t about to shell out another $225.00.  While this does not compare with a Clarisonic, I can be very enthusiastic about it for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it. That&#x27;s all that matters to me.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel. Its gentle on my face but exfoliates well, is great for dry brushing and for using in the shower. It makes you feel like you&#x27;re getting a massage as you exfoliate</li>
            <li> This is a great cleansing brush set, I have used it 3 times since I purchased it a week ago and it gets my face nice and clean and gets rid of the dead cells. The only thing that I wish it had was a little higher/faster setting for using the stone attachment.</li>
            <li> Work ok but not the name brand packaging.  Not sure if it was the real thing or a knock off.  But works</li>
            <li> I like the product however the place where the batteries go does not latch and stay on  and when I tried to return it I was told that I could not. Now I could see if I had it for a long time but I have only had it for about a week. So I guess I will have to use Duct tape to hold the end on which as far as I&#x27;m concerned I should not have to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking that it would at least be somewhat reliable and equivalent to some of the better facial brushes.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  The compartment where the batteries are held will not even stay closed once the batteries are installed.  The batteries extend too far above the unit and the latching mechanism is not strong enough to keep it  closed.  Once I attached the brush and locked it into place it pushed the batteries completely out of the unit.  The only way to use this unit is if you tape the battery compartment shut.  Very dissappointed!</li>
            <li> love this and it is has different ways to use it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> works great,checked other products and this had the best warranty and attachments.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, well for the four months it worked. It seems the battery area isn&#x27;t as water tight as it needs to be. I was very careful to make sure it was closed tightly after each battery change. The first time I noticed a tiny wet area so I was very careful to close and check it closely. Same with the second time. After another month it just stopped working. Thinking it was the batteries, I opened it up. WET! I left it open to dry for several days and even tried to use a Qtip to help the drying. Nope. Dead.&lt;br /&gt;Wished it had been a better product.</li>
            <li> This skin cleansing system is awful! It says it&#x27;s waterproof but it&#x27;s not, battery compartment gets water in it. I tried to be careful and nothing worked, it still got water in it. The brush isn&#x27;t very gentle.  Also the batteries have to be replaced often. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> stopped working after 4 times -.-</li>
            <li> I love it! It does a great job. You feel pampered when you&#x27;re done. The instructions that come with this system are also very detailed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment repeatedly popped open allowing water into the battery chamber. As this product is made for use in the shower, it is a significant problem. I couldn&#x27;t find a phone number or email for customer service at the youthful advantage website and was not able to return this product to Amazon even though I owned it less than 4 weeks. I do not recommend!</li>
            <li> Great Cleansing system.  I love it</li>
            <li> purchased for wife as xmas present, will know more after she opens it. Have to say i was stunned how fast it arrived...</li>
            <li> Great product arrived on time easy to use and economical.</li>
            <li> My other half loves it and uses it every day</li>
            <li> I love this system!!! I has done wonders to my skin already!!!! I would recommend this system to anyone who wants a quality unit for an affordable price. I am so very impressed!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> it is not like a clarisonic.  The brush rotates.  I thought it was waterproof yet it died after 4 uses.</li>
            <li> Great value for money. Item was delivered on time, and it works!</li>
            <li> Received on time. Well packed. Product exactly as advertised. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I have purchased very similar brush systems and am quite happy with this one. It has held up well and the guarantee is a big plus. After going for a couple months without a brush system I noticed an immediate improvement in my skin. I am prone to acne and this cleared right up. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders for my skin all over, a game changing product for me personally, I find myself looking forward to the next time I&#x27;m going to be using it</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and clearer than it ever has. My husband really seen some great results from using the pumice attachment on his heavily hard heels and  callouses on his feet. The best part of this unit are reasonably  priced sturdy construction, waterproof, variety of attachments that snap on and off with ease and the great looking skin results&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been suffering from a lot of breakouts I tried the small bush first on my face. My face felt clean and oil free after the first wash, I immediately felt the difference. Next I tried the big body brush in the shower with one of my favorite scrubs, I felt like I just came from the spa. Last but not least was the pumice stone, which removed the dead skin and callouses with ease. I am very happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with the results so far! Thankfully I am part of the 95% that benefits from using a skin brush. When I tried the sensitive brush head, it cleaned my skin well and doesn&#x27;t feel too soft or too harsh. I&#x27;ve used it every day for 2-3 minutes and my skin has not had any negative effects. My skin feels smoother and looks brighter after using it. I have acne-prone skin and my acne has been healing faster. It exfoliates the blemishes and they appear less red. They also are smaller after being cleansed, and dry out faster. Once the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;outer layer of dry skin has been removed with the brush, my skin absorbs acne medicine, serum, and moisturizer so much better. I have to use much less product. The acne medicine seems to absorb and work better.This is a remarkable cleansing system and I highly recommend it for everyday use.

            <li> This is better than a Clarisonic that didn&#x27;t last but a year! Highly recommend..</li>
            <li> This is a  great product for a good price.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, it&#x27;s just as good as the higher priced product.  The brushes and other attachments are great!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and like all the different brush sizes, seems to apply my makeup very smoothly</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It makes your skin feel so clean and soft.  I have had simular brushes before, but this one works much more efficiently.  I particularly like the body brush, it&#x27;s so luxurious.</li>
            <li> After only a couple weeks of use my complexion has improved quite a lot. I only use once a day.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Rare these days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it the shower in the morning... and at the skin at night before bed... glad i bought it...</li>
            <li> Love this brush and it is a great deal because it is for every part of the body.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I needed something to use on my hands. When I saw this included a head w/ pumice stone I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It worked great! This was by far our most harsh winter and I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get my hands back to normal, but I did. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not what the attachment was designed for, I&#x27;m sure it was for the feet!</li>
            <li> Good for the face, the body, and the feet!</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this cleaner. It really rubs and twists the skin&lt;br /&gt;when used. I don&#x27;t want to cause anymore wrinkles than I&lt;br /&gt;already have, so I very rarely use it. ;-(</li>
            <li> My Opinion?  The same or BETTER than it&#x27;s rival!  You know? ....those that cost 100(s) bucks MORE.  And comes with attachments!  Haven&#x27;t completely submerged it in water either.  Feels the same as my old Mia Clarisonic - oops.  Being honest😉</li>
            <li> My wife and mother in law love it!</li>
            <li> This thing works like a dream! It removes dead skin cells incredibly well! Great for getting rid of blackheads too. And it feels good. You need one of these.</li>
            <li> excellent product, quick shipping</li>
            <li> I received the item very quickly but unfortunately it did not work no matter how many batteries I tried.  So back this item is going.&lt;br /&gt;How sad. :(</li>
            <li> My face was starting to feel &amp;#34; fuzzy &amp;#34;  because of dry skin and after the first use of this it was amazing how soft and smooth it felt.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little product and I love it, so far.  I have only used the small brush and sponge on my face and I like the way it makes my skin feel when I&#x27;m finished.  I wish I could buy just the individual replacement heads instead of the whole set.  Maybe they will sell them that way when I am ready for replacement parts.</li>
            <li> Have noticed big improvement with my face feeling much smoother. The other attachments are an additional benefit. Got rid of rough spots on my feet. Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> After a week of using the facial brush with the Ocean Drive skin care line, my skin is as soft and supple as a baby&#x27;s behind.  Friends at dinner last night commented on how pretty my skin looked.  This is a great product.  I&#x27;m going to start working on my dry feet next with the pumice wheel and am expecting very good results.  I am addicted to this product and know that the results rival any $100+ facial I have received.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Just received it, and only used it once. I could feel the difference.  My face felt smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> i never used such a thing before as i thought it was a women thing until i read some reviews about it. i&#x27;m surprised that no one is taking that men should use this. it cleans well and leaves my skin fresh and tight. i also found that shaving is much better after using it. the body brush is amazing i used it once a week. i love this product so much that the i order two, one as a gift, the other as a backup for me, just in case.</li>
            <li> Some of these facial brushes are veryyy expensive.  This is priced right and does a great job. love it. I travel a lot, so these is easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Works fine but I wish the spin on the brush would be faster especially in the shower.</li>
            <li> Good product. Great price</li>
            <li> My 55+ skin needs help and always loves spa facials, but I hate the expense! I also purchased micro-crystals to use with this and the results were great. I used it on my face, neck and decollete area. Excellent price as well. I just sent one to my younger sister for a surprise present.</li>
            <li> Zero performance with this s***y ass product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful skin cleansing system.  Has everything you need right at your fingertips.  Great quality and works well when it&#x27;s wet.  Highly recommend this system.</li>
            <li> Good product, does what it says that it will do.  I used the pumice attachment on my feet to remove dead skin, and it did do the job.  My only wish was that it had more power, and could spin the attachments faster.  I had to be careful not to press down on it, or it would bog down.  However, if I pressed it too lightly to my skin, it would start skipping across the surface.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I have only used it for about a week, but it cleans my skin much better than simply rubbing the cleanser around with my hands.  I have only used the small brush so far, but I am glad I made this purchase.  Areas of my skin where I had small break outs are now clearer.  I am still using my same cleanser, but getting it deeper into the skin with the brush.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product!</li>
            <li> I use it with microdermabrassion crystals and really gives you excellent results</li>
            <li> This product is just what I wanted! The price and value is excellent and also dealing with the seller has been exceptional. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Very basic. Great price. The company follow up has been fantastic. I love how my skin feels after I use it. I do wish it had a higher/faster setting for the body brush attachment.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 1st time and it&#x27;s worth trying it. It removed all dead skin and left skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I Like Using The Brush; Its Very Powerful; I Just Dislike The Fact That The Batteries Fall Out If The Brush Drops; The Compartment Should Be More Secure</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s cheaper than other branded ones, i dont know but it works perrfectly for me.. Now, my mom wants one and my brother haha.. it makes ure skin smoother and it is very effective in really cleansing ure face.. Highly recommended :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I love it. The only thing I wish it had different, was an a/c adapter for charging instead of batteries.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great steal.</li>
            <li> A handy and inexpensive facial cleansing system that really works.</li>
            <li> good things, use it everyday. and i feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! I can&#x27;t live without it! I do wish that it had a recharge station vs. being battery operated.</li>
            <li> When the brush spins, it pushes itself across your skin. I&#x27;d prefer something that just vibrated. Also, after putting the batteries it, the bottom of the handle wouldn&#x27;t stay on so now its wrapped in tape and its brand new :(</li>
            <li> Very nice product, smooth bristles so they hug around the nose area and not too abrasive. Have only used the facial brush and the body &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; brush so far, but both work very nicely and do what product promises. So it&#x27;s worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price, but is only useful as a face brush IMO.  It has a very nice look and fits easily in the hand. I use the face brush along with an exfoliating product to get the best effect. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple weeks and I do see an improvement in my skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there isn&#x27;t much power with this device (not much torque or speed), so it isn&#x27;t very effective as a body brush and not at all as a pumice tool (unless babies get callouses).  Just using a pumice stone by hand is much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it needs to be more high powered to perform well.  That would of course raise the price, but I think it would be worth it. Maybe a better battery technology could provide more power and maintain the light feel.</li>
            <li> I have bought it as a gift for my mom. And Im still waiting my mom replay !!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m quite pleased the system. my aged skin looks better and that makes me happy!</li>
            <li> Useful and cheap product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Item. It is the most important part of my face care routine</li>
            <li> Works great! Gentle enough for everyday use and still leaves skin feeling cleaned and refreshed with a smooth touch. It works very well for me. I am peeling due to some prescribed acne medication. This brush is perfect, and meet my requirement at the spot.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt my face and is gentle on my skin. When I purchased this online, it was really arrived quickly to me.  I really like it for my daily use and highly recommend to my friends and to you all. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love it! It makes my skin feel very soft. No more dullness to it.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered before the scheduled delivery date. Thumbs up for that.</li>
            <li> I am a 54 year young male and I owe much of my healthy looking skin to Youthful Advantage.  I am a professional model and actor so the appearance of my skin is a major factor in having a successful career.  I am having a fantastic year due to my use of Youthful Advantage on a regular basis.  Its a must have.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;ve never had skin issues until my late 20s. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Proactive, to Nutragina, to not using soap at all. (The doctor suggested it.) I bought the Skin Cleansing System because I was really out of options. I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a week now, 1-2x daily and I am so amazed at how much my skin has improved. It&#x27;s not 100% but it is getting there.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love the product  works great and easy to  understand</li>
            <li> just what I expected!</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Try ! You are going to live it !</li>
            <li> After a long day at work with a  make up covered face, or after the gym, I can count on my facial brush to get all the junk out of my pores. I have extremely oily and sensitive skin, and the facial brush is gentle enough to massage my face, but strong enough to deep clean my pores, remove dead skin build up, and leave it looking refreshed, clean, and glowing.</li>
            <li> Great facial cleansing system!  I also like the pumice for doing at home pedicures!</li>
            <li> Only after a few uses, I love this product.  My skin looks fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li> HUGE mistake!!  Lasted about 1 month......even with careful use, water drips into battery compartment and then system eventually stops working.  I searched in vain for a customer service contact number both in the box/literature and on line and there is NONE.  That alone tells the story....no one to respond to a customer&#x27;s legit complaints...no accountability.  I wish I&#x27;d saved the money and just purchased a much higher end system.  Live and learn.  What a scam!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this facial brush and the attachments. My skin seems brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> This cleansing system is awesome! It comes with everything-face sponge, pumice, small brush, and a nice big brush. I use the big brush and the pumice while I am in the shower. It works wonders on the skin. My elbows, knees, and feet ar smoother. I use the small brush to cleanse and exfoliate my face. The bristles are very soft. Therefore, the skin on your face does not get irritated. I use my Argan or Vitamin E oils with the sponge to massage the moisture into my skin. This is truly an great product and a must have if you want to keep you skin clean and looking young.</li>
            <li> Works great,  love it</li>
            <li> Feels great but it takes a while to do your whole body.  Also great for face.  Used regularly it makes your skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Was purchased as a gift for a female friend who has dry skin and requires to feel &amp;#34;comfortable instead of scaly&amp;#34;.  The Facial Brush Skin Care Cleansing System provides her with an acceptable alternative to scrubbing and using abrasive solutions on her hands, face and feet.  Her comments were that it makes her feel more lady-like and younger-looking.</li>
            <li> It is not what I was hoping for. The rotation is so slow and the pumice stone has no benefit for removing calluses.</li>
            <li> I regret now buying the one with more speed options however, even the one with one speed works brilliant, I washed the small face brush with shower gel and proceeded to use it. I put the 4 batteries in, put my cleanser on top the brush, and wet It  and then splashed a little bit of water on my face. I let it spin for about 2 minutes, washed my face clean. My face feels like a dream!</li>
            <li> Works really well to exfoliate the face and neck...not so powerful for larger areas of the body.</li>
            <li> This works great for cleansing and exfoliating using the brushes.  Not really enough power for the callous remover, not for my huge feet callouses anyway...hence only 4 stars.  I don&#x27;t use the sponge at all.  Had it for about 2 weeks now and it still works.  Still on the first set of batteries.  Not super powerful...hope it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because my big brush after one fall in my tub</li>
            <li> I purchased the Facial Brush about a month ago. For the price this is a great product. I also recently was given the Clairisonic Pro as a gift so I can give a good report on the comparison of the two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main difference between the two units are the brush heads. This brush has more options for brush heads, as it comes with a bigger body brush, face brush, facial sponge, and a pumice stone attachment. While the Clairisonic Vibrates to clean, this unit spins. I feel as though my face benefits from both, but this unit may even outperform the Clairisonic when it comes to the clean feel, but the brush heads are also a little harsher on the face and body and i wouldn&#x27;t reccomend using it more than once a day or every other day, as it might make your skin a little raw. The one issue I have with this unit is that it&#x27;s battery operated. The 4 AA&#x27;s lasted about 2 weeks before I had to put new ones in. A battery charging system like the a Clairisonic is more convenient in that aspect.  The Clairisonic comes with a body brush and a facial brush. The brushes on the Clairisonic will probably last a little longer due to the fact they just vibrate and don&#x27;t rub against the skin quite as much, but this also could be less effective when it comes to cleaning. One other thing I love about this company is the customer service. I have received numerous follow up emails with inquiries about my satisfaction with the product, suggestions or issues i may have come across, and my overall satisfaction of the unit. My brush also seemed to have lost some power after about a month, and they immediately sent me a new unit without me even asking, to make sure I was takin care of with an effective, working brush. Now that is great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great product and I highly recommend it. At a $200 price difference, I honestly don&#x27;t notice much of a difference. So don&#x27;t let the great price fool you, this brush gets the job done and will have yourskin feeling soft and blemish free in no time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the face brush a couple of times and I can see the difference.  My husband can see it too.  He used it once and it made such a big difference.  Will be buying more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, should have paid more and gotten something useful.</li>
            <li> I love this system so much, I gave my &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; system to my friend.  She loves it, too.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  I have used the face brush so far and it works great.  My only issue is the battery compartment keeps opening during use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised by how much I like this tool. I&#x27;m not much of a glamor girl, but this has become a part of my morning and night ritual that I look forward to. I really didn&#x27;t expect much-- The box looks a little cheap-- but in the end, it is sturdy, works great and is incredibly soothing: the bristles are soft yet exfoliating and the lotion sponge is like a very comforting soft face massage. I may have to get this again as a fun present for my mom and sis: it&#x27;s like having a facial at home, great tool for pampering yourself.</li>
            <li> My first one worked when it wanted. Even though I changed the batteries,it quit altogether. I ordered a new one and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price. Shipped as expected.</li>
            <li> good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Do not boy this from Amazon!!!  Ater two weeks it stopped and nothing could revive it. I couldn&#x27;t return it because I had just thrown away the packaging. I purchased it off the tv and its perfect. Amazon should have a no star rating.</li>
            <li> The brushes are too soft</li>
            <li> It s wonderful I love it. thank you</li>
            <li> This product is waist of money! Purchased this product over 3 month ago I use it maybe two times a month.&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks ago I wanted to use it no respond I thought it&#x27;s a batteries. When I opened to replace the inside of the battery chamber was all green. I trashed it</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for a friends as a gift, and when they put batteries into it, it did not work at all.</li>
            <li> Nice face scrubber decent battery life.</li>
