            <li>That&#x27;s great though, because it&#x27;s easy to hold.</li>
            <li>My feet feel amazing</li>
            <li>I have been using this in the shower now for about 2 weeks and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>This product works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>This lava stone is nice.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t wrapped so nicely though</li>
            <li>Now it just sits there and looks nice in the shower.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging as well.</li>
            <li>These are nice.  </li>
            <li>: I purchased this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
            <li>The shape fits so nicely in your hand.</li>
            <li>I received this during a product launch, at a reduced rate, for my honest review.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did receive this item at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>so I appreciate honesty and will always post my honest review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was given this at a promotional discount for my honest unbiased opinion and thats what I&#x27;ve given.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s packaged in a nice brown box with straw or hay packing material.</li>
            <li>~ A nice touch which makes it a nice gift.</li>
            <li>It fits in the hand nicely.  </li>
            <li>I wouldnt use them on my own man feet</li>
            <li>The weight is nice too, feels substantial in use.</li>
            <li>This looks nice in my bathroom and does the job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an effective product.</li>
            <li>so I never wanted to buy nice ones.</li>
            <li>so my feet were nice and pruney.</li>
            <li>Just the stone (not like in the photo with the nice packaged box).  </li>
            <li>received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>and I thought this might be a nice alternative to the sandpaper/file</li>
            <li>It was delivered fast and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, very happy with the purchase...</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had a pumice stone this good in many many years.</li>
            <li>Good size stone that is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your feet looking soft and flawless!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size to fit in your hand, and works wonders on heals of feet.</li>
            <li>and I use a nice moisturizing lotion afterwards and my feet are nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use Pumice stone to feel that good clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>This pumice stone gets those callouses right where you want them.&lt;br /&gt;There is a good amount of elbow grease that will be required, but will get you nice results.</li>
            <li>Perfect size, not too harsh, but very effective.</li>
            <li>This think is great, seems pretty durable, would buy again.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, great price.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best, and most effective pumice stone I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li>but it is fine!</li>
            <li>Makes my hands very smooth.</li>
            <li>and they were very smooth.</li>
            <li>Perfect hand size for gripping and not slipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll bet it&#x27;s fine, but just know it doesn&#x27;t always come in the nice package they show.</li>
            <li>This was so huge!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m thinking maybe 5 months or more</li>
            <li>I am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>better because it does a more aggressive job</li>
            <li>I love nature!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not my favorite of the pumice stones I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I am going to buy more for gifts.</li>
            <li>but it is more like a rock...</li>
            <li>I been using this lava rock for more than a year.</li>
            <li>Thought it would have been rough.my Swedish foot file wris better.</li>
            <li>This pumice is one of the better ones I have used.</li>
            <li>It makes my feet smooth!</li>
            <li>I love this pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>This works on your feet - :)  </li>
            <li>I thought this looked like the stone used at the local salon here for pedicures, and that stone does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>Love this item.  </li>
            <li>I also use Amazon Reviews for most of my purchases (even if I am not purchasing at Amazon)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how well It would work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen pumice stones before which were at most a couple of inches in diameter, if that.  </li>
            <li>The bulged surface helps applying more pressure if required.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works ok, but you need to use it every day and work at it even when your feet have been sitting in water for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Glad I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li>love this pumice stone....works better than any others i have bought.</li>
            <li>Overall great buy!</li>
            <li>am glad that I did.</li>

            <li>Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome, especially since all I have to do is run it over my feet toward the end of my showers.</li>
            <li>This is SO much better than the PedEgg.  </li>
            <li>has helped my legs finally be smooth and hairless!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stone.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>This is just an ok pumice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I checked Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping with Prime...will purchase, again.</li>
            <li>Better than ped egg, $25 + callus remover, smoother.</li>
            <li>than that, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this brush bought three.</li>
            <li>Much better than the pumice stone I buy from a drug store.</li>
            <li>my feet are smooth and socks are saved!</li>
            <li>I love Amazon</li>
            <li>I love this pumice stone</li>
            <li>Love this .</li>
            <li>I was looking for an even more abrasive pumice lava rock which I have had before.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it fabulous when natural things work best?</li>
            <li>I uave used many pummice stones before, but never one like this.</li>
            <li>Better than those metal files you buy in Walmart.</li>
            <li>appropriate weight and texture for a pumice stone.</li>
            <li>- I am really glad I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li>love this will be buying again</li>
            <li>good！！good，I like it so much !!!!</li>
            <li>I always have a pumice in my shower to clean my tootsies, and this is a nice one.</li>
            <li>and I love it much better than anything you would fine in the store</li>
            <li>Effective, quick.  </li>
            <li>I love it, perfect size and extremely durable</li>
            <li>So far it has done a great job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once so far and have been happy with the results.</li>
            <li>the stone is almost too smooth, I would prefer more holes to be rougher and able to smooth skin easier.</li>
            <li>Bummer really thought it would be good</li>
            <li>.shipping is so fast, good.</li>
            <li>Luckily I also ordered a rasp which works wonderfully and left my feet in a condition</li>
            <li>Nice stone, just the right coarseness.</li>
            <li>I bought it originally because I started to get irritation on my skin and wanted to take better care of my skin, but</li>
            <li>Good size, gets job done, great little pet rock.</li>
            <li>That ain&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li>Cleans up easily also</li>
            <li>Easy peasy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold with its egg shape.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is anything better or special about it.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly, nicely packaged and does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>It came in pretty packaging and looked and felt nice.</li>
            <li>Some pumice stones are too fine, which is what probably drives people to purchase all the pricey pedicure/callous products out there.</li>
            <li>Works fine for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Once a day should be fine.</li>
            <li>Probably wouldn&#x27;t make a good pet, but works good at filing down those stubborn calluses on my heels.</li>
            <li>Great quality and effective on smoothing down the calluses on my heels in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Love it best stone I&#x27;ve purchased so far and better than the flat cheap files you buy in cvs or Duane read.</li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s a good pumice stone as far as pumice stones go!</li>

            <li>Excelent replacement for the pumice stone that were available years ago and can nolonger buy.  </li>
            <li>It is shrink wrapped and in a cheap jewelry type bag.</li>
            <li>and it is too smooth to exfoliate anything.</li>
            <li>I now have baby smooth feet.  </li>
            <li>Gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>My feet are silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I like the smooth design, as opposed to the squared off bars.  </li>
            <li>Also did not come with any directions on the best way to get dead skin off with this product,would have been helpful if never used simular product.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t place it on a secure location, it will fall and when it falls, it&#x27;ll 1) land on your foot.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use....</li>
            <li>Now my hands have smooth protective calluses on them</li>
            <li>This pumice stone works great, especially on my heels</li>
            <li>Keeps my feet so smooth.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm on my heels, Love it, plus I think it just looks pretty cool!</li>
            <li>I am able to hold the pumice stone because of the shape and form that does not aggravate my severe arthritis in my right hand.</li>
            <li>Really like this!!!</li>
            <li>It worked great, rinsed clean and can double as a weapon if I&#x27;m ever caught off guard by an assailant while scrubbing my heels.</li>
            <li>I want my feet to look amazing whether I am wearing sandals or high heeled boots</li>
            <li>This product is okay, it doesnt cost very much and get the job done.</li>
            <li>Super soothing and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this one.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the low price I paid for this quality, fast shipping and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>I soaked my feet for about 20 minutes and this pumice stone took off all that skin &amp; dirt -- leaving my feet squeeky clean--</li>
            <li>I also clean it well when taking a shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I use it, I rub some soap on it and rinse it under water and it looks completely clean again.</li>
            <li>and I use it for our cracked heels, they make our feet very soft and the scrubbing motion doesn&#x27;t hurt or tickle, which is a nice factor.</li>
            <li>His hands are super smooth and soft every time he uses the stone - I love it!</li>
            <li>Also, the size is just right for my hand!</li>
            <li>If you get the nice new one, lucky you and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty large, but a nice size for your hand.  </li>
            <li>It did a great job on my feet removing the rough skin.  </li>
            <li>It works great for thickened rough skin, but also works well as an all over body scrubber.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would take more than one use to restore my feet to summer ready condition.</li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>This, however, is the true deal.  </li>
            <li>waala sandals feet ready :)</li>
            <li>then I think it would be better, but I think that may be too much to ask for.</li>
            <li>I would return it if it was worth it, but since it is so cheap I will toss it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought others that were okay, but nothing that really sold me.</li>
            <li>This is the stone they were happiest with, so I&#x27;m rating it full stars.</li>
            <li>I love this stone - it washes off clean, works very well in between monthly pedicures, and it looks pretty too!</li>
            <li>I mean how excellent can a rock be?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Helpful tip: we store ours upright in a 2.5&amp;#34; square planter, which is just large enough to hold it and looks great on the countertop.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>may lead lead you to believe but other than that this thing works great .</li>
            <li>Love it so much I would be willing to buy something else I needed in order to buy another stone when it is time to replace this one!</li>
            <li>I was able to take the top layer of skin off with this stone so that my skin was smooth but also so that my calluses were not completely gone.</li>
            <li>My feet are clean and looking great - and after about a month of use, the stone shows no signs of wearing down.</li>
            <li>I love the baby soft smooth feet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time today, and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I ordered mine from &amp;#34;FIVE Stars,&amp;#34; fulfilled by Amazon for the free shipping, and I received exactly what&#x27;s pictured, box included.  </li>
            <li>they require  good scouring aabout every other day to help keep them smooth.</li>
            <li>Very shady and kind of surprising that Amazon would allow this to be sent out.  </li>
            <li>This one is the right shape to fit in the palm of your hand and the right coarseness to get the job done.</li>
            <li>More pricey than the fake foam pumice stones but way more durable and more effective, too.  </li>
            <li>does a great job, but since purchasing this i&#x27;ve seen lava pumice stones in stores for half the price.</li>
            <li>sure you give this stone a good rinsing after use, because your dead skin will really build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for callused heels!</li>
            <li>That being said, it will last forever and washes well :-) !</li>
            <li>After using it though, I actually like this one better for my body as it is gentler and works just as well!</li>
            <li>A bit of super glue fixed it up real quick.</li>
            <li>love how big this stone is because it is so easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, kinda large but does the job, these are good stones for removing dead skin on feet and tops of toes.</li>
            <li>this rock will take off dried great stuff off your hands.</li>
            <li>and it works great for dead skin.</li>
            <li>This is a larger pumice stone with some good weight, which helps to really scrub my heels, which is what I need.</li>
            <li>Really worth the price.</li>
            <li>This review is based on my own personal experiences.</li>
            <li>Well, get over your fear, dunk the pumice stone in warm water, and lightly rub it on your wet feet.</li>
            <li>Nice and coarse, the way I like it.</li>
            <li>Actually, I rarely give 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Get you one and let your mate enjoy smooth soft feets.</li>
            <li>Great for scrubbing bottom, but too thick to fit between toes at all.</li>
            <li>I loved the look of this stone and the reviews were promising, but I had to send this back bc</li>
            <li>Not much effort is needed to make your feet nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My feet are soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>This thing is awesome, totally obliterated my callouses and rough skin.</li>
            <li>I must say that I love pedicures; I go every two weeks to have a professional one done throughout the year.  </li>
            <li>I am worth it!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Love the natural stone and how durable it is.</li>
            <li>It has one flat surface and one more bulging surface that is a huge plus, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>These stones work great for removing dead skin and makes your skin smooth and soft!!</li>
            <li>It worked right away.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>and it came right off</li>
            <li>It worked right away.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I just used for the first time and was really surprise by how smooth it made my feet feel after one use.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend if you want to get your feet baby smooth at nail salon quality</li>
            <li>it is well worth the money... also had very fast shipping....</li>
            <li>This, along with a great scrub, works the best of all the other things I tried to remove the callus and rough, dead skin at the bottom of my feet.  </li>
            <li>My feet looked completely normal and smooth after that one use.</li>
            <li>First, I think it&#x27;s worth noting that the pumice stone I received didn&#x27;t come in a box.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come in a nice box like shown just a flimsy mesh, and takes way too long coming from china.</li>
            <li>This one is way more smooth than the professional stones used at the salons, so much so that it simply glides over the heel area and isn&#x27;t abrasive enough to do any good.  </li>
            <li>I attribute part of this to the fact that it is a little rougher and asymmetrical, therefore, is able to reach spots that the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; stone wasn&#x27;t able to reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it about every 2 weeks to smooth my feet (making my summer sandals even more fantastic looking)and hands (after working in my flower beds my hands are a mess!)</li>
            <li>My heels tend to crack fairly deep multiple times a year, and this stone has been great at maintaining minimum cracking.</li>
            <li>and the fact it does such an awesome job removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li>This one not only gets the job done, but is durable and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>The product is also easy to clean as you can simply run it under some water with some hand/dish soap.  </li>
            <li>It came packaged in a nice little box and it&#x27;s about a 3 1/2 inch oval (the long way), good size for holding in your hand.</li>
            <li>but it feels as light as a feather and very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent pumice stone for my very calloused feet, and this is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>at first i thought it might hurt but its very gentle.</li>
            <li>Good sized product works pretty good takes a little time to get all dead skin off this way thats why 4 stars instead of five.</li>
            <li>so people are aware that this can happen.</li>
            <li>Nice and rough.</li>
            <li>My first thoughts upon opening the package were that this stone is humongous.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that it the coloring of the stone will come out in your water at first!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>For me this is the first time purchasing a pumice stone.</li>
            <li>My feet feel really soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>and I tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Sorry, but if you are looking for a salon quality lava stone with great scrubbing/removing power, keep looking, this one isn&#x27;t it!!</li>
            <li>This lava stone is exactly what my feet needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different pumice stones throughout the years and they never lasted.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Works much better than the regular Pumice stone.</li>
            <li>started to have a difference after using it the first time.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying this intimidating looking stone</li>
            <li>Also love that this is solid.</li>
            <li>DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT IS INTENDED FOR.</li>
            <li>I have much better results using a glass crystal file, which can be found for a similar price.</li>
            <li>It is the first thing I see on women</li>
            <li>The first one was alright.  </li>
            <li>This works on The First use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly what it looks like, but does not come in a box, haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first time I used this pumice stone.</li>
            <li>I actually like the results from this pumice stone better than the callous eliminator.  </li>
            <li>Plus the stone is very lightweight!</li>
            <li>I waited almost over a month to get it after I placed my order, and I really hope it worth it.</li>
            <li>A hanging strap would be nice, but since it floats, it&#x27;s not really a problem.</li>
            <li>When I first received this stone, I was a bit dismayed as I was hoping that the texture would be coarser (like another stone I had purchased elsewhere).</li>
            <li>it never fails to amaze me.</li>
            <li>ive been using it for a month and have absolutely ZERO complaints!</li>
            <li>I first laid eyes on this pumice</li>
            <li>I am still using this several months later and loving it!</li>
            <li>is my first time buying this sort of pumice stone</li>
            <li>so well she actually cried because how much better her feet felt and her feet don&#x27;t tear up socks</li>
            <li>Seems pretty durable.</li>
            <li>which were pretty beat up &amp; calloused.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it was meant to do.</li>
            <li>It appeared intimidating when it arrived as it was surprisingly dense, heavy, and looked meaner than a cheese</li>
            <li>But it does get rid of the dead skin, so I guess it&#x27;s good if you have callouses.</li>
            <li>I also am able to smooth down the calluses by leaning over the bathtub as I rub the pumice stone over my feet.</li>
            <li>It was rather large and rough and does work nicely.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>If there were peruse soaking or other instructions that would eliminate this problem, it would be nice if there were instructions included.</li>
            <li>However, after ordering it, it isn&#x27;t the same and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of scrubbing the feet and removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li>My mom had a true pumice stone when I was growing up, so I was surprised the first time I bought one at a drugstore to find it was nothing like what she had.  </li>
            <li>Not great - nice packaging, but my Mr. Pumice stone works much better.</li>
            <li>This arrived just fine, however my particular stone has a natural crack formation in it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried countless other pumice stones or pedeggs to do the trick between pedicures and this is great.</li>
            <li>My feet, which are often calloused to hell and back thanks to running and rock climbing, and which are often the cause of much finger wagging from the mani-pedi tech, have never looked better.</li>
            <li>It works much better than those rectangular grey pumice stones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks nice because of its dark color and</li>
            <li>Great for rough dry feet, I use it regularly in the shower and it helps keep my feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li>No on the contrary, to my surprise, after the first use the results were more than i had expected.</li>
            <li>I wear sandals, or am barefoot most of the summer, so my feet and heels tend to get dry.  </li>
            <li>Makes your feet super soft</li>
            <li>I want sure about this at first because I thought I was buying it from a manufacturer or distributor, but it came shipped to me with partial packaging,  like something someone had bought but didn&#x27;t want and had already pulled the cardboard insert out.</li>
            <li>I wish it was an easy process to get my money back.</li>
            <li>My feet are super soft now just like a girl&#x27;s feet should always be.</li>
            <li>This one is large.  </li>
            <li>grater.&lt;br /&gt;However, it worked great as a pumice stone and outperformed a blue square one I previously owned by leaps and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this highly, but if you want pretty, don&#x27;t buy it.  </li>
            <li>and it was great, but starting getting a little funky.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, have to dry it a little after the shower so the water doesn&#x27;t stay in the pores, but my feet are super soft!</li>
            <li>Really upset to see that it is now only available as an add-on item.  </li>
            <li>Great for removing extra dead skin between pedicures.</li>
            <li>Compared to the synthetic white one I had from a cheap foot care package, which had been falling apart, this stone is much nicer</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to really work.</li>
            <li>works really well too.  </li>
            <li>It may be a bit much for grinding elbows</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>It takes literally about 2 minutes to scrub off all of the nitty gritty and leave a smooth bottom without having to put in a lot of effort.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Worked very well for mah nasteh feet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i used to use real pumice stone</li>
            <li>you really have to push and add pressure when using it...</li>
            <li>it works but not as well as a real pumice stone or lava rock...</li>
            <li>gentle strokes).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Soak your feet, soap up the stone and gently rub all over and</li>
            <li>It shipped fast but didn&#x27;t come in a box or with care instructions</li>
            <li>No matter how much I cleaned and scrubbed, the brown ring would not go away.</li>
            <li>They would take off too much skin and the exposed layers would then crack and bleed.  </li>
            <li>This stone takes of the excess skin on her heels but doesn&#x27;t take so much off that cracking occurs.</li>
            <li>I came across this pumice stone, a REAL PUMICE STONE unlike the ones I&#x27;ve bought from department stores, including Origins.  </li>
            <li>This is a very well shaped and sized pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>, it works very well.</li>
            <li>i.e. paint spots on bath tub, rub this stone gently and it removes the paint without damaging the tub surface.</li>
            <li>More expensive, but well worth it for its longevity :)</li>
            <li>Just the scrub alone is not enough to get smooth skin on my heels.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I think the Tweezerman Pink Pedro Callus Stone is so much better.</li>
            <li>But with that said, it works well, and really that&#x27;s all that matters.  </li>
            <li>decided to give it a try (getting my winter skin ready for spring)</li>
            <li>did not like it too much.</li>
            <li>it works very well, but beware..</li>
            <li>have very rough/dry hands and feet .</li>
            <li>I even showed ny boyfriend and he agreed it looked really sketchy.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This is very important due to mold and bacteria which can get into the stone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is very useful after soaking your feet and left my feet feeling smoother.  </li>
            <li>This thing does work on my feet better than any other stone I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works for some, but i&#x27;ll try other options.</li>
            <li>This works amazing on the feet and my husband super tough hands</li>
            <li>Seems a little too rough in the picture, but it&#x27;s actually quite perfect.</li>
            <li>This one has been pretty sturdy so far, and I like</li>
            <li>Ive used these previously and love them.  </li>
            <li>favorite part is that it takes a fraction of the time for me to use this stone than it did my previous one.</li>
            <li>let my better half guess at where these items have been and were used for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more of an off brown color rather than black.</li>
            <li>Too rough and crumbles easily.</li>
            <li>Wish there were less large-sized voids in it and that it was more uniform in texture.</li>
            <li>This egg-shaped stone is somewhat disappointing--it doesn&#x27;t perform particularly well, hence the rating.</li>
            <li>The holes and crevices are deep and work quickly.</li>
            <li>I have looked everywhere for this type of pumice that is super coarse.  </li>
            <li>I can only imagine how lovely my feet will be looking and feeling when I use this regularly.</li>
            <li>The surface is very porous and works well by buffing away dead skin without shredding and/or damaging healthy skin.</li>
            <li>Have learned that using a facial scrub (Such as St. Ives Apricot) makes experience even better.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to go with</li>
            <li>If it had a handle or platform that was of high quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>used it to get rid of hard water build up in a toilet works great</li>
            <li>works so much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried to smooth out and get rid of all the dead dry skin on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This being said I love this little lava rock.</li>
            <li>Tried them here and there over the years, but this is the first one that I&#x27;m certain will make it&#x27;s way into regular use for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It fits nicely in the hand and the curved edges allow use in hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but I&#x27;m totally happy with this natural product!!</li>
            <li>, now my feet are so soft and look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is not obnoxiously rough, nor is it smooth.  </li>
            <li>When I use this as a general body exfoliator (1-2 times per week), I add a generous dollop of body wash and apply only light pressure.  </li>
            <li>I am able to use this and save some money not having to go in for a pedi every few weeks.</li>
            <li>I use this Tend Skin (although I&#x27;m sure any ingrown hair solution will work just as well) at night and when I shower I rub this over my legs to remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li>I found the artificial substances better at callous control but it is good for daily use</li>
            <li>Immediately after showering, while my feet are still moist, I apply Avocado Oil mixed with lotion and massage into both feet and don socks until completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>As such, I pretty much wrote off the whole idea of natural pumice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does look scary and almost like a cheese grater, but it does the job and produces a very nice result without any discomfort despite its looks.</li>
            <li>It may take several (or many) uses for those with very dry, cracked or flaking soles; however, any product will if this is the condition of your feet.</li>
            <li>Other pumice stones I have tried were too smooth.  </li>
            <li>The first day I did a quicky scour, the 2nd time I took more time and got all that dead skin off.</li>
            <li>I ground years of callous off my feet and the stone looks like new.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t throw it if you live in a glass house.</li>
            <li>While other pumice stones and files didn&#x27;t do too much for me, with continued use of this stone I have baby soft feet, especially since I use it with O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Cream.  </li>
            <li>For the average foot, it is probably just fine.</li>
            <li>I had anticipated better results from using this &amp;#34;natural pumice stone&amp;#34;, but it simply doesn&#x27;t exfoliate as I expected.</li>
            <li>The texture was perfect, not too rough not too soft and after only a few days of use I could recognize the increase in softness for my hands and feet and a smaller amount of calluses.  </li>
            <li>It has very &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; qualities, yes-- as in dust is constantly coming off it, no matter how much rinsing or scrubbing you do.</li>
            <li>It is strong, durable and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Scrubs dead skin off easily &amp; leaves the area soft &amp; clean from dirt &amp; dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is a handful sized stone not a small pebble sized stone.</li>
            <li>as far as I know you took them out of your backyard!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I noticed the stone was disintegrating with use, I guess it it natural!?</li>
            <li>Since I have professional pedis done regularly, this little gem keeps my feet looking great until my next appointment.&lt;br /&gt;Since I believe in using natural products when I can, I clean the pumice stone with a toothbrush, rinse, soak it in a white vinegar solution and let air dry.  </li>
            <li>Other pumice stones I&#x27;ve tried are too soft and wear down quickly, or they break easily.  </li>
            <li>Huge improvement with less effort.</li>
            <li>It appears to be real pumice rock vs the molded concrete rectangles you buy from the &#x27;big&#x27; stores.</li>
            <li>I store on a dry sponge on my sink so that it&#x27;s nice and dry for my next use.</li>
            <li>I agree its a great stone for feet and rough skin, but it&#x27;s smaller than it looks one of the two I ordered was smaller than the other.</li>
            <li>Where I work, I&#x27;m pretty much always on my feet, so when I get home, my feet can get a little rough over time, and this helps out a lot to smooth them out.</li>
            <li>i really like it its just what i want , the same i saw here and new  </li>
            <li>found that the lava pumice stone actually provides better results on my heels and calluses than the stone I was previously using.</li>
            <li>The holes are rather large and seem to actually gather up debris.  </li>
            <li>Without intervention, the calluses quickly become too large and rip off leaving raw skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never sure that rinsing it really gets it clean again.  </li>
            <li>The product that I received was in a hard plastic case not in a box as shown here but does the job and is better than block of cement with pores.</li>
            <li>I still need to figure out the proper way to clean the thing and it seems to take a while to completely dry out when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>does it&#x27;s job nothing professional</li>
            <li>My feet were soft and supple.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t any problem with it since.</li>
            <li>Pummel my feet please so somehow they become soft,</li>
            <li>my feet have never been so soft.</li>
            <li>I have purchased one for my mom, my husband and each of my adult sons.  </li>
            <li>Too coarse, I much prefer the finer foot scrubbers.</li>
            <li>I used it and don&#x27;t really see a big difference.</li>
            <li>Since it is a natural product, I recommend not storing in the shower/bath because the brown comes off a bit.</li>
            <li>It removes the dead skin off your feet leaving it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, the presentation is completely lacking.</li>
            <li>So far it works well for maintenance in between using a shaver on my heels.</li>
            <li>it was too soft and was the equivalent of rubbing paper on my feet.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that this stone is natural in material and color.</li>
            <li>oh man this thing really fixed my feet.</li>
            <li>I was rather surprised to get the stone in a mailing package with no packaging, bag, nothing.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen natural lava rocks, and that&#x27;s what this one is, just shaped into an oblong.</li>
            <li>This seems like it will be too soft to get the job done for me.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I frequently get scaly calluses on my hands which flake/tear off and causes pain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is powerful so you must be careful not to over do it.</li>
            <li>The reason it gets two stars is it looks good and the shape is reasonable,but it is useless for me.</li>
            <li>It looks to be a real stone, it fits nicely in my hand, and it&#x27;s small enough to store easily, so it&#x27;s dry and ready to go for the next time.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended--especially over smoother stones and ones that mount with suction cups (it&#x27;s tough and ineffective to move your foot against a fixed stone; better to hold the stone and move it against your foot!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For some odd reason, I did smell the stone, and it smells earthy, which is really cool to me.</li>
            <li>PS, works nice on hands and other trouble spots as well.</li>
            <li>It really helps get the loose, dead hairs out easily.  </li>
            <li>and I have gone from cracked dry feet to smooth and soft pink feet.</li>
            <li>I am the first to admit I was totally wrong about this pumice stone; it worked phenomenal and literally buffed my feet to a shine.  </li>
            <li>I started using the pumice stone every day to get my heels back to normal</li>
            <li>It is hard to the touch and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying this again in the future but not so soon because its a pretty large rock that will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>However, I went back about a month later to order another to carry in my suitcase (I travel a lot), and what arrived at my house was about 1/3 the size of the original one I ordered, not as rough, and came in shrink-wrap.  </li>
            <li>Once I feel its time to get a new stone, I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li>Have to soak feet in hot water for at least 5 mins first then scrub scrub scrub</li>
            <li>but this just fits the bill like no other.  </li>
            <li>Can definitely tell a difference in this as &amp;#34;the real thing&amp;#34; vs. the ones I&#x27;ve bought at beauty stores that wear down fast.</li>
            <li>I rubbed the lava stone on the rough and dry area after showering, and on the third day my elbow was smooth and the pain was gone.  </li>
            <li>I would use it again for the thick calcium deposits but not for a fine layer.</li>
            <li>I suffer from very dry hills, This really worked great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even rubbing the skin lightly, strips the skin and leaves it red and raw.</li>
            <li>This is a fairly large pumice stone that should last a long time.</li>
            <li>Ordered it for myself I use it in the shower with a little body wash and after the first use my feet are already soft .</li>
            <li>Looks scary and intimidating, but feels amazing on your skin.</li>
            <li>I received and was charged for two items when your invoice on amazon clearly states I only ordered one.</li>
            <li>I use it gently every day or two and can see this lasting for a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not rough at all.</li>
            <li>I am 73 years old and got some medical problems.  </li>
            <li>Regular feet stones are either too flimsy, or don&#x27;t have big enough whole in them.</li>
            <li>The light rubbing is enough to get rid of all that gross dead skin.</li>
            <li>In another week they shall be as soft as a baby&#x27;s (they are almost there now) and then,  I will just use it daily for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It totally isn&#x27;t what is pictured as far as packaging goes.</li>
            <li>but I can barely feel it when i rub it on my feet.</li>
            <li>First off this rock is way bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li>It made my super dry, tough feet soft the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Because i is so dark, however, it can leave a dark ring in your tub, but this is easily rinsed off and is not staining.</li>
            <li>After rinsing all the dead skin rinses right out of the holes in the stone.</li>
            <li>Not too harsh, just right.</li>
            <li>I think I described it as Bad Ass when I opened the package but after the first use, I was in love.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Months later, still loving my stone.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to rub so hard, but after two uses, my feet were smooth again for several months!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also just not rough enough for me.  </li>
            <li>This makes my feet baby soft after a long day .</li>
            <li>It cleans my feet and after about five uses has really smoothed my foot down.  </li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t even have to break it in half to get to a rougher surface - it works as it is and is very long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work so well on my feet - wet or dry.</li>
            <li>This does tend to beat our feet up a little more than the average person, and this stone has been an answer to our problem of jolting awake in horror when either of the bottom of our foot touches the other in bed at night.</li>
            <li>It got the dry, dead skin off in had the time and effort as my old stones, and the result was so much smoother.</li>

            <li> That&#x27;s great though, because it&#x27;s easy to hold.</li>
            <li> My feet feel amazing</li>
            <li> I have been using this in the shower now for about 2 weeks and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> This lava stone is nice.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t wrapped so nicely though</li>
            <li> Now it just sits there and looks nice in the shower.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging as well.</li>
            <li> These are nice.  </li>
            <li> : I purchased this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The shape fits so nicely in your hand.</li>
            <li> I received this during a product launch, at a reduced rate, for my honest review.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did receive this item at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li> so I appreciate honesty and will always post my honest review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was given this at a promotional discount for my honest unbiased opinion and thats what I&#x27;ve given.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s packaged in a nice brown box with straw or hay packing material.</li>
            <li> ~ A nice touch which makes it a nice gift.</li>
            <li> It fits in the hand nicely.  </li>
            <li> I wouldnt use them on my own man feet</li>
            <li> The weight is nice too, feels substantial in use.</li>
            <li> This looks nice in my bathroom and does the job.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an effective product.</li>
            <li> so I never wanted to buy nice ones.</li>
            <li> so my feet were nice and pruney.</li>
            <li> Just the stone (not like in the photo with the nice packaged box).  </li>
            <li> received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> and I thought this might be a nice alternative to the sandpaper/file</li>
            <li> It was delivered fast and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, very happy with the purchase...</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had a pumice stone this good in many many years.</li>
            <li> Good size stone that is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your feet looking soft and flawless!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size to fit in your hand, and works wonders on heals of feet.</li>
            <li> and I use a nice moisturizing lotion afterwards and my feet are nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use Pumice stone to feel that good clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> This pumice stone gets those callouses right where you want them.&lt;br /&gt;There is a good amount of elbow grease that will be required, but will get you nice results.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, not too harsh, but very effective.</li>
            <li> This think is great, seems pretty durable, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, great price.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best, and most effective pumice stone I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> but it is fine!</li>
            <li> Makes my hands very smooth.</li>
            <li> and they were very smooth.</li>
            <li> Perfect hand size for gripping and not slipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll bet it&#x27;s fine, but just know it doesn&#x27;t always come in the nice package they show.</li>
            <li> This was so huge!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m thinking maybe 5 months or more</li>
            <li> I am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> better because it does a more aggressive job</li>
            <li> I love nature!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not my favorite of the pumice stones I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I am going to buy more for gifts.</li>
            <li> but it is more like a rock...</li>
            <li> I been using this lava rock for more than a year.</li>
            <li> Thought it would have been rough.my Swedish foot file wris better.</li>
            <li> This pumice is one of the better ones I have used.</li>
            <li> It makes my feet smooth!</li>
            <li> I love this pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> This works on your feet - :)  </li>
            <li> I thought this looked like the stone used at the local salon here for pedicures, and that stone does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li> Love this item.  </li>
            <li> I also use Amazon Reviews for most of my purchases (even if I am not purchasing at Amazon)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well It would work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen pumice stones before which were at most a couple of inches in diameter, if that.  </li>
            <li> The bulged surface helps applying more pressure if required.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works ok, but you need to use it every day and work at it even when your feet have been sitting in water for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Glad I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li> love this pumice stone....works better than any others i have bought.</li>
            <li> Overall great buy!</li>
            <li> am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> but I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, especially since all I have to do is run it over my feet toward the end of my showers.</li>
            <li> This is SO much better than the PedEgg.  </li>
            <li> has helped my legs finally be smooth and hairless!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stone.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This is just an ok pumice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I checked Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping with Prime...will purchase, again.</li>
            <li> Better than ped egg, $25 + callus remover, smoother.</li>
            <li> than that, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this brush bought three.</li>
            <li> Much better than the pumice stone I buy from a drug store.</li>
            <li> my feet are smooth and socks are saved!</li>
            <li> I love Amazon</li>
            <li> I love this pumice stone</li>
            <li> Love this .</li>
            <li> I was looking for an even more abrasive pumice lava rock which I have had before.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it fabulous when natural things work best?</li>
            <li> I uave used many pummice stones before, but never one like this.</li>
            <li> Better than those metal files you buy in Walmart.</li>
            <li> appropriate weight and texture for a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> - I am really glad I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> love this will be buying again</li>
            <li> good！！good，I like it so much !!!!</li>
            <li> I always have a pumice in my shower to clean my tootsies, and this is a nice one.</li>
            <li> and I love it much better than anything you would fine in the store</li>
            <li> Effective, quick.  </li>
            <li> I love it, perfect size and extremely durable</li>
            <li> So far it has done a great job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far and have been happy with the results.</li>
            <li> the stone is almost too smooth, I would prefer more holes to be rougher and able to smooth skin easier.</li>
            <li> Bummer really thought it would be good</li>
            <li> .shipping is so fast, good.</li>
            <li> Luckily I also ordered a rasp which works wonderfully and left my feet in a condition</li>
            <li> Nice stone, just the right coarseness.</li>
            <li> I bought it originally because I started to get irritation on my skin and wanted to take better care of my skin, but</li>
            <li> Good size, gets job done, great little pet rock.</li>
            <li> That ain&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li> Cleans up easily also</li>
            <li> Easy peasy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold with its egg shape.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything better or special about it.  </li>
            <li> Works perfectly, nicely packaged and does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> It came in pretty packaging and looked and felt nice.</li>
            <li> Some pumice stones are too fine, which is what probably drives people to purchase all the pricey pedicure/callous products out there.</li>
            <li> Works fine for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Once a day should be fine.</li>
            <li> Probably wouldn&#x27;t make a good pet, but works good at filing down those stubborn calluses on my heels.</li>
            <li> Great quality and effective on smoothing down the calluses on my heels in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Love it best stone I&#x27;ve purchased so far and better than the flat cheap files you buy in cvs or Duane read.</li>
            <li> but I guess it&#x27;s a good pumice stone as far as pumice stones go!</li>
            <li> Huge improvement in the look &amp; smoothness of my feet after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have really smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It works well and comfortable</li>
            <li> Great, simple, works well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean it.</li>
            <li> Stays clean and reliable, easy to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth without irritation.</li>
            <li> filled rock on your skin.</li>
            <li> If used properly, this is a great addition to your regime.  </li>
            <li> I like how smooth it feels on your skin</li>
            <li> In fact, you have to be gentle with it, it&#x27;s so effective.  </li>
            <li> Excelent replacement for the pumice stone that were available years ago and can nolonger buy.  </li>
            <li> It is shrink wrapped and in a cheap jewelry type bag.</li>
            <li> and it is too smooth to exfoliate anything.</li>
            <li> I now have baby smooth feet.  </li>
            <li> Gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> My feet are silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I like the smooth design, as opposed to the squared off bars.  </li>
            <li> Also did not come with any directions on the best way to get dead skin off with this product,would have been helpful if never used simular product.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t place it on a secure location, it will fall and when it falls, it&#x27;ll 1) land on your foot.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use....</li>
            <li> Now my hands have smooth protective calluses on them</li>
            <li> This pumice stone works great, especially on my heels</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet so smooth.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm on my heels, Love it, plus I think it just looks pretty cool!</li>
            <li> I am able to hold the pumice stone because of the shape and form that does not aggravate my severe arthritis in my right hand.</li>
            <li> Really like this!!!</li>
            <li> It worked great, rinsed clean and can double as a weapon if I&#x27;m ever caught off guard by an assailant while scrubbing my heels.</li>
            <li> I want my feet to look amazing whether I am wearing sandals or high heeled boots</li>
            <li> This product is okay, it doesnt cost very much and get the job done.</li>
            <li> Super soothing and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this so much!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this one.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the low price I paid for this quality, fast shipping and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> I soaked my feet for about 20 minutes and this pumice stone took off all that skin &amp; dirt -- leaving my feet squeeky clean--</li>
            <li> I also clean it well when taking a shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I use it, I rub some soap on it and rinse it under water and it looks completely clean again.</li>
            <li> and I use it for our cracked heels, they make our feet very soft and the scrubbing motion doesn&#x27;t hurt or tickle, which is a nice factor.</li>
            <li> His hands are super smooth and soft every time he uses the stone - I love it!</li>
            <li> Also, the size is just right for my hand!</li>
            <li> If you get the nice new one, lucky you and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty large, but a nice size for your hand.  </li>
            <li> It did a great job on my feet removing the rough skin.  </li>
            <li> It works great for thickened rough skin, but also works well as an all over body scrubber.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would take more than one use to restore my feet to summer ready condition.</li>
            <li> Overall good product.</li>
            <li> This, however, is the true deal.  </li>
            <li> waala sandals feet ready :)</li>
            <li> then I think it would be better, but I think that may be too much to ask for.</li>
            <li> I would return it if it was worth it, but since it is so cheap I will toss it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought others that were okay, but nothing that really sold me.</li>
            <li> This is the stone they were happiest with, so I&#x27;m rating it full stars.</li>
            <li> I love this stone - it washes off clean, works very well in between monthly pedicures, and it looks pretty too!</li>
            <li> I mean how excellent can a rock be?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Helpful tip: we store ours upright in a 2.5&amp;#34; square planter, which is just large enough to hold it and looks great on the countertop.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> may lead lead you to believe but other than that this thing works great .</li>
            <li> Love it so much I would be willing to buy something else I needed in order to buy another stone when it is time to replace this one!</li>
            <li> I was able to take the top layer of skin off with this stone so that my skin was smooth but also so that my calluses were not completely gone.</li>
            <li> My feet are clean and looking great - and after about a month of use, the stone shows no signs of wearing down.</li>
            <li> I love the baby soft smooth feet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today, and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine from &amp;#34;FIVE Stars,&amp;#34; fulfilled by Amazon for the free shipping, and I received exactly what&#x27;s pictured, box included.  </li>
            <li> they require  good scouring aabout every other day to help keep them smooth.</li>
            <li> Very shady and kind of surprising that Amazon would allow this to be sent out.  </li>
            <li> This one is the right shape to fit in the palm of your hand and the right coarseness to get the job done.</li>
            <li> More pricey than the fake foam pumice stones but way more durable and more effective, too.  </li>
            <li> does a great job, but since purchasing this i&#x27;ve seen lava pumice stones in stores for half the price.</li>
            <li> sure you give this stone a good rinsing after use, because your dead skin will really build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for callused heels!</li>
            <li> That being said, it will last forever and washes well :-) !</li>
            <li> After using it though, I actually like this one better for my body as it is gentler and works just as well!</li>
            <li> A bit of super glue fixed it up real quick.</li>
            <li> love how big this stone is because it is so easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, kinda large but does the job, these are good stones for removing dead skin on feet and tops of toes.</li>
            <li> this rock will take off dried great stuff off your hands.</li>
            <li> and it works great for dead skin.</li>
            <li> This is a larger pumice stone with some good weight, which helps to really scrub my heels, which is what I need.</li>
            <li> Really worth the price.</li>
            <li> This review is based on my own personal experiences.</li>
            <li> Well, get over your fear, dunk the pumice stone in warm water, and lightly rub it on your wet feet.</li>
            <li> Nice and coarse, the way I like it.</li>
            <li> Actually, I rarely give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Get you one and let your mate enjoy smooth soft feets.</li>
            <li> Great for scrubbing bottom, but too thick to fit between toes at all.</li>
            <li> I loved the look of this stone and the reviews were promising, but I had to send this back bc</li>
            <li> Not much effort is needed to make your feet nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My feet are soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome, totally obliterated my callouses and rough skin.</li>
            <li> I must say that I love pedicures; I go every two weeks to have a professional one done throughout the year.  </li>
            <li> I am worth it!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Love the natural stone and how durable it is.</li>
            <li> It has one flat surface and one more bulging surface that is a huge plus, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> These stones work great for removing dead skin and makes your skin smooth and soft!!</li>
            <li> It worked right away.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> and it came right off</li>
            <li> It worked right away.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I just used for the first time and was really surprise by how smooth it made my feet feel after one use.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend if you want to get your feet baby smooth at nail salon quality</li>
            <li> it is well worth the money... also had very fast shipping....</li>
            <li> This, along with a great scrub, works the best of all the other things I tried to remove the callus and rough, dead skin at the bottom of my feet.  </li>
            <li> My feet looked completely normal and smooth after that one use.</li>
            <li> First, I think it&#x27;s worth noting that the pumice stone I received didn&#x27;t come in a box.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come in a nice box like shown just a flimsy mesh, and takes way too long coming from china.</li>
            <li> This one is way more smooth than the professional stones used at the salons, so much so that it simply glides over the heel area and isn&#x27;t abrasive enough to do any good.  </li>
            <li> I attribute part of this to the fact that it is a little rougher and asymmetrical, therefore, is able to reach spots that the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; stone wasn&#x27;t able to reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it about every 2 weeks to smooth my feet (making my summer sandals even more fantastic looking)and hands (after working in my flower beds my hands are a mess!)</li>
            <li> My heels tend to crack fairly deep multiple times a year, and this stone has been great at maintaining minimum cracking.</li>
            <li> and the fact it does such an awesome job removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li> This one not only gets the job done, but is durable and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> The product is also easy to clean as you can simply run it under some water with some hand/dish soap.  </li>
            <li> It came packaged in a nice little box and it&#x27;s about a 3 1/2 inch oval (the long way), good size for holding in your hand.</li>
            <li> but it feels as light as a feather and very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent pumice stone for my very calloused feet, and this is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> at first i thought it might hurt but its very gentle.</li>
            <li> Good sized product works pretty good takes a little time to get all dead skin off this way thats why 4 stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> so people are aware that this can happen.</li>
            <li> Nice and rough.</li>
            <li> My first thoughts upon opening the package were that this stone is humongous.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that it the coloring of the stone will come out in your water at first!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> For me this is the first time purchasing a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> My feet feel really soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> and I tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but if you are looking for a salon quality lava stone with great scrubbing/removing power, keep looking, this one isn&#x27;t it!!</li>
            <li> This lava stone is exactly what my feet needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different pumice stones throughout the years and they never lasted.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Works much better than the regular Pumice stone.</li>
            <li> started to have a difference after using it the first time.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this intimidating looking stone</li>
            <li> Also love that this is solid.</li>
            <li> DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT IS INTENDED FOR.</li>
            <li> I have much better results using a glass crystal file, which can be found for a similar price.</li>
            <li> It is the first thing I see on women</li>
            <li> The first one was alright.  </li>
            <li> This works on The First use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly what it looks like, but does not come in a box, haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used this pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I actually like the results from this pumice stone better than the callous eliminator.  </li>
            <li> Plus the stone is very lightweight!</li>
            <li> I waited almost over a month to get it after I placed my order, and I really hope it worth it.</li>
            <li> A hanging strap would be nice, but since it floats, it&#x27;s not really a problem.</li>
            <li> When I first received this stone, I was a bit dismayed as I was hoping that the texture would be coarser (like another stone I had purchased elsewhere).</li>
            <li> it never fails to amaze me.</li>
            <li> ive been using it for a month and have absolutely ZERO complaints!</li>
            <li> I first laid eyes on this pumice</li>
            <li> I am still using this several months later and loving it!</li>
            <li> is my first time buying this sort of pumice stone</li>
            <li> so well she actually cried because how much better her feet felt and her feet don&#x27;t tear up socks</li>
            <li> Seems pretty durable.</li>
            <li> which were pretty beat up &amp; calloused.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it was meant to do.</li>
            <li> It appeared intimidating when it arrived as it was surprisingly dense, heavy, and looked meaner than a cheese</li>
            <li> But it does get rid of the dead skin, so I guess it&#x27;s good if you have callouses.</li>
            <li> I also am able to smooth down the calluses by leaning over the bathtub as I rub the pumice stone over my feet.</li>
            <li> It was rather large and rough and does work nicely.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> If there were peruse soaking or other instructions that would eliminate this problem, it would be nice if there were instructions included.</li>
            <li> However, after ordering it, it isn&#x27;t the same and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of scrubbing the feet and removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li> My mom had a true pumice stone when I was growing up, so I was surprised the first time I bought one at a drugstore to find it was nothing like what she had.  </li>
            <li> Not great - nice packaging, but my Mr. Pumice stone works much better.</li>
            <li> This arrived just fine, however my particular stone has a natural crack formation in it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried countless other pumice stones or pedeggs to do the trick between pedicures and this is great.</li>
            <li> My feet, which are often calloused to hell and back thanks to running and rock climbing, and which are often the cause of much finger wagging from the mani-pedi tech, have never looked better.</li>
            <li> It works much better than those rectangular grey pumice stones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks nice because of its dark color and</li>
            <li> Great for rough dry feet, I use it regularly in the shower and it helps keep my feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li> No on the contrary, to my surprise, after the first use the results were more than i had expected.</li>
            <li> I wear sandals, or am barefoot most of the summer, so my feet and heels tend to get dry.  </li>
            <li> Makes your feet super soft</li>
            <li> I want sure about this at first because I thought I was buying it from a manufacturer or distributor, but it came shipped to me with partial packaging,  like something someone had bought but didn&#x27;t want and had already pulled the cardboard insert out.</li>
            <li> I wish it was an easy process to get my money back.</li>
            <li> My feet are super soft now just like a girl&#x27;s feet should always be.</li>
            <li> This one is large.  </li>
            <li> grater.&lt;br /&gt;However, it worked great as a pumice stone and outperformed a blue square one I previously owned by leaps and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this highly, but if you want pretty, don&#x27;t buy it.  </li>
            <li> and it was great, but starting getting a little funky.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, have to dry it a little after the shower so the water doesn&#x27;t stay in the pores, but my feet are super soft!</li>
            <li> Really upset to see that it is now only available as an add-on item.  </li>
            <li> Great for removing extra dead skin between pedicures.</li>
            <li> Compared to the synthetic white one I had from a cheap foot care package, which had been falling apart, this stone is much nicer</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to really work.</li>
            <li> works really well too.  </li>
            <li> It may be a bit much for grinding elbows</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> It takes literally about 2 minutes to scrub off all of the nitty gritty and leave a smooth bottom without having to put in a lot of effort.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Worked very well for mah nasteh feet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i used to use real pumice stone</li>
            <li> you really have to push and add pressure when using it...</li>
            <li> it works but not as well as a real pumice stone or lava rock...</li>
            <li> gentle strokes).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Soak your feet, soap up the stone and gently rub all over and</li>
            <li> It shipped fast but didn&#x27;t come in a box or with care instructions</li>
            <li> No matter how much I cleaned and scrubbed, the brown ring would not go away.</li>
            <li> They would take off too much skin and the exposed layers would then crack and bleed.  </li>
            <li> This stone takes of the excess skin on her heels but doesn&#x27;t take so much off that cracking occurs.</li>
            <li> I came across this pumice stone, a REAL PUMICE STONE unlike the ones I&#x27;ve bought from department stores, including Origins.  </li>
            <li> This is a very well shaped and sized pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> , it works very well.</li>
            <li> i.e. paint spots on bath tub, rub this stone gently and it removes the paint without damaging the tub surface.</li>
            <li> More expensive, but well worth it for its longevity :)</li>
            <li> Just the scrub alone is not enough to get smooth skin on my heels.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I think the Tweezerman Pink Pedro Callus Stone is so much better.</li>
            <li> But with that said, it works well, and really that&#x27;s all that matters.  </li>
            <li> decided to give it a try (getting my winter skin ready for spring)</li>
            <li> did not like it too much.</li>
            <li> it works very well, but beware..</li>
            <li> have very rough/dry hands and feet .</li>
            <li> I even showed ny boyfriend and he agreed it looked really sketchy.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is very important due to mold and bacteria which can get into the stone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is very useful after soaking your feet and left my feet feeling smoother.  </li>
            <li> This thing does work on my feet better than any other stone I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works for some, but i&#x27;ll try other options.</li>
            <li> This works amazing on the feet and my husband super tough hands</li>
            <li> Seems a little too rough in the picture, but it&#x27;s actually quite perfect.</li>
            <li> This one has been pretty sturdy so far, and I like</li>
            <li> Ive used these previously and love them.  </li>
            <li> favorite part is that it takes a fraction of the time for me to use this stone than it did my previous one.</li>
            <li> let my better half guess at where these items have been and were used for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also more of an off brown color rather than black.</li>
            <li> Too rough and crumbles easily.</li>
            <li> Wish there were less large-sized voids in it and that it was more uniform in texture.</li>
            <li> This egg-shaped stone is somewhat disappointing--it doesn&#x27;t perform particularly well, hence the rating.</li>
            <li> The holes and crevices are deep and work quickly.</li>
            <li> I have looked everywhere for this type of pumice that is super coarse.  </li>
            <li> I can only imagine how lovely my feet will be looking and feeling when I use this regularly.</li>
            <li> The surface is very porous and works well by buffing away dead skin without shredding and/or damaging healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Have learned that using a facial scrub (Such as St. Ives Apricot) makes experience even better.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to go with</li>
            <li> If it had a handle or platform that was of high quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> used it to get rid of hard water build up in a toilet works great</li>
            <li> works so much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried to smooth out and get rid of all the dead dry skin on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This being said I love this little lava rock.</li>
            <li> Tried them here and there over the years, but this is the first one that I&#x27;m certain will make it&#x27;s way into regular use for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It fits nicely in the hand and the curved edges allow use in hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I&#x27;m totally happy with this natural product!!</li>
            <li> , now my feet are so soft and look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is not obnoxiously rough, nor is it smooth.  </li>
            <li> When I use this as a general body exfoliator (1-2 times per week), I add a generous dollop of body wash and apply only light pressure.  </li>
            <li> I am able to use this and save some money not having to go in for a pedi every few weeks.</li>
            <li> I use this Tend Skin (although I&#x27;m sure any ingrown hair solution will work just as well) at night and when I shower I rub this over my legs to remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li> I found the artificial substances better at callous control but it is good for daily use</li>
            <li> Immediately after showering, while my feet are still moist, I apply Avocado Oil mixed with lotion and massage into both feet and don socks until completely absorbed.</li>
            <li> As such, I pretty much wrote off the whole idea of natural pumice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does look scary and almost like a cheese grater, but it does the job and produces a very nice result without any discomfort despite its looks.</li>
            <li> It may take several (or many) uses for those with very dry, cracked or flaking soles; however, any product will if this is the condition of your feet.</li>
            <li> Other pumice stones I have tried were too smooth.  </li>
            <li> The first day I did a quicky scour, the 2nd time I took more time and got all that dead skin off.</li>
            <li> I ground years of callous off my feet and the stone looks like new.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t throw it if you live in a glass house.</li>
            <li> While other pumice stones and files didn&#x27;t do too much for me, with continued use of this stone I have baby soft feet, especially since I use it with O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Cream.  </li>
            <li> For the average foot, it is probably just fine.</li>
            <li> I had anticipated better results from using this &amp;#34;natural pumice stone&amp;#34;, but it simply doesn&#x27;t exfoliate as I expected.</li>
            <li> The texture was perfect, not too rough not too soft and after only a few days of use I could recognize the increase in softness for my hands and feet and a smaller amount of calluses.  </li>
            <li> It has very &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; qualities, yes-- as in dust is constantly coming off it, no matter how much rinsing or scrubbing you do.</li>
            <li> It is strong, durable and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Scrubs dead skin off easily &amp; leaves the area soft &amp; clean from dirt &amp; dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is a handful sized stone not a small pebble sized stone.</li>
            <li> as far as I know you took them out of your backyard!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I noticed the stone was disintegrating with use, I guess it it natural!?</li>
            <li> Since I have professional pedis done regularly, this little gem keeps my feet looking great until my next appointment.&lt;br /&gt;Since I believe in using natural products when I can, I clean the pumice stone with a toothbrush, rinse, soak it in a white vinegar solution and let air dry.  </li>
            <li> Other pumice stones I&#x27;ve tried are too soft and wear down quickly, or they break easily.  </li>
            <li> Huge improvement with less effort.</li>
            <li> It appears to be real pumice rock vs the molded concrete rectangles you buy from the &#x27;big&#x27; stores.</li>
            <li> I store on a dry sponge on my sink so that it&#x27;s nice and dry for my next use.</li>
            <li> I agree its a great stone for feet and rough skin, but it&#x27;s smaller than it looks one of the two I ordered was smaller than the other.</li>
            <li> Where I work, I&#x27;m pretty much always on my feet, so when I get home, my feet can get a little rough over time, and this helps out a lot to smooth them out.</li>
            <li> i really like it its just what i want , the same i saw here and new  </li>
            <li> found that the lava pumice stone actually provides better results on my heels and calluses than the stone I was previously using.</li>
            <li> The holes are rather large and seem to actually gather up debris.  </li>
            <li> Without intervention, the calluses quickly become too large and rip off leaving raw skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never sure that rinsing it really gets it clean again.  </li>
            <li> The product that I received was in a hard plastic case not in a box as shown here but does the job and is better than block of cement with pores.</li>
            <li> I still need to figure out the proper way to clean the thing and it seems to take a while to completely dry out when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> does it&#x27;s job nothing professional</li>
            <li> My feet were soft and supple.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t any problem with it since.</li>
            <li> Pummel my feet please so somehow they become soft,</li>
            <li> my feet have never been so soft.</li>
            <li> I have purchased one for my mom, my husband and each of my adult sons.  </li>
            <li> Too coarse, I much prefer the finer foot scrubbers.</li>
            <li> I used it and don&#x27;t really see a big difference.</li>
            <li> Since it is a natural product, I recommend not storing in the shower/bath because the brown comes off a bit.</li>
            <li> It removes the dead skin off your feet leaving it silky smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, the presentation is completely lacking.</li>
            <li> So far it works well for maintenance in between using a shaver on my heels.</li>
            <li> it was too soft and was the equivalent of rubbing paper on my feet.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that this stone is natural in material and color.</li>
            <li> oh man this thing really fixed my feet.</li>
            <li> I was rather surprised to get the stone in a mailing package with no packaging, bag, nothing.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen natural lava rocks, and that&#x27;s what this one is, just shaped into an oblong.</li>
            <li> This seems like it will be too soft to get the job done for me.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I frequently get scaly calluses on my hands which flake/tear off and causes pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is powerful so you must be careful not to over do it.</li>
            <li> The reason it gets two stars is it looks good and the shape is reasonable,but it is useless for me.</li>
            <li> It looks to be a real stone, it fits nicely in my hand, and it&#x27;s small enough to store easily, so it&#x27;s dry and ready to go for the next time.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended--especially over smoother stones and ones that mount with suction cups (it&#x27;s tough and ineffective to move your foot against a fixed stone; better to hold the stone and move it against your foot!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some odd reason, I did smell the stone, and it smells earthy, which is really cool to me.</li>
            <li> PS, works nice on hands and other trouble spots as well.</li>
            <li> It really helps get the loose, dead hairs out easily.  </li>
            <li> and I have gone from cracked dry feet to smooth and soft pink feet.</li>
            <li> I am the first to admit I was totally wrong about this pumice stone; it worked phenomenal and literally buffed my feet to a shine.  </li>
            <li> I started using the pumice stone every day to get my heels back to normal</li>
            <li> It is hard to the touch and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this again in the future but not so soon because its a pretty large rock that will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> However, I went back about a month later to order another to carry in my suitcase (I travel a lot), and what arrived at my house was about 1/3 the size of the original one I ordered, not as rough, and came in shrink-wrap.  </li>
            <li> Once I feel its time to get a new stone, I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Have to soak feet in hot water for at least 5 mins first then scrub scrub scrub</li>
            <li> but this just fits the bill like no other.  </li>
            <li> Can definitely tell a difference in this as &amp;#34;the real thing&amp;#34; vs. the ones I&#x27;ve bought at beauty stores that wear down fast.</li>
            <li> I rubbed the lava stone on the rough and dry area after showering, and on the third day my elbow was smooth and the pain was gone.  </li>
            <li> I would use it again for the thick calcium deposits but not for a fine layer.</li>
            <li> I suffer from very dry hills, This really worked great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even rubbing the skin lightly, strips the skin and leaves it red and raw.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly large pumice stone that should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for myself I use it in the shower with a little body wash and after the first use my feet are already soft .</li>
            <li> Looks scary and intimidating, but feels amazing on your skin.</li>
            <li> I received and was charged for two items when your invoice on amazon clearly states I only ordered one.</li>
            <li> I use it gently every day or two and can see this lasting for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rough at all.</li>
            <li> I am 73 years old and got some medical problems.  </li>
            <li> Regular feet stones are either too flimsy, or don&#x27;t have big enough whole in them.</li>
            <li> The light rubbing is enough to get rid of all that gross dead skin.</li>
            <li> In another week they shall be as soft as a baby&#x27;s (they are almost there now) and then,  I will just use it daily for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It totally isn&#x27;t what is pictured as far as packaging goes.</li>
            <li> but I can barely feel it when i rub it on my feet.</li>
            <li> First off this rock is way bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> It made my super dry, tough feet soft the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Because i is so dark, however, it can leave a dark ring in your tub, but this is easily rinsed off and is not staining.</li>
            <li> After rinsing all the dead skin rinses right out of the holes in the stone.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh, just right.</li>
            <li> I think I described it as Bad Ass when I opened the package but after the first use, I was in love.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Months later, still loving my stone.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to rub so hard, but after two uses, my feet were smooth again for several months!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also just not rough enough for me.  </li>
            <li> This makes my feet baby soft after a long day .</li>
            <li> It cleans my feet and after about five uses has really smoothed my foot down.  </li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t even have to break it in half to get to a rougher surface - it works as it is and is very long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work so well on my feet - wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This does tend to beat our feet up a little more than the average person, and this stone has been an answer to our problem of jolting awake in horror when either of the bottom of our foot touches the other in bed at night.</li>
            <li> It got the dry, dead skin off in had the time and effort as my old stones, and the result was so much smoother.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this stone to be any better or worse than other pumice stones I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad one, or if my big manly feet are too rough for this thing, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> You have very specific reasons to be searching for a pumice stone... and long story short, it get&#x27;s the job done well.</li>
            <li> Upon opening it and picking it up I was surprised that it was not much bigger than the store bought stone I had previously been using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people like it so much.</li>
            <li> The stone did not last long.  </li>
            <li> I hope it last a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stone is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I hope it last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I absolutely found it too much for knuckles, literally grinding them too thin for comfort, but I am not a delicate guy in any way, and gentle pressure is meaningless to me.</li>
            <li> At 4.5&amp;#34; long, 3.25&amp;#34; wide, and 1.5&amp;#34; thick, this stone fills your hand, feels just right, and is plenty coarse enough without overdoing it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was my stone, but it was not as effective as some reviewer stated: I have tough dry skin, and scrub as I might, it helped, but needed a few tries.  </li>
            <li> My toilets all had a brown ring inside the toilet bowl.</li>
            <li> A unique take on the usual pumice stone &amp; works as well if not better.</li>
            <li> It will remove dry skin or a callous in nothing flat.  </li>
            <li> The product us MUCH smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Its much bigger than expected</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;ll hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> This stone isn&#x27;t quite rough enough, so I&#x27;ll use it for feet and heels instead.</li>
            <li> I can now keep callous feet at bay rather than constantly needing a pedicure because my feet are too rough.  </li>
            <li> Item is ok a bit small and it arrive broken</li>
            <li> Rough enough to remove dead skin but leaves feet feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It looks as described but you should know that this is very hard and very coarse, a real stone.</li>
            <li> I still have some dry skin on my feet after use.</li>
            <li> I rinse it off thoroughly after I use it, keep it in a dry corner in my shower, and rinse it thoroughly before I use it again.  </li>
            <li> After I am through using it for a session, I simply rinse off the dried skin, lay the stone out to dry and then put it back into the reusable plastic case that it came in.</li>
            <li> I had two corns on my big toe, and while it did slough off the dead skin, it didn&#x27;t do anything about the actual bump.</li>
            <li> But for me the dead skin was only a symptom, and the stone only cured my symptom (temporarily), not the underlying problem.</li>
            <li> Decent but not amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exaggerating a single bit.  </li>
            <li> Its not returnable, so it was a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount of Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Nourishing Body Wash to the stone and scrub both feet well.</li>
            <li> and I used it on my feet for about 5 minutes and it almost completely removed all of the dead skin!</li>
            <li> it feels like a fake rock made in a lab (whether that is true or not...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need the stone to buffer away loose skin.</li>
            <li> my feet were soooo dry and scratchy before using this!</li>
            <li> Did next to nothing and felt really odd because of the shape.</li>
            <li> I had really dry, dead, and cracked skin along the side and bottom of my big toes.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my old one was not sturdy enough and it&#x27;s poor construction caused it to separate from the wooden platform and break in half.</li>
            <li> What a difference from that one that leaves all the little pieces of blue foam all over my shower floor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than the picture</li>
            <li> This stone really works on those tough calluses on the sides and bottom of feet.  </li>
            <li> Most pumice stones are ugly in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last</li>
            <li> Not even worth my time to ship dirty used rocks back.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it did anything different than a regular pumice stone, but this seemed to be at least comparable to the pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I used the stone once per week for roughly three weeks and it shredded my heels.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make it any harder to use, but rather just a statement of fact.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too rough on my feet.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> and now I only have to use the pumice stone a few times a week to maintain the softness in my foot.</li>
            <li> I use the stone on my feet as well as on my rough and bumpy elbows, knees and my thighs(use</li>
            <li> Works well for smoothing rough feet.</li>
            <li> I personally use it for the calluses on my hands from heavy weights.</li>
            <li> However, be careful not to use them in combination too often or too vigorously because it can start to irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> Being a type 1 diabetic I have to be careful with the products I use for my feet.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Just wet your feet for 10 minutes before use.</li>
            <li> It made me nervous, but careful inspection seemed to indicate it hadn&#x27;t been used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> stone a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> By looking at it you would think it would be rough on the feet.</li>
            <li> Does what it is expected to do</li>
            <li> Just be warned and be careful when ordering this.  </li>
            <li> Takes care of the rough edges and spurs without a problem.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t work I don&#x27;t wear my shoes, so I have rough calluses on my feet .</li>
            <li> I grew up in the Southern California desert and burned my feet a few times as a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected it to feel rough because of the texture</li>
            <li> Only downside is that dead skin can get stuck in the holes</li>
            <li> Nit what was expected</li>
            <li> bounds.&lt;br /&gt;The shape, color, and weight are all excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4 months later of HEAVY USE:&lt;br /&gt;Still kicking ass, not disintegrating- still retains its sharp and rough body.</li>
            <li> It arrived without the box, only a plain plastic case.</li>
            <li> Often pumice stones leave my hands raw from holding them instead of whatever I was actually trying to rub with it.</li>
            <li> would also like to state that it is heaver than any other stone I have used.</li>
            <li> The smaller sized rectangular ones I used in the past would make my hands ache.</li>
            <li> I use it once every other day.</li>
            <li> When you first take it out of the box, it looks extremely scary and you can&#x27;t imagine rubbing all that roughness and crater</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to purchase another one due to the ineffectiveness of other stones.  </li>
            <li> I do like that this is just the stone and not attached to a stick or some other piece.  </li>
            <li> This stone has much larger holes than other, gray stones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I just keep it in the shower and use it every other day to prevent dryness</li>
            <li> Plus, I got stuck in a rain storm the other day</li>
            <li> Have not had any problems out of it yet, due to the fact that it&#x27;s a rock.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t hurt your feet to use like other stones .</li>
            <li> I use this every time I am in the shower, just rub my heels and other rough spots and, viola!  </li>
            <li> Rough spots are gone!  </li>
            <li> With this, it pulls off the dry dead skin.  </li>
            <li> When you use it just dont press/rub down on your foot to hard be gentle and it will do the job, press too hard you may bruise your foot.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is too tough but it doesn&#x27;t really grind my dead skin down.</li>
            <li> I go barefoot frequently, so I have very thick calluses.</li>
            <li> I feel a little more than disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t scrub hard and only spend about 10 seconds per foot</li>
            <li> Not worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> In all honesty it&#x27;s not worth wasting your money on.</li>
            <li> It does look nicer on display then the average pumice stone.</li>
            <li> As it wears down I find myself nicking the stone to get an edge.</li>
            <li> It looks mean, and looks like it could do some damage, which, if not used properly, could probably do so.  </li>
            <li> Got this, as well as a few other bath/beauty products, for my fianc&amp;eacute; and she loves it.</li>
            <li> you have tough feet that no other pumice stone works on, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Although, it did crack in half when I dropped it in the tub.</li>
            <li> does not work too well, and came several weeks later... not impressed with this product</li>
            <li> like I was previously worried about.</li>
            <li> Just as described, and size of half a mans fist.</li>
            <li> The box it came in looked like it was previously used or opened.</li>
            <li> less overuse injury w this style than others.</li>
            <li> I just use a largerghter touch if I need a less aggressive result.</li>
            <li> It does look a little nicer than the typical gray pumice stones though.</li>
            <li> I wear flip flops all the time, and this makes my feet really dry, thick and get cracked.  </li>
            <li> It worked a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little wet,but is sweet!!perfect...........</li>
            <li> It does get off some of the dead skin, but no more so than any other pumice stone or file that I have used.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little dirty straight out of the package</li>
            <li> I use them all over my body in the winter and summer removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li> B0018MQHO2 Cuccio Earth Stone Lava Pumice]]Pumice to exfolliate the dead skin which had built up on my feet over the winter months.</li>
            <li> This stone removed years of dead skin off the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li> I would always get out of the shower and leave smears of dead foot skin on whatever I walked on, rub against or my socks.</li>
            <li> She had run into trouble by letting the beauty shop people do this for her.  </li>
            <li> It does nothing whatsoever to soften your feet or slough off dead skin.  </li>
            <li> few rubs a days and callouses go away</li>
            <li> After soaking your feet this will remove all dead skin.</li>
            <li> Mine even has a side to smoothen the skin after removing dead skin.</li>
            <li> You will never catch my feet not smooth.  </li>
            <li> Kinda upset or a wasted purchase.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier because this thing is stuff and shreds the dead skin away.  </li>
            <li> After using this for just a few weeks i no longer need to use tape to climb.</li>
            <li> This thing releases so much dead skin</li>
            <li> I also bought a few others.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s HEAVY.</li>
            <li> This picture is not accurate.  </li>
            <li> However, due to the uneven texture of the lava rock it does not effectively remove calluses.</li>
            <li> I received a plain rock in a fabric jewelry bag.</li>
            <li> I misplaced it somehow and never able to find it again.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little less expensive but other than this</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to scrub hard to remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m boring if I dream about pumice.  </li>
            <li> I got a \\&quot;pumice\\&quot; stone on a small holder.  </li>
            <li> This stone looks really scary when you open it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry that this stone is too small (it isn&#x27;t) or won&#x27;t get the job done (it will).</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> Ok my feet aren&#x27;t nasty but they can get funky.</li>
            <li> I use it for shedding tough skin off of my feet (I boulder for 3 hours every other day).</li>
            <li> Winter in the Midwest are very harsh and drying.</li>
            <li> One comment stated that it was very heavy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t shy away based on the cost because it&#x27;s going to be part of your life for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive but decided to start small and slow.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say my feet were terribly dry.</li>
            <li> When it came in the mail the rock was broken in half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking long and hard for this stone and not that white man made crap with a hole and a rope through it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an ugly black color</li>
            <li> It is hard to get to my feet.  </li>
            <li> I hope this was some an oversight and not an intentional ploy to sucker someone into purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pumice stone, not much can go wrong.</li>
            <li> I mean its a stone, not much you can do wrong with it</li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> I mean, its a Pumice stone, does what it&#x27;s told.</li>
            <li> I had a painful patch  of dry skin on one of my elbows from biking in the harsh winter climate of the Northeast.  </li>
            <li> No more sharp cutting blades for the dead&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a male and have really bad calluses on my heals.</li>
            <li> and there was a little mountain looking sharp shape that could of cut me :(</li>
            <li> Ditto for stubborn hard water stains on refrigerator/ freezers!</li>
            <li> It looks like I got a dirty rock, in a banged up, also dirty, clear plastic package with no label.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a competitive dancer and a waitress (where I walk for 7+ hours per shift) and that resulted in some pretty nasty callouses that made it embarrassing to wear sandals.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weather down or get dirty.</li>
            <li> These should be boxed at the very least...</li>
            <li> (they tend to break easily or not do a great job).</li>
            <li> The skin started to harden, so before it became any worse</li>
            <li> and I have no idea if it has been used before it looks like the picture but in not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible time with rough skin on my feet and heels, and I&#x27;d about given up after having used every cream and other type of product on the market.</li>
            <li> sometimes i would even have trouble sleeping because it feels like my feet are suffocating!</li>
            <li> Seriously, it rocks!</li>
            <li> I had severe issues with my skin ripping off and the dead skin made my feet and climbing shoes smell bad.</li>
            <li> This is a tough stone!</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I have to be wary of keeping it out of sight.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse these items were not in the package show in the picture, BUT IN OPENED, USED, UNSEALED PLASTIC BAGS WITH HAIR COMB STICKERS ON THEM!</li>
            <li> Those store bought rectangle stones are useless to me and take for-ever.  </li>
            <li> Definitely the worst buying experience on Amazon in 15 years of buying.</li>
            <li> If doesnt have a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Buy it; you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> What can possibly go wrong with a rock?   </li>
            <li> She has terrible corns on her feet from her disease (like so bad it hurts to walk) and no other pumice stones worked, they would just break.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this unless you want dirty used packaging.</li>
            <li> I asked for a refund but they wanted the dirty stones returned.</li>
            <li> This attracts a lot of dirt which has been almost impossible for me to take off.  </li>
            <li> Bad idea.  </li>
            <li> It was so bad I started forming a bad habit of removing my skin with my hands and a knife.</li>
            <li> It was a problem because my feet looked bad and always snagged my sheets</li>
            <li> My elbow literally felt like sandpaper and was painful to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It works well for removing calluses, without being painfully abrasive.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> and I almost purchase everything on it, but I am so disappointed with this purchase, from the beginning (shipment and the seller&#x27;s response) to the ending (the product itself).</li>
            <li> I have used Cuccio lava stones for years and have been disappointed.</li>
            <li> So, an unpleasant situation turned out in my favor!</li>
            <li> But I cannot use it: painful!</li>
            <li> Had terrible callouses on my heels.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend works in construction and he gets nasty calluses on his hands.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> Even my heels which are the worst.</li>
            <li> Absolutely disgusting!</li>
            <li> But it is the worst thing that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and this now smells really terrible.  </li>
            <li> HORRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy this falsely advertised product!!!!!  </li>

            <li> It looks as described but you should know that this is very hard and very coarse, a real stone. Even rubbing the skin lightly, strips the skin and leaves it red and raw.</li>
            <li> Got this, as well as a few other bath/beauty products, for my fianc&amp;eacute; and she loves it. Works perfectly, nicely packaged and does exactly what it is supposed to. I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it! it also removes body hair when scrubbing with soup</li>
            <li> This lava stone is nice. It is shaped well just like in the photos. It wasn&#x27;t wrapped so nicely though but the overall stone does it job. I wish it were just a bit sharper and rougher so I didn&#x27;t have to rub so hard, but after two uses, my feet were smooth again for several months! Now it just sits there and looks nice in the shower.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to really work. It&#x27;s not rough at all.</li>
            <li> I like this pumice stone.  It&#x27;s pretty large, but a nice size for your hand.  works really well too.  I will be buying another one of these.  I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last but I&#x27;m thinking maybe 5 months or more</li>
            <li> This is my dream pumice.  Okay, I&#x27;m boring if I dream about pumice.  This thing is rugged and washable and for me fits great in my hand.  I ground years of callous off my feet and the stone looks like new.  I used to snag socks when putting them on.  I had callouses on callouses.  No more!  It may be a bit much for grinding elbows and I absolutely found it too much for knuckles, literally grinding them too thin for comfort, but I am not a delicate guy in any way, and gentle pressure is meaningless to me. It&#x27;s such an ugly black color it makes me look good. That ain&#x27;t easy.  I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this highly, but if you want pretty, don&#x27;t buy it.  What you get is great performance and durability.  This is about 50 grit or so in sandpaper terms.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Had terrible callouses on my heels. Now they&#x27;re really smooth &amp; look great!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, have to dry it a little after the shower so the water doesn&#x27;t stay in the pores, but my feet are super soft!</li>
            <li> I used the stone once per week for roughly three weeks and it shredded my heels. I&#x27;m now trying to repair the torn skin. Lotion and socks overnight is helping. I&#x27;m going to try a file next.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! I use it about every 2 weeks to smooth my feet (making my summer sandals even more fantastic looking)and hands (after working in my flower beds my hands are a mess!)</li>
            <li> The best pumice stone I have ever used! Works great under the shower or during a bath.</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose and is very good just as described.</li>
            <li> Ive used these previously and love them.  I use them all over my body in the winter and summer removing dead skin.  Butt , elbows, inner thighs, arm pit, hands.  You&#x27;ll have really smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good quality stone for a while. This one is the right shape to fit in the palm of your hand and the right coarseness to get the job done. Will definitely buy this again. Nice packaging as well.</li>
            <li> does it&#x27;s job nothing professional</li>
            <li> a piece of lava, what can you say</li>
            <li> good for mens hands as well as womens feet! I bought 3 and gave 2 as gifts!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my wife. She loved it! It appears to be real pumice rock vs the molded concrete rectangles you buy from the &#x27;big&#x27; stores.</li>
            <li> the stone is almost too smooth, I would prefer more holes to be rougher and able to smooth skin easier. but that&#x27;s just for one I got. I mean its a stone, not much you can do wrong with it haha. its good. didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li> Item is ok a bit small and it arrive broken</li>
            <li> This arrived just fine, however my particular stone has a natural crack formation in it.  Not a big deal, but want to mention it so people are aware that this can happen. I don&#x27;t find this stone to be any better or worse than other pumice stones I&#x27;ve owned.  It does look a little nicer than the typical gray pumice stones though.</li>
            <li> I ordered the [[ASIN:B0018MQHO2 Cuccio Earth Stone Lava Pumice]]Pumice to exfolliate the dead skin which had built up on my feet over the winter months. Winter in the Midwest are very harsh and drying. Needless to say my feet were terribly dry. I thought it would take more than one use to restore my feet to summer ready condition. No on the contrary, to my surprise, after the first use the results were more than i had expected. My feet were soft and supple. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It works well and comfortable</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good pumice stone for over 4 years as I can no longer find a good one at big-name retailers (they tend to break easily or not do a great job). This is a larger pumice stone with some good weight, which helps to really scrub my heels, which is what I need. My heels tend to crack fairly deep multiple times a year, and this stone has been great at maintaining minimum cracking. I love this stone!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I definitely recommend this product for others to buy. The pumice fits great in hand. Scrubs dead skin off easily &amp; leaves the area soft &amp; clean from dirt &amp; dry skin. And the pumice doesn&#x27;t shed gritty droppings. This product is well deserving of the 5 stars that I rated it!!!  :-)</li>
            <li> Received cracked. The product us MUCH smaller than expected. Not worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> this rock will take off dried great stuff off your hands. nuff said.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, not too harsh, but very effective. Some pumice stones are too fine, which is what probably drives people to purchase all the pricey pedicure/callous products out there. My feet looked good after one use; after three days, I had pedi-perfect feet.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Nice and rough.</li>
            <li> I did not find this to be any good. Didn&#x27;t really work so well on my feet - wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Great, simple, works well</li>
            <li> Good size and quality, does the job.</li>
            <li> Best pumice ever. Does the job and doesn’t fall apart.</li>
            <li> I am 73 years old and got some medical problems.  It is hard to get to my feet.  They need attention.  I could not wait any longer.  I got a \\&quot;pumice\\&quot; stone on a small holder.  The stone did not last long.  It fell off the holder.  I held it in my fingers and used it some.  It worked a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I decided from seeing this Cuccio Earth Lave Pumice Stone at Amazon and reading the reviews to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;  I am glad that I did.  It is excellent.  It worked right away.  I could see and feel the difference right away.&lt;br /&gt;  I love it.  I hope it last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;  I saw a review here that said there was no instructions on how to use it.  My stone came in a box and the instructions were on the box. But under a white label. I had to peel off the label.&lt;br /&gt;  I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> These are nice.  I like Mr. Pumice (synthetic pumice) better because it does a more aggressive job but these are serviceable.</li>
            <li> My first thoughts upon opening the package were that this stone is humongous. Upon opening it and picking it up I was surprised that it was not much bigger than the store bought stone I had previously been using. It was a lot rougher, not symmetrical in shape, which is to be expected for a natural stone.&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to state that it is heaver than any other stone I have used. This doesn&#x27;t make it any harder to use, but rather just a statement of fact. For some odd reason, I did smell the stone, and it smells earthy, which is really cool to me. I love nature!&lt;br /&gt;I found that the lava pumice stone actually provides better results on my heels and calluses than the stone I was previously using. I attribute part of this to the fact that it is a little rougher and asymmetrical, therefore, is able to reach spots that the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; stone wasn&#x27;t able to reach.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is that it takes a fraction of the time for me to use this stone than it did my previous one. Just be aware that it the coloring of the stone will come out in your water at first!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I purchased this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a pumice stone to use in the shower. Great for the foot and heel area. Cleans up easily also</li>
            <li> It is a great size; perfect to hold while using on my feet. The smaller sized rectangular ones I used in the past would make my hands ache. No more! Really worth the price. I am very pleased</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great shipping speed!</li>
            <li> This review is based on my own personal experiences. This means if you decide to purchase this item you may or may not feel the same way about it. For me this is the first time purchasing a pumice stone. I have had this stone for several months now. I use it once every other day. So far it has done a great job. My feet feel really soft and smooth after using it. It&#x27;s not too rough on my feet. It&#x27;s easy to clean it. Once I feel its time to get a new stone, I will definitely buy this product again. I don&#x27;t have calluses. So I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of this product, when it comes to treating calluses.</li>
            <li> Not that coarse.  It&#x27;s actually pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is too tough but it doesn&#x27;t really grind my dead skin down.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite of the pumice stones I have tried.  The holes are rather large and seem to actually gather up debris.  I&#x27;m never sure that rinsing it really gets it clean again.  It&#x27;s also just not rough enough for me.  I still have some dry skin on my feet after use.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Although, it did crack in half when I dropped it in the tub.</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest pumice stones I have ever purchased. You can tell the difference immediately.  I am going to buy more for gifts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pumice stone. Not much else to say about it. Highly recommend. Shape and condition where both great. I find using it regularly greatly reduces foot odor.</li>
            <li> Such a necessity for calloused feet. Doesn&#x27;t weather down or get dirty. Stays clean and reliable, easy to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Felt this didn&#x27;t do anything for my feet. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> It came in pretty packaging and looked and felt nice. The weight of the pumice feels really good to hold and is a nice size.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend works in construction and he gets nasty calluses on his hands. Regular feet stones are either too flimsy, or don&#x27;t have big enough whole in them. This stone is awesome for hard-working hands! He didn&#x27;t even have to break it in half to get to a rougher surface - it works as it is and is very long-lasting. His hands are super smooth and soft every time he uses the stone - I love it!</li>
            <li> The best pumice stone ever!!!!! It takes literally about 2 minutes to scrub off all of the nitty gritty and leave a smooth bottom without having to put in a lot of effort.  Leaves your feet looking soft and flawless! I absolutely love it! Really upset to see that it is now only available as an add-on item.  Love it so much I would be willing to buy something else I needed in order to buy another stone when it is time to replace this one! GET THIS PUMICE STONE!!! You will not be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> I agree with all the women that reviewed this item.  I bought this for my girlfriend.  I actually used it too.  Did Great.</li>
            <li> A great exfoliator. Leaves skin smooth without irritation. The stone is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I have to be wary of keeping it out of sight. When I have friends over, they always ask and go to pick it up off the table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you give this stone a good rinsing after use, because your dead skin will really build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for callused heels!</li>
            <li> Overall good product. Great for heels. As it wears down I find myself nicking the stone to get an edge.</li>
            <li> This pumice stone gets those callouses right where you want them.&lt;br /&gt;There is a good amount of elbow grease that will be required, but will get you nice results.</li>
            <li> i really like it its just what i want , the same i saw here and new  , i like it  thanks</li>
            <li> I stand on my feet all day at work and my heels have definitely paid the price. The skin started to harden, so before it became any worse I researched the best pumice stones to use. This pumice stone is amazing! The reviews do not lie! When you first take it out of the box, it looks extremely scary and you can&#x27;t imagine rubbing all that roughness and crater filled rock on your skin. Well, get over your fear, dunk the pumice stone in warm water, and lightly rub it on your wet feet. It&#x27;s like magic! I felt a difference in a day. I started using the pumice stone every day to get my heels back to normal and now I only have to use the pumice stone a few times a week to maintain the softness in my foot. The light rubbing is enough to get rid of all that gross dead skin.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for mah nasteh feet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(:</li>
            <li> i used to use real pumice stone but i can&#x27;t find it so i tried this...it is good but it is more like a rock...you really have to push and add pressure when using it...it works but not as well as a real pumice stone or lava rock...</li>
            <li> I just got this product and I tried it for the first time.  It did a great job on my feet removing the rough skin.  I decided to try it on my elbows too and it did a good job as well.</li>
            <li> I used a pumice stone on a stick product that I saw on Amazon.  It literally broke after the second usage and crumbled into dust.  I&#x27;m not exaggerating a single bit.  The Cucciio Lava Pumice has lasted me, as of writing this, over 369 days, of regular use (not daily, of course).  I rinse it off thoroughly after I use it, keep it in a dry corner in my shower, and rinse it thoroughly before I use it again.  It doesn&#x27;t smell, it doesn&#x27;t fall apart, it doesn&#x27;t do anything that a quality pumice stone shouldn&#x27;t do.  Highly, highly recommend if you want to get your feet baby smooth at nail salon quality (and it&#x27;s healthy to boot!)</li>
            <li> Used for swimming Pool Calcium build up on tile it worked well did not scratch the tile but did break off to leave chunks at the bottom of the Pool. I would use it again for the thick calcium deposits but not for a fine layer.</li>
            <li> It is sizable so it fits in your hand well and because the grating is larger then others it scrubs off everything thatnyou do not want.</li>
            <li> It definitely works - and it definitely lasts!</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a week but it is the best stone I have used. Rough enough to remove dead skin but leaves feet feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I had a painful patch  of dry skin on one of my elbows from biking in the harsh winter climate of the Northeast.  My elbow literally felt like sandpaper and was painful to the touch.  I rubbed the lava stone on the rough and dry area after showering, and on the third day my elbow was smooth and the pain was gone.  Now I use the stone every day on my elbow and knees as a preventative measure.</li>
            <li> I been using this lava rock for more than a year. When it came in the mail the rock was broken in half. A bit of super glue fixed it up real quick. So far I haven&#x27;t any problem with it since.</li>
            <li> Thought it would have been rough.my Swedish foot file wris better. Bummer really thought it would be good</li>
            <li> Great pumice! The shape fits so nicely in your hand.</li>
            <li> If used properly, this is a great addition to your regime.  I wear sandals, or am barefoot most of the summer, so my feet and heels tend to get dry.  With this, it pulls off the dry dead skin.  It looks mean, and looks like it could do some damage, which, if not used properly, could probably do so.  This pumice is one of the better ones I have used. It looks to be a real stone, it fits nicely in my hand, and it&#x27;s small enough to store easily, so it&#x27;s dry and ready to go for the next time.  I received this during a product launch, at a reduced rate, for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Other pumice stones I have tried were too smooth.  My podiatrist recommended using a pumice stone for the callouses on the soles of my feet.  I was reluctant to purchase another one due to the ineffectiveness of other stones.  I did my researching, and I am thrilled w/this stone!  It makes my feet smooth!</li>
            <li> This stone removed years of dead skin off the bottom of my feet. I would always get out of the shower and leave smears of dead foot skin on whatever I walked on, rub against or my socks. No more! The first day I did a quicky scour, the 2nd time I took more time and got all that dead skin off. It&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this pumice stone.  I am a competitive dancer and a waitress (where I walk for 7+ hours per shift) and that resulted in some pretty nasty callouses that made it embarrassing to wear sandals.  While other pumice stones and files didn&#x27;t do too much for me, with continued use of this stone I have baby soft feet, especially since I use it with O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Cream.  My feet feel awesome.  I am no longer embarrassed to wear sandals or have my socks off in front of people.  There is no sign of deterioration after about 4 months of use.  I am a big big fan.</li>
            <li> This works on your feet - :)  I use it when I need it and I use a nice moisturizing lotion afterwards and my feet are nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I work 50 hours a week and so my feet tend to pay the price. I have tried countless other pumice stones or pedeggs to do the trick between pedicures and this is great. I am able to use this and save some money not having to go in for a pedi every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Easily removed my wife&#x27;s calluses and proved to be a great spa stone.</li>
            <li> This egg-shaped stone is somewhat disappointing--it doesn&#x27;t perform particularly well, hence the rating. However, the merchant&#x27;s service and communication was terrific. I had anticipated better results from using this &amp;#34;natural pumice stone&amp;#34;, but it simply doesn&#x27;t exfoliate as I expected. That being said, it will last forever and washes well :-) !</li>
            <li> I thought this looked like the stone used at the local salon here for pedicures, and that stone does an excellent job.  However, after ordering it, it isn&#x27;t the same and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of scrubbing the feet and removing dead skin.  This one is way more smooth than the professional stones used at the salons, so much so that it simply glides over the heel area and isn&#x27;t abrasive enough to do any good.  Sorry, but if you are looking for a salon quality lava stone with great scrubbing/removing power, keep looking, this one isn&#x27;t it!!</li>
            <li> Love this item.  Use it together with the Cuccio sea salt for feet</li>
            <li> I use the stone on my feet as well as on my rough and bumpy elbows, knees and my thighs(use gentle strokes).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m loving the my skin&#x27;s transformation!</li>
            <li> I mean, its a Pumice stone, does what it&#x27;s told. Pummel my feet please so somehow they become soft, no problems here. This think is great, seems pretty durable, would buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, kinda large but does the job, these are good stones for removing dead skin on feet and tops of toes.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly large pumice stone that should last a long time. It works well for removing calluses, without being painfully abrasive. The packaging is nice, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful tip: we store ours upright in a 2.5&amp;#34; square planter, which is just large enough to hold it and looks great on the countertop.</li>
            <li> This is a great pumice stone.  I like how smooth it feels on your skin and the fact it does such an awesome job removing dead skin.  It will last a lifetime!  I do like that this is just the stone and not attached to a stick or some other piece.  I like the look of the stone on the tile on my bathroom, I find it a &amp;#34;spa look&amp;#34; that works well in my shower.  The stone itself is a lighter brown color.  I did receive this item at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.  I also use Amazon Reviews for most of my purchases (even if I am not purchasing at Amazon) so I appreciate honesty and will always post my honest review.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. I am able to hold the pumice stone because of the shape and form that does not aggravate my severe arthritis in my right hand. I also am able to smooth down the calluses by leaning over the bathtub as I rub the pumice stone over my feet. I have difficulty bending over to reach my feet, but this pumice stone allows me to hold on to it and not having to worry about it breaking if I do drop it in the tub. It is strong, durable and long lasting. After I am through using it for a session, I simply rinse off the dried skin, lay the stone out to dry and then put it back into the reusable plastic case that it came in.</li>
            <li> Like it. Cleans your foot well.</li>
            <li> I love this stone!!  I would highly recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This lava stone is exactly what my feet needed.&lt;br /&gt;It works so much better than anything I&#x27;ve tried to smooth out and get rid of all the dead dry skin on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;I soaked my feet and used this lava stone and it came right off, now my feet are so soft and look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to go with whatever it is you use on your feet because it works so great.&lt;br /&gt;I was given this at a promotional discount for my honest unbiased opinion and thats what I&#x27;ve given.</li>
            <li> This stone has much larger holes than other, gray stones I&#x27;ve used in the past. I wasn&#x27;t sure how well It would work. But I soaked my feet in the tub and used it. It got the dry, dead skin off in had the time and effort as my old stones, and the result was so much smoother. Even my heels which are the worst. Now, if I can just get my husband to use it too...</li>
            <li> Nice and coarse, the way I like it.</li>
            <li> Works well for smoothing rough feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go for this product again. I always have a pumice in my shower to clean my tootsies, and this is a nice one. Don&#x27;t shy away based on the cost because it&#x27;s going to be part of your life for a long time. It&#x27;s packaged in a nice brown box with straw or hay packing material. ~ A nice touch which makes it a nice gift.</li>
            <li> Very good quality! My feet feel amazing</li>
            <li> I love this so much! I&#x27;ve used so many different pumice stones throughout the years and they never lasted. This one not only gets the job done, but is durable and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen pumice stones before which were at most a couple of inches in diameter, if that.  This one is large.  It fits in the hand nicely.  Works great on calloused feet!</li>
            <li> I thought I was just buying another pumice stone, but this one is awesome! It looks nice because of its dark color and my feet have never been so soft. Good product!</li>
            <li> Its much bigger than expected but hey it get the job done. Great for removing extra dead skin between pedicures.</li>
            <li> Cuccio Earth Lava Pumice Stone  use it every day and I love it much better than anything you would fine in the store</li>
            <li> I use Pumice stone to feel that good clean feeling.  My girlfriend hooked me up with one years ago and since then, it feels incomplete to bath without one. It is a handful sized stone not a small pebble sized stone. The product that I received was in a hard plastic case not in a box as shown here but does the job and is better than block of cement with pores. It has one flat surface and one more bulging surface that is a huge plus, in my opinion.  The bulged surface helps applying more pressure if required.  It is not obnoxiously rough, nor is it smooth.  Good product for 6$.</li>
            <li> My mom had a true pumice stone when I was growing up, so I was surprised the first time I bought one at a drugstore to find it was nothing like what she had.  This, however, is the true deal.  It will remove dry skin or a callous in nothing flat.  In fact, you have to be gentle with it, it&#x27;s so effective.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works ok, but you need to use it every day and work at it even when your feet have been sitting in water for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Best pumice I have used!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  Delivered promptly. Highest recommendation</li>
            <li> Absolutely disgusting! Do not buy this unless you want dirty used packaging. I ordered 3 thinking I was getting a deal and all three looked used. Gross! I asked for a refund but they wanted the dirty stones returned. Not even worth my time to ship dirty used rocks back. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. The stone fits comfortably in your hand, is incredibly sturdy, and does what it&#x27;s purported to do. My feet are clean and looking great - and after about a month of use, the stone shows no signs of wearing down. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I just loved!&lt;br /&gt;It works perfect, good size for my hands to hold it!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish is a hanger on it but it is fine!</li>
            <li> These stones work great for removing dead skin and makes your skin smooth and soft!! Soak your feet, soap up the stone and gently rub all over and waala sandals feet ready :)</li>
            <li> I received and was charged for two items when your invoice on amazon clearly states I only ordered one. To make matters worse these items were not in the package show in the picture, BUT IN OPENED, USED, UNSEALED PLASTIC BAGS WITH HAIR COMB STICKERS ON THEM! Why would any woman accept that as part of a christmas gift. I wouldnt use them on my own man feet let alone let my better half guess at where these items have been and were used for. These should be boxed at the very least...as far as I know you took them out of your backyard! I hope this was some an oversight and not an intentional ploy to sucker someone into purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast but didn&#x27;t come in a box or with care instructions and I have no idea if it has been used before it looks like the picture but in not happy with it.</li>
            <li> This stone is great! I personally use it for the calluses on my hands from heavy weights. Makes my hands very smooth.</li>
            <li> Actually, I rarely give 5 stars. Have had this for several months now. It works, is sort of attractive &amp; doesn&#x27;t get moldy. It is everything I&#x27;ve wanted. Looked for some time before I found it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> No need for a cheese grater anymore, just kidding.  This thing does work on my feet better than any other stone I&#x27;ve tried.  Glad I made this purchase.  The stone came in a gold mesh bag with drawstring rather than the box as shown above.  Other than that, AMAZING.  Those store bought rectangle stones are useless to me and take for-ever.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Works much better than the regular Pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I feel a little more than disappointed. It didn&#x27;t come at all like the product stated. It came wrapped in bubble wrap and looks as though it&#x27;s been formerly used. It&#x27;s also more of an off brown color rather than black. One comment stated that it was very heavy but it feels as light as a feather and very soft. In all honesty it&#x27;s not worth wasting your money on.</li>
            <li> It served the purpose that I purchased it for. My toilets all had a brown ring inside the toilet bowl. No matter how much I cleaned and scrubbed, the brown ring would not go away. The pumice stone got rid of all of them!&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled that I bought it!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my old one was not sturdy enough and it&#x27;s poor construction caused it to separate from the wooden platform and break in half. This one has been pretty sturdy so far, and I like it&#x27;s texture and hardness, I feel like it may never break. However, I do wish it was a bit easier to use. If it had a handle or platform that was of high quality then I think it would be better, but I think that may be too much to ask for.</li>
            <li> Can definitely tell a difference in this as &amp;#34;the real thing&amp;#34; vs. the ones I&#x27;ve bought at beauty stores that wear down fast. The weight is nice too, feels substantial in use.</li>
            <li> Excellent for a first time pumice stone user.</li>
            <li> love this pumice stone....works better than any others i have bought.</li>
            <li> Works fine for what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I still need to figure out the proper way to clean the thing and it seems to take a while to completely dry out when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses these on her feet and likes them a lot.  She had run into trouble by letting the beauty shop people do this for her.  They would take off too much skin and the exposed layers would then crack and bleed.  This stone takes of the excess skin on her heels but doesn&#x27;t take so much off that cracking occurs.</li>
            <li> This product is as simple as rubbing your hands/feet against a stone.  The texture was perfect, not too rough not too soft and after only a few days of use I could recognize the increase in softness for my hands and feet and a smaller amount of calluses.  The product is also easy to clean as you can simply run it under some water with some hand/dish soap.  Overall great buy!</li>
            <li> I wear flip flops all the time, and this makes my feet really dry, thick and get cracked.  This attracts a lot of dirt which has been almost impossible for me to take off.  I&#x27;ve tried everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I came across this pumice stone, a REAL PUMICE STONE unlike the ones I&#x27;ve bought from department stores, including Origins.  WOW!  I soaked my feet for about 20 minutes and this pumice stone took off all that skin &amp; dirt -- leaving my feet squeeky clean-- all within a matter of seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I went without this pumice stone for all these years.</li>
            <li> loved this purchase it is well worth the money... also had very fast shipping.... started to have a difference after using it the first time. will definitely  purchase this product again</li>
            <li> Perfect size! Looks scary and intimidating, but feels amazing on your skin. I can&#x27;t wait to take a shower in the morning because of this stone! It&#x27;s a steal at this price. I&#x27;ve ordered 3</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this pumice stone.  I had one from Burts Bees that I used for years and it was great, but starting getting a little funky.  I was so excited to try this one.  But it is the worst thing that I have ever used.  It does nothing whatsoever to soften your feet or slough off dead skin.  Its not returnable, so it was a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> It works as promised! It&#x27;s a pumice stone, not much can go wrong. It&#x27;s a good size to fit in your hand, and works wonders on heals of feet.</li>
            <li> great pumice stone, quality material, and good size (good handfit for me).&lt;br /&gt;a few rubs a days and callouses go away</li>
            <li> I decided from seeing this Cuccio Earth Lave Pumice Stone at Amazon and reading the reviews to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I did. It is excellent. It worked right away. I could see and feel the difference right away.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I hope it last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a review here that said there was no instructions on how to use it. My stone came in a box and the instructions were on the box. But under a white label. I had to peel off the label.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This is a very well shaped and sized pumice stone.  It fits nicely in the hand and the curved edges allow use in hard to reach areas.  It works great for thickened rough skin, but also works well as an all over body scrubber.  I used to use sugar or salt scrubs but had problems with funky build up in my shower.  When I use this as a general body exfoliator (1-2 times per week), I add a generous dollop of body wash and apply only light pressure.  I have purchased one for my mom, my husband and each of my adult sons.  They all report liking it too.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and this now smells really terrible.  It smells like something rotten.</li>
            <li> Too coarse, I much prefer the finer foot scrubbers.</li>
            <li> this rock does not come in that package i did not like because on one side of the rock there was a crack in the middle and there was a little mountain looking sharp shape that could of cut me :(</li>
            <li> Nice stone, just the right coarseness.</li>
            <li> Most pumice stones are ugly in my opinion.  This looks nice in my bathroom and does the job.  Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Nice idea, but mine has holes the size of my cheese grater! Probably a fluke. But I cannot use it: painful!</li>
            <li> BAIT &amp; SWITCH! Do not buy. Item is NOT the one pictured. I received a plain rock in a fabric jewelry bag. No name, use or care instructions. Definitely the worst buying experience on Amazon in 15 years of buying. Buyer beware! Would leave a ZERO feedback if I could. Never again.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this intimidating looking stone but I am so glad that I did. After soaking your feet this will remove all dead skin. Mine even has a side to smoothen the skin after removing dead skin. Its great palm size. If doesnt have a weird smell. After rinsing all the dead skin rinses right out of the holes in the stone. Wonderful! Get you one and let your mate enjoy smooth soft feets. If you dont have a mate just be good to your feet and make them happy with the wonderful purchase. Happy Feet! :)</li>
            <li> My feet, which are often calloused to hell and back thanks to running and rock climbing, and which are often the cause of much finger wagging from the mani-pedi tech, have never looked better. It&#x27;s awesome, especially since all I have to do is run it over my feet toward the end of my showers. Easy peasy.</li>
            <li> For a pumice stone it works great and being a rock it lasts forever.  Excelent replacement for the pumice stone that were available years ago and can nolonger buy.  In fact it is better!</li>
            <li> A very nice item indeed. Well worth the low price I paid for this quality, fast shipping and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend ended up taking this from me and she loves it lol. I bought it originally because I started to get irritation on my skin and wanted to take better care of my skin, but hey if she&#x27;s happy then its a great product.</li>
            <li> very nice ..soft ..well recommended</li>
            <li> This product is okay, it doesnt cost very much and get the job done. When you use it just dont press/rub down on your foot to hard be gentle and it will do the job, press too hard you may bruise your foot.</li>
            <li> does not work too well, and came several weeks later... not impressed with this product</li>
            <li> This is SO much better than the PedEgg.  It made my super dry, tough feet soft the first time I used it.  Buy it; you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> very effective + great size to work with for my feet. it&#x27;s the best one i have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;it is powerful so you must be careful not to over do it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in the shower now for about 2 weeks and the results are amazing. I don&#x27;t scrub hard and only spend about 10 seconds per foot and I have gone from cracked dry feet to smooth and soft pink feet. In another week they shall be as soft as a baby&#x27;s (they are almost there now) and then,  I will just use it daily for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a pumice stone this good in many many years. The ones at the drugstore are junk because they are too smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I love how big this stone is because it is so easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li> Really like this!!! It works great.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from ingrown hairs all my life on my lateral calves. This along with tend skin and any moisturizer has helped my legs finally be smooth and hairless! I use this Tend Skin (although I&#x27;m sure any ingrown hair solution will work just as well) at night and when I shower I rub this over my legs to remove the dead skin. A perfect duo. (I also moisturize in the morning.) However, be careful not to use them in combination too often or too vigorously because it can start to irritate the skin. Once a day should be fine. Also love that this is solid. It doesn&#x27;t flake or lose it&#x27;s shape- its literally has the density of a rock.</li>
            <li> DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT IS INTENDED FOR.</li>
            <li> It arrived without the box, only a plain plastic case. I used it and don&#x27;t really see a big difference.</li>
            <li> I mean how excellent can a rock be? It does the job of exfoliating....like it should.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this pumice stone. It does look nicer on display then the average pumice stone. However, due to the uneven texture of the lava rock it does not effectively remove calluses. It does remove skin, but not evenly! I&#x27;ve tried using it daily and holding it in different positions. I&#x27;m not sure why people like it so much. I have much better results using a glass crystal file, which can be found for a similar price. I did receive the stone in the packaging pictured</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product. This makes my feet baby soft after a long day . I&#x27;ve been looking long and hard for this stone and not that white man made crap with a hole and a rope through it. Don&#x27;t hesitate just buy it.</li>
            <li> Great for skin on one&#x27;s feet. Not recommended for the neck or arms. Teehee.</li>
            <li> It has very &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; qualities, yes-- as in dust is constantly coming off it, no matter how much rinsing or scrubbing you do. It&#x27;s a pumice stone, and it works how it&#x27;s supposed to. If you have caveman feet, then God help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, it does not come in a box. It is shrink wrapped and in a cheap jewelry type bag. The box was probably removed to save on shipping.</li>
            <li> And it is great!  What a difference from that one that leaves all the little pieces of blue foam all over my shower floor.  I really like it, it works very well.</li>
            <li> Cuccio Earth Lava pumice stone is beautifully packaged with shredded paper, boxed and contains a fabulous exfoliating stone. These hold up well, are simply wonderful and a great gift idea. Similar to what is sold, used at day spas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought an extra one for around the home. i.e. paint spots on bath tub, rub this stone gently and it removes the paint without damaging the tub surface. Ditto for stubborn hard water stains on refrigerator/ freezers!</li>
            <li> I love the baby soft smooth feet I now have because of this product.  It is super affordable and does an awesome job!</li>
            <li> This pumice stone works great!  It doesn&#x27;t break apart nor tear up my heels when I use it.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to use on my feet.  Great for scrubbing bottom, but too thick to fit between toes at all.</li>
            <li> This is a tough stone! It is hard to the touch and easy to use. The holes and crevices are deep and work quickly. It&#x27;s an effective product.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was my stone, but it was not as effective as some reviewer stated: I have tough dry skin, and scrub as I might, it helped, but needed a few tries.  I noticed the stone was disintegrating with use, I guess it it natural!?</li>
            <li> This worked so well on my feet, I don&#x27;t even need to get a pedicure anymore.  I can just do it myself in the shower.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought was great! Bought a second one for my girlfriend and it is too smooth to exfoliate anything. The product is inconsistent.</li>
            <li> BEST PUMICE STONE EVER</li>
            <li> My feet are now smooth and happy!</li>
            <li> Great pumice stone! You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Works. Have to soak feet in hot water for at least 5 mins first then scrub scrub scrub</li>
            <li> My feet feel like I just paid for a pedicure!</li>
            <li> This was so huge!  I actually gave it away, as it was just so much&lt;br /&gt;larger than what I needed.</li>
            <li> Really nice stone for the price! Makes your feet super soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pumice stone.  I don&#x27;t think there is anything better or special about it.  It does get off some of the dead skin, but no more so than any other pumice stone or file that I have used.</li>
            <li> Took it out of the package and laid it on my bed, it left a brown stain.  Used it and it left my skin stained brown.  If there were peruse soaking or other instructions that would eliminate this problem, it would be nice if there were instructions included.</li>
            <li> I love this stone. Every time my husband and I use it for our cracked heels, they make our feet very soft and the scrubbing motion doesn&#x27;t hurt or tickle, which is a nice factor.</li>
            <li> Not great - nice packaging, but my Mr. Pumice stone works much better.</li>
            <li> works great. does not leave a brown stain on the shower shelf like I was previously worried about.</li>
            <li> You will never catch my feet not smooth.  It is the first thing I see on women so I must take care of mine.</li>
            <li> No, no, no, no, and no.  This picture is not accurate.  It looks nothing like this and does not come in a box.  I ordered two of these.  The first one was alright.  It was rather large and rough and does work nicely.  It didn&#x27;t come in a box but rather a plastic case.  Which was questionable, but it worked ok.  However, I went back about a month later to order another to carry in my suitcase (I travel a lot), and what arrived at my house was about 1/3 the size of the original one I ordered, not as rough, and came in shrink-wrap.  HORRIBLE.  I know another reviewer made this claim but they were the only one so I thought I would change it.  Bad idea.  Do not buy this falsely advertised product!!!!!  I would return it if it was worth it, but since it is so cheap I will toss it.</li>
            <li> More expensive, but well worth it for its longevity :)</li>
            <li> No more sharp cutting blades for the dead&lt;br /&gt; skin on my feet!! This works on The First use. I now have baby smooth feet.  I just keep it in the shower and use it every other day to prevent dryness</li>
            <li> This pumice is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Because i is so dark, however, it can leave a dark ring in your tub, but this is easily rinsed off and is not staining.</li>
            <li> Great for rough dry feet, I use it regularly in the shower and it helps keep my feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm on my heels, Love it, plus I think it just looks pretty cool!</li>
            <li> Not the best pumice stone I&#x27;ve used but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Did not come in box pictured. But product is great.</li>
            <li> excellent price and very useful for home use in between pedicures.</li>
            <li> Never got this in the mail after ordering.  but I got one like it and it works great for dead skin. Softens feet.</li>
            <li> It appeared intimidating when it arrived as it was surprisingly dense, heavy, and looked meaner than a cheese grater.&lt;br /&gt;However, it worked great as a pumice stone and outperformed a blue square one I previously owned by leaps and bounds.&lt;br /&gt;The shape, color, and weight are all excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4 months later of HEAVY USE:&lt;br /&gt;Still kicking ass, not disintegrating- still retains its sharp and rough body. I use it for shedding tough skin off of my feet (I boulder for 3 hours every other day). I had severe issues with my skin ripping off and the dead skin made my feet and climbing shoes smell bad. It was so bad I started forming a bad habit of removing my skin with my hands and a knife. This pumice stone solved all of these issues. One of the best purchase I ever made.</li>
            <li> Too rough and crumbles easily. Threw away.</li>
            <li> This is just an ok pumice.  Nothing great.  Kinda upset or a wasted purchase.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Not as great as reviews recommend. I found the artificial substances better at callous control but it is good for daily use</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly what it looks like, but does not come in a box, haven&#x27;t used it yet but it&#x27;ll look awesome in the spa gift basket I&#x27;m making</li>
            <li> I bought this product a while back from a drugstore and I loved it. I misplaced it somehow and never able to find it again. I&#x27;m so glad I checked Amazon. It works as well as I remembered.</li>
            <li> I am a male and have really bad calluses on my heals. I have looked everywhere for this type of pumice that is super coarse.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier because this thing is stuff and shreds the dead skin away.  All the drugstores I went to had nothing close to this.</li>
            <li> Just as described, and size of half a mans fist.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used this pumice stone. Being a type 1 diabetic I have to be careful with the products I use for my feet. Gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> Great Product the Wife Loves it...: )</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I might be sold for life. Great price, fast delivery and I could feel a difference immediately. I can only imagine how lovely my feet will be looking and feeling when I use this regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too picky about things like this but I guess it&#x27;s a good pumice stone as far as pumice stones go! Compared to the synthetic white one I had from a cheap foot care package, which had been falling apart, this stone is much nicer and I think it&#x27;ll hold up for a long time. It came packaged in a nice little box and it&#x27;s about a 3 1/2 inch oval (the long way), good size for holding in your hand.</li>
            <li> I actually like the results from this pumice stone better than the callous eliminator.  It is very useful after soaking your feet and left my feet feeling smoother.  I would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent pumice stone for my very calloused feet, and this is a fantastic product.  Other pumice stones I&#x27;ve tried are too soft and wear down quickly, or they break easily.  This is sturdy and aesthetically pleasing in the hand and to look at.</li>
            <li> This works amazing on the feet and my husband super tough hands</li>
            <li> I use this to to get rid of the callus on my feet from wearing flip-flops all the time.  This, along with a great scrub, works the best of all the other things I tried to remove the callus and rough, dead skin at the bottom of my feet.  Just the scrub alone is not enough to get smooth skin on my heels.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today, and it is fabulous. I have a terrible time with rough skin on my feet and heels, and I&#x27;d about given up after having used every cream and other type of product on the market. I can tell with routine use that this pumice will be perfect. Since it is a natural product, I recommend not storing in the shower/bath because the brown comes off a bit. I store on a dry sponge on my sink so that it&#x27;s nice and dry for my next use. I also clean it well when taking a shower. I think that will likely be the trick to its continued use.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly well. I use it twice on my feet. It removes the dead skin off your feet leaving it silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It totally isn&#x27;t what is pictured as far as packaging goes. It looks like I got a dirty rock, in a banged up, also dirty, clear plastic package with no label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, the presentation is completely lacking.</li>
            <li> I need to remember to use regularly. So far it works well for maintenance in between using a shaver on my heels.</li>
            <li> I love it, perfect size and extremely durable</li>
            <li> The box it came in looked like it was previously used or opened. I loved the look of this stone and the reviews were promising, but I had to send this back bc it was too soft and was the equivalent of rubbing paper on my feet. Luckily I also ordered a rasp which works wonderfully and left my feet in a condition I didn&#x27;t need the stone to buffer away loose skin.</li>
            <li> Works great. Where I work, I&#x27;m pretty much always on my feet, so when I get home, my feet can get a little rough over time, and this helps out a lot to smooth them out. Recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I appreciate that this stone is natural in material and color. The shape and size are an ideal fit for your palm. The surface is very porous and works well by buffing away dead skin without shredding and/or damaging healthy skin. It may take several (or many) uses for those with very dry, cracked or flaking soles; however, any product will if this is the condition of your feet. Do not expect miracles. Do expect a quality product that performs the way it is supposed to. I use it nightly. I apply a small amount of Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Nourishing Body Wash to the stone and scrub both feet well. Immediately after showering, while my feet are still moist, I apply Avocado Oil mixed with lotion and massage into both feet and don socks until completely absorbed. My feet are silky smooth. Great price, fast shipping with Prime...will purchase, again.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> This things works. Better than ped egg, $25 + callus remover, smoother. Just wet your feet for 10 minutes before use. Thank you mother nature!</li>
            <li> I use this to manage calluses from climbing.  Without intervention, the calluses quickly become too large and rip off leaving raw skin.  Using the stone also strengthens the skin around the calluses, further preventing rip off.  After using this for just a few weeks i no longer need to use tape to climb.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Does what is supposed to. Came in a sealed box, made in USA&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad one, or if my big manly feet are too rough for this thing, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed. Did next to nothing and felt really odd because of the shape. I&#x27;m sure it works for some, but i&#x27;ll try other options.</li>
            <li> I suffer from very dry hills, This really worked great.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it did anything different than a regular pumice stone, but this seemed to be at least comparable to the pumice stone.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Seems a little too rough in the picture, but it&#x27;s actually quite perfect. Fits well in my hand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various types of pumice-style products from the local Japanese market - volcanic rock, bamboo, pumice, others - but this just fits the bill like no other.  Effective, quick.  Ergonomic too, prob&#x27;ly less overuse injury w this style than others.</li>
            <li> I want sure about this at first because I thought I was buying it from a manufacturer or distributor, but it came shipped to me with partial packaging,  like something someone had bought but didn&#x27;t want and had already pulled the cardboard insert out. It made me nervous, but careful inspection seemed to indicate it hadn&#x27;t been used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s size is perfect for holding on to, it doesn&#x27;t seem brittle at all, the color is great, the curve works perfectly for the arches of my feet, and it seems to do the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Pum. stone a total waste of money. I love this brush bought three. The foot and hand salve cream is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Super soothing and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This pumice stone is the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Not much effort is needed to make your feet nice and smooth.  Much better than the pumice stone I buy from a drug store. I will be purchasing another one.</li>
            <li> I had really dry, dead, and cracked skin along the side and bottom of my big toes. It was a problem because my feet looked bad and always snagged my sheets so I never wanted to buy nice ones. I decided to buy this stone and I used it on my feet for about 5 minutes and it almost completely removed all of the dead skin! My feet looked completely normal and smooth after that one use. I wish I got one of these sooner. It works much better than those rectangular grey pumice stones.&lt;br /&gt;After I use it, I rub some soap on it and rinse it under water and it looks completely clean again. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> used it to get rid of hard water build up in a toilet works great</li>
            <li> does not take the skin off i would get it back to amazon</li>
            <li> By looking at it you would think it would be rough on the feet. It glided across the bottom of my foot almost like silk. My feet are soft and smooth! Plus the stone is very lightweight!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully my feet are smooth and socks are saved!</li>
            <li> I waited almost over a month to get it after I placed my order, and I really hope it worth it. But it doesn&#x27;t! I think the Tweezerman Pink Pedro Callus Stone is so much better. The reason it gets two stars is it looks good and the shape is reasonable,but it is useless for me. I love Amazon and I almost purchase everything on it, but I am so disappointed with this purchase, from the beginning (shipment and the seller&#x27;s response) to the ending (the product itself).</li>
            <li> oh man this thing really fixed my feet. my feet were getting really gross and this rock just scrubbed everthing off and they were very smooth. at first i thought it might hurt but its very gentle.</li>
            <li> Big help between pedicures.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine from &amp;#34;FIVE Stars,&amp;#34; fulfilled by Amazon for the free shipping, and I received exactly what&#x27;s pictured, box included.  Good size, works as intended.  I like the smooth design, as opposed to the squared off bars.  A hanging strap would be nice, but since it floats, it&#x27;s not really a problem.</li>
            <li> Love it best stone I&#x27;ve purchased so far and better than the flat cheap files you buy in cvs or Duane read.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever for my feet!</li>
            <li> This stone looks really scary when you open it. But trust me, it works wonders. I think I described it as Bad Ass when I opened the package but after the first use, I was in love.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Months later, still loving my stone. Have learned that using a facial scrub (Such as St. Ives Apricot) makes experience even better. Plus, I got stuck in a rain storm the other day so my feet were nice and pruney. Got in the shower and went to work with my stone. Huge improvement with less effort. So, an unpleasant situation turned out in my favor! PS, works nice on hands and other trouble spots as well.</li>
            <li> When I first received this stone, I was a bit dismayed as I was hoping that the texture would be coarser (like another stone I had purchased elsewhere). After using it though, I actually like this one better for my body as it is gentler and works just as well! This thing releases so much dead skin it never fails to amaze me. I now use the coarser stone for my feet only and this one for my body.</li>
            <li> I love this pumice stone it works great I just used for the first time and was really surprise by how smooth it made my feet feel after one use. I didn&#x27;t even have to scrub hard to remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li> There was no manufacturing process or craftsmanship here, I am writing a review for a rock. Does what it is expected to do (it&#x27;s a rock). Arrived in great condition (once again, it&#x27;s a rock). The price was good (for a rock). Probably wouldn&#x27;t make a good pet, but works good at filing down those stubborn calluses on my heels. So buy this rock. What can possibly go wrong with a rock?   Update: still a rock. Have not had any problems out of it yet, due to the fact that it&#x27;s a rock. They don&#x27;t tend to malfunction. Don&#x27;t throw it if you live in a glass house. Other than that it&#x27;s great. Rock solid performance. Seriously, it rocks! Go buy one.</li>
            <li> I used pumace stones for grooming my wire-coated terrier.  It really helps get the loose, dead hairs out easily.  This stone isn&#x27;t quite rough enough, so I&#x27;ll use it for feet and heels instead.</li>
            <li> I was rather surprised to get the stone in a mailing package with no packaging, bag, nothing.  Just the stone (not like in the photo with the nice packaged box).  But with that said, it works well, and really that&#x27;s all that matters.  Not too harsh, just right.</li>
            <li> Love it! Gets the job done!</li>
            <li> my feet were soooo dry and scratchy before using this! sometimes i would even have trouble sleeping because it feels like my feet are suffocating! but this stone is great. ive been using it for a month and have absolutely ZERO complaints!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome, totally obliterated my callouses and rough skin.</li>
            <li> Very good pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Cuccio Earth Stone Lava Pumice, along with Pedi Paradís from Wick &amp; Ström and must say the combination of using both products has done wonders for my feet.  I must say that I love pedicures; I go every two weeks to have a professional one done throughout the year.  I want my feet to look amazing whether I am wearing sandals or high heeled boots and I tell myself (and my husband) I am worth it!&lt;br /&gt;When I first laid eyes on this pumice stone my initial thought was “Yikes, this thing will probably cause some irreparable damage!”  I was apprehensive but decided to start small and slow.  I am the first to admit I was totally wrong about this pumice stone; it worked phenomenal and literally buffed my feet to a shine.  Since I have professional pedis done regularly, this little gem keeps my feet looking great until my next appointment.&lt;br /&gt;Since I believe in using natural products when I can, I clean the pumice stone with a toothbrush, rinse, soak it in a white vinegar solution and let air dry.  This is very important due to mold and bacteria which can get into the stone.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little dirty straight out of the package but it&#x27;s easy to rinse off. Love the natural stone and how durable it is. Perfect for my use.</li>
            <li> Simple. Does what it should.</li>
            <li> These are fairly generic products. I am still using this several months later and loving it!</li>
            <li> Best pumice stone I&#x27;ve used period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it for myself, but my wife loves for me to soak and pumice her feet every so often and I thought this might be a nice alternative to the sandpaper/file types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does look scary and almost like a cheese grater, but it does the job and produces a very nice result without any discomfort despite its looks.</li>
            <li> Lava stone is the way to go.</li>
            <li> it feels like a fake rock made in a lab (whether that is true or not...idk but it feels that way)....good for removing foot calluses</li>
            <li> First, I think it&#x27;s worth noting that the pumice stone I received didn&#x27;t come in a box. It was in some beat up, plastic packaging with no label of any sort whatsoever. This I did not like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time buying this sort of pumice stone and I really am impressed. I&#x27;ve bought others that were okay, but nothing that really sold me. As such, I pretty much wrote off the whole idea of natural pumice. Tried them here and there over the years, but this is the first one that I&#x27;m certain will make it&#x27;s way into regular use for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a try (getting my winter skin ready for spring) and I&#x27;m very glad that I did. This isn&#x27;t something that will replace my trusty Diane file, but something I would use after filing.</li>
            <li> More pricey than the fake foam pumice stones but way more durable and more effective, too.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap products.</li>
            <li> It seems to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I love this stone - it washes off clean, works very well in between monthly pedicures, and it looks pretty too!</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this and keeps it in the shower. I got to admit I thought she left an avocado in there but she&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone who had a specific texture of stone in mind.  I also bought a few others.  This is the stone they were happiest with, so I&#x27;m rating it full stars.</li>
            <li> Love this . Ordered it for myself I use it in the shower with a little body wash and after the first use my feet are already soft . So I&#x27;m ordering a second one for my mom (:</li>
            <li> I go barefoot frequently, so I have very thick calluses. I was looking for an even more abrasive pumice lava rock which I have had before. For the average foot, it is probably just fine.</li>
            <li> It was delivered fast and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, very happy with the purchase...</li>
            <li> did not like it too much. It was not what I thought it would be</li>
            <li> My wife and I both scrape our feet with this stone. We both work out at home on our rug in the living room, barefoot. This does tend to beat our feet up a little more than the average person, and this stone has been an answer to our problem of jolting awake in horror when either of the bottom of our foot touches the other in bed at night.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed it for</li>
            <li> I have used Cuccio lava stones for years and have been disappointed. It arrived in perfect condition. I wish it were a little less expensive but other than this I will continue buying this product.</li>
            <li> Good sized product works pretty good takes a little time to get all dead skin off this way thats why 4 stars instead of five.Also did not come with any directions on the best way to get dead skin off with this product,would have been helpful if never used simular product.</li>
            <li> it works very well, but beware.. if you don&#x27;t place it on a secure location, it will fall and when it falls, it&#x27;ll 1) land on your foot. OUCH! it&#x27;s HEAVY. 2) it&#x27;ll miss your feet and land on the lacquer and crack/chip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that, it&#x27;s a great stone for your feet. no scratches or breaking of skin... excellent product.</li>
            <li> Decent but not amazing</li>
            <li> At 4.5&amp;#34; long, 3.25&amp;#34; wide, and 1.5&amp;#34; thick, this stone fills your hand, feels just right, and is plenty coarse enough without overdoing it. Don&#x27;t worry that this stone is too small (it isn&#x27;t) or won&#x27;t get the job done (it will). Highly recommended--especially over smoother stones and ones that mount with suction cups (it&#x27;s tough and ineffective to move your foot against a fixed stone; better to hold the stone and move it against your foot!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen natural lava rocks, and that&#x27;s what this one is, just shaped into an oblong. Isn&#x27;t it fabulous when natural things work best? No plastic handle to break or fall off, just a simple stone.</li>
            <li> have very rough/dry hands and feet . they require  good scouring aabout every other day to help keep them smooth. I uave used many pummice stones before, but never one like this. it is very nice. it provides  rougher surface than some of the cheaper drug store brands. this may be a downfall foe some who need a gentlerbsmoother surface. but for me it works perfectly. I just use a largerghter touch if I need a less aggressive result.</li>
            <li> Works great! I love it!</li>
            <li> good！！good，I like it so much !!!! A little wet,but is sweet!!perfect...........good god .shipping is so fast, good.I want to buy again</li>
            <li> Hands down the best, and most effective pumice stone I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> Use it to remove cat hair from fabric, furniture.</li>
            <li> You have very specific reasons to be searching for a pumice stone... and long story short, it get&#x27;s the job done well.</li>
            <li> I agree its a great stone for feet and rough skin, but it&#x27;s smaller than it looks one of the two I ordered was smaller than the other. It doesn&#x27;t come in a nice box like shown just a flimsy mesh, and takes way too long coming from china. Although you&#x27;d think it was Italian lava.</li>
            <li> I wish it was an easy process to get my money back. What a waste! The pumic stone showed up in a plastic container that looked like it had been opened and had dust and debri on the OUTSIDE of the plastic. I even showed ny boyfriend and he agreed it looked really sketchy. I decided not to use it. I bet you this was used and it was a return that they wanted to get some money for. There wasn&#x27;t even a label on it or the name of the company. Very shady and kind of surprising that Amazon would allow this to be sent out.  Just be warned and be careful when ordering this.  If you get the nice new one, lucky you and I&#x27;ll bet it&#x27;s fine, but just know it doesn&#x27;t always come in the nice package they show.</li>
            <li> First off this rock is way bigger than I expected. It&#x27;s like a mini football. That&#x27;s great though, because it&#x27;s easy to hold. It worked great, rinsed clean and can double as a weapon if I&#x27;m ever caught off guard by an assailant while scrubbing my heels.</li>
            <li> This seems like it will be too soft to get the job done for me. I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Best pumice stone I&#x27;ve tried out of four.  Long lasting (been using this one for a few years) and no weird grit residue in you shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom for her birthday and she loves it. She has terrible corns on her feet from her disease (like so bad it hurts to walk) and no other pumice stones worked, they would just break. But this worked so well she actually cried because how much better her feet felt and her feet don&#x27;t tear up socks anymore!&lt;br /&gt;If you have tough feet that no other pumice stone works on, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s overrated. I had two corns on my big toe, and while it did slough off the dead skin, it didn&#x27;t do anything about the actual bump. As a result the corn kept coming back, since the bump kept rubbing against my shoes as I walked. But it does get rid of the dead skin, so I guess it&#x27;s good if you have callouses. But for me the dead skin was only a symptom, and the stone only cured my symptom (temporarily), not the underlying problem.</li>
            <li> Good product for the money</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!!!! I am so glad I found this lava stone!</li>
            <li> Takes care of the rough edges and spurs without a problem. I use it gently every day or two and can see this lasting for a long time. Better than those metal files you buy in Walmart. Comfortable to use....</li>
            <li> Best pumice stone I have ever bought. Stays sharp and looks pretty sharp too.</li>
            <li> Good size stone that is easy to use.  It does a good job with my calluses.  I leave it in the shower.</li>
            <li> appropriate weight and texture for a pumice stone. Seems pretty durable. I&#x27;ve used it once so far and have been happy with the results. Also, the size is just right for my hand! Often pumice stones leave my hands raw from holding them instead of whatever I was actually trying to rub with it. This one doesn&#x27;t do that, as it fits perfectly in my hand and doesn&#x27;t scrape my fingers.</li>
            <li> Wow. Scrubs off everything. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I frequently get scaly calluses on my hands which flake/tear off and causes pain. I was able to take the top layer of skin off with this stone so that my skin was smooth but also so that my calluses were not completely gone. Now my hands have smooth protective calluses on them and I don’t have to worry about tearing my skin open.</li>
            <li> Ok my feet aren&#x27;t nasty but they can get funky. When I don&#x27;t work I don&#x27;t wear my shoes, so I have rough calluses on my feet . I grew up in the Southern California desert and burned my feet a few times as a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This being said I love this little lava rock. It cleans my feet and after about five uses has really smoothed my foot down.  It&#x27;s a little smaller than the picture may lead lead you to believe but other than that this thing works great . Also it doesn&#x27;t hurt your feet to use like other stones .</li>
            <li> My wife has been asking me to do something about my feet for a while. I tried one of htose hand-held scrubber wands it didn&#x27;t work well. This pumice stone works great, especially on my heels which were pretty beat up &amp; calloused. I expected it to feel rough because of the texture but I can barely feel it when i rub it on my feet. Only downside is that dead skin can get stuck in the holes but I rinse it off with water and a foaming soap which helps. Huge improvement in the look &amp; smoothness of my feet after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I love this pumice its not like the fake plastic ones at the store. This is the real deal. My feet are super soft now just like a girl&#x27;s feet should always be. I will definitely be buying this again in the future but not so soon because its a pretty large rock that will last for a long time. Easy to hold with its egg shape. Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> This works so well - I am really glad I decided to purchase it. Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> Great quality and effective on smoothing down the calluses on my heels in the winter.  Perfect hand size for gripping and not slipping.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, great price.</li>
            <li> does a great job, but since purchasing this i&#x27;ve seen lava pumice stones in stores for half the price.</li>
            <li> Good size, gets job done, great little pet rock.</li>
            <li> A unique take on the usual pumice stone &amp; works as well if not better.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it was meant to do.</li>
            <li> Wish there were less large-sized voids in it and that it was more uniform in texture.</li>
            <li> This stone really works on those tough calluses on the sides and bottom of feet.  I was skeptical, but I&#x27;m totally happy with this natural product!!</li>
            <li> Works as it&#x27;s supposed to.  I can now keep callous feet at bay rather than constantly needing a pedicure because my feet are too rough.  I use this every time I am in the shower, just rub my heels and other rough spots and, viola!  Rough spots are gone!  Definitely a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this to anyone, it works wonderfully!!☺</li>
            <li> Love my pumice stone! Keeps my feet so smooth. I use it once or twice a week. Works great!</li>
            <li> love this will be buying again</li>
            <li> Nit what was expected</li>
