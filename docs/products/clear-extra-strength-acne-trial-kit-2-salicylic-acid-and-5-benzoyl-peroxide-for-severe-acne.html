            <li>I have struggled for many years and have tried almost everything on the market.</li>
            <li>I really love the exfoliant that comes with it.</li>
            <li>It did a great job removing dirt, but the downside is it is very drying</li>
            <li>well so you can layer makeup on top.</li>
            <li>I like the exfoliant the best, because it&#x27;s pretty gentle and doesn&#x27;t sting or reek of rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>These products are fragrance free and very gentle but effective.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s worth it to spend more on your skin care.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thorough and effective.</li>
            <li>Sure enough this stuff if absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>I clean my face with cleanser with Clarisonic two times a day.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter has mild acne.</li>
            <li>Surely I will buy complete</li>
            <li>However, I also recommend a good moisturizer because it dried out my skin a bit, but just a normal oil free moisturizer did the job!</li>
            <li>Great product, extra strenth may be a bit extra strengh for me but a great product never the less</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this!</li>

            <li>Overall, I am pleased with this product and will most likely buy the full-size version.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a week so far and have noticed a tremendous difference in my acne prone combination skin.</li>
            <li>(I know I am so smart)</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>May be good for teen skin, but I definitely would not recommend it for adult skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these products for about a week, and they&#x27;ve left my skin smooth and blemish-free (so far!).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely ordering the full product.</li>
            <li>Less is more  with This product.</li>
            <li>My face has showed tremendous improvement in a very short time.</li>
            <li>A few tips for using it, though: it&#x27;s important if you&#x27;re using makeup to remove it all first.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>A little too drying for m,y skin, but it did clear up the problem area very quickly.</li>
            <li>After washing it is very smooth, and my acne is slowly fading away.</li>
            <li>Also, have a moisturizer ready because it does dry out your skin, and be sure to diligently avoid your eye area and any other sensitive areas, especially with the blemish treatment.</li>
            <li>Completely cleared my skin.</li>
            <li>It did work, but left my skin super dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for an answer to chronic adult acne!</li>
            <li>I have moderate to severe adult acne.</li>
            <li>Purchased product for teenage child, thus far product seems to be clearing up acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time proactiv user and wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is the benzoyl isn&#x27;t as finely milled as proactiv, but it blends into the skin</li>
            <li>This is a good alternative to Proactiv and much less expensive.</li>

            <li> and I had very damaged skin with bad acne, blackheads, whiteheads, red spots, scars after acne all over the face and neck before I start use Paula&#x27;s Choise Acne treatment Kit!</li>

            <li> I have moderate to severe adult acne. I have struggled for many years and have tried almost everything on the market. Nothing seemed to work! I figured I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy three step system. My face has showed tremendous improvement in a very short time. After washing it is very smooth, and my acne is slowly fading away. My skin looks brighter and clearer for once! I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for an answer to chronic adult acne!</li>
            <li> Great product, extra strenth may be a bit extra strengh for me but a great product never the less</li>
            <li> This dried my skin out way too much and made it itch like crazy.  May be good for teen skin, but I definitely would not recommend it for adult skin.</li>
            <li> I felt like I had tried everything, and I found Paulas Choice on a blog and decided to give it a shot because it had great reviews. Sure enough this stuff if absolutely amazing. Completely cleared my skin. I would absolutely recommend this! However, I also recommend a good moisturizer because it dried out my skin a bit, but just a normal oil free moisturizer did the job!</li>
            <li> I had been having some bad breakouts and decided to give this a try. Within 3-4 days, I noticed my skin clearing up. I really love the exfoliant that comes with it. It did a great job removing dirt, but the downside is it is very drying so I had to use a lot of moisturizing lotion. After about a week, I noticed the peeling wasn&#x27;t as bad though. I&#x27;m definitely ordering the full product.</li>
            <li> Only thing that helped my hormonal acne of 3 years go away! I get 1 or 2 small ones during PMS, but it&#x27;s smaller than before.  It took about 1-1 1/2 months for it to truly work. My skin was dry &amp; flaky at first, so had to back down on benzoyl peroxide to once a day &amp; bought a heavy moisturizer at night. I bought the full sizes from the manufacturer website (they also refund you if you&#x27;re not happy with any products you buy from them).</li>
            <li> I bought Trial Kit to try if it help with my bad skin. So I was exiting about this product cause I read a lot good reviews. When I got this product I thought mmmm it is very small, will it be enough? So I start to use it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;First I should tell you that I am 20 y.o. and I had very damaged skin with bad acne, blackheads, whiteheads, red spots, scars after acne all over the face and neck before I start use Paula&#x27;s Choise Acne treatment Kit! I&#x27;m telling you truth cause I tried a lot of products and nothing helped me.&lt;br /&gt;So I clean my face with cleanser with Clarisonic two times a day. Than I make exfoliant and finally put blemish treatment cream. That&#x27;s all! First days I was like snake cause bad skin was exfoliated and I took off flakes of my old skin all time. Looked terribly but it was only couple days. My pores become smaller and cleaner, there is practically no blackheads and whiteheads. My scars, red spots and acne started to disappear! They have already almost gone! Oh God I&#x27;m not kidding! And I&#x27;m using ONLY TRIAL Kit!!! Wow! Surely I will buy complete kit!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You for best results and my new clean skin! I Really recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 8 months now and I LOVE it!!!! My only complaint would be the price. But still love it!</li>
            <li> Not too drying or irritating. I have really oily skin and this doesn&#x27;t strip my skin too the point where I have an oil overload on my face later in the day</li>
            <li> It did work, but left my skin super dry and sensitive. It burned when i put on the products. Didnt work out for me.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this line of products when my old skin care products became too expensive for me. Unfortunately these products wrecked my skin in a matter of days. I went ahead and used the two week trial and repurchased it again (I know I am so smart) too see if my skin would adjust. After a month my skin was breaking out with painful cystic acne and well as covered in new red scars. Needless to say I bit the bullet and repurchased my old skin care products. Sometimes it&#x27;s worth it to spend more on your skin care. You save money on foundation and concealer...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good  . I invite some my friend</li>
            <li> This stuff works so fast!&lt;br /&gt;You only need to use a small amounnt, I  recommend using an acne brush with it, it&#x27;ll make it last For a month! Less is more  with This product.😉</li>
            <li> A little too drying for m,y skin, but it did clear up the problem area very quickly.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and is alright</li>
            <li> The product indeed does work as advertise. Although, not always from time to time it will leave red marks on my skin with a burning irritated sensation. Also, when I stopped using the product for a day it leaves my skin all dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week so far and have noticed a tremendous difference in my acne prone combination skin. It&#x27;s very thorough and effective. A few tips for using it, though: it&#x27;s important if you&#x27;re using makeup to remove it all first. Also, have a moisturizer ready because it does dry out your skin, and be sure to diligently avoid your eye area and any other sensitive areas, especially with the blemish treatment. Just use that on your T-zone.</li>
            <li> Non-drying and really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks.  It has definitely smoothed out my skin, especially the forehead area.  Salicylic acid products tend to have that effect on my skin.  I like the exfoliant the best, because it&#x27;s pretty gentle and doesn&#x27;t sting or reek of rubbing alcohol. The benzoyl peroxide treatment is a bit drying, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  I&#x27;m not sure how this is going to help with scarring/hyperpigmentation though.  Might have to find another product for that.  Still some breakouts occurring, but they don&#x27;t seem to last too long.  Overall, I am pleased with this product and will most likely buy the full-size version.  This is a good alternative to Proactiv and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Product is working well for my grandaughter. She will reorder.</li>
            <li> Very Small for price I think. Just started using it, not sure how well it works yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for about a week, and they&#x27;ve left my skin smooth and blemish-free (so far!).  I&#x27;m a long time proactiv user and wanted to try something new.  These products are fragrance free and very gentle but effective.  Although my face looks and feels a oilier by mid-afternoon, it seems less congested so maybe it&#x27;s helping to declog and move the oils out to the surface.  My only complaint is the benzoyl isn&#x27;t as finely milled as proactiv, but it blends into the skin well so you can layer makeup on top.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter has mild acne. The product didn&#x27;t help a bit.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Purchased product for teenage child, thus far product seems to be clearing up acne.</li>
