            <li>This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The best waterproof EVER.</li>
            <li>I needed something that would stay perfect all day and did a lot of research which lead me to this product.</li>
            <li>and this is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried and sticking to it from now on.  </li>
            <li>Hope this helps and works just as good for you as it did for me!</li>
            <li>Great product and</li>
            <li>The mascara went on great.</li>
            <li>Great ultra waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>Amazing hold!  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly does give great curl.  </li>
            <li>I think you can still get a good idea of the curl.</li>
            <li>Layer at your own risk, lol.</li>
            <li>and I have tried my fair share of mascara.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I found it!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Happily going to buy more :)</li>
            <li>I have been on the hunt for something that could hold and I am so excited and glad I found this!!</li>
            <li>but my lashes are a good length to start with (just light)</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to do more then 2 swipes with this.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Finally found a mascara that can hold my lashes!!!! :D</li>
            <li>Best mascara I used on my stubby asian lashes.</li>
            <li>I was able to add volume with more application.</li>
            <li>Results look great more natural than most waterproof mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I do have to be sure to have a good dual-phase makeup remover like Bifesta or the Isehan one made for this, as it doesn&#x27;t budge with my normal cleansing balms or oils.</li>
            <li>It is easily removed with their mascara remover, which comes in a wand like their mascara.</li>
            <li>I had the most success with DHC oil cleanser then Maybelline waterproof makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit challenging to take off, but worth it for it&#x27;s longevity.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost, I am pleased and I will order this again.</li>
            <li>This mascara really built very strong volume</li>
            <li>It is everything the original one is - curls lashes</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible to get some curl without using a curler and just using the mascara wand to push them up, but the results are far more impressive if you curl them first.  </li>
            <li>Mascara comes off cleanly with no struggling or tugging.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping</li>
            <li>I had been using their original formula and loved it; however, I live in coastal North Carolina where the humidity remains very high</li>
            <li>Thank you Daisuke for your sweet note and snacks.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer the Volume &amp; Curl but this is good too.  </li>
            <li>but I ended up returning it quickly.</li>
            <li>it claimed to be super water</li>
            <li>but it dries fairy quickly.</li>
            <li>It works better than a lot of high end mascara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands from drugstore to high end</li>
            <li>but it showed up weeks before the projected date and is worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>but I would wait longer because this mascara is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to clean up under my eyes and then add a second coat and go out for the evening with no worries.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this and was excited based on rave reddit reviews</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the reason that I&#x27;m not using it right,</li>
            <li>(most mascaras straighten my lashes back out regardless of what the formula is).</li>
            <li>And the waterproof is exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>STRAIGHT!</li>
            <li>which actually helps me stay  clump free when applying and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>So when this new super waterproof mascara came on the market, I had to try it.</li>
            <li>It holds a curl fairly well considering I have very short, straight Asian lashes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good at staying on, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to wash off unless I use an emulsifying oil cleanser.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It dries fast</li>
            <li>I have very oily eyelids, but I can&#x27;t just stop my 12 hour work day to reapply my mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara does an amazing job at lengthening and curling my short, straight, Asian lashes.</li>
            <li>In addition the package arrived much faster than the estimated time, even though it was shipped from Japan.</li>
            <li>Absolutely smudge-proof.</li>
            <li>but the remover dissolves it fast and it cleans off with no tugging.</li>
            <li>If I really load it up, I sometimes have to use eye make up remover again after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>After it dries, it won&#x27;t really budge/smudge which is suppose to do since it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look long and dark and perfect, even after a long day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Kiss Me Heroine make long and pretty lashes super waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>so you need to separate and straighten your lashes quickly if they got crooked or crossed when you curled them.  </li>
            <li>last thing, I used my Neutrogena eye make up remover and had no problems removing the first time.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the other Japanese mascaras that I tried.  </li>
            <li>The color is a rich black, the formula is a bit &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Vaseline helped but it took a lot of gentle massaging and there was still a lot left.)  </li>
            <li>I even tested this in a hot, steamy shower with minimal running.  </li>
            <li>The formula itself is a tad wet when you first apply it</li>
            <li>It was not dry.</li>
            <li>This mascara actually has little fibers so you want to make sure to wipe down the wand occasionally if you don&#x27;t want clumping.</li>
            <li>But the lashes were very dark and very waterproof!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> put this on and took a shower without even rubbing my eyes, and it just comes off, not completely</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really dry in my view.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got an old product</li>

            <li> Careful of the tip of the wand because product likes to build up there.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make a big mess, just a litter dark under eyes.</li>
            <li> Its dark but not enough where the color looks harsh.  </li>
            <li> that usually kills all my makeup but my lashes looked the same.</li>
            <li> and the color is dark and as advertised; and it stays on.</li>
            <li> Holds the curls extremely well!</li>
            <li> so I think it aids in lengthening a little</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get to me</li>
            <li> A few tips -</li>
            <li> but my eyelashes where messy after the shower.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had any trouble with removal</li>
            <li> /&gt;However it is a little hard to remove even though it is waterproof</li>
            <li> Usually, at the end of the day I have raccoon eyes from smudging but not using this stuff.</li>
            <li> Of course, I only put one layer, so it wasn&#x27;t difficult.</li>
            <li> But this one has the added benefit of not smudging in the least bit, even when the humidity is thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy even if it is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> They stayed that way for at least 12 hours</li>
            <li> Only gave 4 stars because I find it almost impossible to remove!  </li>
            <li> I attached a pic of my lashes before and after - sorry about the poor resolution.  </li>
            <li> SAD</li>
            <li> I THINK ILL NEVER FIND A REL WATERPROOF BULLET PROOF MASCARA</li>
            <li> Difficult to wash off even.</li>
            <li> And it will dirty the eyelid....</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also very difficult to remove!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something as a base just to hold your lashes up, I recommend this!</li>

            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I had been using their original formula and loved it; however, I live in coastal North Carolina where the humidity remains very high and I found it smudged. So when this new super waterproof mascara came on the market, I had to try it. It is everything the original one is - curls lashes and they stay curled; elongates lashes, and the color is dark and as advertised; and it stays on. But this one has the added benefit of not smudging in the least bit, even when the humidity is thick and heavy. It is easily removed with their mascara remover, which comes in a wand like their mascara. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The best waterproof EVER. Prompt shipping too!</li>
            <li> Amazing hold!  My eyelashes stay curled all day.  It&#x27;s possible to get some curl without using a curler and just using the mascara wand to push them up, but the results are far more impressive if you curl them first.  I attached a pic of my lashes before and after - sorry about the poor resolution.  I think you can still get a good idea of the curl. (FYI - I use the method where you rotate the curler until it&#x27;s parallel to the floor.)  They stayed that way for at least 12 hours (most mascaras straighten my lashes back out regardless of what the formula is). I also took a nap and slept on my face - that usually kills all my makeup but my lashes looked the same. A few tips - It dries fast so you need to separate and straighten your lashes quickly if they got crooked or crossed when you curled them.  Also, I&#x27;m used to doing multiple swipes to build volume but I haven&#x27;t been able to do more then 2 swipes with this. I haven&#x27;t tried layering a volume mascara over it.  I can see fibers on the brush so I think it aids in lengthening a little but my lashes are a good length to start with (just light) so it&#x27;s hard to tell.  I didn&#x27;t realize this is waterproof and it&#x27;s been a challenge to remove.  It&#x27;s the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever needed to work at removing.  I had the most success with DHC oil cleanser then Maybelline waterproof makeup remover.  (What didn&#x27;t work was regular Maybelline, Purpose cleanser, Sheseido makeup remover and The Body Shop makeup remover.  Vaseline helped but it took a lot of gentle massaging and there was still a lot left.)  I will definitely order this again.  It took a little while to get to me but it showed up weeks before the projected date and is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This mascara really built very strong volume but it&#x27;s also very difficult to remove!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the reason that I&#x27;m not using it right, but it&#x27;s really dry in my view. And it will dirty the eyelid....</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> Thank you Daisuke for your sweet note and snacks. I really love it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have very oily eyelids, but I can&#x27;t just stop my 12 hour work day to reapply my mascara. I needed something that would stay perfect all day and did a lot of research which lead me to this product. My eyelashes look long and dark and perfect, even after a long day. It is a bit challenging to take off, but worth it for it&#x27;s longevity.</li>
            <li> This mascara does an amazing job at lengthening and curling my short, straight, Asian lashes. And the waterproof is exactly as stated. Does not budge for anything. Usually, at the end of the day I have raccoon eyes from smudging but not using this stuff. It&#x27;s so good at staying on, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to wash off unless I use an emulsifying oil cleanser. Definitely am going to buy again.</li>
            <li> Finally found a mascara that can hold my lashes!!!! :D Asian eye lash problems x3 semi-long and STICK STRAIGHT! The only one that could hold my lashes after curling them was Shiseido Lasting Lift and they discontinued! I have been on the hunt for something that could hold and I am so excited and glad I found this!! Definitely worth every penny! If you&#x27;re looking for something as a base just to hold your lashes up, I recommend this! Happily going to buy more :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, I used my Neutrogena eye make up remover and had no problems removing the first time. Of course, I only put one layer, so it wasn&#x27;t difficult. Layer at your own risk, lol. Hope this helps and works just as good for you as it did for me!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mascara that would help my lashes stay curled. Not only does it do that but it has the durability to last all day and into the night. Not since Cover Girl&#x27;s &amp;#34;Marathon Mascara&amp;#34; have I found such a long-lasting mascara. In addition the package arrived much faster than the estimated time, even though it was shipped from Japan. Well worth the cost, I am pleased and I will order this again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this and was excited based on rave reddit reviews but I ended up returning it quickly. I&#x27;m not sure if I got an old product but it was very dry and gunky. For the expensive price I expected a lot more.</li>
            <li> I bought this prosuct couse I&#x27;m going on a cruse nd it claimed to be super water proof.&lt;br /&gt;I put this on and took a shower without even rubbing my eyes, and it just comes off, not completely but my eyelashes where messy after the shower. It doesn&#x27;t make a big mess, just a litter dark under eyes. But it does not last longer. Not waterproof to me. SAD I THINK ILL NEVER FIND A REL WATERPROOF BULLET PROOF MASCARA</li>
            <li> Absolutely smudge-proof. I&#x27;ve had a long-standing problem with raccoon eyes even with waterpoof mascaras, and I&#x27;d thought it was just an unavoidable consequence of my skin type until I tried this. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d never tried Heroine Make until now - it always in the &amp;#34;cheapo makeup&amp;#34; section of the drugstore so I never gave it a second look. Now I regret not buying it while I was still living in Japan!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I bought this to replace a product that was discontinued and I have searched for a satisfactory replacement for over three years.  Now the search is over. No running, flaking, etc.  The color is a rich black, the formula is a bit &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; which actually helps me stay  clump free when applying and dries quickly.  Results look great more natural than most waterproof mascaras.  Then again as a blonde with black lashes I&#x27;m not fooling anyone anyway!  I even tested this in a hot, steamy shower with minimal running.  I was able to clean up under my eyes and then add a second coat and go out for the evening with no worries.  That is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with removal, I use Lancome Bifacil and haven&#x27;t struggled at all. Mascara comes off cleanly with no struggling or tugging.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping only took two days for me but I would wait longer because this mascara is worth it.  I highly recommend Kiss Me Heroine make long and pretty lashes super waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the other Japanese mascaras that I tried.  It does lengthen but did not thicken.  It is waterproof and lasts until you remove it.  I had to use the KissMe Heroine Mascara Remover to get it off but the remover dissolves it fast and it cleans off with no tugging.</li>
            <li> Its dark but not enough where the color looks harsh.  Surprisingly does give great curl.  Only gave 4 stars because I find it almost impossible to remove!  I have to use eye makeup remover, oil cleanse and foam cleanse to get this stuff off.  If I really load it up, I sometimes have to use eye make up remover again after cleansing.  I will continue to buy even if it is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> This mascara actually has little fibers so you want to make sure to wipe down the wand occasionally if you don&#x27;t want clumping. The formula itself is a tad wet when you first apply it but it dries fairy quickly. After it dries, it won&#x27;t really budge/smudge which is suppose to do since it&#x27;s waterproof. It holds a curl fairly well considering I have very short, straight Asian lashes and I have tried my fair share of mascara. It does what it says, it lengths and it holds a curl. The wand itself is a standard curve with same length bristles all around. Careful of the tip of the wand because product likes to build up there. It works better than a lot of high end mascara and it actually cost less so I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite mascara.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands from drugstore to high end but I always find myself going back to this one.  Great product and it arrived on time. No complaints.  It&#x27;s definitely in my HG list for makeup.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amaze balls!!! It works so well holds my curl and does not smudge whatsoever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it is a little hard to remove even though it is waterproof</li>
            <li> Best mascara I used on my stubby asian lashes. Holds the curls extremely well!</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews unless I feel I need to and this is awesome.  Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried and sticking to it from now on.  I do not understand why some people complain about clumping because it doesn&#x27;t for me unless they just dont know how to apply mascara.  It&#x27;s a must try!!</li>
            <li> The mascara went on great. It was not dry. I was able to add volume with more application. I did not notice that my eyelashes were noticeably longer. But the lashes were very dark and very waterproof! Difficult to wash off even. I don&#x27;t know how they do it but I&#x27;m glad I found it!</li>
            <li> Great ultra waterproof mascara. I actually prefer the Volume &amp; Curl but this is good too.  I do have to be sure to have a good dual-phase makeup remover like Bifesta or the Isehan one made for this, as it doesn&#x27;t budge with my normal cleansing balms or oils.</li>
