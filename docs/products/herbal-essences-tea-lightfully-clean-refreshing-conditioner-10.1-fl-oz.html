    <ol>
            <li>Every product they make has a wonderful smell and this one is like the rest.</li>
            <li>The best part is the root stimulation you get with the tea tree oil.</li>

            <li>This conditioner smells wonderful but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>The product is good.  </li>
            <li>Tingles on the scalp, smells good, and works like a clean-rinsing conditioner, leaving no residue like the one with Argon Oil leaves.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, too.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>Most Herbal Essence products are great though.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, does a good job of conditioning.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this conditioner!</li>
            <li>:) Please never stop making this or the matching shampoo #which I also reviewed)!</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences Tea-Lightfully Clean Refreshing Conditioner leaves your hair smelling wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for am honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li>Spreads through the hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>nice scent and works well</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a tingle on my scalp, but I do not get one from this product.  </li>
            <li>but it does a okay job.</li>
            <li>My hair is more tangled after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I also love the tingly feeling it gives while it is on my hair.</li>
            <li>It was a bit surprising for me...didn&#x27;t really expect that.</li>
            <li>Nothing very special about this conditioner, I just got it because it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t love the cool, tingly feeling it gives your scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair feels OK but not as clean as it did with Drama Clean.</li>
            <li>Loved this and how soft it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky smooth and just really clean.</li>
            <li>It does clean your hair but it doesn&#x27;t leave it smooth or glowing.</li>
            <li>I think its my new favorite herbal essence product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming this is the replacement/upgrade for Drama Clean since stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore.</li>
            <li>I use it with the matching Tea-Lightfully Clean shampoo and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li>Most conditioners have more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; when combed through my wet hair.</li>
            <li>My long hair liked both the shampoo and conditioner for this product.</li>
            <li>But I also must reference the first review for this product.</li>
            <li>Once again I&#x27;ll reference the smell mentioned in the first review.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have a feminine smell, and they both finally have SUPER SOFT hair, so I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, the tea tree effect was too much.</li>
            <li>Tea-Lightfully Clean left my hair looking CLEAN and SOFT and SHINEY!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my tween who&#x27;s currently suffering the fine greasy hair drama of puberty.</li>
            <li>This product really rejuvenated my scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair was very bouncy, with no residue, and the FRAGRANCE was heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used Drama Clean for years because it was the only &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love that it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighed down like some conditioners do.</li>
            <li>I love the green packaging, the refreshing theme of green tea</li>
            <li>As far as scent goes, I wish it were a little more girly, but the light scent is to be expected with tea tree products.</li>
            <li>my hair has never felt cleaner after using this is now my favorite and no more greasy hair.</li>
            <li>do I am avoiding completely from now on!</li>
            <li>After being left on for several minutes, it produced a clean, very soft look to my hair.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a little different (it&#x27;s sort of minty#, but it is not bad or offensive, and I got used to it quickly.</li>
            <li>do recommend the product because my hair looks shiny and feels soft.</li>
            <li>It works great-leave her hair clean and soft without drying it out or being to harsh.</li>
            <li>Like any other conditioner, being male and having long hair is another challenge and needed a more than a &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; conditioner</li>
            <li>Once my hair dried (roller set), however, the results were much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I have long, normal hair, and after using this product, my shoulders, forehead and back feel like I put on Bengay cream.</li>
            <li>Does its job, but the scent is pretty harsh.</li>
            <li>The Tea-Lightfully Clean conditioner moisturizes my naturally dry hair, but doesn&#x27;t make it look like an oil slick.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;d have a buddy or family member willing to take it off your hands if you&#x27;re not happy with either product.</li>
            <li> I have since read that other herbal essence products also have this effect</li>
            <li> Other than the lack of tingle</li>
            <li> and it really was frightening.</li>
            <li> When I used this conditioner on my wet hair, it was hard to comb through for some reason.</li>
            <li> We brush our hair through to get rid of dead hairs before showering so we knew it wasn&#x27;t dead hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why it&#x27;s called Tea-Lightfully; it should be called Menthol-Lightfully.</li>
            <li> Not sure what ingredient is causing this &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; sensation, but it makes me nervous to use the product.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve used other products that left me very unhappy because they do leave your hair feeling like you coated it with wax</li>
            <li> The tingling can be a bit disturbing but it does the job intended.  </li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable to use for the two weeks I had it.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, the product is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It made my skin and scalp cold and tingly.</li>
            <li> But I know a lot of people have smell sensitivities and a lot of people might be unhappy with the smell because it does smell a bit medicine-y.</li>
            <li> Pleasent scent and leaves no residue behind!!</li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t the worst thing though-</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Still undecided about this product.  The tingling can be a bit disturbing but it does the job intended.  It has a almost minty smell to it. I received this product at a discount in exchange for am honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I now use this in place of the much more expensive Paul Mitchell Tea Tree products.  Leaves my hair shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect. Shampoo lol</li>
            <li> Love Herbal Essences!!! Every product they make has a wonderful smell and this one is like the rest. Pleasent scent and leaves no residue behind!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells wonderful but not too strong.  Spreads through the hair nicely.  No tangles when done.</li>
            <li> I did not like the way it tingles</li>
            <li> my hair has never felt cleaner after using this is now my favorite and no more greasy hair.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, the tea tree effect was too much. It made my skin and scalp cold and tingly. It was uncomfortable to use for the two weeks I had it. That wasn&#x27;t the worst thing though- myself and my girlfriend noticed after using this conditioner, our hair was coming out in clumps, literally handfuls of hair were coming out, sitting in the plug and covering us when we washed. We brush our hair through to get rid of dead hairs before showering so we knew it wasn&#x27;t dead hair and it really was frightening. I have since read that other herbal essence products also have this effect do I am avoiding completely from now on!</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Tea-Lightfully Clean Refreshing Conditioner leaves your hair smelling wonderful.  My hair feels silky smooth and just really clean. The conditioner with shampoo makes my hair look shiney and I have had nothing but compliments on my hair since using this conditioner and shampoo.</li>
            <li> great size for my gym bag</li>
            <li> Contains menthol, which I do not care for.  Otherwise a very good product.</li>
            <li> The product is good.  Nice scent, does a good job of conditioning.  I was expecting more of a tingle on my scalp, but I do not get one from this product.  Other than the lack of tingle, this is a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> Its ok, it makes my head tingle like mad though.  Clears the sinuses lol.</li>
            <li> This product really rejuvenated my scalp. After being left on for several minutes, it produced a clean, very soft look to my hair.  The best part is the root stimulation you get with the tea tree oil. If you&#x27;re looking to stimulate your hair follicles for growth, this is the product to have. Also, it&#x27;s a great product for swimmers, the tea tree oil helps cleanse all the damaging chlorine that drys out our hair. As far as scent goes, I wish it were a little more girly, but the light scent is to be expected with tea tree products.</li>
            <li> I have used Drama Clean for years because it was the only &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner that didn&#x27;t leave a waxy residue in my hair. I&#x27;m assuming this is the replacement/upgrade for Drama Clean since stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore. But if you&#x27;re thinking if buying this, be warned that it is not the same. I&#x27;m not really sure why it&#x27;s called Tea-Lightfully; it should be called Menthol-Lightfully. I have long, normal hair, and after using this product, my shoulders, forehead and back feel like I put on Bengay cream. Not sure what ingredient is causing this &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; sensation, but it makes me nervous to use the product. The aroma also evokes a menthol-like sensation in my chest. My hair feels OK but not as clean as it did with Drama Clean. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> But I also must reference the first review for this product. Every person is different. I know I&#x27;ve used other products that left me very unhappy because they do leave your hair feeling like you coated it with wax and it feels gummy. My long hair liked both the shampoo and conditioner for this product. Once again I&#x27;ll reference the smell mentioned in the first review. I didn&#x27;t mind the smell. But I know a lot of people have smell sensitivities and a lot of people might be unhappy with the smell because it does smell a bit medicine-y. The shampoo didn&#x27;t tingle for me. I put the shampoo on my scalp and my length but I only use conditioner on my length. The conditioner made my neck tingle. It was a bit surprising for me...didn&#x27;t really expect that. I didn&#x27;t mind but I know a lot of people might not like that tingling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend the product because my hair looks shiny and feels soft. I&#x27;d have a buddy or family member willing to take it off your hands if you&#x27;re not happy with either product.</li>
            <li> nice scent and works well</li>
            <li> Tingles on the scalp, smells good, and works like a clean-rinsing conditioner, leaving no residue like the one with Argon Oil leaves.  My husband and toddler also use this b/c it doesn&#x27;t have a feminine smell, and they both finally have SUPER SOFT hair, so I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Like any other conditioner, being male and having long hair is another challenge and needed a more than a &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; conditioner but it does a okay job.</li>
            <li> My hair is more tangled after using this conditioner. I also don&#x27;t love the cool, tingly feeling it gives your scalp. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It cleans my hair well and makes it manageable.  Smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Nothing very special about this conditioner, I just got it because it was cheap. Does its job, but the scent is pretty harsh. Definitely a shock to the nose!</li>
            <li> Smells Great &amp; Excellent Price Point!!</li>
            <li> Loved this and how soft it made my hair feel. I think its my new favorite herbal essence product!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my tween who&#x27;s currently suffering the fine greasy hair drama of puberty. It works great-leave her hair clean and soft without drying it out or being to harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of brands and various types for 29 years and have never found something that works as well as this! I use it with the matching Tea-Lightfully Clean shampoo and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. Other conditioners are either too weak or too strong. The Tea-Lightfully Clean conditioner moisturizes my naturally dry hair, but doesn&#x27;t make it look like an oil slick. Tea-Lightfully Clean left my hair looking CLEAN and SOFT and SHINEY! The scent is a little different (it&#x27;s sort of minty#, but it is not bad or offensive, and I got used to it quickly. I also love the tingly feeling it gives while it is on my hair. :) Please never stop making this or the matching shampoo #which I also reviewed)!</li>
            <li> When I used this conditioner on my wet hair, it was hard to comb through for some reason. Most conditioners have more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; when combed through my wet hair. Once my hair dried (roller set), however, the results were much better than I expected. My hair was very bouncy, with no residue, and the FRAGRANCE was heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the green packaging, the refreshing theme of green tea but unfortunately, the product is a disappointment. It does clean your hair but it doesn&#x27;t leave it smooth or glowing. Good thing I only bought one. Most Herbal Essence products are great though.</li>
            <li> I am just as happy with this as I am with the shampoo.  I love that it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighed down like some conditioners do.</li>
