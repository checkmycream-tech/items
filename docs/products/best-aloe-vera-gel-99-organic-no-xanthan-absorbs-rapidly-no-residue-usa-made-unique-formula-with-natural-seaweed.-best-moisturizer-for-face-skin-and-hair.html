            <li>We use it on our scalp to make our hair healthy.</li>

            <li>/&gt;*MY FAVORITE: phytonutrients-</li>
            <li>This does not affect most people, but can cause reactions in some.  </li>
            <li>Love this aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li>For sure recommend this .</li>
            <li>I love aloe vera gel...</li>
            <li>I ordered some more.</li>
            <li>My husband and I are both light complected and burn very easily.</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily and my skin is left feeling great!</li>
            <li>I found out real quickly that this claim is absolutely true!</li>
            <li>this is great for sensitive skin like mine</li>
            <li>This product works so great  with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Apple cider vinegar (household use) is great for stopping and removing products when reactions occur; and it also restores skin&#x27;s natural PH balance.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an easy choice.  </li>
            <li>Comes in a generous container with easy application.</li>
            <li>I noticed relief very quickly.</li>
            <li>My daughter is allergic to perfume and strong smells.</li>
            <li>(I received this at a discount for an honest review, but it would be worth every penny of the full price.)</li>
            <li>Super fantastic!</li>
            <li>Holy huge bottle, batman.</li>
            <li>when I lightly towel off I put this all over.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t itchy and the skin is now smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good as a makeup remover, shaving cream, face wash, exfoliator, as part of a night beauty regimen, hand sanitizer, eyebrow grooming, soothing dry cracked feet, for hair and much much more.</li>
            <li>I also used some to slick my hair into a ponytail and bit did a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>I got so excited when I saw this aloe vera gel</li>
            <li>It did not leave a sticky residue, had a pleasant smell and was instantly soothing to the touch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since Aloe Vera has many great uses, I am going to use this product to make all natural body and facial products as well.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin nice and soft and you also don&#x27;t need to use it as often as creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>The good thing is its not super sticky like most gels.</li>
            <li>Being a super fair skinned freckled gal, I burn almost instantly even with sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this if you have super oily hair</li>
            <li>The seller was amazing, sent me another bottle for free and it was at my door 2 days later.</li>
            <li>Within just a couple days, they were tan and ready for more fun in the sun.</li>
            <li>The gel goes on smooth and air dries very fast.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in a &amp;#34;cold pressed&amp;#34; aloe vera gel, there is a brand available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Simply put an amazing product .</li>
            <li>I applied this today fresh out the shower</li>
            <li>I put some on my hands to see how well it absorbed and how it would make my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I am using it as a carrier for my essential oils and it pairs nicely.</li>
            <li>Super fast results!  </li>
            <li>I work in the pizza industry and get burns from a super hot oven sliding pizzas off the paddles into the oven all the time .&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s in a nice dark amber bottle which doesn&#x27;t let much light in, which will prolong the shelf life of the gel.  </li>
            <li>It really absorbs in to my skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>This product comes in a nice dark bottle which is better for storing natural products.</li>
            <li>So a little bit goes a long way, which is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I put it on in the morning and didn&#x27;t feel the need to apply more until mid afternoon.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this and will be recommending it to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thank you for the incredibly fast shipping and for providing quality products!  </li>
            <li>I even have been putting it on the ends of my hair with no ill effect.</li>
            <li>When I first received this Aloe Vera Gel</li>
            <li>Please do a patch test first, before using any product containing this preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That being said, as much as we try to avoid sunburns, they still happen!</li>
            <li>I am using it on an area of dry skin that I have and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera Gel is such an amazing product,  it can help with so many skin problems (also other uses).  </li>
            <li>The extra strong formula contains a natural thickener (seaweed extract)&lt;br /&gt;and is great for sunburns and other skin ailments.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>so it is purely for applying to the body.</li>
            <li>I know, grow my own plants and use for daily consumption due to needed full body health benefits.</li>
            <li>bottle is a really good size as it really doesn&#x27;t take much to cover a single area so it&#x27;ll last for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>A friend suggested that I freeze some in an ice cube tray so we have some ready to soothe burns or mosquito bites.</li>
            <li>I feel these aloe products are incomparable to what&#x27;s currently on the market.  </li>
            <li>Does not leave a build up on your skin if you get it rubbed in really well.  </li>
            <li>She really loves the way it feels, and it really does condition and hydrate the skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>Really helps to soothe and heal my skin.</li>
            <li>No matter how much we apply and reapply sunscreen, the kids get burnt somewhere.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Really appreciate Seven Minerals Aloe Vera Gel.</li>
            <li>and although that is more expensive than some of the non organic brands available it looks to be a good deal when compared to other organic brands.  </li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li>The bottled gel here, has a very slight smell (not unpleasant) and is extremely light colored as is natural to the Aloe cacti plant.</li>
            <li>Years back I was using it daily as my main face moisturizer, and I loved the results with the exception of the white residue that was always left on my face.  </li>
            <li>I am new the the seven minerals brand</li>
            <li>Essentially scentless, lightweight, fast absorption into skin and soothing; this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that it is NOT sticky, as I have had others in the past that were sticky.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s 99% organic, unlike the other brands that you get from the local grocery store.</li>
            <li>Not thick or viscous, natural density that is easier to mix for DIY home remedies: shampoos, conditioners, moisturizers, soaps and even toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seaweed Extract&#x27;s Super Powers:&lt;br /&gt;*anti-aging (due to vitamins, minerals, amino acids and antioxidants contained in seaweed)&lt;br /&gt;*anti-inflammatory- treats rashes and boo-boos&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I was young we always have Aloe Vera plant in our garden</li>
            <li>This product was a big help to us when we went on vacations and we are exposed to the sun for almost the whole day.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>This is a natural preservative used to prevent mold, however it is also a skin allergen.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a plus for me because this allows for an all natural and organic gel.</li>
            <li>it not sticky feeling and just sinks right into skin and cooled off the sun burn</li>
            <li>Living in FL getting a little too much sun happens; I keep this in the fridge for such situations and it is cool to the skin when applied and helps take the ouch out of a sunburn.</li>
            <li>In the mean time I will be continuing to use this Aloe Vera Gel on my skin when it gets dry and on my legs after I shave since it really makes a huge difference since I tend to get razor burns a lot!</li>
            <li>Well just like normal,  a couple kids got a litle red.</li>
            <li>I am also using it straight from the bottle and have seen a decrease in my dry hands.</li>
            <li>The drop that I put on my finger was actually too much for the back of my hand, and I had to spread some up my arm too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This will be replacing my old daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It is a natural astringent, thus stinging sensation when applied to open sores or wounds.</li>
            <li>The gel is a nice clear color with no smell and an easy consistency to work with - not too thin, but also not super thick.  </li>
            <li>She used this Aloe Very gel and did not get a headache or suffer any other symptoms.</li>
            <li>I am black and I highly suggest it to those natural  ladies out there.</li>
            <li>I was blown away by how fast it absorbs which was less than a minute</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it&#x27;s an easy choice.  </li>
            <li> Comes in a generous container with easy application.</li>
            <li> I noticed relief very quickly.</li>
            <li> My daughter is allergic to perfume and strong smells.</li>
            <li> (I received this at a discount for an honest review, but it would be worth every penny of the full price.)</li>
            <li> Super fantastic!</li>
            <li> Holy huge bottle, batman.</li>
            <li> when I lightly towel off I put this all over.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t itchy and the skin is now smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good as a makeup remover, shaving cream, face wash, exfoliator, as part of a night beauty regimen, hand sanitizer, eyebrow grooming, soothing dry cracked feet, for hair and much much more.</li>
            <li> I also used some to slick my hair into a ponytail and bit did a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> I got so excited when I saw this aloe vera gel</li>
            <li> It did not leave a sticky residue, had a pleasant smell and was instantly soothing to the touch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since Aloe Vera has many great uses, I am going to use this product to make all natural body and facial products as well.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin nice and soft and you also don&#x27;t need to use it as often as creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> The good thing is its not super sticky like most gels.</li>
            <li> Being a super fair skinned freckled gal, I burn almost instantly even with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this if you have super oily hair</li>
            <li> The seller was amazing, sent me another bottle for free and it was at my door 2 days later.</li>
            <li> Within just a couple days, they were tan and ready for more fun in the sun.</li>
            <li> The gel goes on smooth and air dries very fast.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in a &amp;#34;cold pressed&amp;#34; aloe vera gel, there is a brand available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Simply put an amazing product .</li>
            <li> I applied this today fresh out the shower</li>
            <li> I put some on my hands to see how well it absorbed and how it would make my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I am using it as a carrier for my essential oils and it pairs nicely.</li>
            <li> Super fast results!  </li>
            <li> I work in the pizza industry and get burns from a super hot oven sliding pizzas off the paddles into the oven all the time .&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s in a nice dark amber bottle which doesn&#x27;t let much light in, which will prolong the shelf life of the gel.  </li>
            <li> It really absorbs in to my skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.  </li>
            <li> This product comes in a nice dark bottle which is better for storing natural products.</li>
            <li> So a little bit goes a long way, which is awesome.  </li>
            <li> I put it on in the morning and didn&#x27;t feel the need to apply more until mid afternoon.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this and will be recommending it to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thank you for the incredibly fast shipping and for providing quality products!  </li>
            <li> I even have been putting it on the ends of my hair with no ill effect.</li>
            <li> When I first received this Aloe Vera Gel</li>
            <li> Please do a patch test first, before using any product containing this preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That being said, as much as we try to avoid sunburns, they still happen!</li>
            <li> I am using it on an area of dry skin that I have and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera Gel is such an amazing product,  it can help with so many skin problems (also other uses).  </li>
            <li> The extra strong formula contains a natural thickener (seaweed extract)&lt;br /&gt;and is great for sunburns and other skin ailments.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> so it is purely for applying to the body.</li>
            <li> I know, grow my own plants and use for daily consumption due to needed full body health benefits.</li>
            <li> bottle is a really good size as it really doesn&#x27;t take much to cover a single area so it&#x27;ll last for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested that I freeze some in an ice cube tray so we have some ready to soothe burns or mosquito bites.</li>
            <li> I feel these aloe products are incomparable to what&#x27;s currently on the market.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave a build up on your skin if you get it rubbed in really well.  </li>
            <li> She really loves the way it feels, and it really does condition and hydrate the skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> Really helps to soothe and heal my skin.</li>
            <li> No matter how much we apply and reapply sunscreen, the kids get burnt somewhere.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Really appreciate Seven Minerals Aloe Vera Gel.</li>
            <li> and although that is more expensive than some of the non organic brands available it looks to be a good deal when compared to other organic brands.  </li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li> The bottled gel here, has a very slight smell (not unpleasant) and is extremely light colored as is natural to the Aloe cacti plant.</li>
            <li> Years back I was using it daily as my main face moisturizer, and I loved the results with the exception of the white residue that was always left on my face.  </li>
            <li> I am new the the seven minerals brand</li>
            <li> Essentially scentless, lightweight, fast absorption into skin and soothing; this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that it is NOT sticky, as I have had others in the past that were sticky.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s 99% organic, unlike the other brands that you get from the local grocery store.</li>
            <li> Not thick or viscous, natural density that is easier to mix for DIY home remedies: shampoos, conditioners, moisturizers, soaps and even toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seaweed Extract&#x27;s Super Powers:&lt;br /&gt;*anti-aging (due to vitamins, minerals, amino acids and antioxidants contained in seaweed)&lt;br /&gt;*anti-inflammatory- treats rashes and boo-boos&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I was young we always have Aloe Vera plant in our garden</li>
            <li> This product was a big help to us when we went on vacations and we are exposed to the sun for almost the whole day.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This is a natural preservative used to prevent mold, however it is also a skin allergen.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a plus for me because this allows for an all natural and organic gel.</li>
            <li> it not sticky feeling and just sinks right into skin and cooled off the sun burn</li>
            <li> Living in FL getting a little too much sun happens; I keep this in the fridge for such situations and it is cool to the skin when applied and helps take the ouch out of a sunburn.</li>
            <li> In the mean time I will be continuing to use this Aloe Vera Gel on my skin when it gets dry and on my legs after I shave since it really makes a huge difference since I tend to get razor burns a lot!</li>
            <li> Well just like normal,  a couple kids got a litle red.</li>
            <li> I am also using it straight from the bottle and have seen a decrease in my dry hands.</li>
            <li> The drop that I put on my finger was actually too much for the back of my hand, and I had to spread some up my arm too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This will be replacing my old daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It is a natural astringent, thus stinging sensation when applied to open sores or wounds.</li>
            <li> The gel is a nice clear color with no smell and an easy consistency to work with - not too thin, but also not super thick.  </li>
            <li> She used this Aloe Very gel and did not get a headache or suffer any other symptoms.</li>
            <li> I am black and I highly suggest it to those natural  ladies out there.</li>
            <li> I was blown away by how fast it absorbs which was less than a minute</li>
            <li> About 30 seconds later, it was dry and not sticky.  </li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of aloe vera</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I did get a promo code to discount the item as long as I leave this review after I used it.</li>
            <li> The next day, burns were gone (or seriously tamed down) and no one was complaining of pain after first application.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it shouldn&#x27;t last or cause ongoing extreme discomfort.</li>
            <li> BUT, our bodies chemical compositions differ due to medications and or supplements taking for diagnosed medical conditions.</li>
            <li> I find that if I give the gel sufficient time to dry (~10 minutes)</li>
            <li> Seven Minerals lists one of their main selling points as the type of geling agent they use (seaweed) and the lack of residue left behind.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and you can dilute this with distilled water if too stinging or burning topically.</li>
            <li> After smoothing this on my skin is feeling soft and supple and does not feel slick when wet because of the product build up</li>
            <li> there really is no residue.  </li>
            <li> It makes irritating bites and itches disappear;  stainless and greaseless.</li>
            <li> I love aloe but didn&#x27;t use it as much as I otherwise would because of the annoying stickiness!</li>
            <li> Those who do, know that topical application directly from cacti leaf is thick, sticky and stiff when dried.</li>
            <li> I may check out the other one for use on backs/ease in treating sunburns.</li>
            <li> I tried to mix this with my bath water to no success-</li>
            <li> As you can see in the picture, the gel is thick enough for a drop to stay on my finger.  </li>
            <li> Overall it did rub in nicely isn&#x27;t really thick</li>
            <li> He just dabs a little on the affected area and the itch is virtually gone.</li>
            <li> The gel has little to no smell to it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> took the redness out in a few days..no scent or smell..</li>
            <li> Because of this I ALWAYS have Aloe Vera on hand but have always hated that the Aloe Vera that I&#x27;ve used never absorbs but sits on my skin and then tend to get itchier because of things being able to stick to the Aloe Vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no residue left behind.</li>
            <li> I decided to use the Aloe Vera Gel and applied a few times a day.</li>
            <li> The bottle I ordered arrived broken due to rough handling by the courier.</li>
            <li> - nothing beats it for taking care of small burns promptly</li>
            <li> you usually get when using lotions.</li>
            <li> This is not your ordinary aloe gel.  </li>
            <li> For home remedies with essential oils, I always stay with oils (even carrier oils) that are virgin and cold pressed.</li>
            <li> I have used other aloe products in the past and they all fake fake-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick, but not too thin either.  </li>
            <li> but because it is so watery, i would not buy it again, unfortunately...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feeling that I hate.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> At the risk of sounding like an infomercial I want to say I really love this stuff!  The gel is a nice clear color with no smell and an easy consistency to work with - not too thin, but also not super thick.  I am a long time fan of aloe vera - nothing beats it for taking care of small burns promptly and it does wonders as a daily skin care product.  Years back I was using it daily as my main face moisturizer, and I loved the results with the exception of the white residue that was always left on my face.  That was a deal killer.  Seven Minerals lists one of their main selling points as the type of geling agent they use (seaweed) and the lack of residue left behind.  I was a bit skeptical but have been pleasantly surprised.  I find that if I give the gel sufficient time to dry (~10 minutes) there really is no residue.  Love it.  I also love the healthy glow it gives my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be replacing my old daily moisturizer.  I was able to purchase this bottle at a discount in exchange for my review of it.  I like the size of the bottle and although that is more expensive than some of the non organic brands available it looks to be a good deal when compared to other organic brands.  Add in their superior method of thickening and it&#x27;s an easy choice.  They make another version of this product which is a liquid spray, but I prefer gels for face use.  I may check out the other one for use on backs/ease in treating sunburns.</li>
            <li> Not sticky and worked wonders for my sunburn. I put it on in the morning and didn&#x27;t feel the need to apply more until mid afternoon. I wouldn&#x27;t use this if you have super oily hair like I do. Because I knew this I am not going to ding them because of my hair type. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used aloe vera before. I bought this product to keep around home.  It helps with skin irritations. I like that this product was not sticky or too runny.</li>
            <li> Very nice aloe vera gel. I like to keep a small container of this in my home first aid kit for burns or even mosquito bites. This also helps a lot with my boyfriend&#x27;s eczema when it flares up. He just dabs a little on the affected area and the itch is virtually gone. The gel has little to no smell to it. The bottle is huge! It should last us quite some time. A friend suggested that I freeze some in an ice cube tray so we have some ready to soothe burns or mosquito bites. I&#x27;ll update this if I ever try to do it with this gel. Overall I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this and will be recommending it to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding brand of aloe and has proven with virtually immediate results to have incredibly soothing and healing properties.  I cannot be without this in the house.  I have both the spray and the gel and each are equally beneficial.  I feel these aloe products are incomparable to what&#x27;s currently on the market.  I&#x27;m so thankful I stumbled upon this brand of aloe, and will continue to reorder this product.  The company is wonderful and the products are superior!  Thank you for the incredibly fast shipping and for providing quality products!  This has been a huge blessing and arrived quite timely to assist with an existing skin irritation!  Super fast results!  Super fantastic!</li>
            <li> I applied this today fresh out the shower and I&#x27;m in love! It doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feeling that I hate. It absorbs easily and my skin is left feeling great! I also used some to slick my hair into a ponytail and bit did a wonderful job. My hair is shiny, and not sticky or coated feeling. A++</li>
            <li> This is what it sounds like- a gel. The good thing is its not super sticky like most gels. I take a bath then when I lightly towel off I put this all over. I even have been putting it on the ends of my hair with no ill effect. The smell doesn&#x27;t smell fake and is enjoyable. I tried to mix this with my bath water to no success- so it is purely for applying to the body. I have used other aloe products in the past and they all fake fake- this is great for sensitive skin like mine and I am glad I stumbled across it.&lt;br /&gt;I did get a promo code to discount the item as long as I leave this review after I used it.</li>
            <li> Just went to the beach and got sunburned on the top of my feet and shoulders..Love the gel it not sticky feeling and just sinks right into skin and cooled off the sun burn took the redness out in a few days..no scent or smell..I love aloe vera..great product..</li>
            <li> When I was young we always have Aloe Vera plant in our garden and we use it a lot. We use it on our scalp to make our hair healthy. We use it when we have sunburns to ease the pain and heal the over exposed skin. I got so excited when I saw this aloe vera gel because it is now comes in handy. This product was a big help to us when we went on vacations and we are exposed to the sun for almost the whole day. At the end of the day it is soothing to apply this to our skin and so thankful we brought this on our vacation. It absorbs well and didn&#x27;t irritate our skin. So thankful we have this suring our vacation.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I learned that there are more uses for aloe vera than just sunburns. It&#x27;s good as a makeup remover, shaving cream, face wash, exfoliator, as part of a night beauty regimen, hand sanitizer, eyebrow grooming, soothing dry cracked feet, for hair and much much more. The smell is nice. It leaves my skin feeling super soft. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would moisturize without leaving my skin feeling slimy. I HAVE FOUND IT!  After smoothing this on my skin is feeling soft and supple and does not feel slick when wet because of the product build up you usually get when using lotions. Love this and will purchase again</li>
            <li> Living in Oklahoma and having had my fair share of sunburns I know how well Aloe Vera works to help treat sunburns. Because of this I ALWAYS have Aloe Vera on hand but have always hated that the Aloe Vera that I&#x27;ve used never absorbs but sits on my skin and then tend to get itchier because of things being able to stick to the Aloe Vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all being said when I saw this Aloe Vera Gel I knew I had to get it and try it just for the simple fact that it claims to absorb. I found out real quickly that this claim is absolutely true! When I first received this Aloe Vera Gel I put some on my hands to see how well it absorbed and how it would make my skin feel. I was blown away by how fast it absorbs which was less than a minute and it made the skin on my hands feel so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a really good size as it really doesn&#x27;t take much to cover a single area so it&#x27;ll last for quite awhile. This Aloe Vera Gel makes me feel more secure because I know that when I get a sunburn I will be in good hands! In the mean time I will be continuing to use this Aloe Vera Gel on my skin when it gets dry and on my legs after I shave since it really makes a huge difference since I tend to get razor burns a lot! I would HIGHLY recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera Gel is such an amazing product,  it can help with so many skin problems (also other uses).  Does not leave a build up on your skin if you get it rubbed in really well.  My Mother uses it as a hand and body lotion.  She has allergies to dyes, pigments, and most additives in store bought creams and lotions.  She really loves the way it feels, and it really does condition and hydrate the skin.  Leaves your skin nice and soft and you also don&#x27;t need to use it as often as creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> Living in FL getting a little too much sun happens; I keep this in the fridge for such situations and it is cool to the skin when applied and helps take the ouch out of a sunburn.</li>
            <li> This Aloe Vera gel is 99% organic and absorbs rapidly.  We purchased this Seven minerals aloe vera gel in&lt;br /&gt;a promotion for testing and review purposes.  The extra strong formula contains a natural thickener (seaweed extract)&lt;br /&gt;and is great for sunburns and other skin ailments.  Plus it is a perfect skin hydrator and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This Aloe Vera Gel is great.  It&#x27;s not too thick, but not too thin either.  The best part about it is that it&#x27;s not sticky at all.  As you can see in the picture, the gel is thick enough for a drop to stay on my finger.  The drop that I put on my finger was actually too much for the back of my hand, and I had to spread some up my arm too.  About 30 seconds later, it was dry and not sticky.  So a little bit goes a long way, which is awesome.  Also, it&#x27;s in a nice dark amber bottle which doesn&#x27;t let much light in, which will prolong the shelf life of the gel.  I was fortunate to receive this Aloe Vera Gel at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.  I use Aloe all the time on sunburns.  It provides great relief and prevents peeling.  I highly recommend!  I&#x27;ll be buying again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that an aloe gel could not feel sticky after application. I love aloe but didn&#x27;t use it as much as I otherwise would because of the annoying stickiness! This gel is fantastic! It dries quickly, smells good and there&#x27;s no residue left behind. It makes your skin feel soft and silky. I will also be adding it to my hair care products. I would highly recommend this and I will be reordering! (I received this at a discount for an honest review, but it would be worth every penny of the full price.)</li>
            <li> Holy huge bottle, batman. Being a super fair skinned freckled gal, I burn almost instantly even with sunscreen. In addition to the moisturizing properties aloe is a must have for any summer time burn. So happy to have this</li>
            <li> I LOVE Aloe Vera and this product is a wonderful formula.  It makes irritating bites and itches disappear;  stainless and greaseless.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with Seven Minerals Aloe Vera Gel. I am using it as a carrier for my essential oils and it pairs nicely. I am also using it straight from the bottle and have seen a decrease in my dry hands. I LOVE that it is NOT sticky, as I have had others in the past that were sticky.</li>
            <li> This gel is way to liquidy for me- it is like water... moisturizing properties are good though.. but because it is so watery, i would not buy it again, unfortunately...</li>
            <li> I wanted to order, but didn&#x27;t get a chance too.  However, this seems to be a great product!</li>
            <li> This product works so great  with my natural hair. I am black and I highly suggest it to those natural  ladies out there.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST Aloe gel I have ever used. It did not leave a sticky residue, had a pleasant smell and was instantly soothing to the touch. Everyone in my house was sun burned after a day at the pool and this gel was a lifesaver! The next day, burns were gone (or seriously tamed down) and no one was complaining of pain after first application. LOVE this product, and will buy again if we run out. Comes in a generous container with easy application. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This gel has zero smell which is a very important factor in my home. My daughter is allergic to perfume and strong smells. She used this Aloe Very gel and did not get a headache or suffer any other symptoms. The gel goes on smooth and air dries very fast. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Seems ok. I wish it had the cooling feeling as I am using it on my scalp. Overall it did rub in nicely isn&#x27;t really thick seems ok I guess. Would possibly order again.</li>
            <li> This is not your ordinary aloe gel.

This is a natural preservative used to prevent mold, however it is also a skin allergen.  This does not affect most people, but can cause reactions in some.  Please do a patch test first, before using any product containing this preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount, in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I am new the the seven minerals brand but I must say that this is a good Aloe Gel that quickly absorbs into the skin without leaving ANY residue.I love that it&#x27;s 99% organic, unlike the other brands that you get from the local grocery store. I am using it on an area of dry skin that I have and so far so good. I noticed relief very quickly. It isn&#x27;t itchy and the skin is now smooth. This product comes in a nice dark bottle which is better for storing natural products. So, if you like making your own products, DIY, oils, etc., I would hold on to this bottle for later use. I also appreciate the seal under the cap to help protect the product and ensure its freshness. My only suggestion would be to wrap bubble wrap around the bottle when shipping for protection. The bottle I ordered arrived broken due to rough handling by the courier. The seller was amazing, sent me another bottle for free and it was at my door 2 days later. That&#x27;s great service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Aloe Vera has many great uses, I am going to use this product to make all natural body and facial products as well. I am pretty confident that it will turn out great, and if so, I will increase the review to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> always wanted this and it works perfectly with my shampoo</li>
            <li> Love this aloe vera gel.  It really absorbs in to my skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.  Really helps to soothe and heal my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  My husband and I are both light complected and burn very easily. That being said, as much as we try to avoid sunburns, they still happen! That is when this stuff comes to the rescue. Essentially scentless, lightweight, fast absorption into skin and soothing; this stuff is the real deal. Will DEFINITELY be buying this product again. You can&#x27;t find this quality in any box stores....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have to say, the picture is misleading showing 3 bottles.</li>
            <li> I was offered this Aloe Vera Gel from Seven Minerals for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it.  Towards the end of summer,  we take a trip to the beach house and spend a couple weeks playing in the sun. No matter how much we apply and reapply sunscreen, the kids get burnt somewhere. I always am looking for a great after sun lotion or gel to help with the burns. Well just like normal,  a couple kids got a litle red. I decided to use the Aloe Vera Gel and applied a few times a day. Within just a couple days, they were tan and ready for more fun in the sun. I definitely recommend this Aloe Vera Gel from Seven Minerals for your after sun care.</li>
            <li> Simply put an amazing product . I work in the pizza industry and get burns from a super hot oven sliding pizzas off the paddles into the oven all the time .&lt;br /&gt;For one super soothing when applied to my burns and the healing process from this product is remarkable compared to anything else that I&#x27;ve tried . For sure recommend this .</li>
            <li> I love aloe vera gel... i use this everytime i get sun burned and it gives a great timgly sensation that helps with the burn... definitely a great purchase and i will keep buying it...</li>
            <li> Perfect! Thanks. I ordered some more.</li>
            <li> Really appreciate Seven Minerals Aloe Vera Gel. This gel is the closest you&#x27;ll get to growing your own Aloe without the slime or stickiness. I know, grow my own plants and use for daily consumption due to needed full body health benefits. The Aloe Vera Gel here, is not sticky or as viscous as what you can grow yourself. Those who do, know that topical application directly from cacti leaf is thick, sticky and stiff when dried. The bottled gel here, has a very slight smell (not unpleasant) and is extremely light colored as is natural to the Aloe cacti plant. Not thick or viscous, natural density that is easier to mix for DIY home remedies: shampoos, conditioners, moisturizers, soaps and even toothpaste. If you are interested in a &amp;#34;cold pressed&amp;#34; aloe vera gel, there is a brand available here on Amazon. For home remedies with essential oils, I always stay with oils (even carrier oils) that are virgin and cold pressed. Made an exception here as this has no Xanthan preservative and uses a seaweed plant extract. That&#x27;s a plus for me because this allows for an all natural and organic gel. A little goes a long way and you can dilute this with distilled water if too stinging or burning topically. It is a natural astringent, thus stinging sensation when applied to open sores or wounds. Affects are comparable to using hydrogen peroxide. HOWEVER, it shouldn&#x27;t last or cause ongoing extreme discomfort. If it does, then you should definitely discontinue its use. Can&#x27;t say that Aloe causes an allergic reaction as according documented and scientific studies, there are no known causations. BUT, our bodies chemical compositions differ due to medications and or supplements taking for diagnosed medical conditions. Good to be safe: check with your MD and ALWAYS spot test a tiny amount on the inside skin area of any elbow with a 24 hour wait time. Q-tip is excellent for this. Apple cider vinegar (household use) is great for stopping and removing products when reactions occur; and it also restores skin&#x27;s natural PH balance. Best wishes.t also restores skin&#x27;s natural PH balance. Best wishes.</li>
