            <li>Can not praise this product too much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference for my brittle, splitting nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I reviewed many nail blogs to find out what other women use to help nails that peel at the edges, and this product came highly recommended ( along with the ridge filler II).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it hydrates the nail or not, but it seems to me I get less breakage, although that may be because my polish stays on better and longer and lends strength to my nails.</li>
            <li>After using this product a few weeks I am in a better place.  </li>
            <li>Can apply thick so go with a light hand especially when applying a nail polish on top.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t just add substance to your nails because of the coating; they will actually grow stronger very quickly when you use this polish regularly.  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for several years, but this is the first time</li>
            <li>And the splitting has nearly stopped.  </li>

            <li> I have no idea how this stuff works, but after only a few days of use, I took my polish off...</li>
            <li> have trouble remembering to use it daily and still it helps.</li>
            <li> crap to  be honest did nothing for me</li>
            <li> this review was useful,to you, please take a sec and hit the &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; button below!</li>
            <li> I tried lots of other products that i would buy but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing some other things to perhaps make the nails stronger</li>
            <li> : I still use this stuff, and haven&#x27;t found a better base for my manicures.</li>
            <li> typically i don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews. ..  </li>
            <li> they grew a little and they would split on the sides.</li>
            <li> By applying a few coats it does seem to strengthen nails some.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I put Hydration Therapy on everyday.</li>
            <li> I use two coats of this when I don&#x27;t want to bother with color, apply a touch of it underneath my nail tips, and reapply every few days.</li>
            <li> I removed my acrylic a few months ago and was not easily adjusting.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry and brittle nails with ridges to boot, I highly recommend Nailtek Foundation No. 3 as a base coat.  </li>
            <li> Apply this a few times in a row and your nails feel hard but not brittle.</li>
            <li> No more splitting or chipping when used proberly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the solution for my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one fingernail that for years has split down to the cuticule, which was not only unsightly, but painful.  </li>
            <li> After using nail hardeners you need to add some hydration to your nails so they don&#x27;t become simply hard and brittle.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the condition of my nails was such a bad one  </li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and I have never repurchased a base coat, until now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nails were thin and breaking and peeling.  </li>
            <li> I could still see the damaged parts of my tips but they were somehow sealed which kept it from getting worse and then losing the nail.</li>
            <li> (yes was!,  horrible, dry, bridges all over, flaky etc.)</li>
            <li> I am also living through a cold winter in Chicago, so that may affect my nails also.</li>
            <li> It has not helped, disappointed.</li>
            <li> My nails split, peel and are generally ugly!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I strongly recommend this clear polish as a way of coping with aging fingernails that crack and split.  You can still use Healthy Hoof cream over your nails polished with Nail Tek Hydration Therapy, and they will actually still soak up the moisture of the cream.  The polish is quick-drying and easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t just add substance to your nails because of the coating; they will actually grow stronger very quickly when you use this polish regularly.  Don&#x27;t expect results if you don&#x27;t use it regularly and cut your nails regularly.</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time. Description was good. The is a really good product. I have been using it for years and needed to stock my supply.</li>
            <li> This is just the product I need for my dry nails. I will always use it.</li>
            <li> I have never had long nails except when I had silk wraps (18 years!). Now I don&#x27;t need them. This stuff works great for me. You need to figure out which type of nail you have and order the appropriate therapy. Nail Tek Hydration Therapy III is the one for me. I tried Therapy I, but it didn&#x27;t do the job. This stuff is amazing and now I&#x27;m no longer ashamed to show my hands.</li>
            <li> I tried this because it was recommended by a friend. My nails are always getting tears in them far down by the skin. This really hasn&#x27;t seemed to help make my nails stronger and less brittle. I have only used it for a few weeks, so maybe I need to be more patient. I am also living through a cold winter in Chicago, so that may affect my nails also. They only seem to grow in the spring and summer.</li>
            <li> Always does the job. My nail grow and are strong when I use this. Can&#x27;t go without it! Shipping on time as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Thanks to Nail Tek I have beautiful nails. No more splitting or chipping when used proberly.</li>
            <li> Used for 2 weeks and still having splits and tears in nails.  By applying a few coats it does seem to strengthen nails some.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product, but it seems to be helping my nails.  My nails were very dry, but are looking more healthy as they are growing out.</li>
            <li> April 2016: I still use this stuff, and haven&#x27;t found a better base for my manicures. I hope they never stop making it!&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff! It forms a great, strong bond between the nail and your polish, it really makes polish last longer. I don&#x27;t really know if it hydrates the nail or not, but it seems to me I get less breakage, although that may be because my polish stays on better and longer and lends strength to my nails. I am on my second bottle and I have never repurchased a base coat, until now.&lt;br /&gt;If this review was useful,to you, please take a sec and hit the &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; button below! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I removed my acrylic a few months ago and was not easily adjusting.  My nails were thin and breaking and peeling.  After using this product a few weeks I am in a better place.  My nails feel good, less breakage and I don&#x27;t have to file my nails of often.</li>
            <li> My nails look great already</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from my manicurist.  My nails split, peel and are generally ugly!  Anyway, I put Hydration Therapy on everyday. At the end of the week I remove it and start over with a fresh coat. My nails have actually GROWN! And the splitting has nearly stopped.  I recommend this product.  And the vendor sent it very promptly.</li>
            <li> cant tell a difference</li>
            <li> Initially it stayed on now it peels like the rest of the polishes.  I&#x27;m not sure of the solution for my nails.</li>
            <li> THE MIRACLE WORKER!!!! Used it 1 time , only one, and my nails show such an improvement that I felt compelled to share this. I have used acrylic nails for years ( about 10) , finally decided to stop the madness, unfortunately the condition of my nails was such a bad one  (yes was!,  horrible, dry, bridges all over, flaky etc.) that I looked for a treatment, found different products , but this one was highly recommended by several consumer reports. I just buff my nails, clean with alcohol, and brush 3 coats of this product, waited a week and well the results are amazing ! I also take Biotin daily. Try it ! get the right one for you nails,  very important.</li>
            <li> After using nail hardeners you need to add some hydration to your nails so they don&#x27;t become simply hard and brittle. This is perfect to use when your nails are a little brittle. Apply this a few times in a row and your nails feel hard but not brittle. This is the perfect base hydrating nail polish. Can apply thick so go with a light hand especially when applying a nail polish on top.</li>
            <li> My manucurist recommended this product and sold me a bottle.  Since I wanted to have a bottle in my desk drawer at work I ordered two so I would not run out.  It is great to moisturize my brittle nails.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything....for YEARS, and this is miracle stuff.  It actually works.  I now have strong, healthy nails.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. ... typically i don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews. ..  but this product does exactly what it says it does. . Heaven sent.</li>
            <li> Used entire bottle as directed and my nails were still dry and splitting/breaking.</li>
            <li> Love this products helps my nails grow and become stronger rate this as 10 stars recommend to all my friends</li>
            <li> This helped grow my nails stronger&lt;br /&gt;My nails grow with no problems but gets brittle so this helped me a lot</li>
            <li> This product - applied 2 or 3 times a week - gives me &amp;#34;acrylic nails&amp;#34; without the hassle, side effects, appt. time, and expense.  My nails are prone to break near the nail bed, which was keeping me from having the long nails I wanted.  Nailtek Hydration Therapy  III has made it possible for me to have long nails !!!!!  They are stronger and healthier. When I get &amp;#34;busy&amp;#34; and slack off the treatment, my old problems return - so I know it is the product that has made the difference.  Have been using it for several years, but this is the first time have bought it from Amazon.  Can not praise this product too much.</li>
            <li> Seemed nice at first but then turned yellow.  It may be just my nails but that is what happened to me.</li>
            <li> It has not helped, disappointed.</li>
            <li> After using this product as directed for several weeks I do not notice any difference. My nails are still brittle and cracking</li>
            <li> This hydration therapy works great to fill in ridges and keep nails from splitting.I highly recommend it for nails that are dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> crap to  be honest did nothing for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one fingernail that for years has split down to the cuticule, which was not only unsightly, but painful.  This product was recommended to me by a manicurist and it works.  I use it all the time and my nails are looking better than they have for a long time.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. My nail are always dry and brittle they grew a little and they would split on the sides. I tried lots of other products that i would buy but nothing worked. I started using Nailtek Hydration Therapy my nail are growing slowly but surely and they look healthier. It has a strong smell but it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I reviewed many nail blogs to find out what other women use to help nails that peel at the edges, and this product came highly recommended ( along with the ridge filler II). I can grow my nails out for a while, but then I lose them when the majority develop peeling at the tips--despite careful filing with crystal files, no acetone remover, etc. I was beginning that phase again, severe peeling on about one third of my nails, when I tried this product. Not only didn&#x27;t I lose those nails, but I was able to grow them out and file off the damaged tips. I have no idea how this stuff works, but after only a few days of use, I took my polish off...I could still see the damaged parts of my tips but they were somehow sealed which kept it from getting worse and then losing the nail. Another thing I noticed is my nails no longer hurt when I take my polish off. They used to hurt until I&#x27;d put more nail polish on, but now this product does something that protects and moisturizers the nail bed and I&#x27;m not experiencing that sensation anymore between manicures.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference for my brittle, splitting nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have trouble remembering to use it daily and still it helps. If I can make it part of my routine, it will be even better.</li>
            <li> First I couldn&#x27;t get the bottle open, part of the glass was glued to the brush applicator, I&#x27;ve used this product before it was a smooth liquid, this time it was a thick gloppy mess.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my  nails.  I don&#x27;t think it is a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; product, I just could not tell any difference in my nails before or after using this product for several weeks.  I think some people just have healthier nails than others do.  I&#x27;m doing some other things to perhaps make the nails stronger (better diet, more calcium, less sugar, rubber gloves, olive oil and vitamin E oil on the cuticles, etc).</li>
            <li> If your nails are hard but dry and brittle (I.e., exactly as this product indicates), this is a wondrous product.  I use two coats of this when I don&#x27;t want to bother with color, apply a touch of it underneath my nail tips, and reapply every few days. It isn&#x27;t that great of a base coat, though.  If you have dry and brittle nails with ridges to boot, I highly recommend Nailtek Foundation No. 3 as a base coat.  Great stuff, and dries quickly so you can get that mani done.</li>
            <li> my nails are beauitful</li>
