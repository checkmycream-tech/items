            <li>Very good price for GrandLASH MD, from a vendor with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Because of this, when re-ordering this great product, I preferred to buy for 3 months and not 6.</li>
            <li>Great results.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This lash enhancer works almost as good a Lattisse ...</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many others and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li>I have used a different lash product before with no problem and a great result.</li>
            <li>The box that contained this great product read &amp;#34; 4ml/6 month supply &amp;#34; but the applicator doesn&#x27;t show the same.  </li>
            <li>I have a special event in the fall I ordered a &amp;#34;6 month&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It works really well and the price was better than through the company.</li>
            <li>True story</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t notice growth what t did notice was after about 3 weeks my normally straight eyelashes developed a nice curl.  </li>
            <li>Love this,product it&#x27;s my second tube</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the 4oz...</li>
            <li>I think it is working better than the last 2oz product I purchased!!</li>
            <li>I chose this product because of its positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Really all I expect is the 6 month supply I paid for.  </li>
            <li>It really makes the lashes grow and become luxuriant.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>Within one month, my eye lash lady said I had new lashes growing in.</li>
            <li>They are shipping a new tube.  </li>
            <li>and they have thickened up considerably.</li>
            <li>The 3 month and 6 month applicators are exact same size and left me wondering</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to several of my friends and hope they like as much as I do also plan on ordering on a regular basis!</li>
            <li>It definitely took the expected two months to start seeing results but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li>After not using the product for several months , of course my eyelashes returned I have back to their natural straightness.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>

            <li> used this product in the past and would have given it 3 stars then.  </li>
            <li> All my friends asks if I am wearing fake lashes or what mascara I am using</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of healing, I decided to apply this product to that torn area and was shocked to see that lashes began to appear again.  </li>

            <li> This product works!!!! It does not bother my eyes to use.  I have always had long lashes but noticed with age and having to use Waterproof Mascara that this was taking a toll on them.</li>
            <li> It works great! I have been using it twice a day, and within just a few weeks I could tell a big difference!</li>
            <li> Great product! It arrived on time.  I used it once a day for three weeks.  Now I can see my lashes getting a little longer.  The best part is that it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  My friends and sisters use it too and they like it.</li>
            <li> I love the GrandeLash I saved money on this product and my eye lashes are so long that I might have to trim them and they have thickened up considerably.I have recommended this product to several of my friends and hope they like as much as I do also plan on ordering on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using product and have not seen any results</li>
            <li> Within one month, my eye lash lady said I had new lashes growing in. By the 2nd month, I could see the results. It is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!  After 6 weeks my lashes almost hit my eyebrows</li>
            <li> i hated the product... never getting something this brand again.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of its positive reviews. I used it one time. It was runny enough to go in my eyes and caused burning. I have used a different lash product before with no problem and a great result. I wanted to try this one after all the research I did because it sounded like it would be a better product.  It turned my eyes so red that the redness lasted for at least 6 days. I returned it with no hassle at all.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. My lashes are definitely thicker and longer. Stick with it and you will see results. Love this,product it&#x27;s my second tube</li>
            <li> I just heard from the seller. They are shipping a new tube.  I will update when I get to use for longer than 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product in the past and would have given it 3 stars then.  While I didn&#x27;t notice growth what t did notice was after about 3 weeks my normally straight eyelashes developed a nice curl.  After not using the product for several months , of course my eyelashes returned I have back to their natural straightness.&lt;br /&gt;Because I have a special event in the fall I ordered a &amp;#34;6 month&amp;#34; sized tube.  After a little over 3 weeks the tube is completely empty.  I emailed seller and have had one response saying they would have to discuss a refund.  Really all I expect is the 6 month supply I paid for.  I have yet to hear back from the seller.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for awhile.  It works really well and the price was better than through the company.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the 4oz... I think it is working better than the last 2oz product I purchased!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 7 weeks and I have not seen a difference in the length of my eyelashes. Also thought it was supposed to darken the lashes and mine have turned blonde. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, I now have lashes where I didn&#x27;t have any prior.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have tried others, but they do not compare. I especially like the applicator. It not only met my expectations it exceeded it. All my friends asks if I am wearing fake lashes or what mascara I am using and I tell them neither, it&#x27;s GrandeLASH MD</li>
            <li> This lash enhancer works almost as good a Lattisse ... and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper!  In stores it&#x27;s over $80; on Amazon it&#x27;s a bargain!</li>
            <li> Very good price for GrandLASH MD, from a vendor with Amazon.  Product arrived promptly, and like the product</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for 4 weeks but can already tell a difference.</li>
            <li> The product is good, and my eyelashes are noticeably longer, but I would not buy the so-called 6-month supply again.  It arrived in a container barely larger than the 2 ml, so I doubt that it has twice the amount of serum since the containers are practically identical.</li>
            <li> I love my soap, and it was on time and you are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have grown very long and in some areas they had grown period! I love this product and would recommend it to everyone out there having no eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The box that contained this great product read &amp;#34; 4ml/6 month supply &amp;#34; but the applicator doesn&#x27;t show the same.  The 3 month and 6 month applicators are exact same size and left me wondering if indeed, it contained double the amount of the 3 month supply.  Because of this, when re-ordering this great product, I preferred to buy for 3 months and not 6. At one point I accidently  tore my lashes  with my eyelast curler.  After 2 weeks of healing, I decided to apply this product to that torn area and was shocked to see that lashes began to appear again.  I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product. It definitely took the expected two months to start seeing results but it&#x27;s worth the wait. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many others and plan to continue using it. I finally have eyelashes that I always wanted.</li>
            <li> It really makes the lashes grow and become luxuriant.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I had to trim my lashes! True story</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Great results. Exceeded my expectations. Will continue to purchase.</li>
