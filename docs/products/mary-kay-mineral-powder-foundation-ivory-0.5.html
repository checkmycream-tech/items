    <ol>
            <li>This Mary Kay variety is excellent.  </li>
            <li>however this matches my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>great product, just wish it came with a brush!</li>
            <li>Oh well - guess we can&#x27;t expect everything to be perfect!</li>
            <li>Try Merle Norman mineral makeup, it has EXCELLENT coverage, and blends beautifully.</li>
            <li>so this product works great for my skin.</li>
            <li>It has great coverage and is so weightless</li>
            <li>Great foundation and</li>
            <li>I am very fair and glad to find .5 Ivory shade.</li>
            <li>It lasts a good while too.</li>
            <li>The coverage is good -</li>
            <li>The powder formula is a good one, about on par with department store brands.  </li>
            <li>then this would probably be a good product for you.</li>
            <li>I love these mineral powder foundations!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this makeup!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Good coverage for a powder, goes on smooth and no clumping, good shine reducer.</li>
            <li>Mary Kay seems to be one of those companies you either love or hate--I myself have had nothing but good experiences with their products and prefer their foundation to just about anyone else.  </li>
            <li>Blends well and is very light.  </li>
            <li>I love Mary Kay mineral powder.</li>
            <li>Love this powder, stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I have been using this foundation from Mary Kay for a couple years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this foundation and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>the foundation faster than I would a liquid, but my skin looks better with this, so I&#x27;ll stick with this.</li>
            <li>The color of the liquid was better than the color of the mineral powder.</li>
            <li>I found it works much better as a mineral veil/setting powder.</li>
            <li>The powder sits on top of skin, and looks like peach-colored flour.</li>
            <li>Anything, ANYTHING is better than this crap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight, yet does a great job of evening</li>
            <li>I am really glad I did.</li>
            <li>Great texture and has a good matte finish, but doesn&#x27;t work any better than other brands I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>this is exactly the shade of my skin and it just looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like liquid makeup because it feels to heavy on my skin, but this powder is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I ordered this in too light a color for my complexion, I would have given it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>It provides great coverage and lasts bascially all day long.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this stuff the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>If you are super pale like me this Mary Kay foundation in ivory 0.5 is awesome.</li>
            <li>My order came quickly and also came with free samples.</li>
            <li>Been searching for a mineral powder foundation that didn&#x27;t cost a bajillion dollars and actually provided really good coverage, so I decided to take a gamble and try this Mary Kay Mineral Powder Foundation.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and really covers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like wearing make up, but since my skin is kind of not-so-great, Mary Kay actually makes my skin look nice, without the powdery, gritty feeling of having gunk on your face.</li>
            <li>Worth a try of course.</li>
            <li>I love this product because my T-zone gets oily toward the early afternoon.</li>
            <li>I was rather nervous with this shade (despite it being specifically recommended) but love how its color just melts right into my natural skin shade.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone, matches my skin tone great too, and got a great price way better then all these other expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other powders, and some have worked fairly well, but Mary Kay feels the smoothest on my skin.</li>
            <li>It melted right into my skin.</li>
            <li>It shipped pretty fast too!</li>
            <li>Definitely going to be buying more when my supply runs out.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>My face stopped breaking out as much as soon as I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>Otherwise, not so much</li>
            <li>Go and shell out a few more bucks to NOT look like a clown, I promise you, it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
            <li>If you have normal skin, not super prone to breakouts and just need on layer to kind of even your tone</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it, and was really excited to receive it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other powder foundations, but this one offers more coverage.</li>
            <li>It looks cakey even with just one fine layer (that doesn&#x27;t cover anything) and on top of that it breaks me out... which is unfortunate.</li>
            <li>I took a big chance with this because foundation powders never seem to come in a light enough shade for me</li>
            <li>It has a grainy consistency because this low quality garbage wasn&#x27;t sifted, making it feel exactly like grain flour.</li>
            <li>maybe i am just sensitive!</li>
            <li>it blends in  and doesn&#x27;t look all powdery like others.it looks natural.</li>
            <li>100% regret straying from my tried and true brands trying to experiment with something new and save myself a few dollars.</li>
            <li>tried this MK mineral makeup with three different types of high end kabuki brushes, and I STILL could not get this powder to blend.</li>
            <li>Or also Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but this can HARDLY be considered foundation.</li>
            <li>Just like bare minerals, only this doesn&#x27;t make my face break out!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love powder to begin with but its always difficult for me to find a shade that is not too dark on my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really difficult to find make up that matches my skin tone, since I&#x27;m really pale, and almost everything, even the lightest shades of most brands makes me feel like an oompa loompa</li>
            <li> This brand is so worthless and low quality, it can&#x27;t even be mixed with better makeup.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t cover much or blend well (even with an expensive brush and multiple layers)</li>
            <li> I do like the color of it, and it does look soft on your skin but the smell is very harsh!</li>
            <li> Other powders for me</li>
            <li> I am very pale and this is the only powder foundation that I can find to match my skin.</li>
            <li> Are these good reviews fake, or are you people who love this crap so inexperienced with mineral makeup, that you just don&#x27;t know the difference between crap and quality?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda messy through.</li>
            <li> There is very, very little coverage.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> no more oil!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money like I did!!!</li>
            <li> I feel make my skin dry, or I can just feel them on my face, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I have never in my life tried such a terrible mineral foundation, and you people are NUTS to recommend this.</li>
            <li> I told the MK rep that I hate mineral powders, but she insisted I try it.</li>
            <li> THANK GOD for mineral powder as I hate the feel of liquid make up on my face!</li>

            <li> I love these mineral powder foundations!  This Mary Kay variety is excellent.  Blends well and is very light.  It lasts a good while too.</li>
            <li> I love Mary Kay mineral powder. This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it, and was really excited to receive it again. I&#x27;ve tried other powders, and some have worked fairly well, but Mary Kay feels the smoothest on my skin. Other powders for me I feel make my skin dry, or I can just feel them on my face, which is annoying. It&#x27;s also really difficult to find make up that matches my skin tone, since I&#x27;m really pale, and almost everything, even the lightest shades of most brands makes me feel like an oompa loompa haha. I don&#x27;t like wearing make up, but since my skin is kind of not-so-great, Mary Kay actually makes my skin look nice, without the powdery, gritty feeling of having gunk on your face. Definitely would recommend  giving it a try!</li>
            <li> Love this powder, stays on all day. It&#x27;s kinda messy through.</li>
            <li> I love powder to begin with but its always difficult for me to find a shade that is not too dark on my skin however this matches my skin tone perfectly. My order came quickly and also came with free samples. Will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> great product, just wish it came with a brush!</li>
            <li> I have been using this foundation from Mary Kay for a couple years now and love it.  I don&#x27;t like liquid makeup because it feels to heavy on my skin, but this powder is wonderful.  It provides great coverage and lasts bascially all day long.  I don&#x27;t wear alot of makeup to begin with so this product works great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and this is the only powder foundation that I can find to match my skin. I love this foundation and will continue to buy it. Liquid foundation feels too oily on my skin, and this is lightweight. I don&#x27;t feel as though I am wearing makeup throughout the day. I&#x27;ve used other powder foundations, but this one offers more coverage. My only gripe is that I go though the foundation faster than I would a liquid, but my skin looks better with this, so I&#x27;ll stick with this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this makeup! My face stopped breaking out as much as soon as I started using this product. It shipped pretty fast too! I would definitely recommend(:</li>
            <li> Years ago I used to used Mary Kay liquid foundation. THANK GOD for mineral powder as I hate the feel of liquid make up on my face! The color of the liquid was better than the color of the mineral powder. Oh well - guess we can&#x27;t expect everything to be perfect! I will consider buying this again - possibly trying a different color. The coverage is good - so perhaps it&#x27;s a 5 Star rating for others.</li>
            <li> If you are super pale like me this Mary Kay foundation in ivory 0.5 is awesome. I took a big chance with this because foundation powders never seem to come in a light enough shade for me but this one did! I just wish it had an SPF in it.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but this can HARDLY be considered foundation. There is very, very little coverage. I found it works much better as a mineral veil/setting powder.</li>
            <li> Are these good reviews fake, or are you people who love this crap so inexperienced with mineral makeup, that you just don&#x27;t know the difference between crap and quality? Because ladies let me tell you; this is crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this MK mineral makeup with three different types of high end kabuki brushes, and I STILL could not get this powder to blend. The powder sits on top of skin, and looks like peach-colored flour. It has a grainy consistency because this low quality garbage wasn&#x27;t sifted, making it feel exactly like grain flour. It has almost ZERO coverage, to boot, and when it oxidizes, it turns to beige slime on your face. I have never in my life tried such a terrible mineral foundation, and you people are NUTS to recommend this. Go and shell out a few more bucks to NOT look like a clown, I promise you, it&#x27;ll be worth it. Try Merle Norman mineral makeup, it has EXCELLENT coverage, and blends beautifully. Or also Bare Minerals. Anything, ANYTHING is better than this crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I 100% regret straying from my tried and true brands trying to experiment with something new and save myself a few dollars. This brand is so worthless and low quality, it can&#x27;t even be mixed with better makeup. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money like I did!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this foundation for years.  It is very lightweight, yet does a great job of evening my skin tone.  I am very fair and glad to find .5 Ivory shade.</li>
            <li> Good coverage for a powder, goes on smooth and no clumping, good shine reducer. Evens skin tone and all of that.</li>
            <li> Great texture and has a good matte finish, but doesn&#x27;t work any better than other brands I&#x27;ve used.  Worth a try of course.</li>
            <li> I do like the color of it, and it does look soft on your skin but the smell is very harsh! I use a brush for my powder foundation and as i went to put it to my face i couldnt help but hold my breath as i put it on because it was hurting my nose and actually gave me a headache :/ maybe i am just sensitive!</li>
            <li> Just like bare minerals, only this doesn&#x27;t make my face break out! It&#x27;s way cheaper! I love this product because my T-zone gets oily toward the early afternoon. I touch up with this or the translucent powder and.... no more oil!</li>
            <li> Been searching for a mineral powder foundation that didn&#x27;t cost a bajillion dollars and actually provided really good coverage, so I decided to take a gamble and try this Mary Kay Mineral Powder Foundation. I am really glad I did. It has great coverage and is so weightless I don&#x27;t even know I&#x27;m wearing it. I have really oily skin and this helps cover up the shine without clogging pores or looking cakey. Definitely going to be buying more when my supply runs out.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this stuff the first time I tried it. I told the MK rep that I hate mineral powders, but she insisted I try it. It melted right into my skin. I bought her sampler on the spot and let her keep the one I ordered. I use this alone and I use it atop foundation. It never feels like I&#x27;m wearing anything.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay seems to be one of those companies you either love or hate--I myself have had nothing but good experiences with their products and prefer their foundation to just about anyone else.  In regards to this specific shade, well, I&#x27;ve finally given into the recommendation to go with a paler shade during the sunless winter months.  I was rather nervous with this shade (despite it being specifically recommended) but love how its color just melts right into my natural skin shade.  The powder formula is a good one, about on par with department store brands.  It seems you almost have to try to get that cakey look, and this stuff will last all day.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I ordered this in too light a color for my complexion, I would have given it 5 stars.  Goes on smooth and really covers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Great foundation and it blends well under my traditional foundation I use.  I would recommend this to everyone, matches my skin tone great too, and got a great price way better then all these other expensive brands.</li>
            <li> this is exactly the shade of my skin and it just looks amazing. it blends in  and doesn&#x27;t look all powdery like others.it looks natural.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t cover much or blend well (even with an expensive brush and multiple layers) It looks cakey even with just one fine layer (that doesn&#x27;t cover anything) and on top of that it breaks me out... which is unfortunate. Note that I have combination skin, am prone to breakouts, and have a lot of scarring. If you have normal skin, not super prone to breakouts and just need on layer to kind of even your tone then this would probably be a good product for you. Otherwise, not so much</li>
