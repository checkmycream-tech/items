A nail salon, business neighbor of mine, uses all OPI Brand Polish for their customers (they provide: pedicures, manicures, fake nails, artsy nail work ect...).  They had been telling me that The OPI Brand Polish&lt;br /&gt;is the best nail polish on the market.  With that knowledge, it was a no brain-er to purchase the polish via AMAZON.</li>
