            <li>I think Dentek makes the best floss pick out there</li>
            <li>These are the best floss picks I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Perfect angle and</li>
            <li>Incredibly flimsy.</li>
            <li>Great</li>

            <li>great taste, and usability</li>
            <li>Product is great quality.</li>
            <li>These are great flosses on the go</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>This 6 pack is an excellent deal, if you have space for buying 6 bags at a time :-)  </li>
            <li>strong floss, and cleans really good.</li>
            <li>Good price and easy for my family to use.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t break as easily and it glides nicely between teeth.</li>
            <li>I love these picks.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Easier to use than regular tape floss and at an excellent price.</li>
            <li>and i love the brand.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I was amazed how much better some floss picks were over others after I bought these.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Kids 4,6 &amp; 8 are flossing more often.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of these Dentek flossers for reviewing purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>If they are, you might need a more robust floss pick.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to jam your fingers in your mouth to floss, this is a pretty good alternative.</li>
            <li>Easy to use even for kids.</li>
            <li>so it fits between teeth fairly easily.</li>
            <li>The pick comes to fine point and not blunt... easy to go between teeth.</li>
            <li>They also taste good and clean better than regular floss because food catches better on this wider floss.</li>
            <li>These Dentek Comfort Clean Picks have a silky tape floss that slides between your teeth smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>I question if these are genuine or pirated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give zero stars if that option was available.</li>
            <li>clean teech earliy and confortable.</li>
            <li>My wife has bought several brands for me, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>QUICK DELIVERY</li>
            <li>Great for teeth with tight spaces more gentle on the gum</li>
            <li>So it really is a &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; floss in that it is easy on the gums.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried DenTek Comfort Clean floss picks</li>
            <li>Nice mint flavor, does not get stuck like regular floss.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the gums and easy grip.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy yet gentle.</li>
            <li>I have place three different orders of this product the first and the last one were great.</li>
            <li>It is flatter and &amp;#34;more slippery&amp;#34;, for lack of a better description, than those generic floss picks.</li>
            <li>OK, no big deal.  </li>
            <li>The first one I used, the floss broke away from the holder.  </li>
            <li>They work good and don&#x27;t get stuck between tight teeth as much as others</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra money over the cheap generics.</li>
            <li>With the good quality pack I use one pick per flossing, but with the low quality one I was probably averaging 1.5 picks throughout the bag (some time I would have to use 2, and sometimes only 1).</li>
            <li>They really make it quite easy to floss your teeth and not so much a chore as it can sometimes be with regular dental floss.</li>
            <li>They work really well for my tight teeth and feel nice.</li>
            <li>I really really like these floss</li>
            <li>Really like the floss picks.</li>
            <li>these are my favorite flossers, after trying other kinds/brands.</li>
            <li>stopped use any other floss anymore:)</li>
            <li>cant live without them!</li>
            <li>The floss is comparable to the thickness of your normal string floss</li>
            <li>In the first bag of blue ones, I&#x27;d day a dozen broke.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the second bag, the first 5 broke.  </li>
            <li>Most picks are either extra thick for more strength, or bordering on razor wire for a strong thin pick.</li>
            <li>The pick end is too fine, resulting in them bending, or breaking after a little use</li>
            <li>The middle one was a much lower quality and the floss kept stretching a break during use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are the thick white floss kind.</li>
            <li>The floss strips pull loose from the plastic holder much too easily, often before I&#x27;ve finished flossing one round of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Teeth I have always had trouble getting between with the generics were suddenly easily accessible to get between with these Denteks.</li>
            <li>The company should consider removing this product or making the floss strong and tight enough to be held there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using only DenTek picks for the past 2 years, they are the most easy to use (for me at least) and don&#x27;t hurt your teeth.</li>
            <li>I am not sure that what I received was genuine.  </li>
            <li>The flosser was sturdy yet soft enough for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>These dental picks are great if you have tight teeth that are difficult to floss with regular dental floss.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used various cheap generic floss picks from Walmart and CVS over the years, all with that green stringy floss that unravels and breaks and is difficult to get between teeth that are very close</li>
            <li> My only complaint about the product is that the quality has not been consistent.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than regular dental floss and wastes a lot less time.</li>
            <li> not too hard, gentle on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> pointed enough to go between teeth like a pick and has floss at the other end.</li>
            <li> And I have not had the floss break or come loose in the Denteks yet.  </li>
            <li> Prefers this specific Dentek because it does not shred between tight teeth.</li>
            <li> At that rate, I am certainly not saving money on this deal.  </li>
            <li> Have to use 4 to do what 1 of other brands would do.  </li>
            <li> the floss strand is stronger than other brands/styles.</li>
            <li> Unless your teeth are hugging each other for dear life, there should be no problem.</li>
            <li> the floss doesn&#x27;t break or fall off like other brands.</li>
            <li> Has a slight minty taste when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slight mint flavor to them as well that can help you freshen your breath a little bit.</li>
            <li> And the pick was small enough to get even hard to reach places when needed.</li>
            <li> Now that I am well into the second bag, I figure about 25% of them have broken.  </li>
            <li> This are made for very tight teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have very little space between my teeth</li>
            <li> They can be expensive at the local markets.</li>
            <li> I started using this after having a hard time flossing, it works well for me</li>
            <li> The floss is very loosely held and its difficult to floss two or three teeth and the thread is gone.</li>
            <li> Although sometimes you get a batch of these that have really weak attachment points, so the floss breaks off the pick almost immediately...</li>
            <li> so I need the glossy, thin floss.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these picks. I&#x27;ve been using only DenTek picks for the past 2 years, they are the most easy to use (for me at least) and don&#x27;t hurt your teeth. Although sometimes you get a batch of these that have really weak attachment points, so the floss breaks off the pick almost immediately...I use about 3-4 picks every time.</li>
            <li> Bought a pack of this from Target. The floss is very loosely held and its difficult to floss two or three teeth and the thread is gone. I would not recommend buying this product. The company should consider removing this product or making the floss strong and tight enough to be held there.</li>
            <li> Great but floss has yellowish residue perhaps from the mint coating?</li>
            <li> Great for teeth with tight spaces more gentle on the gum</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! QUICK DELIVERY</li>
            <li> I have very little space between my teeth so I need the glossy, thin floss.  These work perfectly and are so convenient.</li>
            <li> This 6 pack is an excellent deal, if you have space for buying 6 bags at a time :-)  these are my favorite flossers, after trying other kinds/brands.</li>
            <li> Great price on these floss picks. I use them every day. Love them.</li>
            <li> I buy in bulk to save money.  This are made for very tight teeth.  They can be expensive at the local markets.</li>
            <li> These dental picks are great if you have tight teeth that are difficult to floss with regular dental floss. These Dentek Comfort Clean Picks have a silky tape floss that slides between your teeth smoothly and easily. They really make it quite easy to floss your teeth and not so much a chore as it can sometimes be with regular dental floss. There&#x27;s a slight mint flavor to them as well that can help you freshen your breath a little bit.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Can&#x27;t ever do without them!</li>
            <li> my fav floss! cant live without them! not too hard, gentle on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Easier to use than regular tape floss and at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> I started using this after having a hard time flossing, it works well for me and i love the brand.&lt;br /&gt;Very strong floss, and cleans really good.</li>
            <li> I really really like these floss picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are 150 picks a pack. And there are 6 packs total. Should last quite a while..&lt;br /&gt;They are the thick white floss kind. Very gentle on the gums and easy grip.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy yet gentle.</li>
            <li> The floss strips pull loose from the plastic holder much too easily, often before I&#x27;ve finished flossing one round of my teeth.  The pick end is too fine, resulting in them bending, or breaking after a little use and I would have preferred that the pick not have bumps.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how much better some floss picks were over others after I bought these. I&#x27;ve used various cheap generic floss picks from Walmart and CVS over the years, all with that green stringy floss that unravels and breaks and is difficult to get between teeth that are very close together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Dentek picks use a different type of floss it seems. It is flatter and &amp;#34;more slippery&amp;#34;, for lack of a better description, than those generic floss picks. Teeth I have always had trouble getting between with the generics were suddenly easily accessible to get between with these Denteks. And I have not had the floss break or come loose in the Denteks yet.  Definitely worth the extra money over the cheap generics.</li>
            <li> love it. stopped use any other floss anymore:) clean teech earliy and confortable. reach any placees and never been a problem</li>
            <li> Same product that I used to get from Walmart! The price is the same, too, making this purchase a no-brainer if you already use these and don&#x27;t want to drive to the store!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who haven&#x27;t used these, they have a flat piece of floss which I find easier to slip between my teeth. They also taste good and clean better than regular floss because food catches better on this wider floss.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than regular dental floss and wastes a lot less time.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that what I received was genuine.  I had been buying these at the drugstore for several years.  For convenience, I bought these in bulk from Amazon.  What I had gotten in the drugstore were white; the ones I got on Amazon were blue.  OK, no big deal.  The first one I used, the floss broke away from the holder.  Of all the ones I bought at the drugstore over the years, only one or two broke.  In the first bag of blue ones, I&#x27;d day a dozen broke.  When I opened the second bag, the first 5 broke.  Now that I am well into the second bag, I figure about 25% of them have broken.  At that rate, I am certainly not saving money on this deal.  I question if these are genuine or pirated.</li>
            <li> pointed enough to go between teeth like a pick and has floss at the other end. use it every day, sometimes teice</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product.  Prefers this specific Dentek because it does not shred between tight teeth.</li>
            <li> great taste, and usability</li>
            <li> Easy to use even for kids.</li>
            <li> They work good and don&#x27;t get stuck between tight teeth as much as others</li>
            <li> I like the product. The floss is comparable to the thickness of your normal string floss so it fits between teeth fairly easily. Most picks are either extra thick for more strength, or bordering on razor wire for a strong thin pick. So it really is a &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; floss in that it is easy on the gums. My only complaint about the product is that the quality has not been consistent. I have place three different orders of this product the first and the last one were great. The middle one was a much lower quality and the floss kept stretching a break during use. With the good quality pack I use one pick per flossing, but with the low quality one I was probably averaging 1.5 picks throughout the bag (some time I would have to use 2, and sometimes only 1). I am hoping the issue was only a one time occurrence, and at this time recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Good price and easy for my family to use. Kids 4,6 &amp; 8 are flossing more often. Will buy these again.</li>
            <li> Product is great quality. Floss does not easly break. The pick comes to fine point and not blunt... easy to go between teeth.</li>
            <li> My wife has bought several brands for me, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Incredibly flimsy. Have to use 4 to do what 1 of other brands would do.  I&#x27;d give zero stars if that option was available. Beware.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried DenTek Comfort Clean floss picks and I thought they were great! The flosser was sturdy yet soft enough for sensitive gums. And the pick was small enough to get even hard to reach places when needed. I&#x27;ve even started carrying a couple of these in my purse just in case. I received a free sample of these Dentek flossers for reviewing purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Really like the floss picks. They work really well for my tight teeth and feel nice. Regular floss or floss picks feel kinda funky.</li>
            <li> I think Dentek makes the best floss pick out there, it doesn&#x27;t break as easily and it glides nicely between teeth.</li>
            <li> Minty taste and the floss strand is stronger than other brands/styles. Everyone in our family from 5 years-30+ years uses these daily.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to jam your fingers in your mouth to floss, this is a pretty good alternative. Unless your teeth are hugging each other for dear life, there should be no problem. If they are, you might need a more robust floss pick.</li>
            <li> Nice mint flavor, does not get stuck like regular floss.</li>
            <li> These are the best floss picks I&#x27;ve used. Perfect angle and the floss doesn&#x27;t break or fall off like other brands. Has a slight minty taste when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> These are great flosses on the go</li>
