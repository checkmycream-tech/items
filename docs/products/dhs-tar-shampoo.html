            <li>It lathers really nicely; I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I found it to be one of the mildest yet effective dandruff shampoos I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This DHS Shampoo is as good as or better than any of them.  </li>
            <li>Good for my fine hair that needs body WITHOUT gooey conditioners.</li>
            <li>Both shampoos do an excellent job of washing my hair, but this coal tar version has completely cured the scamp buildup problems that I was experiencing.  </li>
            <li>This DHS Tar Shampoo helps control Dandruff easy!</li>
            <li>My scalp and hair haven&#x27;t been this healthy in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As with most anything I guess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands of anti-dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>I went to a doctor, and i will be needing to take medacine to get rid of it, so its not something a shampoo was going to be able to fix anyway.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you use your conditioner twice</li>
            <li>Felt better and 50% improvement within 2 days using this.</li>
            <li>I had used so many shampoos but nothing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most shampoos, both over the counter and by prescription.  </li>
            <li>did use most of it just for the sake of</li>
            <li>Excellent Product Overall!!!</li>
            <li>It is ok</li>
            <li>Now I just shampoo with DHS to maintain my healthy scalp.</li>
            <li>Many tar products are now unavailable.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products for my scalp condition and NONE work a well as this product does for me.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li>and the results are very significant.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly IT WORKS.  </li>
            <li>My old shampoo was discontinued but this one has helped me a great deal and I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>The most important factor is that my scalp is void of psoriatic plaques after using DHS Tar Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find a truly clean shampoo.</li>
            <li>I got very lucky in my choice to try DHS.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you smell the lather on your hands while in the shower you will get a semi strong smell, but once you wash your head and hands off</li>
            <li>The samples worked fine as a shampoo</li>
            <li>Huge flakes, every day.</li>
            <li>Items was smoothly shipped.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Product.</li>
            <li>but I still had some light flaking.</li>
            <li>Is not fragrance free, irritated my scalp</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints I assume it was good.</li>
            <li>It has definately helped with my dry scalp issue and thats pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really works!!!  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it had \\&quot;decent\\&quot; reviews, a pretty good mix of them actually, so i thought i would give it a shot and make up my own mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But since I have been using DHS Tar Shampoo my scalp problem has improved significantly.</li>
            <li>Maybe a higher percentage of coal tar would be better.</li>
            <li>Love the product which impress me on the first time.</li>
            <li>Excellent shampoo, no more itching scalp</li>
            <li>It was originally recommended by a dermatologist and I find it satisfsctory.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any significant improvement and</li>
            <li>it is gone, and you left with nice clean smell free hair :)</li>
            <li>but they should offer a better deal for us that really needed like a 20oz bottle for 12bucks cus</li>
            <li>Good shampoo initially but just like everything else</li>
            <li>Its very good on your hair .. feels soft after u blow dry and easy to style.............</li>
            <li>It addresses a ,now, mild case of psoriasis, and does not leave his hair discolored.</li>
            <li>This is an ok product but in my opinion not any better than the high end drug store brand, which is still considerably cheaper than DHS.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really works!!</li>
            <li>Try this first!  </li>
            <li>This non-scented shampoo smells exactly like gasoline!</li>
            <li>I use it about 3-4 times a week for the first bottle to get rid of it and it cleared it up!</li>
            <li>I have developed severely itching scalp after many years of using fragrance-free shampoos.  </li>
            <li>But if needed, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is interesting / frustrating that there don&#x27;t seem to be any fragrance free shampoos that contain Zinc Pyrithione, but this fragrance free coal tar shampoo is easily found!  </li>
            <li>now my scalp is getting itchy as hell right now</li>
            <li>Of course, it has a smell - not of gasoline exactly, but of coal tar, which anyone who has ridden a train pulled by a coal burning locomotive will distinctly remember.  </li>
            <li>Nice to to find a good basic shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make your hair limp &amp; draggy.  </li>
            <li>So far so good...keep my melon free of flakes.</li>
            <li>One of the biggest things I have noticed since using this is I dont have white flakes in my hair at all any more.  </li>
            <li>After the first time using DHS Tar Shampoo this all stopped.</li>
            <li>this shampoo no longer removes it as it did at first.</li>
            <li>ok i finish my first bottle last week and it took like a whole week to work on my scalp</li>
            <li>Really good shampoo, its the only one I have used for the last month or so,</li>
            <li>Have not used long enough for a good review.</li>
            <li>I would scartch and get large clumps and end up with a sore scalp.</li>
            <li>the best product for your daily shower, help me with my skin, I have a very dry skin and this product help me to back to a normal skin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s helping me</li>
            <li>would recommend this shampoo for anyone that needs shampoo for smelly scalp, because she has so much oil</li>
            <li>An after shampoo product, used on my ends only, helps with dryness, and keeps my scalp free to heal.</li>
            <li>About ready to give up I found this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and it worked very well after one use.  </li>
            <li>My high dollar dermatologist prescribed this over the counter treatment!</li>
            <li>Really helps with my skin condition.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend you buy the scented one!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful product.</li>
            <li>Stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s service in getting it to me was very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>Thanks...   JN</li>
            <li>my husband and son uses this .. it really works</li>
            <li>All I can say is that this product works very well</li>
            <li>This shampoo is as effective but not as harsh on my SB.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can wear black again without worrying about looking like I&#x27;ve been in a snow storm.</li>
            <li>Particularly for my scalp</li>
            <li>Now I feel great and no more dry itchy, flaky scalp.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY, IT DOES THE JOB</li>
            <li>I recommend the product highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it, but just know that you will probably want to shampoo and condition with another shampoo afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this coal tar shampoo is not that strong, and it quickly dissipates, so it is hardly a problem, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my wife at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, which is the best that can ever be said about coal tar shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t buy this locally, my Doc recommended it to me and he was right.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 3 months now, and for the first time in recent years I have zero, no, none</li>
            <li>first tar shampoo that actually did</li>
            <li>will definitely be sticking with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree oil series way much better/healthier and nicer results!</li>
            <li>Even though I followed the directions exactly as described on the label and have used it several times the DHS shampoo didn&#x27;t help with my psoriasis one bit.</li>
            <li>Smells and looks like tar, but the smell goes away and is a small price to pay for a clear and healthy scalp.</li>
            <li>It may help clear the dandruff</li>
            <li>It even helped clear up my face a bit.  </li>
            <li>As far assisting with the lump, nope didnt work.  </li>
            <li>Cleared my dandruff completely.</li>
            <li>I bought it and it has totally fixed my problem.</li>
            <li>so  far,</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to synthetic odorants or aroma compounds - then this is the shampoo for you.</li>
            <li>USED IT FOR YEARS AND DOES RELIEVE THE SCALP SOMEWHAT, BUT EVENTUALLY YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR TO GET COMPLETE RELIEF.</li>
            <li>After years of scalp psoriasis with burning &amp; itching that was nearly unbearable, this product worked.</li>
            <li>my problem may be different, this didn&#x27;t help me much, it did work for my cousin and her mother though...</li>
            <li>And it has completely cured my dandruffs.</li>
            <li>This shampoo appears comparable to other tar shampoos I&#x27;ve used, many of which were more expensive.</li>
            <li>If one has itching and skin irritation caused by conditions such as dandruff, then it&#x27;s highly recommended here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one other tar shampoo (Denorex Therapeutic, which apparently isn&#x27;t available for purchase right now) in the past</li>
            <li>but I only use it on my scalp so I can live with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To begin with the smell of the tar is so strong that it already turns you negative towards the product</li>
            <li>shampoo scrub with it first then wash it out and then use regular shampoo and conditioner so your scalp doesnt dry out from the tar shampoo or smell like it either.</li>
            <li>He gets nervous when he notices the bottle only half full.</li>
            <li>It was highly recommended to me by the dermatologist two years ago due to my sensitive scalp and this stuff works.  </li>
            <li>So I now know for certain that this shampoo works extremely well for me</li>
            <li>but it left my hair dry and very brittle.</li>
            <li>product does not dry out the scalp or the hair, and does not smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>

            <li> This is an ok product but in my opinion not any better than the high end drug store brand, which is still considerably cheaper than DHS.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo really works!!</li>
            <li> Try this first!  </li>
            <li> This non-scented shampoo smells exactly like gasoline!</li>
            <li> I use it about 3-4 times a week for the first bottle to get rid of it and it cleared it up!</li>
            <li> I have developed severely itching scalp after many years of using fragrance-free shampoos.  </li>
            <li> But if needed, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is interesting / frustrating that there don&#x27;t seem to be any fragrance free shampoos that contain Zinc Pyrithione, but this fragrance free coal tar shampoo is easily found!  </li>
            <li> now my scalp is getting itchy as hell right now</li>
            <li> Of course, it has a smell - not of gasoline exactly, but of coal tar, which anyone who has ridden a train pulled by a coal burning locomotive will distinctly remember.  </li>
            <li> Nice to to find a good basic shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make your hair limp &amp; draggy.  </li>
            <li> So far so good...keep my melon free of flakes.</li>
            <li> One of the biggest things I have noticed since using this is I dont have white flakes in my hair at all any more.  </li>
            <li> After the first time using DHS Tar Shampoo this all stopped.</li>
            <li> this shampoo no longer removes it as it did at first.</li>
            <li> ok i finish my first bottle last week and it took like a whole week to work on my scalp</li>
            <li> Really good shampoo, its the only one I have used for the last month or so,</li>
            <li> Have not used long enough for a good review.</li>
            <li> I would scartch and get large clumps and end up with a sore scalp.</li>
            <li> the best product for your daily shower, help me with my skin, I have a very dry skin and this product help me to back to a normal skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s helping me</li>
            <li> would recommend this shampoo for anyone that needs shampoo for smelly scalp, because she has so much oil</li>
            <li> An after shampoo product, used on my ends only, helps with dryness, and keeps my scalp free to heal.</li>
            <li> About ready to give up I found this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and it worked very well after one use.  </li>
            <li> My high dollar dermatologist prescribed this over the counter treatment!</li>
            <li> Really helps with my skin condition.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend you buy the scented one!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful product.</li>
            <li> Stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s service in getting it to me was very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> Thanks...   JN</li>
            <li> my husband and son uses this .. it really works</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this product works very well</li>
            <li> This shampoo is as effective but not as harsh on my SB.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can wear black again without worrying about looking like I&#x27;ve been in a snow storm.</li>
            <li> Particularly for my scalp</li>
            <li> Now I feel great and no more dry itchy, flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY, IT DOES THE JOB</li>
            <li> I recommend the product highly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it, but just know that you will probably want to shampoo and condition with another shampoo afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this coal tar shampoo is not that strong, and it quickly dissipates, so it is hardly a problem, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my wife at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, which is the best that can ever be said about coal tar shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t buy this locally, my Doc recommended it to me and he was right.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 months now, and for the first time in recent years I have zero, no, none</li>
            <li> first tar shampoo that actually did</li>
            <li> will definitely be sticking with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree oil series way much better/healthier and nicer results!</li>
            <li> Even though I followed the directions exactly as described on the label and have used it several times the DHS shampoo didn&#x27;t help with my psoriasis one bit.</li>
            <li> Smells and looks like tar, but the smell goes away and is a small price to pay for a clear and healthy scalp.</li>
            <li> It may help clear the dandruff</li>
            <li> It even helped clear up my face a bit.  </li>
            <li> As far assisting with the lump, nope didnt work.  </li>
            <li> Cleared my dandruff completely.</li>
            <li> I bought it and it has totally fixed my problem.</li>
            <li> so  far,</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to synthetic odorants or aroma compounds - then this is the shampoo for you.</li>
            <li> USED IT FOR YEARS AND DOES RELIEVE THE SCALP SOMEWHAT, BUT EVENTUALLY YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR TO GET COMPLETE RELIEF.</li>
            <li> After years of scalp psoriasis with burning &amp; itching that was nearly unbearable, this product worked.</li>
            <li> my problem may be different, this didn&#x27;t help me much, it did work for my cousin and her mother though...</li>
            <li> And it has completely cured my dandruffs.</li>
            <li> This shampoo appears comparable to other tar shampoos I&#x27;ve used, many of which were more expensive.</li>
            <li> If one has itching and skin irritation caused by conditions such as dandruff, then it&#x27;s highly recommended here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one other tar shampoo (Denorex Therapeutic, which apparently isn&#x27;t available for purchase right now) in the past</li>
            <li> but I only use it on my scalp so I can live with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To begin with the smell of the tar is so strong that it already turns you negative towards the product</li>
            <li> shampoo scrub with it first then wash it out and then use regular shampoo and conditioner so your scalp doesnt dry out from the tar shampoo or smell like it either.</li>
            <li> He gets nervous when he notices the bottle only half full.</li>
            <li> It was highly recommended to me by the dermatologist two years ago due to my sensitive scalp and this stuff works.  </li>
            <li> So I now know for certain that this shampoo works extremely well for me</li>
            <li> but it left my hair dry and very brittle.</li>
            <li> product does not dry out the scalp or the hair, and does not smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Both DHS shampoos have a higher concentration of active ingredients than other over the counter types which I attribute to their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, read the directions, use it now twice a week, and on other days the clear version of the same brand.  </li>
            <li> It just made my hair extra dry and gave me split</li>
            <li> Really strong smell which is unfortunate since it leaked in the box.  </li>
            <li> My suggestion is to use that with a normal conditioner because it leave your hair a little bit dry.</li>
            <li> In fact, it is suspiciously similar to the drug store item and has the same amount of the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Purchased the wrong one, should have purchased the fragrance free.</li>
            <li> But I was at a point that I didnt care what it smelled like as long as it worked</li>
            <li> This shampoo has long helped me when an itching scalp becomes unbearable.  </li>
            <li> I am a life long costumer of this brand</li>
            <li> I have a patch of scalp psoriasis that is usually very itchy and produces thick flakes of skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE TRIED OTHER SHAMPOOS IN THE PAST, BUT NOTHING REALLY WORKED FOR MY PSORIASIS</li>
            <li> From various Head and Shoulders to other &amp;#34;tar&amp;#34; type products.  </li>
            <li> the bottle only last me like 3 weeks its so little.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this product will definately help with your dandruff / dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not stripping her hair so that it&#x27;s completely dry</li>
            <li> Yes, does dry out hair</li>
            <li> also have problems with dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I had a horribly dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Work so far, shampoo has a stronger than usual coal tar smell compared to Neutrogena, but for it&#x27;s effectiveness you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I had terrible dry flaky scalp for many years and within days of buying the first bottle and using the product, my problems disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Like I have short hair, but I can nail my scalp and see nothing fall in front of my eyes, where previous to using this I would.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it (occasionally) over a period of years and find it is consistently the same--effective and expensive.  </li>
            <li> very red and a little bit swollen.  </li>
            <li> We have tried a few different shampoos, and nothing lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I use this every few days prior to shampooing with a salon shampoo.  </li>
            <li> so I looked online to see what other types DHS had and found this tar</li>
            <li> My husband has not found any other product that works for him.</li>
            <li> However, once it&#x27;s out of the hair, you can&#x27;t smell it or any of the other smells anymore.</li>
            <li> Not many of us left, I guess ...&lt;</li>
            <li> The other products just work to unknot my hair.</li>
            <li> My dry, flaking scalp issues are virtually gone!!!</li>
            <li> I can even wear dark clothing, which is something that people with scalp psoriasis would appreciate.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that it didn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick enough that no one can see them, but the itch is always there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several different dandruff shampoos and then moved on to selsun blue medicated (the highest potency) and still my dandruff was getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> After a week I noticed less itching and irritation.</li>
            <li> I have allergic/ dermatitis and my scalp was a mess.</li>
            <li> only down side is that the smell of the shampoo is not great.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked in as little as 2-3 uses.</li>
            <li> and I use a little coconut hair oil to help moisturize as it dries out the scalp a bit.</li>
            <li> but it looks like it helped my scalp psoriasis a little.  </li>
            <li> As I said, it is weird that you can&#x27;t buy a fragrance-free Zinc shampoo, as the pure Zinc solution has hardly any smell at all.  </li>
            <li> dried my hair out a little bit but did its job.</li>
            <li> It seems that the only coal tar shampoos available in pharmacies don&#x27;t work well and are horrible for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well I got this lump/bald spot on my head, and it didnt go away for a few months.  </li>
            <li> Now I keep it at bay and use it once ever few months if I see a sign of it returning.</li>
            <li> It did not go to waste, gave to a friend who uses the fragrance one</li>
            <li> Is not too harsh and results are immediate.</li>
            <li> The smell takes a bit of time to get used to, but after a few washes, you don&#x27;t even notice anymore.  </li>
            <li> honestly for me the WORST feeling was the sliminess on my body that just made me want to vomit!</li>
            <li> but, once I dried my hair I noticed no lingering odor.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness it is fragrance free - nearly impossible to find!</li>
            <li> no strong odor</li>
            <li> plus you spent a ridiculous amount of money</li>
            <li> It smells pretty bad</li>
            <li> Usually when I find one that I like, it gets taken off the market.  </li>
            <li> A Hypo-allergic shampoo/conditioner combo purchased from Sallys was actually making it worse!</li>
            <li> No more itching</li>
            <li> Since I am unable to find it in my local stores I routinely order it thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was prescribed this by my dermatologist and since its hard to get an appointment with him, I ordered it here.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a month and the results are unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this produce to to anyone with serious dandruff problems.</li>
            <li> My wife is severely chemically sensitive, especially to artificial fragrances, and what they put in most shampoos are some of the worst things for her.  </li>
            <li> and I have not received any complaints that my head stinks, and it really doesnt smell that bad.  </li>
            <li> I was an infected poor</li>
            <li> I had bad dandruff and all the other shampoos</li>
            <li> it stinks</li>
            <li> My dandruff was really really bad.</li>
            <li> I had psoriasis so bad that my Derm referred me to this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by my dermatologist because I have some bad dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the tar scent is that bad......</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell that bad.</li>
            <li> so disappointed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sensation on your hair is horrible, it does not lather up almost at all, thus leaving you with a feeling that you did not wash your hair to begin with.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it stinks but it works</li>
            <li> I think the smell is just unavoidable with this medicine,  but it works.</li>
            <li> It may help clear the dandruff but it left my hair dry and very brittle.</li>
            <li> Good for my fine hair that needs body WITHOUT gooey conditioners. Nice to to find a good basic shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make your hair limp &amp; draggy.  If I want conditioners I&#x27;d add my own.  Glad to find a truly clean shampoo.</li>
            <li> Items was smoothly shipped. Products are very effective for my hair. This DHS Tar Shampoo helps control Dandruff easy! This is grate items!</li>
            <li> I RECONMEND THIS SHAMPOO HIGHLY, IT DOES THE JOB WELL. IF YOU HAVE ITCHY SCALP OR PSORIASIS THIS SHAMPOO IS FOR YOU. I&#x27;VE TRIED OTHER SHAMPOOS IN THE PAST, BUT NOTHING REALLY WORKED FOR MY PSORIASIS UNTIL I FOUND DHS TAR SHAMPOO.IT&#x27;S REALLY GOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my scalp, which means I get itchy sores on my scalp.  My hair is thick enough that no one can see them, but the itch is always there.  I have tried every coal tar shampoo I can find.  Usually when I find one that I like, it gets taken off the market.  It seems that the only coal tar shampoos available in pharmacies don&#x27;t work well and are horrible for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In desperation, I went online to see what I could find.  I got very lucky in my choice to try DHS.  It lathers really nicely; I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, which is the best that can ever be said about coal tar shampoo.  Most importantly IT WORKS.  My scalp and hair haven&#x27;t been this healthy in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a convert. This is my shampoo from now on. Please, please, please don&#x27;t stop producing it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works but must be used regularly. As with most anything I guess. Was recommended by my dermatologist and he has had good reviews from his patients</li>
            <li> It WORKS !!!  I&#x27;ve tried many brands of anti-dandruff shampoos. From various Head and Shoulders to other &amp;#34;tar&amp;#34; type products.  Some seemed to work for a short time (weeks) then flakes came back like snow.  I was following all the instructions, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist&#x27;s office had samples of the DHS shampoo in a &amp;#34;Clear&amp;#34; version. I had never heard of the brand. The samples worked fine as a shampoo so I looked online to see what other types DHS had and found this tar shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, read the directions, use it now twice a week, and on other days the clear version of the same brand.  It&#x27;s been about 3 months now, and for the first time in recent years I have zero, no, none, zilch evidence of flaking.</li>
            <li> Well I have recently purchased my second bottle of DHS Tar Shampoo.  I had terrible dry flaky scalp for many years and within days of buying the first bottle and using the product, my problems disappeared.  The first bottle lasted five months, I only would use small amounts two or three times a week.  After running out of the shampoo, the flaky and itchy scalp returned after a couple weeks.  So I now know for certain that this shampoo works extremely well for me and I hope it works as well for others with the same problem.</li>
            <li> So far so good...keep my melon free of flakes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fought psoriasis for years.  My old shampoo was discontinued but this one has helped me a great deal and I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s helping me but I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> well I got this lump/bald spot on my head, and it didnt go away for a few months.  I was washing my head daily, and was told to try a coal shampoo as it might help.  So I found this one, and decided to give it a try.  One of the biggest things I have noticed since using this is I dont have white flakes in my hair at all any more.  Like I have short hair, but I can nail my scalp and see nothing fall in front of my eyes, where previous to using this I would.  It has definately helped with my dry scalp issue and thats pretty awesome.  As far assisting with the lump, nope didnt work.  I went to a doctor, and i will be needing to take medacine to get rid of it, so its not something a shampoo was going to be able to fix anyway.  I was an infected poor I guess.    Anyway, this product will definately help with your dandruff / dry scalp.  It even helped clear up my face a bit.  Really good shampoo, its the only one I have used for the last month or so, and I have not received any complaints that my head stinks, and it really doesnt smell that bad.  Maybe if you smell the lather on your hands while in the shower you will get a semi strong smell, but once you wash your head and hands off it is gone, and you left with nice clean smell free hair :)</li>
            <li> This product is the only one works on my skin. My suggestion is to use that with a normal conditioner because it leave your hair a little bit dry. But despite that, it works.</li>
            <li> I already tried the shampoo made by this company that has zinc on it.  But it left my seborrheic dermatitis (SD) very red and a little bit swollen.  This shampoo is as effective but not as harsh on my SB.  It stopped the flakiness within a week and the redness is almost gone after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> My husband has not found any other product that works for him. He gets nervous when he notices the bottle only half full. I recommend the product highly.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and have tried numerous medicated,OTC shampoos with no improvement. But since I have been using DHS Tar Shampoo my scalp problem has improved significantly. I have only used the product for a month but I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great in my daughters hair. She is on a cocktail of medicines and vitamins for her ADHD, because of this her scalp is extra oily and smelly. We have tried a few different shampoos, and nothing lasted all day. I looked up Tar shampoos on Amazon and this one had great reviews for smelly scalp so we decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shampoo for anyone that needs shampoo for smelly scalp, because she has so much oil it&#x27;s not stripping her hair so that it&#x27;s completely dry either.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that the smell of the shampoo is not great. However, once it&#x27;s out of the hair, you can&#x27;t smell it or any of the other smells anymore. We use Jason&#x27;s Tea Tree Conditioner twice a week with this in her hair, and it&#x27;s been going great.</li>
            <li> I had bad dandruff and all the other shampoos did not work. I would scartch and get large clumps and end up with a sore scalp. This shampoo worked in as little as 2-3 uses. I saw results even with one use! Just make sure you use your conditioner twice and I use a little coconut hair oil to help moisturize as it dries out the scalp a bit. Now I keep it at bay and use it once ever few months if I see a sign of it returning. This product changed my life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent for my type of hair. Particularly for my scalp it&#x27;s good. If one has itching and skin irritation caused by conditions such as dandruff, then it&#x27;s highly recommended here.</li>
            <li> This product line recommended by my Dermatologist, and could not find it locally, so ordered from Amazon. I have used it 5 days now and cannot believe how well its working. I have allergic/ dermatitis and my scalp was a mess.A Hypo-allergic shampoo/conditioner combo purchased from Sallys was actually making it worse! Felt better and 50% improvement within 2 days using this. Yes, does dry out hair but if you need for a specific condition,I recommend.Was soothing and lathers well. An after shampoo product, used on my ends only, helps with dryness, and keeps my scalp free to heal.</li>
            <li> the best product for your daily shower, help me with my skin, I have a very dry skin and this product help me to back to a normal skin.</li>
            <li> Purchased the wrong one, should have purchased the fragrance free. It did not go to waste, gave to a friend who uses the fragrance one</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my head and this has worked for me. I started using it about 3 times a week and it has gotten rid of the patches. I haven&#x27;t seen any flakes on my shirt and it doesn&#x27;t itch anymore (even when i&#x27;m stressed out) this product has met my expectations. I will purchase it again.  it smells like tar but I only use it on my scalp so I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I had a Seborrheic Dermatitis (self diagnosed)  This product seems to be getting it under control.  I have been using it now for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Worked only about a week then my scalp started to scale again. Maybe a higher percentage of coal tar would be better.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was one of several on my dermatologist list,which was prepared for my allergies.I found it to be one of the mildest yet effective dandruff shampoos I have ever used.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got scalp problems this is your answer. Smells and looks like tar, but the smell goes away and is a small price to pay for a clear and healthy scalp.</li>
            <li> i know its not amazons fault, but this didnt work for me at all an i was faithful with it till it was gone. scalp psoriasis suks an i about give up on it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t buy this locally, my Doc recommended it to me and he was right. Great product.</li>
            <li> It works well to heal dandruff. dried my hair out a little bit but did its job. good for flare ups.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Cleared my dandruff completely. My dandruff was really really bad. I had used so many shampoos but nothing had worked like this before.</li>
            <li> This shampoo appears comparable to other tar shampoos I&#x27;ve used, many of which were more expensive. It is a good buy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works!! My psoriasis was getting to the point of embarrassment. I was put in antibiotics, didn&#x27;t work, was put on a medicated shampoo and nothing. About ready to give up I found this shampoo. Have been using it for a month and the results are unbelievable! Totally recommended!</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product. Is not too harsh and results are immediate. I never heard of this brand before but I believe I found the perfect solution for my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo forever...  Since my drugstore ceased selling this&lt;br /&gt;shampoo I have had to send to California for it.  What a SURPRISE for me when I found it on Amazon.com  Thank you.</li>
            <li> works great on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I had psoriasis so bad that my Derm referred me to this shampoo. I bought it and it has totally fixed my problem. I have been using it twice a week for four weeks and Im so relieved. It does smell like gasoline though. But after I wash it out, I use my regular shampoo and conditioner afterwards and the gasoline smelll gets subsided. But I was at a point that I didnt care what it smelled like as long as it worked and it did.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and a zinc version by the same manufacturer were recommended for me by my dermatologist to address scamp issues.  Both shampoos do an excellent job of washing my hair, but this coal tar version has completely cured the scamp buildup problems that I was experiencing.  Both DHS shampoos have a higher concentration of active ingredients than other over the counter types which I attribute to their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I use it 2 to 3 times a week and it removes the dandruff. It was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by my dermatologist because I have some bad dermatitis. It reduced my scalp itchiness but I still had some light flaking. Not a fan of the product.</li>
            <li> worked wonders. first tar shampoo that actually did it&#x27;s job. flakes were gone in 2 weeks when used consistantly. shampoo scrub with it first then wash it out and then use regular shampoo and conditioner so your scalp doesnt dry out from the tar shampoo or smell like it either.</li>
            <li> This over the counter shampoo provided excellent control of plaque psoriasis on the scalp. No more itching and it worked very well after one use.  Flakes also greatly reduced.  Try this first!  My high dollar dermatologist prescribed this over the counter treatment!</li>
            <li> This shampoo exceeds my expectations. Plenty of lather with a very nice smell and best of all it is controlling my dandruff. I would recommend this produce to to anyone with serious dandruff problems.</li>
            <li> Tried for 60 days. Did nothing for me. Still looking for something that works.</li>
            <li> My husband is very satisfied with this shampoo. It addresses a ,now, mild case of psoriasis, and does not leave his hair discolored.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis over my body and on my scalp for dozens of years.  I&#x27;ve tried most shampoos, both over the counter and by prescription.  This DHS Shampoo is as good as or better than any of them.  I don&#x27;t think the tar scent is that bad......and if using a conditioner, the tar odor is gone.  The most important factor is that my scalp is void of psoriatic plaques after using DHS Tar Shampoo.  I can even wear dark clothing, which is something that people with scalp psoriasis would appreciate.  Give it a try, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> only used  it once so  far, but it looks like it helped my scalp psoriasis a little.  no strong odor</li>
            <li> Recommeded by skin doctor to alternated with prescription medication for scalp itch problem.  So far so good...no itch no scratch!</li>
            <li> only place  know it can be obtained</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works!!!  My dry, flaking scalp issues are virtually gone!!!</li>
            <li> Really helps with my skin condition.</li>
            <li> I have developed severely itching scalp after many years of using fragrance-free shampoos.  My wife is severely chemically sensitive, especially to artificial fragrances, and what they put in most shampoos are some of the worst things for her.  It is interesting / frustrating that there don&#x27;t seem to be any fragrance free shampoos that contain Zinc Pyrithione, but this fragrance free coal tar shampoo is easily found!  Of course, it has a smell - not of gasoline exactly, but of coal tar, which anyone who has ridden a train pulled by a coal burning locomotive will distinctly remember.  Not many of us left, I guess ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I needed to use some medicated shampoos for the itching and what I found to work for me is to alternate (over periods of several weeks each) use of this shampoo with use of one of the standard fragrance-free shampoos together with the Derma-Zinc product.  As I said, it is weird that you can&#x27;t buy a fragrance-free Zinc shampoo, as the pure Zinc solution has hardly any smell at all.  The smell of this coal tar shampoo is not that strong, and it quickly dissipates, so it is hardly a problem, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my wife at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for those who suffer from eczema on their scalps.  I use this every few days prior to shampooing with a salon shampoo.  I leave it on for about 5 minutes before shampooing with the salon product.  It has done wonders for my scalp, especially during the winter months.  I would highly recommend it, but just know that you will probably want to shampoo and condition with another shampoo afterwards.  The smell takes a bit of time to get used to, but after a few washes, you don&#x27;t even notice anymore.  Even if you don&#x27;t use another product afterwards, your hair does not smell like tar.  The other products just work to unknot my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had \\&quot;decent\\&quot; reviews, a pretty good mix of them actually, so i thought i would give it a shot and make up my own mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with the smell of the tar is so strong that it already turns you negative towards the product but you convince yourself that its \\&quot;good\\&quot; for you plus you spent a ridiculous amount of money so you decide to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensation on your hair is horrible, it does not lather up almost at all, thus leaving you with a feeling that you did not wash your hair to begin with. Brushing your hair is a nightmare even if you use a TON of conditioner and after products!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But honestly for me the WORST feeling was the sliminess on my body that just made me want to vomit! It was like taking a slugs slime and rubbing it allover it was horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use most of it just for the sake of maybe it will help with itchy scalp and dandruff but it help with neither. It just made my hair extra dry and gave me split ends!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i would definitely not recommend it nor buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be sticking with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree oil series way much better/healthier and nicer results!</li>
            <li> This non-scented shampoo smells exactly like gasoline! I HIGHLY recommend you buy the scented one! It does the job though... I don&#x27;t have any flakes or problems with my scalp anymore.</li>
            <li> I would give the shampoo a 5 star rating, but the shipping was an issue. It came to me leaking into the box. Thankfully it didn&#x27;t get on to the Disney infinity that was in the same box.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Works great and helps with skin condition without harming my hair. Thank goodness it is fragrance free - nearly impossible to find! Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> After a week I noticed less itching and irritation.</li>
            <li> After trying several products to control my flakes I went to the doctors and she recommended that I try this and by surprise it work on my flaky hair. Love the product which impress me on the first time.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Very helpful product.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product Overall!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the others for years until a Dr. Had me try this. Now I feel great and no more dry itchy, flaky scalp. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> Its very good on your hair .. feels soft after u blow dry and easy to style............. wonderful item would purchase again</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo i have found to help with my dandruff. I love that I can wear black again without worrying about looking like I&#x27;ve been in a snow storm.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has long helped me when an itching scalp becomes unbearable.  I&#x27;ve used it (occasionally) over a period of years and find it is consistently the same--effective and expensive.  (Hence the &amp;#34;occasional&amp;#34; use.)  But if needed, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent coal tar shampoo</li>
            <li> This is an ok product but in my opinion not any better than the high end drug store brand, which is still considerably cheaper than DHS.  In fact, it is suspiciously similar to the drug store item and has the same amount of the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to synthetic odorants or aroma compounds - then this is the shampoo for you. It&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li> ok i finish my first bottle last week and it took like a whole week to work on my scalp now my scalp is getting itchy as hell right now so im ordering another bottle today so if u wondering if this works YES this stuff does work but they should offer a better deal for us that really needed like a 20oz bottle for 12bucks cus the bottle only last me like 3 weeks its so little.</li>
            <li> Stuff really works.  Been taking meds from dermatologist for awhile, found this, scalp greatly improved.  Won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Have not used long enough for a good review.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> came on time and this is the best shampoo I have ever used.  It was highly recommended to me by the dermatologist two years ago due to my sensitive scalp and this stuff works.  I have tried 4 of their shampoos and have had great results with them all.  I am a life long costumer of this brand and I will definitely order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Work so far, shampoo has a stronger than usual coal tar smell compared to Neutrogena, but for it&#x27;s effectiveness you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my brother since he uses it. So far I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints I assume it was good.</li>
            <li> Is not fragrance free, irritated my scalp</li>
            <li> Gross smell and destroyed hair and did nothing for my itchy scalp. I used it once then threw the rest away</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good, MD recommended product.  Amazon&#x27;s service in getting it to me was very satisfactory.  Thanks...   JN</li>
            <li> I have a patch of scalp psoriasis that is usually very itchy and produces thick flakes of skin. I&#x27;ve used one other tar shampoo (Denorex Therapeutic, which apparently isn&#x27;t available for purchase right now) in the past that was really good for this condition so I thought this one (DHS) would work too. I&#x27;m sorry to say that it didn&#x27;t work very well at all. Even though I followed the directions exactly as described on the label and have used it several times the DHS shampoo didn&#x27;t help with my psoriasis one bit. I still have the itching and flaking. I cannot recommend this product for scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I have suffered for years with severe flakiness and nothing has worked for me until I found this product.  I have been using it for approx. 3 weeks and the results are very significant.  If you or someone your know has this problem please let them know about this Tar Shampoo!  A blessing is disguise.</li>
            <li> I use this product everytime I have BB sessions with guys at the bar.  It helps me prevent HIV and keeps me from getting dandruff.</li>
            <li> this did nothing for me. i remember using this product along time ago and it was good it stopped my itching  immediately but something must of changed in the formulating. im so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo, no more itching scalp</li>
            <li> USED IT FOR YEARS AND DOES RELIEVE THE SCALP SOMEWHAT, BUT EVENTUALLY YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR TO GET COMPLETE RELIEF. THE PRODUCT ONLY WORKS AS A TEMPORARY RELIEVER TO SCALP PROBLEMS AND DOES NOT HEAL SCALP IRRITATIONS, WHICH MUST BE TREATED BY A DERMATOLOGIST IN THEIR OFFICE.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo to control my psoriasis. Nothing else has worked! I use it about 3-4 times a week for the first bottle to get rid of it and it cleared it up! Now I use it when it starts to come back, same routine, and it keeps it at bay.</li>
            <li> It is ok it does what iit is suposed to do and help with dandruff some I guess just trying to get enough words.</li>
            <li> After years of scalp psoriasis with burning &amp; itching that was nearly unbearable, this product worked. It used it in conjunction with MG217 and within 10 days the burning, itch, redness &amp; scales were gone. Now I just shampoo with DHS to maintain my healthy scalp.</li>
            <li> Many tar products are now unavailable. Bought this for someone who has issues with dandruff and thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;They also have problems with dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;This product does not dry out the scalp or the hair, and does not smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> my husband and son uses this .. it really works</li>
            <li> This product was suggested by my Dermatologist.  Since I am unable to find it in my local stores I routinely order it thru Amazon.  The product works well and I have been using it for over a year....</li>
            <li> I was prescribed this by my dermatologist and since its hard to get an appointment with him, I ordered it here. It definitely helped me with itching of the scalp and flakes.</li>
            <li> my problem may be different, this didn&#x27;t help me much, it did work for my cousin and her mother though...</li>
            <li> I had a horribly dry scalp. It was constantly burning and itching. I also had flakes. After the first time using DHS Tar Shampoo this all stopped. It really is a great product. It smells pretty bad but, once I dried my hair I noticed no lingering odor. Anyone suffering from scalp issues should try this shampoo. I hope you get the same results that I had.</li>
            <li> and it works well for my hair.It was originally recommended by a dermatologist and I find it satisfsctory. Thank you..</li>
            <li> Really strong smell which is unfortunate since it leaked in the box.  I didn&#x27;t see any significant improvement and the smell is off putting.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several different dandruff shampoos and then moved on to selsun blue medicated (the highest potency) and still my dandruff was getting worse and worse. Huge flakes, every day. This is because I have seborrheic dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist of all people recommended this tar gel. I got it. Didn&#x27;t smell that bad. And it has completely cured my dandruffs. This is my miracle shampoo. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> This is a good product that I have purchased before.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this product works very well</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for my scalp condition and NONE work a well as this product does for me.  I have not flaking or itching of the scalp wen using DHS Tar Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo initially but just like everything else the body seems to get used to it and then the flakes return and this shampoo no longer removes it as it did at first.</li>
            <li> good for the itchiness from scalp dermatitis</li>
    </ol>
