            <li>Very happy with this lotion so much, that I ended up purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I bruise very easily because of steroids.  </li>
            <li>Not so sure this is effective.</li>

            <li>Removes bruises quickly!!</li>

            <li>This product is ok.  </li>
            <li>So much better than the ointment for day use.</li>
            <li>I think Emu oI works better.</li>
            <li>Love the consistency.</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>any more-I&#x27;m glad Amazon has stores that do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works and I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>You can temporarily remove the cap to get more cream out.</li>
            <li>love the cream , but not container</li>
            <li>I was hoping this bruise cream would work better that some I&#x27;ve tried, but no luck.  </li>
            <li>A week after having some surgery, my bruising was still getting darker and more pronounced.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It seems to work on some bruises better than others.  </li>
            <li>Arnica additive is a sure bet.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more for her.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work OK.</li>
            <li>Was so impressed that I carry the Miracle Plus Arnica Bruise Cream with me and bought Arnica gel locally to keep at the house.  </li>
            <li>Have been using Arnica for years now and like the lotion better than the roll on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month, and about to order two more containers.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find going on was painless, it was in fact soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put it on before, after, and during the therapy as many times as I want....</li>
            <li>The bruises disappear much more rapidly when I use this cream.</li>
            <li>doctor said it would take some time to return to normal, but already after three days looks greatly improved.</li>
            <li>it was pretty fascinating to watch.  </li>
            <li>I bruise easily and this product helps better than anything else I tried.</li>
            <li>and my hands bruise easy.</li>
            <li>I Bruise Easily</li>
            <li>I purchased for my Dad that bruises easily</li>
            <li>I get Juvederm injections once a year and bruise easy.</li>
            <li>I will easily buy it again.</li>
            <li>I both bleed and bruise way too easily.  </li>
            <li>THis cream has a great texture, doesnâ€™t smell and really seems to calm inflammation and soothe soreness.</li>
            <li>Really helped get rid of the bruising and help me feel better!</li>
            <li>and I see a huge improvement on my bruising and swelling.</li>
            <li>And, it had another important benefit ...</li>
            <li>It worked great but ran out of it before spots TOTALLY DISAPPEARED....</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.....went back to using DMSO which works great on all bruises.</li>
            <li>Really Works!!!</li>
            <li>so this is a good fit for me if I use it soon enough.  </li>
            <li>Specially if you use it as soon as your are bruised.</li>
            <li>yeah-a cool doctor)</li>
            <li>Seem to notice some fading but must continue to use it longer for full affects</li>
            <li>Does a good job of lessening the bruises on the back of  my hands.  </li>
            <li>If you are a fast healer, this might not do much for you, however if you are, like me, an older person with the thinning we can get skin wise and if you bruise easily I suggest trying this cream on your bruises.  </li>
            <li>Helps to eliminate bruises quickly.</li>
            <li>I have never had a bruise heal that quickly before.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a product work so quickly.</li>
            <li>Josh - Pure Valley National Sales Manager, distributor for Miracle Plus, was attentive and quick to respond to questions I had regarding the cream.  </li>
            <li>Gave this to my mom who is getting older and has easily bruising skin.  </li>
            <li>It feel silky and is quickly absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>Based on reviews, it seemed worth trying.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it, if you bruise easily, also works on some folks for pains and aches, but this one is formulated for &amp;#34;BRUISE and swelling&amp;#34; so I prefer it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that my bruises are noticeably fading pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I started using it right away</li>
            <li>I bruise pretty easy as I have gotten older.</li>
            <li>I bruise very easy and as a teacher, I am constantly finding bruises on my thighs where I have walked into student desks.</li>
            <li>I am 77 and on blood thinners, but still pretty active, and thusly get a lot of bruises, This cream works great and is very affordable.</li>
            <li>The most recent is a reddening to my right calf, along with a bruising color.  </li>
            <li>This feels so good on my skin, and it actually feels better, my skin seems smoother and less irritated</li>
            <li>The Arnica Bruise Cream strengthened the skin so much that I rarely have that problem anymore.  </li>
            <li>Buy this Miracle Plus Arnica Bruise Cream because it does exactly as wriitten..  </li>
            <li>Really minimizes bruises!</li>
            <li>the first caution was that it could cause tendonts and swelling.</li>
            <li>I am much more likely to do all the exercises if the pain level is tolerable!!!  </li>
            <li>First day or</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant aroma but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about a week and a half of using this 2-3 times a day on the bruises, as well as preemptively on the areas that seem most prone to bruising, my legs look like they did when I was twenty!</li>
            <li>Very helpful and really works!</li>
            <li>Speeds true bruise healing if applied early and often.</li>
            <li>I have used the cream for only a couple of weeks but am pleased with the results so far, will definitely reorder more  to see if results keep improving.</li>
            <li>first used it following abdominal surgery, when I had huge bruises on my stomach from surgery.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is easy to open and use.</li>
            <li>I bruise extremely easy and my bruises last over two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Certainly did not hurt them.  </li>
            <li>I would end up with huge bruises on my hands and arms simply from putting clothes into the washer and dryer, but with this cream</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for a friend and don&#x27;t know really how it worked</li>
            <li>Also works great for those broken veins in the legs.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This cream is very helpful for my bruises.</li>
            <li>my leg/arm/cheekbone were really bruised &amp; she gave me some Arnica Bruise Cream &amp; it</li>
            <li>Really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference</li>
            <li>Way too much money for product...</li>
            <li>It absolutely helped heal bruises on my hands faster.</li>
            <li>doesn;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell much difference when I use it.</li>
            <li>I am very prone to bruising</li>
            <li>had I not used Arnica Bruise Cream that it would have taken me much longer to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very satissue with Amazons fast delivery</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>have to agree, it really works, the bruises get much lighter in a day or two.</li>
            <li>Stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I am very thankful that we have access to this reasonably-priced product from</li>
            <li>Did not do what it really said it would do to my skin</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really notice the smell as I&#x27;m trying it on my arms.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>This really doesn&#x27;t do what its advertised to do.  </li>
            <li>If not completely gone, they are faded tremendously!</li>
            <li>At first, it didn&#x27;t seem like anything was happening, but after 3-4 days of use, I could see a marked difference just from morning to evening.  </li>
            <li>I first applied the cream to some old bruises.  </li>
            <li>My body doesn&#x27;t normally &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; bruises this fast by itself though and so for that reason I tend to believe that there is something to it after all.  </li>
            <li>I bruise very easily and they will last a long time</li>
            <li>That said, where Arnica really shines is when applied to new injuries.  </li>
            <li>The older generation used this in the day and we have it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It really works; not so much on the old bruises that have turned brown over the years, but put it on a new bruise as directed and it will break it up in a couple of days and make it disappear in 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li>I do find that it helps with restoring normal color to bruises.</li>
            <li>I almost think that the dissipation of the bruises is normal with or without the bruise cream.</li>
            <li>That way the cream in the top of the container will naturally come down to the bottom by the cap.</li>
            <li>As days when by, the very light blue in the center the bruise&lt;br /&gt;expanded to the perimeter of the bruise.</li>
            <li>DerMend comes in a pliable tubular container and you can easily work the remaining cream down and use every bit.  </li>
            <li>The product worked on NEW bruising but not so well on alder bruises.  </li>
            <li>I immediately stopped the medication and was given a new prescription.</li>
            <li>Also staves away new bruises from reoccurring.</li>
            <li>not sure it was any better than Vaseline intensive care.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to whether there is scientific evidence behind this particular therapy or not because I haven&#x27;t found that evidence, but I can say that this product is soothing and smells nice</li>
            <li>I woke up with a new one trying to come through this morning and have put the cream on twice so far today, and it has already noticeably faded and will probably be gone tomorrow or the day after.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Almost immediately, within days, I saw something positive happening, as there was a reduction to the swelling and the intensity of the red.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any change whatsoever even though I used it faithfully on a major bruise, an average bruise and a light bruise.</li>
            <li>They seemed to clear faster.  </li>
            <li>Seems to help bruise to clear up faster</li>
            <li>Balmy feeling when massaged into the skin.</li>
            <li>I used this cream in the morning and at night for three days and my bruising is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>This product was very helpful after knee replacement surgery when my husband&#x27;s entire leg was bruised up.</li>
            <li>and wow does it help.  </li>
            <li>My bruises were completely gone in 4 days.</li>
            <li>I recently got a very large,dark bruise on my arm, and a friend at work, whose son is a stunt man, told me I should use Arnica on it.  </li>
            <li>Within 24 hrs of my 1st application I began to see a marked reduction of bruising.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do that and by the time I read the directions, the bruises had faded naturally.  </li>
            <li>she put some on her arms for 3 days and reduced her bruises considerably before she returned to Oklahoma...</li>
            <li>, one left hand crashed into a door jamb, and one right forearm crashed into a different door jamb</li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned and bruise very easily (doesn&#x27;t help that I also tend to be very clumsy!).  </li>
            <li>The main ingredient in both are the same and so far this seems to work well.</li>
            <li>Most are small, fingerprint sized but some are large and extremely unsightly.</li>
            <li>I wake up with new bruises on my legs almost daily and have anywhere from 10-20 on each leg at any given time.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that helps the bruises go way a bit more quickly-usually a bang on the arm will leave me with a bruise for at least a month.  </li>
            <li>After two days the swelling went down and my foot looked more normal without the black and blue bruising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave this product to a friend who had a very large dark bruise from her knee replacement surgery, and it dramatically lightened the bruise within a couple of days.</li>
            <li>We have not had the product long enough to say really how we like it.</li>
            <li>very good/ but not what i expected</li>
            <li>It seems to reduce my black-and-blue dings several days faster (and I get a lot of these b-and-b marks in my work as a professional wildlife and landscape photographer).</li>
            <li>Also, the bruising left lasts for weeks on end--one almost a year old.  </li>
            <li>I also use it as a moisturizer on my arms and legs--I dab a thicker portion directly on the bruise then rub the cream into my entire arm and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 64 year old male.</li>
            <li>know the Arnica in the bruise Cream recently used by professional athletes.</li>
            <li>Being as klutzy as Mr. Magoo is not a good thing if one bruises easily, as I do.  </li>
            <li>I bruise very easily, and I&#x27;ve used this cream for the past few years.</li>
            <li>With that being said just because the product didnt work for me it very well may work on other peoples</li>
            <li>Not a single bruise appeared.  </li>
            <li>so I can treat bruises right away, one  by my bed and one in my backpack for carrying on hikes when I invariably trip or stumble and fall down, bruise myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive compared to other similar creams for the legs.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and the bruising did not remain near as long as it had been.</li>
            <li>an elderly woman with very thin skin who bruises very easily.  </li>
            <li>According to The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center \\&quot;A few clinical trials suggest benefits of topical arnica for osteoarthritis; and for affecting significant reduction of bruising.</li>
            <li>this cream really does work and about half what you&#x27;d pay in a drug store.</li>
            <li>My skin was solid black and blue in large areas.  </li>
            <li>they usually go away very fast but not with this product.</li>

            <li> Very happy with this lotion so much, that I ended up purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I bruise very easily because of steroids.  </li>
            <li> Not so sure this is effective.</li>

            <li> This product is ok.  </li>
            <li> So much better than the ointment for day use.</li>
            <li> I think Emu oI works better.</li>
            <li> Love the consistency.</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> any more-I&#x27;m glad Amazon has stores that do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works and I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> You can temporarily remove the cap to get more cream out.</li>
            <li> love the cream , but not container</li>
            <li> I was hoping this bruise cream would work better that some I&#x27;ve tried, but no luck.  </li>
            <li> A week after having some surgery, my bruising was still getting darker and more pronounced.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It seems to work on some bruises better than others.  </li>
            <li> Arnica additive is a sure bet.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more for her.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work OK.</li>
            <li> Was so impressed that I carry the Miracle Plus Arnica Bruise Cream with me and bought Arnica gel locally to keep at the house.  </li>
            <li> Have been using Arnica for years now and like the lotion better than the roll on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month, and about to order two more containers.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to find going on was painless, it was in fact soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it on before, after, and during the therapy as many times as I want....</li>
            <li> The bruises disappear much more rapidly when I use this cream.</li>
            <li> doctor said it would take some time to return to normal, but already after three days looks greatly improved.</li>
            <li> it was pretty fascinating to watch.  </li>
            <li> I bruise easily and this product helps better than anything else I tried.</li>
            <li> and my hands bruise easy.</li>
            <li> I Bruise Easily</li>
            <li> I purchased for my Dad that bruises easily</li>
            <li> I get Juvederm injections once a year and bruise easy.</li>
            <li> I will easily buy it again.</li>
            <li> I both bleed and bruise way too easily.  </li>
            <li> THis cream has a great texture, doesnâ€™t smell and really seems to calm inflammation and soothe soreness.</li>
            <li> Really helped get rid of the bruising and help me feel better!</li>
            <li> and I see a huge improvement on my bruising and swelling.</li>
            <li> And, it had another important benefit ...</li>
            <li> It worked great but ran out of it before spots TOTALLY DISAPPEARED....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.....went back to using DMSO which works great on all bruises.</li>
            <li> Really Works!!!</li>
            <li> so this is a good fit for me if I use it soon enough.  </li>
            <li> Specially if you use it as soon as your are bruised.</li>
            <li> yeah-a cool doctor)</li>
            <li> Seem to notice some fading but must continue to use it longer for full affects</li>
            <li> Does a good job of lessening the bruises on the back of  my hands.  </li>
            <li> If you are a fast healer, this might not do much for you, however if you are, like me, an older person with the thinning we can get skin wise and if you bruise easily I suggest trying this cream on your bruises.  </li>
            <li> Helps to eliminate bruises quickly.</li>
            <li> I have never had a bruise heal that quickly before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a product work so quickly.</li>
            <li> Josh - Pure Valley National Sales Manager, distributor for Miracle Plus, was attentive and quick to respond to questions I had regarding the cream.  </li>
            <li> Gave this to my mom who is getting older and has easily bruising skin.  </li>
            <li> It feel silky and is quickly absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> Based on reviews, it seemed worth trying.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it, if you bruise easily, also works on some folks for pains and aches, but this one is formulated for &amp;#34;BRUISE and swelling&amp;#34; so I prefer it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that my bruises are noticeably fading pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I started using it right away</li>
            <li> I bruise pretty easy as I have gotten older.</li>
            <li> I bruise very easy and as a teacher, I am constantly finding bruises on my thighs where I have walked into student desks.</li>
            <li> I am 77 and on blood thinners, but still pretty active, and thusly get a lot of bruises, This cream works great and is very affordable.</li>
            <li> The most recent is a reddening to my right calf, along with a bruising color.  </li>
            <li> This feels so good on my skin, and it actually feels better, my skin seems smoother and less irritated</li>
            <li> The Arnica Bruise Cream strengthened the skin so much that I rarely have that problem anymore.  </li>
            <li> Buy this Miracle Plus Arnica Bruise Cream because it does exactly as wriitten..  </li>
            <li> Really minimizes bruises!</li>
            <li> the first caution was that it could cause tendonts and swelling.</li>
            <li> I am much more likely to do all the exercises if the pain level is tolerable!!!  </li>
            <li> First day or</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant aroma but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about a week and a half of using this 2-3 times a day on the bruises, as well as preemptively on the areas that seem most prone to bruising, my legs look like they did when I was twenty!</li>
            <li> Very helpful and really works!</li>
            <li> Speeds true bruise healing if applied early and often.</li>
            <li> I have used the cream for only a couple of weeks but am pleased with the results so far, will definitely reorder more  to see if results keep improving.</li>
            <li> first used it following abdominal surgery, when I had huge bruises on my stomach from surgery.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is easy to open and use.</li>
            <li> I bruise extremely easy and my bruises last over two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Certainly did not hurt them.  </li>
            <li> I would end up with huge bruises on my hands and arms simply from putting clothes into the washer and dryer, but with this cream</li>
            <li> This really works.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend and don&#x27;t know really how it worked</li>
            <li> Also works great for those broken veins in the legs.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This cream is very helpful for my bruises.</li>
            <li> my leg/arm/cheekbone were really bruised &amp; she gave me some Arnica Bruise Cream &amp; it</li>
            <li> Really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference</li>
            <li> Way too much money for product...</li>
            <li> It absolutely helped heal bruises on my hands faster.</li>
            <li> doesn;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell much difference when I use it.</li>
            <li> I am very prone to bruising</li>
            <li> had I not used Arnica Bruise Cream that it would have taken me much longer to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very satissue with Amazons fast delivery</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> have to agree, it really works, the bruises get much lighter in a day or two.</li>
            <li> Stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I am very thankful that we have access to this reasonably-priced product from</li>
            <li> Did not do what it really said it would do to my skin</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really notice the smell as I&#x27;m trying it on my arms.  </li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> This really doesn&#x27;t do what its advertised to do.  </li>
            <li> If not completely gone, they are faded tremendously!</li>
            <li> At first, it didn&#x27;t seem like anything was happening, but after 3-4 days of use, I could see a marked difference just from morning to evening.  </li>
            <li> I first applied the cream to some old bruises.  </li>
            <li> My body doesn&#x27;t normally &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; bruises this fast by itself though and so for that reason I tend to believe that there is something to it after all.  </li>
            <li> I bruise very easily and they will last a long time</li>
            <li> That said, where Arnica really shines is when applied to new injuries.  </li>
            <li> The older generation used this in the day and we have it</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It really works; not so much on the old bruises that have turned brown over the years, but put it on a new bruise as directed and it will break it up in a couple of days and make it disappear in 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> I do find that it helps with restoring normal color to bruises.</li>
            <li> I almost think that the dissipation of the bruises is normal with or without the bruise cream.</li>
            <li> That way the cream in the top of the container will naturally come down to the bottom by the cap.</li>
            <li> As days when by, the very light blue in the center the bruise&lt;br /&gt;expanded to the perimeter of the bruise.</li>
            <li> DerMend comes in a pliable tubular container and you can easily work the remaining cream down and use every bit.  </li>
            <li> The product worked on NEW bruising but not so well on alder bruises.  </li>
            <li> I immediately stopped the medication and was given a new prescription.</li>
            <li> Also staves away new bruises from reoccurring.</li>
            <li> not sure it was any better than Vaseline intensive care.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to whether there is scientific evidence behind this particular therapy or not because I haven&#x27;t found that evidence, but I can say that this product is soothing and smells nice</li>
            <li> I woke up with a new one trying to come through this morning and have put the cream on twice so far today, and it has already noticeably faded and will probably be gone tomorrow or the day after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Almost immediately, within days, I saw something positive happening, as there was a reduction to the swelling and the intensity of the red.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change whatsoever even though I used it faithfully on a major bruise, an average bruise and a light bruise.</li>
            <li> They seemed to clear faster.  </li>
            <li> Seems to help bruise to clear up faster</li>
            <li> Balmy feeling when massaged into the skin.</li>
            <li> I used this cream in the morning and at night for three days and my bruising is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> This product was very helpful after knee replacement surgery when my husband&#x27;s entire leg was bruised up.</li>
            <li> and wow does it help.  </li>
            <li> My bruises were completely gone in 4 days.</li>
            <li> I recently got a very large,dark bruise on my arm, and a friend at work, whose son is a stunt man, told me I should use Arnica on it.  </li>
            <li> Within 24 hrs of my 1st application I began to see a marked reduction of bruising.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do that and by the time I read the directions, the bruises had faded naturally.  </li>
            <li> she put some on her arms for 3 days and reduced her bruises considerably before she returned to Oklahoma...</li>
            <li> , one left hand crashed into a door jamb, and one right forearm crashed into a different door jamb</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned and bruise very easily (doesn&#x27;t help that I also tend to be very clumsy!).  </li>
            <li> The main ingredient in both are the same and so far this seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Most are small, fingerprint sized but some are large and extremely unsightly.</li>
            <li> I wake up with new bruises on my legs almost daily and have anywhere from 10-20 on each leg at any given time.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that helps the bruises go way a bit more quickly-usually a bang on the arm will leave me with a bruise for at least a month.  </li>
            <li> After two days the swelling went down and my foot looked more normal without the black and blue bruising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this product to a friend who had a very large dark bruise from her knee replacement surgery, and it dramatically lightened the bruise within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> We have not had the product long enough to say really how we like it.</li>
            <li> very good/ but not what i expected</li>
            <li> It seems to reduce my black-and-blue dings several days faster (and I get a lot of these b-and-b marks in my work as a professional wildlife and landscape photographer).</li>
            <li> Also, the bruising left lasts for weeks on end--one almost a year old.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a moisturizer on my arms and legs--I dab a thicker portion directly on the bruise then rub the cream into my entire arm and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 64 year old male.</li>
            <li> know the Arnica in the bruise Cream recently used by professional athletes.</li>
            <li> Being as klutzy as Mr. Magoo is not a good thing if one bruises easily, as I do.  </li>
            <li> I bruise very easily, and I&#x27;ve used this cream for the past few years.</li>
            <li> With that being said just because the product didnt work for me it very well may work on other peoples</li>
            <li> Not a single bruise appeared.  </li>
            <li> so I can treat bruises right away, one  by my bed and one in my backpack for carrying on hikes when I invariably trip or stumble and fall down, bruise myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very inexpensive compared to other similar creams for the legs.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and the bruising did not remain near as long as it had been.</li>
            <li> an elderly woman with very thin skin who bruises very easily.  </li>
            <li> According to The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center \\&quot;A few clinical trials suggest benefits of topical arnica for osteoarthritis; and for affecting significant reduction of bruising.</li>
            <li> this cream really does work and about half what you&#x27;d pay in a drug store.</li>
            <li> My skin was solid black and blue in large areas.  </li>
            <li> they usually go away very fast but not with this product.</li>
            <li> It was almost black in some areas to a dark blue color.&lt;br /&gt;After 24 hours the center of bruise had lighten significantly, about an inch in diameter.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s this particular product or just Arnica in general,</li>
            <li> I have Venous Stasis, and developed an odd swelling above my left ankle in May.  </li>
            <li> It really reduces the length of time it usually takes me to heal.  </li>
            <li> I saw no apparent improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> how often I do that and how long the bruises last!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using about 4 times per day on bruises and it has had only a minor effect, almost not noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Usually my bruises last weeks- got rid of a brand new bruise in 3 to 4 days!  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Health and Beauty Outlet\\&quot; shipped quickly and included a note to me about the cream, offering a refund if I&#x27;m not happy and explaining that it would take a bit before it started to work..</li>
            <li> However, it has only moderate success on bruise-like spots due to thin skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Miracle Plus Arnica Bruise Cream a long time ago from a catalog that I couldn&#x27;t find again.  </li>
            <li> seems to help, but takes to long to see any difference.</li>
            <li> I had read about Arnica at the University of Maryland Medical Center website and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> if I just barely brushed against something sharp like the underside of the kitchen cabinets.  </li>
            <li> I also use in on my feet after a long day!</li>
            <li> She swears by this stuff for dry skin and bruising.</li>
            <li> the skin on my hands had become so thin that I would tear the first layer of skin off</li>
            <li> I used to look like a spousal-abuse victim, although my husband has never laid a hand on me.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no difference in using this on minor hand and forearm bruises after using it for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since using it, she no longer looks like she has red blood clots up and down her arms.  </li>
            <li> once I stopped using the cream though the discoloration seemed to come back slightly.</li>
            <li> Miracle Plus is intended in relieving the black and blue bruises caused by veins leaking in the legs and feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> couple of days ago a medicine I was taking caused my foot to swell and turn black and blue.</li>
            <li> The cream also has helped kept my skin from being dry and rough.</li>
            <li> It does seem to speed the healing of red spots caused by my little dogs&#x27; scratches and the medications I take.</li>
            <li> It arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
            <li> but I did not very well for me</li>
            <li> There are only a few small, barely noticeable bruises now.</li>
            <li> Not certain about the hemlock.  </li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my husband because he bruises easily due to the medication he takes.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother who bruises easily due to health issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reached that point in life where a small bump makes a big bruise, so I decided to get something to help.  </li>
            <li> I bruise very easily due to medications I take and carry this around with me to use ASAP when the occasion arises.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past several days</li>
            <li> Read the ingredients list, but since I am not familiar with most, it does not look bad.  </li>
            <li> This Arnica Bruise Cream simply makes the bruises fade within very few days.</li>
            <li> I am always dinging my hands and arms up as I&#x27;m active.  </li>
            <li> Met all my expectations and took care of clearing the very dark blue and black bruise in a few days.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> It is so hard that you waste about a third of what is in it because you can&#x27;t &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; the cream down.  </li>
            <li> ...and purple and black bruises.  </li>
            <li> Then I saw this for less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> I know from previous experience,  </li>
            <li> and I am not looking for a miracle, just a little help will suffice.  </li>
            <li> It does work, just wish it was a little faster in getting rid of bruising.</li>
            <li> as I said I had the bruise for a week  with no significant change.</li>
            <li> do no do a think, after few day using nothing change at all</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> cleared my son&#x27;t bruise on his ear within a few days...</li>
            <li> I have continued using this cream and it has continued not to provide any effect on everyday bruises and hasn&#x27;t reduced recovery time.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Used Nelson&#x27;s before and it was stiff.</li>
            <li> It has certainly has made my therapy (to regain the use of my hands) much less painful.</li>
            <li> One tip: the container is heavy plastic, so it can be hard to squeeze the product out after a while.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my wife ,in place of the usual Anica Cream .&lt;br</li>
            <li> but he is not sure.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can buy it in Rockford.</li>
            <li> Usually the bruising takes about 2 weeks to disappear.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> but as of now I believe I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been prone to bruising but for the past year or two (basically since I hit my forties) it has just gotten ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Hard to put cream on a spot</li>
            <li> After 6 days it was hard to detect where the bruise was.</li>
            <li> It has made wearing skirts and dresses embarrassing, which sucks since they comprise 90% of my wardrobe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I exercise 6 days a week and drink at least 60 oz of H20 a day this may have helped but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bruise healing is a slow process, but we do believe it  does seem to work  faster  </li>
            <li> It is slow in helping the bruise to disappear.</li>
            <li> I used this after serious bruising post-surgery.</li>
            <li> I have serious vein problems in my legs and feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous</li>
            <li> I had a bad black/blue bruise on my arm, not a new bruise but one that I had for a week, and then I bought this Arnica cream, used it for about a week.  </li>
            <li> I already knew this but did appreciate knowing the supplier stood behind the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I ordered this product and started using it approximately 4 days after I was bruised.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I had recently taken a nasty fall &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say I would not recommend this product for the use of bruises.</li>
            <li> Had surgery on June 2nd started bruising terribly.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical upon purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I don&#x27;t see that it has helped</li>
            <li> I already had one blood clot last year and that was horrible.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with the results, but will not blame the product as the directions instruct to apply it every three hours.  </li>
            <li> I had a terrible bruise on the back of my leg from a bad fall and this cream erased the bruise in one weeks time.</li>
            <li> Try it--you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> She uses it every day and it helps with the bad bruising from medication on her arms.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad bruise 7&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Before this I had to remember not to scratch my arm if I had an itch because it would cause an ugly bruise or even blood blister.  </li>
            <li> I have horrible skin and bruise like crazy</li>
            <li> I had a very bad fall about a week ago and because of blood thinner medications</li>

            <li> didn&#x27;t work like I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This product is ok.  Didn&#x27;t actually get rid of my bruises though.  Just eased the pain and swelling.</li>
            <li> This really works.  I was amazed</li>
            <li> Gave this to my mom who is getting older and has easily bruising skin.  Since using it, she no longer looks like she has red blood clots up and down her arms.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my wife ,in place of the usual Anica Cream .&lt;br /&gt;Bruise healing is a slow process, but we do believe it  does seem to work  faster  healing bruises.&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars rating for sure !!!! You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Nice. Balmy feeling when massaged into the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like it works great!</li>
            <li> Works quite well.  Helps to eliminate bruises quickly.</li>
            <li> it is good but it takes longer then  expexed</li>
            <li> it does help with my bruising, taking blood thinner and my hands bruise easy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my husband because he bruises easily due to the medication he takes. He tells me he thinks it is working to fade his bruises but he is not sure. We have not had the product long enough to say really how we like it. The bottle is easy to open and use. It arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Smells good and helps heal bruises quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend and don&#x27;t know really how it worked</li>
            <li> Excellent for helping bruising and marks on skin disappear.</li>
            <li> Feel this does accelerate the healing of bruises.  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> very good/ but not what i expected</li>
            <li> I Bruise Easily So I Tried This Miracle Lotion &amp; It Really Works!!! I Will Keep This Stuff Around At All Times.</li>
            <li> Works for me...bruises fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;reordered and still like it</li>
            <li> Told to use this when I had &amp;#34;some work done&amp;#34; by my Plastic Surgeon....Now, I wouldn&#x27;t be without it !! As your skin ages, it thins out, and you bruise SOOO easily, Arnica Montana is the greatest for quick bruise removal...BUT..this brand is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommend it, if you bruise easily, also works on some folks for pains and aches, but this one is formulated for &amp;#34;BRUISE and swelling&amp;#34; so I prefer it.</li>
            <li> I am 77 and on blood thinners, but still pretty active, and thusly get a lot of bruises, This cream works great and is very affordable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Miracle Plus Arnica Bruise Cream a long time ago from a catalog that I couldn&#x27;t find again.  When I broke my arm recently, and had surgery to put a plate in it, I found myself reaching for the cream to ease the soreness in my wrist.  I was just about out, so I set about finding it again on line.  Got it through Amazon!  Yea!  Also works great for those broken veins in the legs.  Try it--you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother who bruises easily due to health issues. She says it seems to shorten the heal time for them.</li>
            <li> Nice product. It seems to reduce my black-and-blue dings several days faster (and I get a lot of these b-and-b marks in my work as a professional wildlife and landscape photographer).</li>
            <li> So much better than the ointment for day use. Thanks</li>
            <li> This cream is very helpful for my bruises.</li>
            <li> I had recently taken a nasty fall &amp; my leg/arm/cheekbone were really bruised &amp; she gave me some Arnica Bruise Cream &amp; it was amazing how the cream helped to speed healing &amp; the discoloration.</li>
            <li> Really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference</li>
            <li> do no do a think, after few day using nothing change at all</li>
            <li> No difference. I think Emu oI works better.</li>
            <li> the reason i bought this was for bruising because arnica is great for making bruises go away quicker and with arnica they usually go away very fast but not with this product. i saw no difference between this cream and not using anything.</li>
            <li> Love the consistency. Used Nelson&#x27;s before and it was stiff. This one is luxurious and feels good to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;Great fragrance too.</li>
            <li> Way too much money for product...didn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
            <li> Erases bruises within days!</li>
            <li> It worked after about a week.  I think the bruise would have gone away in that time anyway. It was okay.</li>
            <li> ...and purple and black bruises.  I bruise extremely easy and my bruises last over two weeks.  I used this cream in the morning and at night for three days and my bruising is almost completely gone.  This is a miracle, trust me.  This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did absolutely nothing for me.  I&#x27;m sorry to say I would not recommend this product for the use of bruises.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my Dad that bruises easily and he says it works like a charm. He rubs this cream on his bruises and they go away within a couple days of use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Applies well no smell</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can buy it in Rockford. I do use this daily on my bruises. I like the product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this yet, but I was so impressed with the seller I am giving it a 4.  I bruise very easily because of steroids.  My skin will literally tear.  Also, the bruising left lasts for weeks on end--one almost a year old.  I am hoping this bruise cream will lessen the unsightliness of the bruise marks and heal them faster as well.  The seller wrote a personal note with the cream and said that it may not work in all instances--I fully accept that and I am not looking for a miracle, just a little help will suffice.  When I bruise again I will apply the cream and update this review.</li>
            <li> I had great results from the Arnica Bruise Cream.  It absolutely helped heal bruises on my hands faster. And, it had another important benefit ... the skin on my hands had become so thin that I would tear the first layer of skin off if I just barely brushed against something sharp like the underside of the kitchen cabinets.  This happened often and my hands always looked &amp;#34;wounded&amp;#34; with bruises and lacerations.  The Arnica Bruise Cream strengthened the skin so much that I rarely have that problem anymore.  HOWEVER, I switched to DerMend Bruise Cream for a very simple reason...the container that Arnica comes in!  It is so hard that you waste about a third of what is in it because you can&#x27;t &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; the cream down.  I even resorted to trying to cut the container open to get what was left out!  DerMend comes in a pliable tubular container and you can easily work the remaining cream down and use every bit.  The manufacturer of Arnica will have to substantially change the container to bring me back to their product.</li>
            <li> This product was very helpful after knee replacement surgery when my husband&#x27;s entire leg was bruised up. I would recommend to anyone who has bruises that can get cream on them.</li>
            <li> Snake oil. Doesn&#x27;t make any difference.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this thru a catalog but they don&#x27;t carry it any more-I&#x27;m glad Amazon has stores that do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially liked the supplier that I purchased it from thru Amazon.  \\&quot;Health and Beauty Outlet\\&quot; shipped quickly and included a note to me about the cream, offering a refund if I&#x27;m not happy and explaining that it would take a bit before it started to work..I already knew this but did appreciate knowing the supplier stood behind the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an elderly woman with very thin skin who bruises very easily.  This is the only thing that helps the bruises go way a bit more quickly-usually a bang on the arm will leave me with a bruise for at least a month.  Using this Arnica Cream reduces that by a good week to 10 days. If you are a fast healer, this might not do much for you, however if you are, like me, an older person with the thinning we can get skin wise and if you bruise easily I suggest trying this cream on your bruises.  I am always dinging my hands and arms up as I&#x27;m active.  It really reduces the length of time it usually takes me to heal.  I also use it as a moisturizer on my arms and legs--I dab a thicker portion directly on the bruise then rub the cream into my entire arm and hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used it following abdominal surgery, when I had huge bruises on my stomach from surgery.  The doctor suggested taking Arnica supplement (yeah-a cool doctor) but I dislike taking systemic pills for local issues like bruises.  So instead I bought this ArnicaCream and wow does it help.  I suggest using it on surgery areas to both relieve pain and help with bruising and swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People may say it&#x27;s snake oil but it works for me-I buy it....3-4 bottles at a time, keep one in the car so I can treat bruises right away, one  by my bed and one in my backpack for carrying on hikes when I invariably trip or stumble and fall down, bruise myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works!</li>
            <li> Has done nothing for me!</li>
            <li> I get Juvederm injections once a year and bruise easy. This speed up and bruises disappear quicker. I also use it for occasional bruises on my arm.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I just had liposuction on my outer thighs and I has a lot of bruising.  I rubbed this cream on twice daily and the bruising cleared up within a week.  I used this product along with the pellets and it does promote healing.  I would definitely reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> it seems to work, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and has a nice feel going on, what more would you want</li>
            <li> Works like a dream. I&#x27;m a 64 year old male.</li>
            <li> Have tried many, this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> it seems to help with bruises on my hands</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the cream to lessen the coloring of the bruises or the length of time of the bruising.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! It helps with not only bruises but aches,pain and swelling. It&#x27;s great to put on my feet and legs at the end of the day, it helps with the burning pain of my peripheral neuropathy.</li>
            <li> Had surgery on June 2nd started bruising terribly. I ordered June 9th and got it June 11th. I started using it right away and I see a huge improvement on my bruising and swelling. It really works and I am happy with the product. It has a pleasant aroma but not overwhelming. It feel silky and is quickly absorbed into my skin. I use it as the directions say to and I am very pleased with the purchase. Wish I would of know about this before my surgery.</li>
            <li> It truly is a miracle. I was skeptical upon purchasing this product. Especially since the reviews are so mixed. However, I was very happy that the product lived up to its expectations. I bruise just by someone looking at me. Usually the bruising takes about 2 weeks to disappear. That is not that case with this product! My bruises were completely gone in 4 days. Very happy with this lotion so much, that I ended up purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream for bruises. Arnica, Vitamin K, and Horse Chestnut Extract are really good for the skin and the circulatory system. I gave this product to a friend who had a very large dark bruise from her knee replacement surgery, and it dramatically lightened the bruise within a couple of days. I use the cream not only for bruises but also on my legs. It promotes the health of the legs and it has lightened up my spider veins. It&#x27;s very inexpensive compared to other similar creams for the legs. One tip: the container is heavy plastic, so it can be hard to squeeze the product out after a while. You can temporarily remove the cap to get more cream out. Store the product upright with the cap on the bottom. That way the cream in the top of the container will naturally come down to the bottom by the cap.</li>
            <li> love the cream , but not container</li>
            <li> doesn;t do much for me.  I can&#x27;t tell much difference when I use it.</li>
            <li> I used this on severe bruising following liposuction.  My skin was solid black and blue in large areas.  I applied the Arnica Bruise cream several times a day and my bruises were GONE in FOUR days!  I was hugely impressed by how well this cream worked.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have only tried it for a week, time will tell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reached that point in life where a small bump makes a big bruise, so I decided to get something to help.  I came to Amazon to get a bottle of Dermend, since that was the only one I knew about.  Then I saw this for less than half the price.  The main ingredient in both are the same and so far this seems to work well.</li>
            <li> It feels a tad bit greasy but not in a way that I find off putting. I do find that it helps with restoring normal color to bruises.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this bruise cream would work better that some I&#x27;ve tried, but no luck.  Bruises  still last 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I bruise very easily due to medications I take and carry this around with me to use ASAP when the occasion arises. It does shorten the time it takes for the bruises to fade. Its better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried!!!</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations and took care of clearing the very dark blue and black bruise in a few days.</li>
            <li> Marvelous cream for reducing bruises, lumps and swelling.</li>
            <li> This product just didn&#x27;t work for me. I didn&#x27;t notice any change whatsoever even though I used it faithfully on a major bruise, an average bruise and a light bruise. Will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> effective and easy to use</li>
            <li> The product worked on NEW bruising but not so well on alder bruises.  I am very prone to bruising so this is a good fit for me if I use it soon enough.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have horrible skin and bruise like crazy so that may be the reason why the product did nothing for me. With that being said just because the product didnt work for me it very well may work on other peoples skin im just speaking of my own results.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I used this product for &amp;#34;bruising&amp;#34; following laser  surgery for varicose veins.  My doctor recommended this product to me and after a week,  I could see that the bruising was slowing disappearing.  I know from previous experience,  had I not used Arnica Bruise Cream that it would have taken me much longer to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told my daughter about this product and she now uses it on my granddaughter who is always bumping her knees while at play or gymnastics.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother. She swears by this stuff for dry skin and bruising.</li>
            <li> Excellent product just ordered more. Very satissue with Amazons fast delivery</li>
            <li> Seem to notice some fading but must continue to use it longer for full affects</li>
            <li> This bruise cream works. Specially if you use it as soon as your are bruised.</li>
            <li> This cream is FANTASTIC!!!  I bruise very easily, and I&#x27;ve used this cream for the past few years. I used to look like a spousal-abuse victim, although my husband has never laid a hand on me. This Arnica Bruise Cream simply makes the bruises fade within very few days. I would end up with huge bruises on my hands and arms simply from putting clothes into the washer and dryer, but with this cream I know they will be gone before the weekend. It&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
            <li> I bruise very easily and they will last a long time but if I use this they disappear sooner. And it helps with pain also</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. I purchased in hopes that it would fade bruises that I always seem to get on my legs. It&#x27;s no miracle cream as it doesn&#x27;t instantly fade bruises but it does shorten the fade time by several days so for that reason I&#x27;ll keep purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I bruise easily and this product helps better than anything else I tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  Not sure if it&#x27;s this particular product or just Arnica in general, but I swear by it now!  I am very fair-skinned and bruise very easily (doesn&#x27;t help that I also tend to be very clumsy!).  I recently got a very large,dark bruise on my arm, and a friend at work, whose son is a stunt man, told me I should use Arnica on it.  Based on the reviews, I ordered this product and started using it approximately 4 days after I was bruised.  At first, it didn&#x27;t seem like anything was happening, but after 3-4 days of use, I could see a marked difference just from morning to evening.  I have never had a bruise heal that quickly before.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> After just 1 week of using this.  It works. Great stuff.  Before this I had to remember not to scratch my arm if I had an itch because it would cause an ugly bruise or even blood blister.  Now, there is no marks at all.</li>
            <li> I do think this cream helped my bruises.  They seemed to clear faster.  Certainly did not hurt them.  I will continue to use as any help at all is welcome.</li>
            <li> A week after having some surgery, my bruising was still getting darker and more pronounced. My Dr had given me Arnica tablets. I decided to try the cream. Within 24 hrs of my 1st application I began to see a marked reduction of bruising. I&#x27;ve never had a product work so quickly. My only gripe is that it did not come in a larger container.</li>
            <li> It works if you use it as directed.</li>
            <li> I bruise pretty easy as I have gotten older. My read an article about Arnica cream that speeds up the healing of bruises.&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree, it really works, the bruises get much lighter in a day or two.</li>
            <li> Buy this Miracle Plus Arnica Bruise Cream because it does exactly as wriitten..  I had a bad black/blue bruise on my arm, not a new bruise but one that I had for a week, and then I bought this Arnica cream, used it for about a week.  The bruise mark hascompletely  vanished.  I will easily buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bruises heal up faster. The older generation used this in the day and we have it today awesome produced !</li>
            <li> Love it. Stuff really works.</li>
            <li> this cream really does work and about half what you&#x27;d pay in a drug store.</li>
            <li> Works great on bruises!</li>
            <li> the back of the bottle tells you apply every 15 mins and I tried it but I did not very well for me</li>
            <li> It seems to work on some bruises better than others.  It is slow in helping the bruise to disappear.</li>
            <li> I used this after serious bruising post-surgery. Really helped get rid of the bruising and help me feel better!</li>
            <li> I did not feel like it made a difference in decreasing time it took to heal.  I used it after I took a cosmetic filler. The texture of the lotion was nice</li>
            <li> Seems to help my wife&#x27;s traumatized ankle area.  Arnica additive is a sure bet.  Not certain about the hemlock.  But seems to help.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> cleared my son&#x27;t bruise on his ear within a few days... it was pretty fascinating to watch.  once I stopped using the cream though the discoloration seemed to come back slightly.</li>
            <li> My mother has been using this product and swears by it.  She uses it every day and it helps with the bad bruising from medication on her arms.  I will buy more for her.  Arrived in good shape and on time.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This Miracle Plus Arnica Bruise Cream healed my vast bruising from a boating accident this Summer within one week.  The cream penetrates quickly, is non-greasy and has a subtle fragrance.  I am very thankful that we have access to this reasonably-priced product from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Josh - Pure Valley National Sales Manager, distributor for Miracle Plus, was attentive and quick to respond to questions I had regarding the cream.  Thank you Josh!</li>
            <li> seems to help, but takes to long to see any difference. on my third tube.</li>
            <li> I get bruises on my arms (I am at that age)  It might help some</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how well this stuff works!!! I&#x27;ve always been prone to bruising but for the past year or two (basically since I hit my forties) it has just gotten ridiculous. I wake up with new bruises on my legs almost daily and have anywhere from 10-20 on each leg at any given time. Most are small, fingerprint sized but some are large and extremely unsightly. It has made wearing skirts and dresses embarrassing, which sucks since they comprise 90% of my wardrobe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week and a half of using this 2-3 times a day on the bruises, as well as preemptively on the areas that seem most prone to bruising, my legs look like they did when I was twenty! There are only a few small, barely noticeable bruises now. I woke up with a new one trying to come through this morning and have put the cream on twice so far today, and it has already noticeably faded and will probably be gone tomorrow or the day after. I don&#x27;t even know how that is possible. I can finally wear some of my shorter skirts without looking like I&#x27;ve lost a kickboxing match. I&#x27;m buying another bottle of it as soon as I finish writing this review. This stuff is incredible!</li>
            <li> works great on injectible mishaps</li>
            <li> The claim that this product diminishes bruises  is bogus.  I saw no apparent improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I used this for bruising after surgery  unfortunately I don&#x27;t see that it has helped</li>
            <li> I had a terrible bruise on the back of my leg from a bad fall and this cream erased the bruise in one weeks time. A++</li>
            <li> Really minimizes bruises!</li>
            <li> Did not do what it really said it would do to my skin</li>
            <li> Seems to work OK. I will buy again</li>
            <li> Finally, I purchase Arnica.  I am kind of clutzy and always managing to bruise myself.  My girlfriend has told me for years to try Arnica to speed healing. Neutral smell, nice texture. I used it and it worked.</li>
            <li> I have serious vein problems in my legs and feet. I already had one blood clot last year and that was horrible. Miracle Plus is intended in relieving the black and blue bruises caused by veins leaking in the legs and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of days ago a medicine I was taking caused my foot to swell and turn black and blue. I read the cautions on the medicine and the first caution was that it could cause tendonts and swelling. I immediately stopped the medication and was given a new prescription. I the applied Arnica bruise Cream four or five times a day on the affected foot and leg while keeping my foot elevated and with ice packs for three days. At the beginning of the swelling the foot looked a deep blue and purple with a tinge of yellow. After two days the swelling went down and my foot looked more normal without the black and blue bruising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My doctor said it would take some time to return to normal, but already after three days looks greatly improved. I&#x27;ll keep putting the dream on until I can walk without causing any additional bruising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the Arnica in the bruise Cream recently used by professional athletes. According to The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center \\&quot;A few clinical trials suggest benefits of topical arnica for osteoarthritis; and for affecting significant reduction of bruising.

            <li> Very helpful and really works!</li>
            <li> I am a klutz.  Being as klutzy as Mr. Magoo is not a good thing if one bruises easily, as I do.  I had read about Arnica at the University of Maryland Medical Center website and decided to give it a try.  I first applied the cream to some old bruises.  Was not impressed with the results, but will not blame the product as the directions instruct to apply it every three hours.  Didn&#x27;t do that and by the time I read the directions, the bruises had faded naturally.  That said, where Arnica really shines is when applied to new injuries.  One cut and bumped knee, one left hand crashed into a door jamb, and one right forearm crashed into a different door jamb (yes, I&#x27;m klutzy).  On each injury I immediately applied the Arnica cream, followed up with another application about an hour later.  Not a single bruise appeared.  Was so impressed that I carry the Miracle Plus Arnica Bruise Cream with me and bought Arnica gel locally to keep at the house.  Good stuff, when used appropriately.</li>
            <li> I bruise very easy and as a teacher, I am constantly finding bruises on my thighs where I have walked into student desks. It&#x27;s ridiculous how often I do that and how long the bruises last! The bruising is virtually gone within 24 hours after using this product. If not completely gone, they are faded tremendously!</li>
            <li> This lotion works great on the bruises on my arms.  I will keep using it and ordering again</li>
            <li> I was not going to write a review, but we all depend upon each others reviews so here goes:  It really works; not so much on the old bruises that have turned brown over the years, but put it on a new bruise as directed and it will break it up in a couple of days and make it disappear in 3 or 4 days. Amazing. Read the ingredients list, but since I am not familiar with most, it does not look bad.  Will take it to my dermatologist, but I don&#x27;t intend to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I was never prone to bruising until being put on blood thinners for a time. I purchased this cream to hopefully help with the problem and I found  it to be of some good use. Not greasy and the bruising did not remain near as long as it had been.</li>
            <li> It worked great but ran out of it before spots TOTALLY DISAPPEARED....Wife&#x27;s coustn was visiting  and had several bruises on her arms  she put some on her arms for 3 days and reduced her bruises considerably before she returned to Oklahoma...She purchased her some in Okla.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle cream at all, used daily for weeks w/ no visible signs of improvement. Nice scent.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of lessening the bruises on the back of  my hands.  Have been using Arnica for years now and like the lotion better than the roll on.</li>
            <li> GREAT!! Removes bruises quickly!! Also has been good to help remove brown spots from hands and arms! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Cream seems to prevent bruises and bump marks from appearing as often when I bump my arms &amp; hands. The cream also has helped kept my skin from being dry and rough. I have used the cream for only a couple of weeks but am pleased with the results so far, will definitely reorder more  to see if results keep improving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month, and about to order two more containers.  It is without a doubt an incredible product, one that truly works.  A little dab goes a long way.  I have Venous Stasis, and developed an odd swelling above my left ankle in May.  The skin felt tender to the touch and had an overall reddish coloring.  I tried ice, but it was only temporary.  In June, I discovered this product by accident while browsing through Amazon.  Based on reviews, it seemed worth trying.  I was pleased to find going on was painless, it was in fact soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost immediately, within days, I saw something positive happening, as there was a reduction to the swelling and the intensity of the red. I stopped using the cream for awhile, and the condition continues to improve.  The most recent is a reddening to my right calf, along with a bruising color.  I applied the cream yesterday, and today, there was improvement.  Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad fall about a week ago and because of blood thinner medications I&#x27;m on I both bleed and bruise way too easily.  My fall created some enormous bruises on my leg and although I&#x27;d never heard of Arnica before, some research led me to this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the past several days and I&#x27;ve noticed that my bruises are noticeably fading pretty quickly. I can&#x27;t speak to whether there is scientific evidence behind this particular therapy or not because I haven&#x27;t found that evidence, but I can say that this product is soothing and smells nice and it absorbs well.  My body doesn&#x27;t normally &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; bruises this fast by itself though and so for that reason I tend to believe that there is something to it after all.  I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Speeds true bruise healing if applied early and often. However, it has only moderate success on bruise-like spots due to thin skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.....went back to using DMSO which works great on all bruises.</li>
            <li> THis cream has a great texture, doesnâ€™t smell and really seems to calm inflammation and soothe soreness. I used it on my husbands back it helped a lot (and heâ€™s picky) I also use in on my feet after a long day! Bought some for my dads sore knees too!</li>
            <li> I  have been using this for some time because of medication for arthritis which causes the bruising.</li>
            <li> Nice creamy texture, very pleasant lite smell, and it works like a miracle.  Usually my bruises last weeks- got rid of a brand new bruise in 3 to 4 days!  Couldn&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li> I like the cream and I don&#x27;t really notice the smell as I&#x27;m trying it on my arms.  It does seem to speed the healing of red spots caused by my little dogs&#x27; scratches and the medications I take.</li>
            <li> Not so sure this is effective. Have used it about a week and can;t tell any difference....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using about 4 times per day on bruises and it has had only a minor effect, almost not noticeable.  I almost think that the dissipation of the bruises is normal with or without the bruise cream.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that really works.</li>
            <li> Tried this product for 3 months and still no difference.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> To me this is a 5-star product!  This is my second order.  It has certainly has made my therapy (to regain the use of my hands) much less painful. I put it on before, after, and during the therapy as many times as I want.... no problems.  I am much more likely to do all the exercises if the pain level is tolerable!!!  This does the trick for me.  It is affordable and has no side effects that I can find.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect miracles but after using for two days my bruises are darker!,</li>
            <li> I bruise easily, especially on my arms.  The bruises disappear much more rapidly when I use this cream.</li>
            <li> This really doesn&#x27;t do what its advertised to do.  I saw absolutely no difference in using this on minor hand and forearm bruises after using it for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;06/07/15 Update.  I have continued using this cream and it has continued not to provide any effect on everyday bruises and hasn&#x27;t reduced recovery time.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over a week since I started using this cream for bruises on my legs. They have not faded one bit. I&#x27;ll keep trying but as of now I believe I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> Seems to help bruise to clear up faster</li>
            <li> not sure it was any better than Vaseline intensive care.</li>
            <li> It does work, just wish it was a little faster in getting rid of bruising.</li>
            <li> Actually does what it advertises.  Just need a bigger bottle!!</li>
            <li> This feels so good on my skin, and it actually feels better, my skin seems smoother and less irritated</li>
            <li> I had a bad bruise 7&amp;#34; x 4&amp;#34;. I had this bruise for a week before I started using this product. It was almost black in some areas to a dark blue color.&lt;br /&gt;After 24 hours the center of bruise had lighten significantly, about an inch in diameter. As days when by, the very light blue in the center the bruise&lt;br /&gt;expanded to the perimeter of the bruise. After 6 days it was hard to detect where the bruise was. It works. First day or so I applied it about every two to three hours. Then about  4 to 6 times a day. I exercise 6 days a week and drink at least 60 oz of H20 a day this may have helped but as I said I had the bruise for a week  with no significant change.</li>
            <li> Ordered one bottle and in two weeks chronic bruising were gone. Also staves away new bruises from reoccurring. Ordered four more bottles!</li>
            <li> Work great for bruises.  Helps reduce discoloration in 2 days.</li>
            <li> Did nothing to lessen bruises</li>
