            <li>so i&#x27;m assuming I did good.</li>
            <li>it looks good for any occasion.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this makeup!</li>

            <li>Love this palette!</li>
            <li>I love the color combinations!</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute, the colors are fairly pigmented,</li>

            <li>The color stays bold all day, goes on smooth,blends easily and always looks perfect.</li>
            <li>I love love love this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s $50, so $14 more, but you get more colors, the shadows are better quality (creamier and smoother), and it comes with a nice brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you get this, make sure to put a tissue under your eyes to catch the fall-out or you&#x27;ll look like a disco ball.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite, but I wanted this color scheme for night time.</li>
            <li>I use six of the shades the most.</li>
            <li>It is so wonderfully stunning that I use it all the time.</li>
            <li>Love this palette.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the colors in this palette, but there is a lot of fallout on your face.</li>
            <li>I love Too Faced products, and love this night collection.</li>
            <li>It stays on longer than most eyeshadows I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>the eyeshadows are so smooth and pigmented!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>If you love neutral eyeshadow colors this is for you.</li>
            <li>Love this set.</li>
            <li>and I love that set too.</li>
            <li>I use lots of too faced products and these are top notch</li>
            <li>Every single color is beautiful!  </li>
            <li>This is a very cool set.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous palette and I love it on my light olive skin and brown eyes.</li>
            <li>Great colors applies easy and smooth lasts all day and has easy direction to do different things and designs to your eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Night Light:  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>the packaging is great if you are low on storage.</li>
            <li>She was really happy when she opened her present.</li>
            <li>It was bought as a present and my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li>I wore it more over the summer because I was very tan</li>
            <li>I have other Too Faced Collections and this one is not that great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super pleased and would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>This is only a good palette if you already have a nice collection of eyeshadow and you want something to throw in your purse when you&#x27;re going out of town and know you&#x27;ll be partying (and you have the patience to deal with massive fallout).  </li>
            <li>I love too faced eyeshadow better then any other shadow&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li>the UD Naked Palette is just better in my opinion in terms of pigmentation, ease of application, and blending.</li>
            <li>Then I read the return policy and of course I can&#x27;t return it because its makeup, but how could I have been sure of the colors until I actually tried them.</li>
            <li>I own one other set of eye shadows from them</li>
            <li>I love all the other Two-Faced shadows, but this one just doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>The colors are similar between UD Naked and TF Natural at Night (warm browns and champagnes) but the Urban Decay colors are shimmers (I love shimmers) and many of the shads in the Too Faced Naked at Night palette are glitters.  </li>

            <li>Amazing colors, a little darker than pictures</li>
            <li>find that I don&#x27;t use this palette much.  </li>
            <li>Way too much sparkley stuff that gets all over - &amp;</li>
            <li>but I do not use it as much as my Too Faced Smokey Eye collection...</li>
            <li>but once I received the product I realized that I was paying for a quality product and then the price didn&#x27;t bother me so much.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with Urban Decay&#x27;s \\&quot;Midnight Cowgirl\\&quot; shadow family you&#x27;ll get the picture.  </li>
            <li>You can definitely make some work appropriate looks, but these are more glittery than shimmery, making it a bit juvenile.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Updated:  I am still experimenting with this palette (I brought it in my makeup bag on vacation and left my UD Naked palette at home) and I&#x27;ve definitely created some nice looks that are completely appropriate for daily life.  </li>

            <li>My issue is that many of the colors are very glittery - I like shimmery shadows, but we are talking big chunks of glitter here in several of the colors.  </li>
            <li>I also have the Urban Decay Naked palette and the colors are MUCH better, as is the quality of the shadows.  </li>
            <li>Personally I think Naked is also a better deal.  </li>
            <li>the UD Naked Palette is just better in my opinion in terms of pigmentation, ease of application, and blending.isn&#x27;t a palette that has an obvious place in my makeup</li>
            <li>Some colors have a lot of shimmer, so if you are not big on that than try the more matte palettes that Urban Decay and the like have.</li>
            <li>This is my FAVORITE pallette hands down!  </li>
            <li>Let me preface this by saying that the colors are pretty and generally well pigmented (I use it with Too Faced Shadow Insurance).  </li>
            <li>I have the Natural Eyes, that has daytime looks.</li>
            <li>A natural look but a look that tells you you are wearing</li>
            <li>This collection is definitely the high quality that Too Faced make-up is well known for!</li>
            <li>I have the Naked one and the Natural one.</li>
            <li>I really love this pallet however it came a little messy and</li>
            <li>At first I taught the price was a little steep</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love this makeup! It actually stays on all day and night unlike everything else I&#x27;ve bought. A little pricey but lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying that the colors are pretty and generally well pigmented (I use it with Too Faced Shadow Insurance).  My issue is that many of the colors are very glittery - I like shimmery shadows, but we are talking big chunks of glitter here in several of the colors.  If you&#x27;re familiar with Urban Decay&#x27;s \\&quot;Midnight Cowgirl\\&quot; shadow family you&#x27;ll get the picture.  Basically the entire palette is gliterry, except for two matte shades. If you get this, make sure to put a tissue under your eyes to catch the fall-out or you&#x27;ll look like a disco ball.  I&#x27;m talking serious fall-out here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Moon: Glittery Champagne&lt;br /&gt;Night Light:  Supremely Glittery rosey pink (this one has a chalky texture, making it impossible to apply without massive fallout.)&lt;br /&gt;Spotlight: Matte Beige&lt;br /&gt;Nightcap: Shimmery medium tan&lt;br /&gt;After Hours:  Chalky glittery medium beige&lt;br /&gt;Moonstone:  Glittery deep tan&lt;br /&gt;Cocoa Star:  Matte chocolate brown&lt;br /&gt;Eclipse: Glittery Chestnut brown&lt;br /&gt;Night Fever: Glittery Chocolate brown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives:  The packaging is cute, the colors are fairly pigmented, Too Faced includes looks cards so you can get ideas on looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives:  This is only a good palette if you already have a nice collection of eyeshadow and you want something to throw in your purse when you&#x27;re going out of town and know you&#x27;ll be partying (and you have the patience to deal with massive fallout).  You can definitely make some work appropriate looks, but these are more glittery than shimmery, making it a bit juvenile.  Some of the shadows are chalky too. I also have the Urban Decay Naked palette and the colors are MUCH better, as is the quality of the shadows.  Personally I think Naked is also a better deal.  It&#x27;s $50, so $14 more, but you get more colors, the shadows are better quality (creamier and smoother), and it comes with a nice brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I don&#x27;t use this palette much.  It isn&#x27;t a palette that has an obvious place in my makeup collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated:  I am still experimenting with this palette (I brought it in my makeup bag on vacation and left my UD Naked palette at home) and I&#x27;ve definitely created some nice looks that are completely appropriate for daily life.  I just don&#x27;t LOVE it.  The problem is, I have the Urban Decay Naked palette.  The colors are similar between UD Naked and TF Natural at Night (warm browns and champagnes) but the Urban Decay colors are shimmers (I love shimmers) and many of the shads in the Too Faced Naked at Night palette are glitters.  That makes the TF colors much harder to work with due to fallout.  Ultimately, this palette is 3.5 stars to me.  It has nice colors and you can create some great looks (provided you put tissue under your eyes to catch the fallout), but the UD Naked Palette is just better in my opinion in terms of pigmentation, ease of application, and blending.isn&#x27;t a palette that has an obvious place in my makeup collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated:  I am still experimenting with this palette (I brought it in my makeup bag on vacation and left my UD Naked palette at home) and I&#x27;ve definitely created some nice looks that are completely appropriate for daily life.

            <li> The colors looked nothing like they do in the pallete on my face. Way too much sparkley stuff that gets all over - &amp; that&#x27;s coming from someone who likes shimmery shadown. Then I read the return policy and of course I can&#x27;t return it because its makeup, but how could I have been sure of the colors until I actually tried them. I love all the other Two-Faced shadows, but this one just doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my eye shadow!  Very happy with the whole process from ordering it, to receiving it!  Can&#x27;t rave enough about this product!</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for this product so I found it on Amazon and ordered it for her. She is very happy with it and so am I. It&#x27;s very nice and a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I have the Natural Eyes, that has daytime looks. It&#x27;s my favorite, but I wanted this color scheme for night time. I absolutely love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing colors, a little darker than pictures but I still like them</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous palette and I love it on my light olive skin and brown eyes. There is a mixture of matte, sheen, and shimmer eye shadow shades.  I use six of the shades the most. The other three shimmer shades are a little too glittery for my mature 50 -something eyes and have a lot of fall out, but that didn&#x27;t deter me from buying it. It is so wonderfully stunning that I use it all the time. Love this palette. One of my favorites.    see my full review on my channel: [...]</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter-in-law for Christmas , She loves it! This is about all she uses and was thrilled to receive it</li>
            <li> I bought it for recomendación of a friénd i use everything day , i like the quolity of this product and the efects that i can reach in my face</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful pallet that I return to again and again.  A natural look but a look that tells you you are wearing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always run out of one shade...  And that is frustrating.  This is my third purchase of this item.  It is very difficult to find at ULTA...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super pleased and would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Great colors applies easy and smooth lasts all day and has easy direction to do different things and designs to your eyes.</li>
            <li> I really love this pallet however it came a little messy and the pots looked like they had been replaced...</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loved it. She is singer in a nightclub (extra word. Dumb requirement for reviews)</li>
            <li> It was bought as a present and my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the colors in this palette, but there is a lot of fallout on your face. The colors have shimmer/almost glitter-like in them. I expected that since it&#x27;s a night collection. They have staying power and the price isn&#x27;t bad for the size of the palette. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love Too Faced products, and love this night collection. It stays on longer than most eyeshadows I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE pallette hands down!  Every single color is beautiful!  They all can go together too!  I wear this at least twice a week (which is a lot for me).  The pigment is great and with a primer it lasts all day and is beautiful all day.  I may need to buy another one!</li>
            <li> The colors in this are absolutely beautiful! This collection is definitely the high quality that Too Faced make-up is well known for!</li>
            <li> I have other Too Faced Collections and this one is not that great. The glitter gets all over your cheeks when you are trying to out on the base color. It&#x27;s not a good look for day/work. I will keep it but I do not use it as much as my Too Faced Smokey Eye collection...</li>
            <li> This is a very cool set.  Colors are great and you can mix them.  Never goes out of style! love it</li>
            <li> Love this palette! the eyeshadows are so smooth and pigmented! I love the color combinations! Easy to blend and a lot of beautiful looks to create!</li>
            <li> I use this palette every day! I absolutely love it. The color are perfect for my brown eyes. You can make a natural look or a dramatic look with these colors! Too Faced is the best :)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing about this pallet. If you love neutral eyeshadow colors this is for you. It has the perfect mix of shimmer and matte eyeshadow and the packaging is great if you are low on storage.</li>
            <li> Love this set. Too Faced eye shadows are great . I own one other set of eye shadows from them and I love that set too. At first I taught the price was a little steep but once I received the product I realized that I was paying for a quality product and then the price didn&#x27;t bother me so much. I will be giving two other set to family members for Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> I like Too Faced palettes. I have the Naked one and the Natural one. Both are great and I use them often. Some colors have a lot of shimmer, so if you are not big on that than try the more matte palettes that Urban Decay and the like have.</li>
            <li> I love love love this! I wore it more over the summer because I was very tan but this stuff is great!!!</li>
            <li> one of the best deals on Amazon, this amazing eye shadow compact doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I use lots of too faced products and these are top notch</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas Gift. On my niece Amazon wish list. She was really happy when she opened her present.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this non stop. She likes it so i&#x27;m assuming I did good. Hopefully this helps the rest of yall</li>
            <li> I love too faced eyeshadow better then any other shadow&#x27;s out there. The color stays bold all day, goes on smooth,blends easily and always looks perfect. I hate eyeshadow that looks faded and cheap and too faced makes great quality eyeshadow. I use this for the day or night..it looks good for any occasion.</li>
