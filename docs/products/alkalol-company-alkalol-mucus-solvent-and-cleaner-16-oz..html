            <li>I found the taste and smell to be very strong with an after taste</li>
            <li>Feels good, better clean feeling and lasts longer than the leading competitors</li>
            <li>I tried diluting the product more than recommended but still couldn&#x27;t get used to the taste.</li>
            <li>I love this solution.</li>
            <li>But I leaves a refreshing feeling afterward.</li>
            <li>Has camphor which causes more congestion than it relieves. ...</li>
            <li>It opens my sinuses better than anything else I have ever tried.</li>

            <li>I use it at night and sleep so much better.</li>
            <li>Been using this for years and attribute my good health (in part) to consistent use.</li>
            <li>Good old fashioned amazing.  </li>
            <li>Clears me up and breath easy</li>
            <li>Saline is fine for that.</li>
            <li>maybe just maybe I will be allergy symptom free this fall.</li>
            <li>This product is doing a good job so far.</li>
            <li>It is also good in a steam, for clear breathing.</li>
            <li>After finishing the first bottle, I ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Alkalol for years, with an eye dropper, in each nostril, at full strength; no problems.  </li>
            <li>May be too strong for some, but it will really make a difference.  </li>
            <li>It is a refreshing way to clear sinus issues.</li>
            <li>BUT I recently had a mild sinus infection then got a flu/cold on top of that.</li>
            <li>It is not a cure for me but a good aid to help clear the sinus, especially before bed.</li>
            <li>Delivery service from this company was fast!</li>
            <li>but neti use is a big turn off for most people.</li>
            <li>PS: if you do not have a fancy machine, an empty Ocean bottle would work nicely.</li>
            <li>Once I got rid of the virus (quickly with homeopathic remedies), i found this aggravated the mild infection to full blown complete with facial pain and ear pressure on one side.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Really helpful.</li>
            <li>Didnt feel much relief after using it either</li>
            <li>It will not drain much but don&#x27;t worry about that.</li>
            <li>The formula is very soothing to inflamed nasal passages.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>A nice change of pace from the usual saline.</li>
            <li>I like using this product particularly in allergy season.  </li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s all normal.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I did and do not find this product useful or necessary for normal maintenance cleansing for people with sinus issus</li>
            <li>Users can adjust the strength by using more or less mixed with water.</li>
            <li>If using in a neti pot, be sure to use in a saline solution as their website recommends, otherwise it may burn (I learned the hard way).</li>
            <li>Great in a neti pot for sinus and cold ailments</li>
            <li>Makes your sinus clear and refreshed</li>
            <li>Keeps my husbands sinuses clear during allergy season.</li>
            <li>Alkalol works like a charm to clear my nasal passages.  </li>
            <li>All natural, once even received a written letter from his grandson attesting to the strict QC of this product.  </li>
            <li>It really helped during a recent sinus infection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like the manufacturer to make some individual packets or TSA-friendly packaging.</li>
            <li>Tingly but not overwhelming unless you mix it too strong.</li>
            <li>Start with a low dose to assess your tolerance-it&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; as my young son says.</li>
            <li>some folks have used it full strength and haved learned a lesson the hard way.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Alkalol for years, with an eye dropper, in each nostril, at full strength; no problems.  This is a formula compounded in year 1896, by a Taunton, MA. pharmacist, Mr.James P Withers.  All natural, once even received a written letter from his grandson attesting to the strict QC of this product.  Nothing harmful in it, has proven to be that good after almost 120 years. May be too strong for some, but it will really make a difference.  Just try it.</li>
            <li> My ENT recommended this.  It works for me.  Haven&#x27;t had a sinus infection since I started using it.  If using in a neti pot, be sure to use in a saline solution as their website recommends, otherwise it may burn (I learned the hard way).</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. This is terrible stuff. It burns my nose so bad. I even diluted it about 95 percent water and it still burned. Would not recommend this product even though my ENT did.</li>
            <li> A nice change of pace from the usual saline.</li>
            <li> This has been a great product for me.  Some nights I have a hard time breathing through my nose.  I use Alkalol before I go to bed once a week and I am good to go.  Really helpful.</li>
            <li> I found the taste and smell to be very strong with an after taste thas I found unpleasant. This product is best for those who enjoy strong types of mouth washes. I tried diluting the product more than recommended but still couldn&#x27;t get used to the taste. I will wait for a month or so and then try again.</li>
            <li> I love this solution. Makes your sinus clear and refreshed</li>
            <li> This stuff is an awesome addition to saline nasal rinses. It really helped during a recent sinus infection. Start with a low dose to assess your tolerance-it&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; as my young son says. But I leaves a refreshing feeling afterward.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for my allergies and keeps sinus infections at bay. I use it in my neti pot. Delivery service from this company was fast! Will order again.</li>
            <li> Incredible product, get off the nose sprays forever!! 30 years of sinus swelling and nasal sprays and now it&#x27;s all normal. WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Best stuff you will ever use for sinusitis!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for opening up stuffy sinuses. I mix 1/3 Alkalol with 2/3 previously boiled and cooled water, put in a sterilized nasal sprayer for use.</li>
            <li> Clears me up and breath easy</li>
            <li> Has camphor which causes more congestion than it relieves. ... Stick to the sodium packets that are availabel.</li>
            <li> Have always had sinus problems, tried a lot of products. This product is doing a good job so far.</li>
            <li> THis stuff is awesome! Tingly but not overwhelming unless you mix it too strong. It opens my sinuses better than anything else I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Feels good, better clean feeling and lasts longer than the leading competitors ( Ne** M*d) product.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this nasal wash. It is a refreshing way to clear sinus issues. Users can adjust the strength by using more or less mixed with water.</li>
            <li> The best, time-tested sinus cleaner and mucus remover, ever.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my husband&#x27;s ENT, he likes using this product. He used to rinse his sinus&#x27; with water mixed with salt and baking soda. This is more convenient &amp; my husband prefers it. After finishing the first bottle, I ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li> Works great, very soothing.</li>
            <li> Great in a neti pot for sinus and cold ailments</li>
            <li> Works a awesome.  Keeps my husbands sinuses clear during allergy season.</li>
            <li> best nasal irrigation addition.  soothing and great when exposed to allergens.  love it.</li>
            <li> amazing for my sinuses</li>
            <li> You got nasal problems? Alkolol is the best additive to a saline wash. Just get it.</li>
            <li> Good Product. Cheaper in the store if you pay shipping.</li>
            <li> Quite a few years ago a friend told me this is how his Mother fouught off sinutitus &amp; other sinus isssues.  When i start feeling&lt;br /&gt;my sinuses are starting to give me problems I use this with a shringe &amp; wash it thoroughly each time.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and attribute my good health (in part) to consistent use. Once a week in warm months and twice in cold ones. Tell everyone about it but neti use is a big turn off for most people. I look forward to using it every time. Be careful and read directions...some folks have used it full strength and haved learned a lesson the hard way. Recommend 4:1 then work up to 3:1.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works for me. After trying it in a few hours I ve got a fever. Not sure if it was the reason. But have not tryed it after that again. Didnt feel much relief after using it either</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; service</li>
            <li> Want to find a way to avoid that spring sinus attack and infection?  This is a must have for you nasel rinsers. I sing on broadway and this is a must in my community</li>
            <li> Good old fashioned amazing.  Alkalol works like a charm to clear my nasal passages.  It is also good in a steam, for clear breathing.</li>
            <li> this product is excellent for clearing sinuses</li>
            <li> Great for those of us who suffer sinus ailments. Please keep in stock.</li>
            <li> not refrring to the price here tho. I bought from amazon but at almost half this price?!? But as opposed to a doctor visit and 2 weeks of antibiotics... Anyway, I did and do not find this product useful or necessary for normal maintenance cleansing for people with sinus issus BUT I recently had a mild sinus infection then got a flu/cold on top of that. Once I got rid of the virus (quickly with homeopathic remedies), i found this aggravated the mild infection to full blown complete with facial pain and ear pressure on one side. Since the infection is bacterial now, time for antibiotics but not interested so I tried a couple of things to no avail. But somebody on the internet (either here or in a blog) mentioned mixing 2/3 cup Alkolol with 1 cup saline (I use NeilMed packets) and to use 2-3 oz at a time. Since I had the Alkalol bottle lying around, I tried this. I made the mixture in a mason jar and kept in the fridge and warmed up a couple ounces at a time and used in my sinupulse machine. Between the burn of this &#x27;vicks&#x27; mixture and my already sore sinuses, I changed to a mist spray. After 2 small treatments, pressure on ear was gone and pressure on face was diminishing a bit. I treated every few hours and tried to nap a lot. Within 1 day I had newfound energy already. So I heartily recommend this product for medicinal use but still have to say nah to regular use. Saline is fine for that. PS: if you do not have a fancy machine, an empty Ocean bottle would work nicely. It is not necessary to FLUSH for a long time but you DO want to get quite a bit of the mix up there. It will not drain much but don&#x27;t worry about that. It is working. After all, it is an antiseptic.</li>
            <li> Great stuff- maybe just maybe I will be allergy symptom free this fall.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that since my doctor told me to use this everyday I have not gotten a sinus infection. I used to get them every other month!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for some years now and find it helps to alleviate symptoms from a chronic sinus problem without the side effects of other drugs. It is not a cure for me but a good aid to help clear the sinus, especially before bed.</li>
            <li> My brother recommended this to me as I was getting sick with bad colds after each visit with my 7 months old granddaughter over several months time.My brother has not been sick with colds for 8 years and he had young children.  I have been using since June so for two months have not gotten sick.  Very happy!  My husband has also begun using Alkalol as well.  He has allergies so double duty in his case (no colds, no allergies).</li>
            <li> Alkalol is a life saver for me following serious nasal and sinus surgery. I use it fault with a saline rinse and it is effective at clearing congestion. I use it at night and sleep so much better. (I heart it also helps reduce my snoring!) This is a great addition to the neti pot routine.</li>
            <li> I like using this product particularly in allergy season.  The formula is very soothing to inflamed nasal passages. I&#x27;d really like the manufacturer to make some individual packets or TSA-friendly packaging.</li>
