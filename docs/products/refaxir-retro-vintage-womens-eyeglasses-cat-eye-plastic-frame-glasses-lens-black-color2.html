            <li> They are perfect for my face! I was at the mall 2 weeks looking for glasses like these, found one that cost $300. Like....no. These glasses is so worth the buy! Im also buying it in black. They are a little oversized, which makes it cute :) got so much compliments.</li>

            <li> Great quality, especially given the price.  I have a similar pair in black that I like a lot, and these look even better on me (the color probably matches my skin tone a bit better).  Would totally recommend these glasses.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! this frame thinking about getting another pair. It&#x27;s exactly as the pic if not better. I had my prescription put in and work out perfectly. I highly recommend this frame. It&#x27;s light without being flimsy. Attractive looking. 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Very cat eye and OVERSIZED. Check the pictures because the one of the mannequin head shows that they are oversized. Anyway, not for the small faced. The glass has somewhat of a haze over it and I&#x27;m not too fond of that but can&#x27;t go wrong with a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Nice item for the price!</li>

The price was crazy-i thought they would look cheap but they do not-glam is great.  I purchased a different pair in black, that is how much I love them!!! I would recommend this Diva stylish eye ware to anyone.  I makes people that a double, even triple look at you, and the ask where did you get those, how much did they cost, what brand (i.e Gucci or what).  I simple smile.  Look great in short or long hair style. I know because I tried them on-stylin and profilin my wigs- you know given my face that sexxy space, and come hither look and stare!</li>
