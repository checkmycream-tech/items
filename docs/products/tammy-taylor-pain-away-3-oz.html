            <li> I love this product!  I received it quickly; it consists of a combination of natural ingredients; and it&#x27;s effective in giving quick relief from pain, etc.</li>
            <li> This was a gift purchase for a friend - she had used it before and really found relief for pain with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tammy Taylor spray pain away solution for pain in a knee I injured and an ankle I broke last winter.  I find that the pain is gone within moments of application.  I offered it to my sister when she had pain in a hip.  She was so impressed that she wanted some for herself. My recent order was a gift for my sister.  My sister&#x27;s daughter suffers migrane headaches.  Application of Tammy Taylor spray pain away actually relieved the pain of one recent migrane episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> It is nice because it does give u a quick instant relief. I would recommend to anyone especially suffering any sort of muscle pain</li>
            <li> pain relief. wonderful for any type of joint or muscle pain. wish it came in a larger size. totally fixes what ails you</li>
            <li> I really love this product and use it for many different things including as a mosquito repellant. I really need it for my arthritic neck. It&#x27;s a shame that the price keeps going up and up, though. It is grossly overpriced on many sites, so I hunt around until I can purchase it more reasonably. The price has doubled and then some, and the bottle has shrunk. Be careful TammyTaylor, because you will price yourself right out of the market!</li>

            <li> Does the job every time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when my trainer recommended this for muscle related injuries and aches and pains in general.  I have used it for about a year now and it has always worked.  Knees, back, neck and shoulders, it works on everything.  Just be careful about spraying it near your face.  :-)</li>
