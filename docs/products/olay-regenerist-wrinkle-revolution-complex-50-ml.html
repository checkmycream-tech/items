    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was really impressed with the results of this lotion, but I had to stop using it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent customer service!  </li>
            <li>Primer that is so so beautiful!</li>
            <li>best of all, I have noticed an improvement in the appearance of my *</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t happen overnight, but it did happen, and I am really happy with the results!  </li>
            <li>I am impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>Great product - way to go, Olay!</li>
            <li>Another great product!</li>
            <li>However, she may be as impressed with quality of moisturization that I was.    </li>
            <li>There were some complaints about the &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; mechanism on the container in some reviews I read, but mine works perfectly.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it!</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ll be happy to help!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, the product feels and smells great on your skin.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, after using it twice a day for two to three weeks, I can update this review with happy results.  </li>
            <li>Although everyone&#x27;s skin sensitivities and allergies may differ, none of our \\&quot;test panel\\&quot; of users experienced any allergic reactions, rashes, or itchiness from using this</li>

            <li>This product goes on very light and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>but the lotion is amazing!  </li>
            <li>இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies!</li>
            <li>I have been searching the internet for the best OTC wrinkle creams and OLAY has been at the top.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;you look relaxed, bright,</li>
            <li>Both of these should do a good job in tandem, depending on your skin needs.</li>
            <li>This Olay product is the best available.</li>
            <li>The price is fair too.</li>
            <li>I gave up a good skin care system&#x27;s lotion to try this product.  </li>
            <li>This got a good review in O magazine.</li>
            <li>Olay is a good product.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time and just bought a couple from Amazon because of the good price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good.</li>
            <li>must be good</li>
            <li>This is a good choice for a wrinkle cream in the median price range.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great under makeup and alone and the texture is really nice.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li>but it is really good.</li>
            <li>i find the olay regenerist cream very pleasant and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>Love the product, smells good and makes my face feel great</li>
            <li>have used Olay products for a while (Tottal Effects, Regenerist, Pro X) and was always very pleased.  </li>
            <li>using Olay products for years and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very many wrinkles</li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for two days, and it may be my imagination, but my eyes are looking better already!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>, it does absorb very quick and great for under make up or for non make up days ..</li>
            <li>It smoothes on like pure silk and feels AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>and I am very impressed and will certainly replace when it is gone.    </li>
            <li>Love , love ,love and very good price</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is great under make-up.</li>
            <li>It has a velvet like consistency that doesn&#x27;t float on the surface of the skin, which was quite nice.</li>
            <li>That was nice, and probably formulated for 20 something skin.  </li>
            <li>product smells good and has an interesting \\&quot;feel\\&quot; to it.  </li>
            <li>I liked that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It deserves honest, consumer-friendly packaging.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has a nice creamy feel and smell to it.  </li>
            <li>I liked it a lot and always use it now- holds up well all day.</li>
            <li>(kind of doubt that),</li>
            <li>The product states there is a \\&quot;cashmere\\&quot; feel, and I suppose that is what I&#x27;m attempting to describe, but I truly noticed it and liked the feeling.</li>
            <li>It is not at all greasy and leaves my skin feeling really nice, but I haven&#x27;t noticed improvement in the lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Olay for another great skincare product!</li>
            <li>The product is good but the top of the jar for squeezing it out did not work.  </li>
            <li>They are rich creams, over all fairly hypo-allergenic, and do the job they promise at a good and affordable price.</li>
            <li>My crows feet are slowly becoming teeny-weeny!</li>
            <li>MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream No.23 Natural Beige SPF42 PA+++ (50ml)]]</li>
            <li>She did not have any problems with the pump mechanism, but it&#x27;s nice to see that Olay responded to the many concerns and has changed the pump design.</li>
            <li>I do love the way it feels on my skin, but don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>It does not diminish my lines, but it might work on very fine lines.</li>
            <li>Nice, clean scent and penetrates skin nicely, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start off with the positive: this Regenerist product is great when used to spot treat problem areas.  </li>
            <li>I never had tried before a product that leaves that smooth feeling over my skin and the smell is smooth and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Sure, this product does help reduce the appearance of wrinkles, but I dislike the residue it leaves on my skin.  </li>
            <li>, I would rate this as OK, but not the aging revolution that&#x27;s promised.  </li>
            <li>What I found works best is to tap the container on its top (on red, metallic over-cap) before removing the cap.</li>
            <li>So, we&#x27;re confident you won&#x27;t experience this problem if you choose to try the product</li>
            <li>I will buy again but am hoping for a better container.</li>
            <li>But the serum sounds like it would do a better job</li>
            <li>Most of my moisturizers and night cream are 1.7 oz</li>
            <li>I noticed the cream squishing out of the top of the container, where the pump lid is attached.  </li>
            <li>Well,I ve been trying these product for more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li>only caution is to not get pump happy!  </li>
            <li>at their price point I think they are a better value than most.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels better and looks moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love the way this feels on my skin (around the eyes), not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>In spite of Olay claiming that they had improved the situation, I wasn&#x27;t able to get the pump to work and have torn the thing apart in order to use the product.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy it again, and this seller was excellent.</li>
            <li>Have always been pleased with all of the Olay products I have used.</li>
            <li>Ok as a moisturiser</li>
            <li>Unlike most wrinkle-reducers that you apply before makeup, it doesn&#x27;t tighten your skin.  </li>
            <li>I like most that the product is not oily.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this product unless you can check to make sure it has the product in it.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and used what went on the sink, but it was much, much more than I needed.  </li>
            <li>I have to break the top cover to pieces to get the cream.</li>
            <li>I love this product but the fact that i use it twice a day and it is gone in two weeks makes me think that this is a scam.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I will definetly be purchasing more of this from now on.  </li>
            <li>I used the product (didn&#x27;t love the name:&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it seems to smell better to me than ANEW.  </li>
            <li>The price of this though is much more pleasing than the mall brands.</li>
            <li>Saw raves about this on Consumers Digest 5 years ago, how it&#x27;s better than $300 creams.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better after using this for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>I love the way this feels and because of the &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; it gives my skin  </li>
            <li>It feels silky smooth on my skin and does diminish the appearance of wrinkles without leaving any kind of residue that rubs off or flakes.</li>
            <li>Use on my neck and chest area and love the change in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have been able to get rid of those squinch marks between my eyebrows with this.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Guess I will be doing some more research on another anti-wrinkle fighter.</li>
            <li>Not too sure yet.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than a year</li>
            <li>I think that the amount of correction from this  product made speaks volumes about how potent this product is.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The difference I noticed after the first 2 weeks of use was remarkable.</li>
            <li>I keep buying it because I love the product...</li>
            <li>I honestly Love This Stuff.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels on my skin</li>
            <li>and I love how my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I decided to pop off the top</li>
            <li>I just ordered some more.</li>
            <li>I love how the Regenerist system works.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews I decided to try this one and was very excited to see results.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily absorbed and has a light, pleasant smell.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Olay is becoming better in</li>
            <li>the price was good though, but she had much higher hopes.</li>
            <li>and I find it lasts quite a long time, and gives me excellent smoothness and a &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; finish to my skin before applying powder.</li>
            <li>I had been using it 2 weeks before my wedding (for fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes), and when my best friend/maid of honor was in from Florida, she asked me out of the blue \\&quot;Did you get botox??\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>laugh lines and character crinkles!!  </li>
            <li>For years I have been searching for the perfect moisturizer - rich enough to hydrate, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I DID notice is that it went on smoothly, and felt fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin silky smooth and makeup goes on a lot better.</li>
            <li>What I really liked about this product, and noticed immediately, was the way it went on my skin and the quickness with which it was absorbed.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft and greatly reduces fine lines and discoloration.</li>
            <li>gave 4 stars to the original product, which I love.</li>
            <li>However, this lotion does feel nice and never too heavy, and it does a very good job under foundation, seeming to keep makeup from gathering in my deepest wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One needs a tube that can be easily squeezed, controlled and all product used.</li>
            <li>This is highly recommended on beautypedia.com for having all the good stuff you want/need in a face cream without an exorbinate pricetag.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smoothly and absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>after reading all of the positive reviews I was sure this would be THEE PRODUCT!.</li>
            <li>My face looks much smoother and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>My grandmother used them and always had such beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>The product helps reduce crows feet and fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>I think it works on fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both ANEW by AVON and Olay and can say that Olay does a fine job moisturizing the face.  </li>
            <li>I am 58 and have not really taken very good care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I never find that products claims are accurate, (</li>
            <li>It is not oily light.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I was just thinking I saw a reduction in wrinkles, but my forehead was noticeably smooth.  </li>
            <li>You need to put it on lightly.  </li>
            <li>It has a light perfume smell that dissipates within about 2 minutes after you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gotta get the free gift, if you know what I mean...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I picked this as an item that I could receive free of charge through the Vine Voice program...</li>
            <li>And yeah, it would be nice to see how much of the product you have left--but I will just always keep 2 on hand.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>My wife tried this product and liked it so much that she continues to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I recommend that you give this one a try if you are looking to smooth out some of those wrinkles.</li>
            <li>As with all makeup or beauty products, your skin&#x27;s reaction will be an important factor.</li>
            <li>Great product but the packaging is definitely an issue.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and soaks into skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, is not greasy or sticky, and I like the way it moisurizes.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin feel smooth and silky immediately after application, but with time you do notice a tightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I used it sparingly and will say it feels beautifully smooth to apply.  </li>
            <li>Goes on so smoothly</li>
            <li>Save your money; no results at all; it&#x27;s like using a cheap moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look smooth.</li>
            <li>but this sure feels good and&lt;br /&gt;helps as much as possible.</li>
            <li>It has a strong, albeit not unpleasant, fragrance that disappates after a time, but I dislike strongly fragranced beauty products.</li>
            <li>I began to notice a significant reduction in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>very slight fading at best.</li>
            <li>Their products are not only just as good as products at high end department stores a lot of times they are superior.</li>
            <li>And every time I&#x27;ve used it my makeup has not looked as smooth and flawless as usual-</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an Olay brand product and I am very impressed, this product is easy to apply, leaves my skin so soft and with a velvety feeling, doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue (completely zero)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Living in this dry mountain air, I always welcome any kind of moisturizing skin care, especially since I love being outside in the great outdoors and playing up in the mountains both during winter and summer.  </li>
            <li>And, boy was it worth it!</li>
            <li>Pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product... but only if they get the packaging fixed!</li>
            <li>(maybe mine wasn&#x27;t all the way full)</li>
            <li>Feel cheated that after two weeks and just using three pushes in the top lip that it would be gone so fast.  </li>
            <li>I do not have an opinion about the product yet, not having used it enough, but I do know that I won&#x27;t be buying it again no matter how good it is.  </li>
            <li>Under comments someone said just take the plunger top off the can and use straight from can.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice but has silicone in it which can cause problems for your skin if your sensitive or acne prone like me</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not a bad product--it does moisturize your face, but it didn&#x27;t decrease the lines on my face.</li>
            <li>Have been happy with all other Olay products purchased.</li>
            <li>The lotion is great, goes on smoothly, and really works on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>When I wear a full face of make-up, it does contain SPF, but I rarely wear a full face of make- up - perhaps 2 - 3 times a year.</li>
            <li>I discovered this Olay product through Beautypedia, where it is highly recommended for its ingredients and packaging, and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.</li>
            <li>Recently switched to this from the micro-sculpting cream based on reviews and am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>have noticed since beginning to use this product in place of my normal Neutrogena Healthy Defense that the skin on my neck and at the jawline feels a bit smoother.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a basic moisturizer backed by a company with LOTS of money who can hire a very convincing PR team.</li>
            <li>If you get this and the pump stops just pop off the top, it will stay fresh if you put the top back on.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I have enjoyed all the new line from Olay Regenerist line I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but I thought this would be okay since it is non-comedogenic.  </li>
            <li>Im pretty much getting dimethicones,silicones,nothing very benefical for my aging skin,I really love the olay regenerist line and highly recommend them to people to atleast give them a try,you really dont have to much to lose,and atleast their a great affordable price.</li>
            <li>This cream goes on smoothly, has no annoying fragrance, and makes my skin feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>this one more for younger skin with fine lines or for under make up as primer as it does not break up the make up as the others</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised with this product--my favorite of all the Olay products.</li>
            <li>Olay has a reputation for developing great skin products, especially for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>just laugh lines and some forehead lines.  </li>
            <li>if it was worth it</li>
            <li>The alternative is far more disagreeable.</li>
            <li>It has lessened some light lines around my eyes and I have been overall pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This blows the competition away - well worth the $20.</li>
            <li>you dont mind clipping coupons its worth going to the store.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, but for my money, it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>(I apply the product right after a shower in the morning, then let it absorb into my skin for about 30 mins before applying any make-up, and apply it again after cleansing my face at night.)  </li>
            <li>Some material in this cream doesn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li>Right now I habe this product placed in the over promised  column.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily</li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I observed carefully my amazing wrinkles before and after and concluded that while yes, the product did in fact reduce my wrinkles, they were still basically there.</li>
            <li>Over the past 6 months I have seen great improvement in the texture and evenness of my skin.</li>
            <li>This does help to smooth out fine lines, especially around the eye area and forehead region, and when used twice a day, our skin felt smoother and tighter.  </li>
            <li>I mean, my face literally shined in the light, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>Overall, its a fine product and the price doesn&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much of this product (like that very much)</li>
            <li>This may be just me as I don&#x27;t put very much product on my skin because of its sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Because of that, I would not use this product for daytime use; however, I would very much consider this product for a nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The #11 wrinkles between my eyebrows are only visible when I scowl, and the texture of my skin is now very smooth.  </li>
            <li>If your skin is not too sensitive, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>But I find myself just not using it much because other products like Este Lauder seem to do as good of a job and not have the super-greasy feel to them.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much but as I got into the fourth week of using it the product started to ooze out of the container between the top and bottom part of the container.  </li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t think worth what I paid for.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer seems to form more of a \\&quot;seal\\&quot; but I found that the Aveeno provides the same result with 2xday application at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have read the customers reviews at Amazon&#x27;s and Olay&#x27;s websites and found out that many people had had the same problem.  </li>
            <li>Since you were aware of the problem you should have recalled</li>
            <li>When I wear it during the day, I apply it first, then my moisturizer, then my makeup.  </li>
            <li>first, I was concerned, as it has a light fragrance to the liquid, and I am highly sensitive to fragrances, and I thought I might need to wash it off.  </li>
            <li>They used words like \\&quot;you look so pretty</li>
            <li>First of all, it does not contain 1.7 ounces as claimed.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was stuck, so I dismantled the bottle and there was only about a 1/2 teaspoon more inside.  </li>
            <li>So I used a screwdriver to pop off the top of the pump and low and behold, found an ample supply of lotion in the cap and in the container.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty confident that with continued use, I will continue to see improvement, so I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time</li>
            <li>Sometimes it seems like products work at first</li>
            <li>I especially like to use it on my hands because the product seems to make them look more youthful.</li>
            <li>First time using this product makes my make up go on smoother no wrinkles</li>
            <li>First time buyer of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I just bought my first bottle of this, and I have to say I&#x27;m amazed</li>
            <li>- it really does what it&#x27;s advertised to do!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to say this is a wonderful product, or even a mediocre product, but I still don&#x27;t know.   </li>
            <li>Avoid this one, though -- or make sure you keep the receipt in case it won&#x27;t open at all, like mine did.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was damaged and did not work after the first couple uses.  </li>
            <li>So I use it only once or twice a week, and put moisturizers on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much better my skin looked when I finally got to a mirror.</li>
            <li>First of all, it does not say &amp;#34;Instant Fix&amp;#34; anywhere on the package or bottle like it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li>Like many, I picked this up for my wife as she has become worried about small wrinkles that form on everyone past the age of 17 (You are as beautiful as the day we met honey!).</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re over 65 and people still compliment your skin, you know this product is for real!  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work any better than regular moisturizer</li>
            <li>It starts working the first day you use it.</li>
            <li>I ran out of the product and didn&#x27;t bother to reorder any more for over a 1/2 year until I noticed that the wrinkles were starting to return.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Wrinkle Revolution Complex with the skepticism of one who has been let down by many a \\&quot;wrinkle cream\\&quot;, but I have to say that, in my opinion, Olay has really created a great product with this one!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the reviews,that this wasnt rated a bit higher,I love this stuff,I use it daily as my primer,I actually rotate it with the regenerist serum,that one I use in the summer as my primer,it makes total sense to use these products as primers,it saves me a ton of money also,I used to use smashbox photo finish primer and all of these products have silicone in them,so I figured I might as well use the olay,it makes so much more sense,with the olay regenerist products as my primers Im getting great ingredients that actually help my skin,like peptides,and vitamin b3 with my 42$primer</li>
            <li>It felt a bit thicker and smelt different than the original one I purchased at the chemist!</li>
            <li>It instantly smooths the fine lines on my forehead, including the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34;, and gives my skin an overall fresher and more youthful tone.</li>
            <li>This particular complex is effective over night and the application pump is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love Olay&#x27;s products but have long been dissatified with the packaging.</li>
            <li>When the container became empty and would no longer pump out more lotion, I pried off the pump part and found that there was still some lotion left inside the tub that could have been extracted if it was dispensed from a more flexible squeeze tube.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much of a \\&quot;revolution\\&quot; is occurring on my face, my wrinkles seem to be pretty darned stubborn.</li>
            <li>While I love all the other Olay products, this one just seems to sit on the face without being absorbed.</li>
            <li>I was really optimistic about this product, which is why I was willing to pay the $25 price tag.</li>
            <li>In that case, you have to pry up the entire pump mechanism; the pump comes apart fairly easily after a bit of prying.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps It is my advanced age when first starting to use.  </li>
            <li>It certainly has given the appearance of softening the wrinkles around my eyes as well.</li>
            <li>A large amount of the product slopped into the sink and floor.  </li>
            <li>, really noticed my skin is softer and more firm, specially on my jaw line and around my lips.</li>
            <li>so I guess when it reaches a certain point it no longer has the pressure to get the rest of the product out.</li>
            <li>With use her skin is certainly shinier, but in all honesty, that is about it.</li>
            <li>When I called the number given, I was told to mail the product to a certain address.  </li>
            <li>I had not only noticed an increase in fine lines around my eyes recently, but fine and somewhat deeper lines around my lips.  </li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve tried this particular Olay product.</li>
            <li>thats kind of expencive for so little</li>
            <li>OLAY REGENEREST WRINKLE REVOLUTION is a pretty decent moisturizer that works like a primer, which is used to create a smooth palette and decrease facial oil so that foundation or powder goes on evenly and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had an empty Olay container and popped the top of and put this in it.</li>
            <li>It really reduced the wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid Ounces]], which is supposed to tighten the skin, and also seems to work as advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for under-eye wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Also, it seemed that the 1.7 Oz went really fast</li>
            <li>I FINISHED THE WHOLE BOTTLE</li>
            <li>I really like this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I am very please with the Olay product line.</li>
            <li>product was gentle to my skin so there was so \\&quot;brush burn\\&quot; feeling or redness.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t really expect it to, though--</li>
            <li>I really do dislike any creams or lotions that have a greasy feel to them, and this does.</li>
            <li>Just be gentle when smoothing on makeup so it won&#x27;t rub off-</li>
            <li>Once I had a problem with the pump; another time the whole can opened and splashed.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rate the real product I received from Amazon/Cosmetics Depot...</li>
            <li>I found that it was very drying if I used it as directed, twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really see any difference in my lines</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and moisturized and fresh</li>
            <li>reasonable expectations, this product will improve the appearance of lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>And it really seems to be ironing out the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Really did get rid of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The price range has had a difference of as much as $4.98.If</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>I consider myself very picky when it comes to what I put on my face.</li>
            <li>No question, it works, and fast.</li>
            <li>when you are ready to use the product was already removed, I thought I was getting a bargain&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>am very unsatisfy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and much cheaper than I can get it at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a year or two now, and really see a difference in the lines I have on my forehead.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really rate it.  </li>
            <li>My wife likes the product, I can&#x27;t say I notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Deeper frown lines are not affected much.</li>
            <li>and it has really helped my skin.</li>
            <li>I can set the top back on and keep it fresh, if not I would have only given it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>Olay Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex didn&#x27;t disappoint me and delighted me with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and it&#x27;s non-greasy, leaves no build-up and is safe for daily use--</li>
            <li>Even though it appears thick, it has a dry, light feel to it, spreads easily, and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>but I am done until this pump that never works, gets fixed!!!</li>
            <li>This new Regenerist product line is definitely beneficial to more mature skin and helps it to look lovely even in dry and polluted city climates.</li>
            <li>Having used Olay products for several years, and generally being very happy with them, I decided to try their Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on crow&#x27;s feet or other skin issues, but I am very happy and surprised with my results.</li>
            <li>hands, especially, are hydrated and soft from using the product which seems to absorb very quickly, but the wrinkles are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, Olay has fixed its problems with the packaging and the product dispenses without a hitch.  </li>
            <li>After about 10 pumps it gave out, first I was thinking wow</li>
            <li>Luckily I&#x27;m able to just push down to get some of the lotion.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I am always worried when I first try something new.</li>
            <li>(A decent line from the beauty supply</li>
            <li>However, it does seem to improve the wrinkles when used as directed, and that is the main point of it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I use a little more at night, because I&#x27;m going to bed and won&#x27;t notice the sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li>she says it seems ok as moisturizer, but has done little for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Very surprising and disappointing.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, just a few fine lines on my forehead, and the cream seemed to smooth those</li>
            <li>I bought this product on a whim like I do with many anti-aging products...being full of hope but half expecting it to not live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li>I normally like the Olay product line</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I have a deep crease between my eyes and some lines around my eyes when I smile.  </li>
            <li>I found that after just a few days of using this it was noticeably better.  </li>
            <li>We normally use Aveeno moisturizer and frankly will return to that...</li>
            <li>sure you don&#x27;t put it on heavily.  </li>
            <li>I can try products I normally might not go for or know about...and the fact that I did not pay for this sample in no way influences my opinion or review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After a few uses, it seems to be ok.  </li>
            <li>One can use just a small amount to have good facial</li>
            <li>It was probably eight to ten days worth of the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The pump kind of sucks...</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY moisturizers over the years and a few stand out.</li>
            <li>I normally love Olay, but this one is a misfire.</li>
            <li>This whole new Regenerist line is a far cry from the Oil of Olay line of yesterday.</li>
            <li>At 90 years I can&#x27;t expect too much, but since I&#x27;m fortunate not to have hardly ane deep wrinkles, I thought I would try this  to minimize the fine lines, and I may be seeing a bit of a result.</li>
            <li>I use practically every kind of Olay product and without fail, they have been extraordinary.    </li>
            <li>Next time, save \\&quot;your help\\&quot; and send the product right</li>
            <li>the skin get very hydrated and baby soft on touch , if you have very deep wrinkles use the intense hydration that is much stronger</li>
            <li>I tried this morning to get something out of it, eager to try my new purchase, but couldn&#x27;t get anything out of it and gave up, as I had to move on and get to work.  </li>
            <li>My biggest peeve is that every time I smooth it on, it has a very fine grit feel that I only feel on my face slightly irritating it.</li>
            <li>The lines I have are not very deep, and my husband tells me they aren&#x27;t even all that noticeable to him, but I certainly don&#x27;t want them to get any deeper!</li>
            <li>In fact, the only real difference I noticed was that it left me with a super shiny complexion.</li>
            <li>I had a melanoma removed 4 years ago, and I am very sensitive to protecting my skin against UVA/UVB rays.</li>
            <li>I then went to their website to get better information, and upon checking return dates, the date for return was past for the new item.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to absorb/dry quickly on the skin, and leaves it feeling quite smooth, but it also leaves my slightly oily/combination skin feeling and looking too dry.</li>
            <li>The first night I applied this, I noticed a big difference.  </li>
            <li>used it twice a day, and at first I actually thought that this product made the lines worse--and by the end of three weeks see that it didn&#x27;t do a thing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but no better.  </li>
            <li>I love my other Olay products, but will pass on this one in the future.</li>
            <li>I knew there had been issues with faulty pumps in the past, but noted that the Olay rep had stated on more than one occasion, that the pump had been updated.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>I do like tho, that it is a wrinkle treatment in addition to instantly smoothing the skin ;-)</li>
            <li>I am in my mid &#x27;50&#x27;s, and have fair colored skin, with some red spots, a few aging spots, etc.</li>
            <li>But I have them very few :)</li>
            <li>I liked how it went on, thinly and smooth, no thick gunk to clog your pores.&lt;br /&gt;Nicely, a little goes</li>
            <li>Most people think she&#x27;s at least a decade younger than she is when they first meet her.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t insist that this product magically erased them and I looked half my age instantly ...</li>
            <li>but after a few uses I began to notice a change in the appearance of both fine and deeper wrinkles.</li>
            <li>While I think it is a little over-priced, most of these type products are about the same.</li>
            <li>This product does not have that, and I found that to be a great disappointment.</li>
            <li>BTW,i dont have much wrinkles on my face, only a few.but its never too early to start a anti aging product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the bottle, so perhaps they have fixed the issue that others have had with it failing.  </li>
            <li>Well, this is March 2012, and I don&#x27;t think they fixed it yet.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so hydrated and soft after application, and,</li>
            <li>Everything from La Mer to all Olay products Regenerist and Professional...</li>
            <li>of these Olay products have been well designed and developed.</li>
            <li>the only place I have one, thanks to a lifetime of oily skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, almost a powdery feeling to it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet, but I&#x27;ve been noticed my skin is already losing firmness, I am 47 years old</li>
            <li>maybe i&#x27;m too old for it to work</li>
            <li>of course nothing will ever get rid of the wrinkles completely</li>
            <li>I felt as though I could apply make-up directly over this and not feel as if my face had a \\&quot;caked on\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li>Also, bonus points for not reacting with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but it is a very soothing product to use and absorbs almost instantly.</li>
            <li>I wear this day and night (with sunscreen during the day) and I am completely dedicated.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>(almost totally &#x27;natural&#x27;).</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this product...just don&#x27;t expect too much from it.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and going thru a funk where I feel like I look old and haggered.</li>
            <li>So far no change.</li>
            <li>Reduces appearance of wrinkles and takes care of that winter dryness - just leaves your face feeling soft and plump.</li>
            <li>I notice the price has dropped considerably.</li>
            <li>Nice thin, silky night moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many, many products in the past, but this is the only one that I can say has actually made my wrinkles less noticable.  </li>
            <li>I am 56 years old, past menopause, and my skin has lost its elasticity and is now easily wrinkling and lining.  </li>
            <li>Olay should seriously look into better testing of this product.</li>
            <li>When I initially removed the lid, the entire top half of the container came apart</li>
            <li>Several of us, all in our forties, first started using this last autumn, and we all give it a thumbs-up.  </li>
            <li>The entire cap is depressed to dispense the product, but doesn&#x27;t press down evenly, nor does the product come out smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I decided that overall, this would not be a product I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The good thing about the limited amounts that come out with each effort is that you don&#x27;t waste product by dispensing too much by mistake, but it feels awkward and you have to press the top multiple times as it tips this way</li>
            <li>When I thought the product had run out I got curious and broke the container open to find a HUGE amount of product left in the container.</li>
            <li>Being of a certain age, the only way I am going to rid my face of lines is to &amp;#34;go under the knife&amp;#34; which is definitely not an option for me.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product that works as well if not better than other far more expensive products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Every once in a while I try some new fancy named product that is expencive and I always end up going back to Oil Of Olay.</li>
            <li>Sooner or later you are going to get old and look old.</li>
            <li>This product is an OK thick moisturizer, which I decided to give a second try, despite my growing dissatisfaction with Olay&#x27;s deceptive packaging.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: The product may be helpful to discourage lines and wrinkles from forming, and is a nice smooth base under makeup, but hasn&#x27;t improved existing wrinkles for me.</li>
            <li>It took a couple weeks, but I noticed a major reduction in the crease lines that are on my chest.  </li>
            <li>The scent was light and soft so it didn&#x27;t overpower the scent of other HBA products or tussle with my perfume or other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt OK, but I was so upset over the amount that was wasted that I&#x27;m not sure how I really feel about it.  </li>
            <li>it required major surgery to unwrap it.</li>
            <li>I have laugh lines, nose crinkles, and minor crows feet, and I noticed that in about a week, this product has really smoothed my face out without being too heavy.</li>
            <li>Being that I am of (ahem) a certain age, but having never smoked or gone out for broiling myself regularly in the sun, the wrinkles I do boast are relatively minor anyway.</li>
            <li>The feedback on the pump device is so uniformly bad I wonder why the company continues to deliver a great skin treatment this way - when I buy it now, I just go ahead and remove the lid with a screwdriver and pliers, saving the insert portion to use as a cap.  </li>
            <li>The Olay Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex combines Olay&#x27;s trademark moisture with micro-fillers that promise to smooth out the wrinkles--and guess what?  </li>
            <li>Once applying it to your face, your skin instantly feels velvety soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Although I do occasionally breakout, I wouldn&#x27;t consider my skin to be overly sensitive and this cream didn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and my skin feels amazingly soft and my lines are definitely softened too!!  </li>
            <li>That part I don&#x27;t like, but overall Olay Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex is a good product - one of the few I&#x27;ve noticed visible results with.</li>
            <li>but at times left my skin feeling a little itchy, only mildly though it wasn&#x27;t something that would make me not use it.</li>
            <li>only reason I purchased a second time was Olay&#x27;s comments that the problem with the pump would be fixed, this statement was made over a year ago.  </li>
            <li>Great as a primer, it really helps my frown lines, I put it on and wait for it to dry before applying my base.</li>
            <li>major facial points where I&#x27;m seeing a difference are around the eyes and the forehead.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and if you&#x27;re used to needing more than one pump of other products, you won&#x27;t need to do that with this one!  </li>
            <li>The skin under my eyes is much smoother, tighter, and firmer and the dark circles have lightened a bit as well.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much but so far the results are a bit underwhelming, even though the product makes a nice base to apply my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No one else thinks this except for me but the small lines on the sides of my mouth (smile lines?)</li>
            <li>(the large black pump part pulled away from the silver bottom portion).  </li>
            <li>I have a partially used container, and a new one never opened................................</li>
            <li>really do look a LOT less noticeable.</li>
            <li>The large wrinkles by the side of my nose remained the same, whereas, the finer wrinkles around my lips were reduced slightly.</li>
            <li>To further the deception, all Olay products are packaged in boxes that are much larger than the product, which sits inside the box on a little paper platform, evidently to make it look bigger.</li>
            <li>I did not wear any other products with this that I normally would...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fluffy 41-year old and feel that I am getting new wrinkles by the minute.</li>
            <li>Because of my love for their products,  I have tolerated the dispensers up to this point, but after this, I will no longer be forced to make yet another trip to buy or return a product which will not dispense, nor get \\&quot;half use\\&quot; of the ones that will.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, I&#x27;ve been now and again tempted to spend way much more for a high-end skin-care product that didn&#x27;t seem to be all that much different from this or any other Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li>This complex is very lightweight and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a good idea to put your fingers into a moisturizing product -- even if they are clean, it compromises the product integrity.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much I minded so little, it&#x27;s that they hid it.</li>

            <li> and we&#x27;ll be happy to help!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies!</li>
            <li> I have been searching the internet for the best OTC wrinkle creams and OLAY has been at the top.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;you look relaxed, bright,</li>
            <li> Both of these should do a good job in tandem, depending on your skin needs.</li>
            <li> This Olay product is the best available.</li>
            <li> The price is fair too.</li>
            <li> I gave up a good skin care system&#x27;s lotion to try this product.  </li>
            <li> This got a good review in O magazine.</li>
            <li> Olay is a good product.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time and just bought a couple from Amazon because of the good price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good.</li>
            <li> must be good</li>
            <li> This is a good choice for a wrinkle cream in the median price range.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great under makeup and alone and the texture is really nice.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> but it is really good.</li>
            <li> i find the olay regenerist cream very pleasant and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> Love the product, smells good and makes my face feel great</li>
            <li> have used Olay products for a while (Tottal Effects, Regenerist, Pro X) and was always very pleased.  </li>
            <li> using Olay products for years and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very many wrinkles</li>
            <li> and I think you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two days, and it may be my imagination, but my eyes are looking better already!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> , it does absorb very quick and great for under make up or for non make up days ..</li>
            <li> It smoothes on like pure silk and feels AWESOME!  </li>
            <li> and I am very impressed and will certainly replace when it is gone.    </li>
            <li> Love , love ,love and very good price</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is great under make-up.</li>
            <li> It has a velvet like consistency that doesn&#x27;t float on the surface of the skin, which was quite nice.</li>
            <li> That was nice, and probably formulated for 20 something skin.  </li>
            <li> product smells good and has an interesting \\&quot;feel\\&quot; to it.  </li>
            <li> I liked that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It deserves honest, consumer-friendly packaging.  </li>
            <li> This lotion has a nice creamy feel and smell to it.  </li>
            <li> I liked it a lot and always use it now- holds up well all day.</li>
            <li> (kind of doubt that),</li>
            <li> The product states there is a \\&quot;cashmere\\&quot; feel, and I suppose that is what I&#x27;m attempting to describe, but I truly noticed it and liked the feeling.</li>
            <li> It is not at all greasy and leaves my skin feeling really nice, but I haven&#x27;t noticed improvement in the lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Olay for another great skincare product!</li>
            <li> The product is good but the top of the jar for squeezing it out did not work.  </li>
            <li> They are rich creams, over all fairly hypo-allergenic, and do the job they promise at a good and affordable price.</li>
            <li> My crows feet are slowly becoming teeny-weeny!</li>
            <li> MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream No.23 Natural Beige SPF42 PA+++ (50ml)]]</li>
            <li> She did not have any problems with the pump mechanism, but it&#x27;s nice to see that Olay responded to the many concerns and has changed the pump design.</li>
            <li> I do love the way it feels on my skin, but don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> It does not diminish my lines, but it might work on very fine lines.</li>
            <li> Nice, clean scent and penetrates skin nicely, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off with the positive: this Regenerist product is great when used to spot treat problem areas.  </li>
            <li> I never had tried before a product that leaves that smooth feeling over my skin and the smell is smooth and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Sure, this product does help reduce the appearance of wrinkles, but I dislike the residue it leaves on my skin.  </li>
            <li> , I would rate this as OK, but not the aging revolution that&#x27;s promised.  </li>
            <li> What I found works best is to tap the container on its top (on red, metallic over-cap) before removing the cap.</li>
            <li> So, we&#x27;re confident you won&#x27;t experience this problem if you choose to try the product</li>
            <li> I will buy again but am hoping for a better container.</li>
            <li> But the serum sounds like it would do a better job</li>
            <li> Most of my moisturizers and night cream are 1.7 oz</li>
            <li> I noticed the cream squishing out of the top of the container, where the pump lid is attached.  </li>
            <li> Well,I ve been trying these product for more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> only caution is to not get pump happy!  </li>
            <li> at their price point I think they are a better value than most.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels better and looks moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my skin (around the eyes), not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> In spite of Olay claiming that they had improved the situation, I wasn&#x27;t able to get the pump to work and have torn the thing apart in order to use the product.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy it again, and this seller was excellent.</li>
            <li> Have always been pleased with all of the Olay products I have used.</li>
            <li> Ok as a moisturiser</li>
            <li> Unlike most wrinkle-reducers that you apply before makeup, it doesn&#x27;t tighten your skin.  </li>
            <li> I like most that the product is not oily.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product unless you can check to make sure it has the product in it.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and used what went on the sink, but it was much, much more than I needed.  </li>
            <li> I have to break the top cover to pieces to get the cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the fact that i use it twice a day and it is gone in two weeks makes me think that this is a scam.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I will definetly be purchasing more of this from now on.  </li>
            <li> I used the product (didn&#x27;t love the name:&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it seems to smell better to me than ANEW.  </li>
            <li> The price of this though is much more pleasing than the mall brands.</li>
            <li> Saw raves about this on Consumers Digest 5 years ago, how it&#x27;s better than $300 creams.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better after using this for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels and because of the &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; it gives my skin  </li>
            <li> It feels silky smooth on my skin and does diminish the appearance of wrinkles without leaving any kind of residue that rubs off or flakes.</li>
            <li> Use on my neck and chest area and love the change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been able to get rid of those squinch marks between my eyebrows with this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Guess I will be doing some more research on another anti-wrinkle fighter.</li>
            <li> Not too sure yet.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a year</li>
            <li> I think that the amount of correction from this  product made speaks volumes about how potent this product is.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The difference I noticed after the first 2 weeks of use was remarkable.</li>
            <li> I keep buying it because I love the product...</li>
            <li> I honestly Love This Stuff.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels on my skin</li>
            <li> and I love how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I decided to pop off the top</li>
            <li> I just ordered some more.</li>
            <li> I love how the Regenerist system works.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I decided to try this one and was very excited to see results.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily absorbed and has a light, pleasant smell.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Olay is becoming better in</li>
            <li> the price was good though, but she had much higher hopes.</li>
            <li> and I find it lasts quite a long time, and gives me excellent smoothness and a &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; finish to my skin before applying powder.</li>
            <li> I had been using it 2 weeks before my wedding (for fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes), and when my best friend/maid of honor was in from Florida, she asked me out of the blue \\&quot;Did you get botox??\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> laugh lines and character crinkles!!  </li>
            <li> For years I have been searching for the perfect moisturizer - rich enough to hydrate, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I DID notice is that it went on smoothly, and felt fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin silky smooth and makeup goes on a lot better.</li>
            <li> What I really liked about this product, and noticed immediately, was the way it went on my skin and the quickness with which it was absorbed.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and greatly reduces fine lines and discoloration.</li>
            <li> gave 4 stars to the original product, which I love.</li>
            <li> However, this lotion does feel nice and never too heavy, and it does a very good job under foundation, seeming to keep makeup from gathering in my deepest wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One needs a tube that can be easily squeezed, controlled and all product used.</li>
            <li> This is highly recommended on beautypedia.com for having all the good stuff you want/need in a face cream without an exorbinate pricetag.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly and absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> after reading all of the positive reviews I was sure this would be THEE PRODUCT!.</li>
            <li> My face looks much smoother and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> My grandmother used them and always had such beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> The product helps reduce crows feet and fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> just fine.</li>
            <li> I think it works on fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both ANEW by AVON and Olay and can say that Olay does a fine job moisturizing the face.  </li>
            <li> I am 58 and have not really taken very good care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I never find that products claims are accurate, (</li>
            <li> It is not oily light.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I was just thinking I saw a reduction in wrinkles, but my forehead was noticeably smooth.  </li>
            <li> You need to put it on lightly.  </li>
            <li> It has a light perfume smell that dissipates within about 2 minutes after you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gotta get the free gift, if you know what I mean...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I picked this as an item that I could receive free of charge through the Vine Voice program...</li>
            <li> And yeah, it would be nice to see how much of the product you have left--but I will just always keep 2 on hand.</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this product and liked it so much that she continues to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I recommend that you give this one a try if you are looking to smooth out some of those wrinkles.</li>
            <li> As with all makeup or beauty products, your skin&#x27;s reaction will be an important factor.</li>
            <li> Great product but the packaging is definitely an issue.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and soaks into skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, is not greasy or sticky, and I like the way it moisurizes.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin feel smooth and silky immediately after application, but with time you do notice a tightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I used it sparingly and will say it feels beautifully smooth to apply.  </li>
            <li> Goes on so smoothly</li>
            <li> Save your money; no results at all; it&#x27;s like using a cheap moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look smooth.</li>
            <li> but this sure feels good and&lt;br /&gt;helps as much as possible.</li>
            <li> It has a strong, albeit not unpleasant, fragrance that disappates after a time, but I dislike strongly fragranced beauty products.</li>
            <li> I began to notice a significant reduction in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> very slight fading at best.</li>
            <li> Their products are not only just as good as products at high end department stores a lot of times they are superior.</li>
            <li> And every time I&#x27;ve used it my makeup has not looked as smooth and flawless as usual-</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an Olay brand product and I am very impressed, this product is easy to apply, leaves my skin so soft and with a velvety feeling, doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue (completely zero)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Living in this dry mountain air, I always welcome any kind of moisturizing skin care, especially since I love being outside in the great outdoors and playing up in the mountains both during winter and summer.  </li>
            <li> And, boy was it worth it!</li>
            <li> Pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product... but only if they get the packaging fixed!</li>
            <li> (maybe mine wasn&#x27;t all the way full)</li>
            <li> Feel cheated that after two weeks and just using three pushes in the top lip that it would be gone so fast.  </li>
            <li> I do not have an opinion about the product yet, not having used it enough, but I do know that I won&#x27;t be buying it again no matter how good it is.  </li>
            <li> Under comments someone said just take the plunger top off the can and use straight from can.  </li>
            <li> Would be nice but has silicone in it which can cause problems for your skin if your sensitive or acne prone like me</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not a bad product--it does moisturize your face, but it didn&#x27;t decrease the lines on my face.</li>
            <li> Have been happy with all other Olay products purchased.</li>
            <li> The lotion is great, goes on smoothly, and really works on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> When I wear a full face of make-up, it does contain SPF, but I rarely wear a full face of make- up - perhaps 2 - 3 times a year.</li>
            <li> I discovered this Olay product through Beautypedia, where it is highly recommended for its ingredients and packaging, and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.</li>
            <li> Recently switched to this from the micro-sculpting cream based on reviews and am very glad I did.</li>
            <li> have noticed since beginning to use this product in place of my normal Neutrogena Healthy Defense that the skin on my neck and at the jawline feels a bit smoother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a basic moisturizer backed by a company with LOTS of money who can hire a very convincing PR team.</li>
            <li> If you get this and the pump stops just pop off the top, it will stay fresh if you put the top back on.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I have enjoyed all the new line from Olay Regenerist line I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, but I thought this would be okay since it is non-comedogenic.  </li>
            <li> Im pretty much getting dimethicones,silicones,nothing very benefical for my aging skin,I really love the olay regenerist line and highly recommend them to people to atleast give them a try,you really dont have to much to lose,and atleast their a great affordable price.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on smoothly, has no annoying fragrance, and makes my skin feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> this one more for younger skin with fine lines or for under make up as primer as it does not break up the make up as the others</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised with this product--my favorite of all the Olay products.</li>
            <li> Olay has a reputation for developing great skin products, especially for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> just laugh lines and some forehead lines.  </li>
            <li> if it was worth it</li>
            <li> The alternative is far more disagreeable.</li>
            <li> It has lessened some light lines around my eyes and I have been overall pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This blows the competition away - well worth the $20.</li>
            <li> you dont mind clipping coupons its worth going to the store.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but for my money, it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> (I apply the product right after a shower in the morning, then let it absorb into my skin for about 30 mins before applying any make-up, and apply it again after cleansing my face at night.)  </li>
            <li> Some material in this cream doesn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li> Right now I habe this product placed in the over promised  column.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I observed carefully my amazing wrinkles before and after and concluded that while yes, the product did in fact reduce my wrinkles, they were still basically there.</li>
            <li> Over the past 6 months I have seen great improvement in the texture and evenness of my skin.</li>
            <li> This does help to smooth out fine lines, especially around the eye area and forehead region, and when used twice a day, our skin felt smoother and tighter.  </li>
            <li> I mean, my face literally shined in the light, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> Overall, its a fine product and the price doesn&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much of this product (like that very much)</li>
            <li> This may be just me as I don&#x27;t put very much product on my skin because of its sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Because of that, I would not use this product for daytime use; however, I would very much consider this product for a nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The #11 wrinkles between my eyebrows are only visible when I scowl, and the texture of my skin is now very smooth.  </li>
            <li> If your skin is not too sensitive, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> But I find myself just not using it much because other products like Este Lauder seem to do as good of a job and not have the super-greasy feel to them.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much but as I got into the fourth week of using it the product started to ooze out of the container between the top and bottom part of the container.  </li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t think worth what I paid for.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer seems to form more of a \\&quot;seal\\&quot; but I found that the Aveeno provides the same result with 2xday application at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have read the customers reviews at Amazon&#x27;s and Olay&#x27;s websites and found out that many people had had the same problem.  </li>
            <li> Since you were aware of the problem you should have recalled</li>
            <li> When I wear it during the day, I apply it first, then my moisturizer, then my makeup.  </li>
            <li> first, I was concerned, as it has a light fragrance to the liquid, and I am highly sensitive to fragrances, and I thought I might need to wash it off.  </li>
            <li> They used words like \\&quot;you look so pretty</li>
            <li> First of all, it does not contain 1.7 ounces as claimed.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was stuck, so I dismantled the bottle and there was only about a 1/2 teaspoon more inside.  </li>
            <li> So I used a screwdriver to pop off the top of the pump and low and behold, found an ample supply of lotion in the cap and in the container.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty confident that with continued use, I will continue to see improvement, so I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time</li>
            <li> Sometimes it seems like products work at first</li>
            <li> I especially like to use it on my hands because the product seems to make them look more youthful.</li>
            <li> First time using this product makes my make up go on smoother no wrinkles</li>
            <li> First time buyer of this lotion.</li>
            <li> I just bought my first bottle of this, and I have to say I&#x27;m amazed</li>
            <li> - it really does what it&#x27;s advertised to do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to say this is a wonderful product, or even a mediocre product, but I still don&#x27;t know.   </li>
            <li> Avoid this one, though -- or make sure you keep the receipt in case it won&#x27;t open at all, like mine did.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was damaged and did not work after the first couple uses.  </li>
            <li> So I use it only once or twice a week, and put moisturizers on top of it.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much better my skin looked when I finally got to a mirror.</li>
            <li> First of all, it does not say &amp;#34;Instant Fix&amp;#34; anywhere on the package or bottle like it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> Like many, I picked this up for my wife as she has become worried about small wrinkles that form on everyone past the age of 17 (You are as beautiful as the day we met honey!).</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re over 65 and people still compliment your skin, you know this product is for real!  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work any better than regular moisturizer</li>
            <li> It starts working the first day you use it.</li>
            <li> I ran out of the product and didn&#x27;t bother to reorder any more for over a 1/2 year until I noticed that the wrinkles were starting to return.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Wrinkle Revolution Complex with the skepticism of one who has been let down by many a \\&quot;wrinkle cream\\&quot;, but I have to say that, in my opinion, Olay has really created a great product with this one!  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the reviews,that this wasnt rated a bit higher,I love this stuff,I use it daily as my primer,I actually rotate it with the regenerist serum,that one I use in the summer as my primer,it makes total sense to use these products as primers,it saves me a ton of money also,I used to use smashbox photo finish primer and all of these products have silicone in them,so I figured I might as well use the olay,it makes so much more sense,with the olay regenerist products as my primers Im getting great ingredients that actually help my skin,like peptides,and vitamin b3 with my 42$primer</li>
            <li> It felt a bit thicker and smelt different than the original one I purchased at the chemist!</li>
            <li> It instantly smooths the fine lines on my forehead, including the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34;, and gives my skin an overall fresher and more youthful tone.</li>
            <li> This particular complex is effective over night and the application pump is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love Olay&#x27;s products but have long been dissatified with the packaging.</li>
            <li> When the container became empty and would no longer pump out more lotion, I pried off the pump part and found that there was still some lotion left inside the tub that could have been extracted if it was dispensed from a more flexible squeeze tube.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much of a \\&quot;revolution\\&quot; is occurring on my face, my wrinkles seem to be pretty darned stubborn.</li>
            <li> While I love all the other Olay products, this one just seems to sit on the face without being absorbed.</li>
            <li> I was really optimistic about this product, which is why I was willing to pay the $25 price tag.</li>
            <li> In that case, you have to pry up the entire pump mechanism; the pump comes apart fairly easily after a bit of prying.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps It is my advanced age when first starting to use.  </li>
            <li> It certainly has given the appearance of softening the wrinkles around my eyes as well.</li>
            <li> A large amount of the product slopped into the sink and floor.  </li>
            <li> , really noticed my skin is softer and more firm, specially on my jaw line and around my lips.</li>
            <li> so I guess when it reaches a certain point it no longer has the pressure to get the rest of the product out.</li>
            <li> With use her skin is certainly shinier, but in all honesty, that is about it.</li>
            <li> When I called the number given, I was told to mail the product to a certain address.  </li>
            <li> I had not only noticed an increase in fine lines around my eyes recently, but fine and somewhat deeper lines around my lips.  </li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried this particular Olay product.</li>
            <li> thats kind of expencive for so little</li>
            <li> OLAY REGENEREST WRINKLE REVOLUTION is a pretty decent moisturizer that works like a primer, which is used to create a smooth palette and decrease facial oil so that foundation or powder goes on evenly and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had an empty Olay container and popped the top of and put this in it.</li>
            <li> It really reduced the wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid Ounces]], which is supposed to tighten the skin, and also seems to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for under-eye wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Also, it seemed that the 1.7 Oz went really fast</li>
            <li> I FINISHED THE WHOLE BOTTLE</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am very please with the Olay product line.</li>
            <li> product was gentle to my skin so there was so \\&quot;brush burn\\&quot; feeling or redness.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t really expect it to, though--</li>
            <li> I really do dislike any creams or lotions that have a greasy feel to them, and this does.</li>
            <li> Just be gentle when smoothing on makeup so it won&#x27;t rub off-</li>
            <li> Once I had a problem with the pump; another time the whole can opened and splashed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate the real product I received from Amazon/Cosmetics Depot...</li>
            <li> I found that it was very drying if I used it as directed, twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see any difference in my lines</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and moisturized and fresh</li>
            <li> reasonable expectations, this product will improve the appearance of lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> And it really seems to be ironing out the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Really did get rid of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The price range has had a difference of as much as $4.98.If</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> I consider myself very picky when it comes to what I put on my face.</li>
            <li> No question, it works, and fast.</li>
            <li> when you are ready to use the product was already removed, I thought I was getting a bargain&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> am very unsatisfy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and much cheaper than I can get it at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year or two now, and really see a difference in the lines I have on my forehead.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really rate it.  </li>
            <li> My wife likes the product, I can&#x27;t say I notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Deeper frown lines are not affected much.</li>
            <li> and it has really helped my skin.</li>
            <li> I can set the top back on and keep it fresh, if not I would have only given it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex didn&#x27;t disappoint me and delighted me with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and it&#x27;s non-greasy, leaves no build-up and is safe for daily use--</li>
            <li> Even though it appears thick, it has a dry, light feel to it, spreads easily, and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> but I am done until this pump that never works, gets fixed!!!</li>
            <li> This new Regenerist product line is definitely beneficial to more mature skin and helps it to look lovely even in dry and polluted city climates.</li>
            <li> Having used Olay products for several years, and generally being very happy with them, I decided to try their Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on crow&#x27;s feet or other skin issues, but I am very happy and surprised with my results.</li>
            <li> hands, especially, are hydrated and soft from using the product which seems to absorb very quickly, but the wrinkles are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, Olay has fixed its problems with the packaging and the product dispenses without a hitch.  </li>
            <li> After about 10 pumps it gave out, first I was thinking wow</li>
            <li> Luckily I&#x27;m able to just push down to get some of the lotion.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I am always worried when I first try something new.</li>
            <li> (A decent line from the beauty supply</li>
            <li> However, it does seem to improve the wrinkles when used as directed, and that is the main point of it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use a little more at night, because I&#x27;m going to bed and won&#x27;t notice the sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> she says it seems ok as moisturizer, but has done little for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Very surprising and disappointing.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, just a few fine lines on my forehead, and the cream seemed to smooth those</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim like I do with many anti-aging products...being full of hope but half expecting it to not live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> I normally like the Olay product line</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I have a deep crease between my eyes and some lines around my eyes when I smile.  </li>
            <li> I found that after just a few days of using this it was noticeably better.  </li>
            <li> We normally use Aveeno moisturizer and frankly will return to that...</li>
            <li> sure you don&#x27;t put it on heavily.  </li>
            <li> I can try products I normally might not go for or know about...and the fact that I did not pay for this sample in no way influences my opinion or review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After a few uses, it seems to be ok.  </li>
            <li> One can use just a small amount to have good facial</li>
            <li> It was probably eight to ten days worth of the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The pump kind of sucks...</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY moisturizers over the years and a few stand out.</li>
            <li> I normally love Olay, but this one is a misfire.</li>
            <li> This whole new Regenerist line is a far cry from the Oil of Olay line of yesterday.</li>
            <li> At 90 years I can&#x27;t expect too much, but since I&#x27;m fortunate not to have hardly ane deep wrinkles, I thought I would try this  to minimize the fine lines, and I may be seeing a bit of a result.</li>
            <li> I use practically every kind of Olay product and without fail, they have been extraordinary.    </li>
            <li> Next time, save \\&quot;your help\\&quot; and send the product right</li>
            <li> the skin get very hydrated and baby soft on touch , if you have very deep wrinkles use the intense hydration that is much stronger</li>
            <li> I tried this morning to get something out of it, eager to try my new purchase, but couldn&#x27;t get anything out of it and gave up, as I had to move on and get to work.  </li>
            <li> My biggest peeve is that every time I smooth it on, it has a very fine grit feel that I only feel on my face slightly irritating it.</li>
            <li> The lines I have are not very deep, and my husband tells me they aren&#x27;t even all that noticeable to him, but I certainly don&#x27;t want them to get any deeper!</li>
            <li> In fact, the only real difference I noticed was that it left me with a super shiny complexion.</li>
            <li> I had a melanoma removed 4 years ago, and I am very sensitive to protecting my skin against UVA/UVB rays.</li>
            <li> I then went to their website to get better information, and upon checking return dates, the date for return was past for the new item.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to absorb/dry quickly on the skin, and leaves it feeling quite smooth, but it also leaves my slightly oily/combination skin feeling and looking too dry.</li>
            <li> The first night I applied this, I noticed a big difference.  </li>
            <li> used it twice a day, and at first I actually thought that this product made the lines worse--and by the end of three weeks see that it didn&#x27;t do a thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but no better.  </li>
            <li> I love my other Olay products, but will pass on this one in the future.</li>
            <li> I knew there had been issues with faulty pumps in the past, but noted that the Olay rep had stated on more than one occasion, that the pump had been updated.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I do like tho, that it is a wrinkle treatment in addition to instantly smoothing the skin ;-)</li>
            <li> I am in my mid &#x27;50&#x27;s, and have fair colored skin, with some red spots, a few aging spots, etc.</li>
            <li> But I have them very few :)</li>
            <li> I liked how it went on, thinly and smooth, no thick gunk to clog your pores.&lt;br /&gt;Nicely, a little goes</li>
            <li> Most people think she&#x27;s at least a decade younger than she is when they first meet her.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t insist that this product magically erased them and I looked half my age instantly ...</li>
            <li> but after a few uses I began to notice a change in the appearance of both fine and deeper wrinkles.</li>
            <li> While I think it is a little over-priced, most of these type products are about the same.</li>
            <li> This product does not have that, and I found that to be a great disappointment.</li>
            <li> BTW,i dont have much wrinkles on my face, only a few.but its never too early to start a anti aging product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the bottle, so perhaps they have fixed the issue that others have had with it failing.  </li>
            <li> Well, this is March 2012, and I don&#x27;t think they fixed it yet.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so hydrated and soft after application, and,</li>
            <li> Everything from La Mer to all Olay products Regenerist and Professional...</li>
            <li> of these Olay products have been well designed and developed.</li>
            <li> the only place I have one, thanks to a lifetime of oily skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, almost a powdery feeling to it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet, but I&#x27;ve been noticed my skin is already losing firmness, I am 47 years old</li>
            <li> maybe i&#x27;m too old for it to work</li>
            <li> of course nothing will ever get rid of the wrinkles completely</li>
            <li> I felt as though I could apply make-up directly over this and not feel as if my face had a \\&quot;caked on\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li> Also, bonus points for not reacting with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but it is a very soothing product to use and absorbs almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I wear this day and night (with sunscreen during the day) and I am completely dedicated.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> (almost totally &#x27;natural&#x27;).</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product...just don&#x27;t expect too much from it.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and going thru a funk where I feel like I look old and haggered.</li>
            <li> So far no change.</li>
            <li> Reduces appearance of wrinkles and takes care of that winter dryness - just leaves your face feeling soft and plump.</li>
            <li> I notice the price has dropped considerably.</li>
            <li> Nice thin, silky night moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many, many products in the past, but this is the only one that I can say has actually made my wrinkles less noticable.  </li>
            <li> I am 56 years old, past menopause, and my skin has lost its elasticity and is now easily wrinkling and lining.  </li>
            <li> Olay should seriously look into better testing of this product.</li>
            <li> When I initially removed the lid, the entire top half of the container came apart</li>
            <li> Several of us, all in our forties, first started using this last autumn, and we all give it a thumbs-up.  </li>
            <li> The entire cap is depressed to dispense the product, but doesn&#x27;t press down evenly, nor does the product come out smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I decided that overall, this would not be a product I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The good thing about the limited amounts that come out with each effort is that you don&#x27;t waste product by dispensing too much by mistake, but it feels awkward and you have to press the top multiple times as it tips this way</li>
            <li> When I thought the product had run out I got curious and broke the container open to find a HUGE amount of product left in the container.</li>
            <li> Being of a certain age, the only way I am going to rid my face of lines is to &amp;#34;go under the knife&amp;#34; which is definitely not an option for me.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product that works as well if not better than other far more expensive products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while I try some new fancy named product that is expencive and I always end up going back to Oil Of Olay.</li>
            <li> Sooner or later you are going to get old and look old.</li>
            <li> This product is an OK thick moisturizer, which I decided to give a second try, despite my growing dissatisfaction with Olay&#x27;s deceptive packaging.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: The product may be helpful to discourage lines and wrinkles from forming, and is a nice smooth base under makeup, but hasn&#x27;t improved existing wrinkles for me.</li>
            <li> It took a couple weeks, but I noticed a major reduction in the crease lines that are on my chest.  </li>
            <li> The scent was light and soft so it didn&#x27;t overpower the scent of other HBA products or tussle with my perfume or other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt OK, but I was so upset over the amount that was wasted that I&#x27;m not sure how I really feel about it.  </li>
            <li> it required major surgery to unwrap it.</li>
            <li> I have laugh lines, nose crinkles, and minor crows feet, and I noticed that in about a week, this product has really smoothed my face out without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> Being that I am of (ahem) a certain age, but having never smoked or gone out for broiling myself regularly in the sun, the wrinkles I do boast are relatively minor anyway.</li>
            <li> The feedback on the pump device is so uniformly bad I wonder why the company continues to deliver a great skin treatment this way - when I buy it now, I just go ahead and remove the lid with a screwdriver and pliers, saving the insert portion to use as a cap.  </li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex combines Olay&#x27;s trademark moisture with micro-fillers that promise to smooth out the wrinkles--and guess what?  </li>
            <li> Once applying it to your face, your skin instantly feels velvety soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Although I do occasionally breakout, I wouldn&#x27;t consider my skin to be overly sensitive and this cream didn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and my skin feels amazingly soft and my lines are definitely softened too!!  </li>
            <li> That part I don&#x27;t like, but overall Olay Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex is a good product - one of the few I&#x27;ve noticed visible results with.</li>
            <li> but at times left my skin feeling a little itchy, only mildly though it wasn&#x27;t something that would make me not use it.</li>
            <li> only reason I purchased a second time was Olay&#x27;s comments that the problem with the pump would be fixed, this statement was made over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> Great as a primer, it really helps my frown lines, I put it on and wait for it to dry before applying my base.</li>
            <li> major facial points where I&#x27;m seeing a difference are around the eyes and the forehead.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and if you&#x27;re used to needing more than one pump of other products, you won&#x27;t need to do that with this one!  </li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes is much smoother, tighter, and firmer and the dark circles have lightened a bit as well.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much but so far the results are a bit underwhelming, even though the product makes a nice base to apply my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No one else thinks this except for me but the small lines on the sides of my mouth (smile lines?)</li>
            <li> (the large black pump part pulled away from the silver bottom portion).  </li>
            <li> I have a partially used container, and a new one never opened................................</li>
            <li> really do look a LOT less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The large wrinkles by the side of my nose remained the same, whereas, the finer wrinkles around my lips were reduced slightly.</li>
            <li> To further the deception, all Olay products are packaged in boxes that are much larger than the product, which sits inside the box on a little paper platform, evidently to make it look bigger.</li>
            <li> I did not wear any other products with this that I normally would...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fluffy 41-year old and feel that I am getting new wrinkles by the minute.</li>
            <li> Because of my love for their products,  I have tolerated the dispensers up to this point, but after this, I will no longer be forced to make yet another trip to buy or return a product which will not dispense, nor get \\&quot;half use\\&quot; of the ones that will.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve been now and again tempted to spend way much more for a high-end skin-care product that didn&#x27;t seem to be all that much different from this or any other Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li> This complex is very lightweight and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good idea to put your fingers into a moisturizing product -- even if they are clean, it compromises the product integrity.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much I minded so little, it&#x27;s that they hid it.</li>
            <li> CRAP - now I have to go return it, which will cost more in gas and hassle than the product is worth, which means I might just suck it up.</li>
            <li> Paying a lot of money for one does not mean it is any better than a less expensive brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see how this will work with the lines around my mouth, and if there will be any affect on the crease/scar left behind by shingles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Olay offers that with other products.  </li>
            <li> I had checked other reviews before buying this and saw the comments about the pump that didn&#x27;t work but assumed that a company like Olay would have fixed the problem by now.  </li>
            <li> Olay claimed to have fixed the product, which I purchased after reading other buyer beware claims.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any other product that makes this type of difference, while leaving my skin soft without a greasy or oily effect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand Olay&#x27;s self-sabotage in frustrating consumers this way when they clearly are aware of the problem.</li>
            <li> Olay, and all other manufacturers who bottle products in such shoddy containers, needs to simplify the packaging and return to a container that allows full access, like a jar.  </li>
            <li> so I know how long it is supposed to last.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Olay fan, but this one was so different and strange.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to give an assessment.  </li>
            <li> I am removing one whole star rating because the pump dispenser is really annoying to use when a simple squeeze tube would have been both easier to use and also more compact to carry.  </li>
            <li> It does make make-up a little difficult to apply nicely, as well.</li>
            <li> This product is very strange and will be going back.</li>
            <li> but it is starting to dry out as I age.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is not very tall, but big around, and the cap is the same circumference.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, except it seems to apply a  bit thick &amp; later wants to rub off?</li>
            <li> fast!&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser is difficult to get going, but now it seems to be coming out fine.</li>
            <li> Larger wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet will not totally disappear, but they do become less noticeable over time with regular usage of this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I have always had smooth skin and was not happy that my skin was now sagging and wrinkling due to age.  </li>
            <li> ( I also read several other reviews that said the same thing)</li>
            <li> only problem - for the ones with very dry skin-</li>
            <li> I knew my wrinkles looked less noticable, but I had no idea that other people would notice such a marked improvement.  </li>
            <li> rated the product an overall three stars because while the lotion deserves five stars, the container it comes in deserves a MINUS five stars.  </li>
            <li> I had shingles on my face a few years ago, and the only scar I have is one deep line above my lip, crossing into my lip.  </li>
            <li> It was not soft.  </li>
            <li> I have always used Olay products - the only products I have used in 50 years, since the pink stuff was all they had.  </li>
            <li> Age spots are fading and minor wrinkles are disappearing.  </li>
            <li> And it softens the lines on your face immediately without any strange feeling or residue.</li>
            <li> I have spent several thousand dollars over the years on botox injections for my eye and forehead areas for wrinkle correction.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange.</li>
            <li> Went on easy, but when I tried to put my foundation on, it was actually hard to spread because of the wrinkle complex.  </li>
            <li> The red cap and black pump can then be snapped back onto the tub.  </li>
            <li> Hold the canister and place index finger on black actuator and completely press the actuator down and release pressure to allow to return to starting position.</li>
            <li> But the thing is, even if my wrinkles were less than previous, I still had the same old face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A definite improvement over other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it on other areas as well and on my hands where there are definitely wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure out how I&#x27;m going to crack open this bottle to get the last little bit of product out once the pump won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> This product feels dry on my skin .  </li>
            <li> Amazon will replace but who wants to have to wait for them to send another and have to send them the broken one back.</li>
            <li> As another issue, this time, when I opened the box, the container was broken, even though the product box was not-- and the box showed no damage, so evidently it was a lack of quality-control during the production run.</li>
            <li> The only thing left are some tiny wrinkles below my tear duck, and these are going away slowly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and it seemed like overnight the skin under my eyes got all loose and saggy.  </li>
            <li> I am a woman, and I have some lines there that lead down towards my mid chest.  </li>
            <li> Next remove the metallic over-cap and the black tab in the dispenser.</li>
            <li> Have been using this recently and now not able to find it in stores locally .</li>
            <li> It made it feel very dry where as I was expecting it to add moisture to my face.</li>
            <li> The only problem was that after about a week I started to get little whiteheads all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to my face in the morning and then mix a little of it with an expensive tinted moisturizer and smooth that on.</li>
            <li> I need less product to achieve the same moisturized feeling and the packaging is designed to keep the active ingredients fresher longer (rather than the screw-top jar).</li>
            <li> I used just a pea sized amount of the wrinkle complex under my regular daytime moisturizer, and to my amazement after only 1 week, nothing came out.  </li>
            <li> , but no thanks.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m on empty after the 4-5 weeks of use that wasn&#x27;t nightly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, in my humble opinion, I would say this moisturizer definitely makes a difference and does what it says it will!  </li>
            <li> And it truly seems to diminish the appearance of wrinkles and helps my skin overall to feel hydrated without being heavy or greasy looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy or wet.  </li>
            <li> It arrived TOTALLY empty.</li>
            <li> Total waste of time.  </li>
            <li> So Olay should have packaged this lotion in a simple squeeze tube.this lotion is not cheap, I would want every drop of lotion that I paid for.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected out of Olay.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t tell when the product is almost empty.  </li>
            <li> Tries to get me to use it too.</li>
            <li> I told her I had a partially used container and another one unopened.  </li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this product but - as many other reviews will tell you - the packaging is terrible.</li>
            <li> I opened it up to try a very small amount and instantly, my face felt very gritty.</li>
            <li> Because it is &#x27;dry&#x27; I had less problems with oily shine, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s barely anything in the bottle, which basically falsely packaged to look larger than it is.</li>
            <li> if I find issues with other products in this line I might make the effort to return everything.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t interfere with any of my other products.  </li>
            <li> diligently used this product as directed, 2x day, but did not use their other products with it.  </li>
            <li> However, after trying this product for an extended length of time I can safely say I am greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> My skin was left feeling slick as well.</li>
            <li> But if you are unable to clear the clog on the pump, then you need to pry off the pump again when you use the lotion later.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved Olay product but was very disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex yesterday, along with several other products in the Olay Regenerist line.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;friendliness\\&quot;-- earlier packaging had so much hard plastic encapsulating their product</li>
            <li> My second was just as bad as the first.  </li>
            <li> And the dark circles under my eyes seemed to have lessened.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are very well established unfortunately, so there is a lot of age to overcome.  </li>
            <li> And as an added bonus it helps the dark circles under my eyes too, something I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased the Olay Wrinkle Revolution Complex.  </li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;ve had no breakouts so maybe further use will yield results.</li>
            <li> I think the product is good, but the packaging is terrible.</li>
            <li> It was a complete rip-off.</li>
            <li> had to turn the bottle upside down to get the pump to work</li>
            <li> I ignored some of the other reviews, and wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> maybe that has a lot to do with her youthful looks, but if you ask her, she will tell you that it&#x27;s also because she takes care of her skin with this and a few other products.</li>
            <li> WRINKLE REVOLUTION goes on creamy and has the consistency slightly thicker than that of a serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using for less than a week and notice my face looks and feels smoother.</li>
            <li> Silky, slightly spackle-like texture.</li>
            <li> Exposure to air destabilizes the active ingredients I just paid for!</li>
            <li> When I contacted Olay directly, I spoke to a representative who was rude, condescending and confusing.  </li>
            <li> Please be super careful when you remove the lid, or you will be extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I found that this was not true.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and unfortunately even at my age I broke out using this product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I found out a little deception in packaging was going on.</li>
            <li> I use it as a night cream as it is a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> but this is a waste of money</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t want you to feel you wasted your money so if you still have trouble give us a call at (800) 395-0737</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Also, we&#x27;ve made a few changes to the dispensing on our packaging.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have a heavy smell.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work for forehead wrinkles; results noticeable after a few days.</li>
            <li> I waited a few minutes and then the scent no longer was noticible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will post as to if this helps my skin, once I have been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> And, my foundation went on unevenly.  </li>
            <li> For me this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Since this lotion is not cheap, I would want every drop of lotion that I paid for.  </li>
            <li> Been using it since, everyday.  </li>
            <li> Once it has been on for a few minutes</li>
            <li> And I have noticed a few unwelcome lines appearing on my forehead, so I thought I would give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect an immediate reaction on the lines on my forehead, so I waited a few days after using the product to check the lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this product as my sole moisturizer, I could say that there was some slight improvment, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was dramatic.</li>
            <li> I received this product a few days ago and opened it to use yesterday.</li>
            <li> It actually seemed to make my wrinkles look worse which was really driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> Olay thought it was likely the product had been poorly stored</li>
            <li> My other complaint is that Olay never returns emails.  </li>
            <li> suggestion would be that packaging be simplified since a squeeze tube would be easier to carry, less expensive, and less complicated than the pump/overly large container it is in now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;I&#x27;m sorry several of you are having trouble with the packaging of the Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution.</li>
            <li> I use Olay products extensively and this was an extreme disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Very little in bottle.</li>
            <li> This oil of Olay product not one of my favorites, very little product in container for the price you pay .</li>
            <li> I think if a woman who has much deeper lines or wrinkles uses this product, she may be a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I have not been a fan of Olay in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the container is designed like this.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like</li>
            <li> it being in a can and unable to see how much is left.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday and doesn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li> on your website, the date for return is past.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was unable to use it long enough to acertain any \\&quot;wrinkle revolution\\&quot; taking place.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, oily, or thin and runny unlike other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> The hard plastic cases are difficult to open, although they seem to be moving towards easier-to-open packages on some of the product line.  </li>
            <li> This wrinkle complex is showing signs of helping.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a least a 50 % inmprovement in my skin condition.  </li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex is a product that produces results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I haven&#x27;t use this regularly</li>
            <li> am in my late 20&#x27;s and have just started to notice the tiniest lines under my eyes and over my eyebrows- this product did not make them disappear.</li>
            <li> I mean a lot and will transfer your skin in 2 days..not for under make up..</li>
            <li> I have had issues with Olay&#x27;s dispensing methods for years, but this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It does not have that nasty, greasy feel when applied, as if you were slathering your face with warm butter -- which is something that I hate-hate-hate with a mad passion.</li>
            <li> not a good thing guys</li>
            <li> Not good, not good at all.</li>
            <li> Health and beauty products are difficult to review because it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get empirical evidence to analyze efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Neither are we \\&quot;having problems with the packaging\\&quot; nor are we idiots that do not know how to \\&quot;operate\\&quot; a simple pump.  </li>
            <li> Rather than looking tired, she looks like she just had a vacation.</li>
            <li> Maybe they&#x27;ve changed the pump since I purchased mine but the pump works poorly.</li>
            <li> I have received 5 of these on Subscribe &amp; Save and 2out of 5 have had a broken pump.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference using this product, but not a great difference.</li>
            <li> and the small wrinkiles under my eyes are driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the reviews that were unhappy with the pump not working on the Olay Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex.  </li>
            <li> Instead of acting as a base to my foundation, it produced a horrible interaction, that left me feeling</li>
            <li> Not a pleasant feeling!  </li>
            <li> It has a horrible, thick synthetic texture and almost feels slightly scratchy when it goes on my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Pumps are absolutely useless.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s time for me to find another product line unfortunately.</li>
            <li> &quot; she didn&#x27;t believe me, looked at me skeptically and said \\&quot;Move</li>
            <li> I have become obsessed with caring for my skin now which I had never cared about before.</li>
            <li> This product is awful in its current packaging.</li>
            <li> but, sadly it doesn&#x27;t have the expiration date?</li>
            <li> The product oozes out all around the base of the pump.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these on sale from my local supermarket and would have to say it&#x27;s one of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I feel a very poor quality dispenser and don&#x27;t believe I will purchase again.  </li>
            <li> When a consumer is paying $17 for 1.7 ounces, that comes to roughly $1,088 a gallon (talk about gas being expensive!!!)  </li>
            <li> But alas, we are disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a horrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> How cheesy!  </li>
            <li> Plus it would be very difficult to tell when the product was running out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have arthritis in my hands and even trying vice grips find that impossible to do.  </li>
            <li> This seller made it impossible to get a refund.</li>
            <li> However, with this product I didn&#x27;t notice the scent being bad.     </li>
            <li> but Olay doesn&#x27;t seem to be as bad as ANEW</li>
            <li> and this was what was caused it to behave badly.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that she said that.  </li>
            <li> But I am totally disappointed with the lack of respect that Olay showed to their customers  with answers like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wrinkles do not disappear though :(</li>
            <li> The one thing I was disappointed in (and the reason for giving this product 4 stars instead of 5) is there is no SPF protection in this product.</li>
            <li> Trying to save money, I purchased this through Amazon and was seriously disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Awful- box was not sealed - bottle appears half-empty as it is nearly impossible to pump any product out of it.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was/am very disappointed in this product and am returning it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed on this item!</li>
            <li> However the packaging is HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> It felt horrible on my skin.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> too soon to tell.  don&#x27;t ask again.</li>
            <li> I normally like the Olay product line but this is a waste of money</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly and absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Read review so bought one and don&#x27;t like it because use the all that hope see any difference but did not. It is not oily light. Really don&#x27;t think worth what I paid for.</li>
            <li> It is definitely keeping the wrinkles away.  I use it on my face and  neck!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the results of this lotion, but I had to stop using it.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I have a deep crease between my eyes and some lines around my eyes when I smile.  I found that after just a few days of using this it was noticeably better.  The only problem was that after about a week I started to get little whiteheads all over my face.  I have very sensitive skin, but I thought this would be okay since it is non-comedogenic.  Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t and I had to quit using it.  If your skin is not too sensitive, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> Sure, this product does help reduce the appearance of wrinkles, but I dislike the residue it leaves on my skin.  I&#x27;ve always been one to put comfort before beauty, so this is not for me.  It does make make-up a little difficult to apply nicely, as well.</li>
            <li> Both me and my spouse tried this product for about a week.  We normally use Aveeno moisturizer and frankly will return to that... This moisturizer seems to form more of a \\&quot;seal\\&quot; but I found that the Aveeno provides the same result with 2xday application at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I would rate this as OK, but not the aging revolution that&#x27;s promised.  And the price / value ratio is out of whack.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex yesterday, along with several other products in the Olay Regenerist line. I tried this morning to get something out of it, eager to try my new purchase, but couldn&#x27;t get anything out of it and gave up, as I had to move on and get to work.  I just came home and decided to try again this evening. I&#x27;ve been trying and trying, fiddling the head around as you sometimes find with lotion pumps, but nada. Nothing! CRAP - now I have to go return it, which will cost more in gas and hassle than the product is worth, which means I might just suck it up. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!!!! OTOH if I find issues with other products in this line I might make the effort to return everything. Bummer.</li>
            <li> After using this product only 14 nights the pump stopped working.  I dismantled the bottle and put the rest of the product in another container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read the customers reviews at Amazon&#x27;s and Olay&#x27;s websites and found out that many people had had the same problem.  I do not find Olay&#x27;s responses in neither of both websites acceptable at all. To give an example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I&#x27;m sorry several of you are having trouble with the packaging of the Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution. What I found works best is to tap the container on its top (on red, metallic over-cap) before removing the cap. Next remove the metallic over-cap and the black tab in the dispenser. Hold the canister and place index finger on black actuator and completely press the actuator down and release pressure to allow to return to starting position. You&#x27;ll want to keep repeating this until the product comes out. This may take several times. We don&#x27;t want you to feel you wasted your money so if you still have trouble give us a call at (800) 395-0737 and we&#x27;ll be happy to help!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay&#x27;s representative, spare me your lecture. Neither are we \\&quot;having problems with the packaging\\&quot; nor are we idiots that do not know how to \\&quot;operate\\&quot; a simple pump.  YOUR PRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE!  Since you were aware of the problem you should have recalled it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, another reviewer that called you said that she had to wait 2-3 weeks to get a replacement.  Excellent customer service!  Next time, save \\&quot;your help\\&quot; and send the product right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Olay products for a while (Tottal Effects, Regenerist, Pro X) and was always very pleased.  But I am totally disappointed with the lack of respect that Olay showed to their customers  with answers like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;Also, we&#x27;ve made a few changes to the dispensing on our packaging. So, we&#x27;re confident you won&#x27;t experience this problem if you choose to try the product again.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, but no thanks.</li>
            <li> Primer that is so so beautiful!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a week ago from a local drug store. The pump didn&#x27;t work at all. I had an empty Olay container and popped the top of and put this in it. I love this product! My creases in my forehead and going away. My crows feet are slowly becoming teeny-weeny! I will buy again but am hoping for a better container.</li>
            <li> The first night I applied this, I noticed a big difference.  I thought maybe I was just thinking I saw a reduction in wrinkles, but my forehead was noticeably smooth.  So, I continued to apply it.  I began to notice a significant reduction in fine lines.  The deeper lines were reduced, but you can still see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this on my neck, and I noticed that it firmed up.  Not dramatically, but noticeably.  It really reduced the wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I then looked at my upper chest.  I am a woman, and I have some lines there that lead down towards my mid chest.  So, I started putting this on that area.  It took a couple weeks, but I noticed a major reduction in the crease lines that are on my chest.  This, I thought was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you don&#x27;t put it on heavily.  If you do, it will leave a sticky feeling.  You need to put it on lightly.  I use a little more at night, because I&#x27;m going to bed and won&#x27;t notice the sticky feeling.  When I wear it during the day, I apply it first, then my moisturizer, then my makeup.  This doesn&#x27;t interfere with any of my other products.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a heavy smell.  It has a light perfume smell that dissipates within about 2 minutes after you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!  I hope it lives up to its claims of reducing wrinkles from forming.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it.  You get a lot in a bottle, and it lasts awhile.  I bought this over a month ago, and it still feels like I have quite a bit left.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the bottle, so perhaps they have fixed the issue that others have had with it failing.  Give this a try if you are looking for something that works!</li>
            <li> Seems to work for forehead wrinkles; results noticeable after a few days. However, this product is different from [[ASIN:B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid Ounces]], which is supposed to tighten the skin, and also seems to work as advertised. Both of these should do a good job in tandem, depending on your skin needs. But the serum sounds like it would do a better job overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for under-eye wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Recently switched to this from the micro-sculpting cream based on reviews and am very glad I did. I need less product to achieve the same moisturized feeling and the packaging is designed to keep the active ingredients fresher longer (rather than the screw-top jar).</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product yesterday and returned it today because the pump did not work - So Mr. Olay  where is the improved pump????? (this is December you know)  I have had issues with Olay&#x27;s dispensing methods for years, but this is ridiculous. Because of my love for their products,  I have tolerated the dispensers up to this point, but after this, I will no longer be forced to make yet another trip to buy or return a product which will not dispense, nor get \\&quot;half use\\&quot; of the ones that will.  Pumps are absolutely useless.  One needs a tube that can be easily squeezed, controlled and all product used. I, for one, do not care if the container is \\&quot;moisturized or not\\&quot;. I want the product on my skin.  Never thought I would buy another brand of facial products, but here I go in search of one.</li>
            <li> This Olay product is the best available. The product helps reduce crows feet and fine wrinkles. The price is fair too.</li>
            <li> Olay products are hit or miss for me, as a rule. This one was not a hit. It has a strong, albeit not unpleasant, fragrance that disappates after a time, but I dislike strongly fragranced beauty products. It has a velvet like consistency that doesn&#x27;t float on the surface of the skin, which was quite nice. However, I did break out after using it and cleared up when I stopped, so I surmise I have some sensitivity to it. Unfortunately, I was unable to use it long enough to acertain any \\&quot;wrinkle revolution\\&quot; taking place.</li>
            <li> OLAY REGENEREST WRINKLE REVOLUTION is a pretty decent moisturizer that works like a primer, which is used to create a smooth palette and decrease facial oil so that foundation or powder goes on evenly and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WRINKLE REVOLUTION goes on creamy and has the consistency slightly thicker than that of a serum. Once applying it to your face, your skin instantly feels velvety soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, just a few fine lines on my forehead, and the cream seemed to smooth those just fine. It also has a mattifying affect without feeling dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for about 4-5 weeks, about every two-three nights, only applying after showering from my workout, not to sleep in though, and my skin does appear to be smoother and glowing (although that could be from the BB CREAM [[ASIN:B0027A7CLG MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream No.23 Natural Beige SPF42 PA+++ (50ml)]] that I&#x27;ve been using during the day). Although I do occasionally breakout, I wouldn&#x27;t consider my skin to be overly sensitive and this cream didn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one-star because there isn&#x27;t a sunscreen in it so you&#x27;ll still need to use one in the day time. Also, it seemed that the 1.7 Oz went really fast (maybe mine wasn&#x27;t all the way full) but I&#x27;m on empty after the 4-5 weeks of use that wasn&#x27;t nightly.</li>
            <li> since I use \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; label dept store products! Gotta get the free gift, if you know what I mean...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I picked this as an item that I could receive free of charge through the Vine Voice program...and I like that I can try products I normally might not go for or know about...and the fact that I did not pay for this sample in no way influences my opinion or review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I diligently used this product as directed, 2x day, but did not use their other products with it.  I wanted to know how this held up by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was concerned, as it has a light fragrance to the liquid, and I am highly sensitive to fragrances, and I thought I might need to wash it off.  I waited a few minutes and then the scent no longer was noticible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I DID notice is that it went on smoothly, and felt fantastic!  Like I was bathing my skin in silk...and before I knew it, within a day or two, my friends started commenting on my appearance!  They used words like \\&quot;you look so pretty today!\\&quot;..\\&quot;you look relaxed, bright, happy\\&quot; etc..I did not wear any other products with this that I normally would...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in my humble opinion, I would say this moisturizer definitely makes a difference and does what it says it will!  I am in my mid &#x27;50&#x27;s, and have fair colored skin, with some red spots, a few aging spots, etc. And it truly seems to diminish the appearance of wrinkles and helps my skin overall to feel hydrated without being heavy or greasy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try the rest of the products in this line!  Ole!</li>
            <li> I FINISHED THE WHOLE BOTTLE AND I STILL GOT THE SAME WRINKLES. IT DIDNT DIMINISH WRINKLES INSTANTLY AS THEY CLAIM AND AFTER 14 DAYS I STILL HAVE WRINKLES. MINE ARENT DEEP,  I WAS SUPPOSED TO SEE SOME RESULT.</li>
            <li> Hi Shoppers,  Do not buy this product.  I ignored some of the other reviews, and wasted my money.  First of all, it does not contain 1.7 ounces as claimed.  Most of my moisturizers and night cream are 1.7 oz so I know how long it is supposed to last.  My 1.7 oz creams usually last from 4 to 6 weeks.  I used just a pea sized amount of the wrinkle complex under my regular daytime moisturizer, and to my amazement after only 1 week, nothing came out.  I thought it was stuck, so I dismantled the bottle and there was only about a 1/2 teaspoon more inside.  To add insult to injury, it did nothing to fight wrinkles as claimed, but this could be because there was not enough to make a difference.  I WILL NOT be buying this again.  What a horrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item today, and the pump did not work. Very disappointing. I went back to the store, and returned/purchased another. I read a review here, from the manufacturer, that they were fixing the pump problem, and it would be all set in Dec 2011. Well, this is March 2012, and I don&#x27;t think they fixed it yet. I will post as to if this helps my skin, once I have been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much but as I got into the fourth week of using it the product started to ooze out of the container between the top and bottom part of the container.  I hope Olay improves on this or I will have to try another brand.  This was purchased on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off with the positive: this Regenerist product is great when used to spot treat problem areas.  I&#x27;ve noticed a visible reduction in wrinkles above my lips and along the corners of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated the product an overall three stars because while the lotion deserves five stars, the container it comes in deserves a MINUS five stars.  When a consumer is paying $17 for 1.7 ounces, that comes to roughly $1,088 a gallon (talk about gas being expensive!!!)  The problem with the container is that it stops pumping when the lotion starts running low.  I noticed the cream squishing out of the top of the container, where the pump lid is attached.  So I used a screwdriver to pop off the top of the pump and low and behold, found an ample supply of lotion in the cap and in the container.  In my case, enough for about another week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consumers should NOT have to perform surgery on a container to access all of the product they&#x27;ve paid for.  Olay, and all other manufacturers who bottle products in such shoddy containers, needs to simplify the packaging and return to a container that allows full access, like a jar.  Olay offers that with other products.  Why not this one?</li>
            <li> Well,I ve been trying these product for more than 2 weeks and I have started noticing a lot of differences in my skin..  BTW,i dont have much wrinkles on my face, only a few.but its never too early to start a anti aging product.I use the cleanser with this too..</li>
            <li> I ordered the Wrinkle Revolution Complex with the skepticism of one who has been let down by many a \\&quot;wrinkle cream\\&quot;, but I have to say that, in my opinion, Olay has really created a great product with this one!  My skin feels so hydrated and soft after application, and, best of all, I have noticed an improvement in the appearance of my *ahem* laugh lines and character crinkles!!  It didn&#x27;t happen overnight, but it did happen, and I am really happy with the results!  (I apply the product right after a shower in the morning, then let it absorb into my skin for about 30 mins before applying any make-up, and apply it again after cleansing my face at night.)  I am pretty confident that with continued use, I will continue to see improvement, so I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after being guilted into using Mary Kay for years by my mother.  I had not only noticed an increase in fine lines around my eyes recently, but fine and somewhat deeper lines around my lips.  I had shingles on my face a few years ago, and the only scar I have is one deep line above my lip, crossing into my lip.  I&#x27;ve used this product for two days, and it may be my imagination, but my eyes are looking better already!  It smoothes on like pure silk and feels AWESOME!  I&#x27;m excited to see how this will work with the lines around my mouth, and if there will be any affect on the crease/scar left behind by shingles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caution is to not get pump happy!  A little goes a long way, and if you&#x27;re used to needing more than one pump of other products, you won&#x27;t need to do that with this one!  I wish this came in a squeeze tube, jar or something else, but as it is...that&#x27;s my only complaint!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m saving that fifth star for my update,  hoping I&#x27;ll need it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> After a few uses, it seems to be ok.  I never find that products claims are accurate, (from any company not just Olay) but at their price point I think they are a better value than most.  My makeup sits and wears well.  Wrinkles do not disappear though :(</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time and I didn&#x27;t like the way it felt on my skin.  It was not soft.  My skin felt sticky.  I contacted the seller and explained my problem and they refunded my money without problems.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons and tons of wrinkle products out there. Everything from La Mer to all Olay products Regenerist and Professional...and I was pleasantly surprised with this product--my favorite of all the Olay products. I have been using for less than a week and notice my face looks and feels smoother. And the dark circles under my eyes seemed to have lessened. Sometimes it seems like products work at first but then plateau--let&#x27;s hope this is not one of those times. I really like this product and will buy it again. And given the affordable price, I think I have found a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the complaints about the pump..I can see where they are coming from but it has not affected my opinion of the product. And yeah, it would be nice to see how much of the product you have left--but I will just always keep 2 on hand.</li>
            <li> Awful- box was not sealed - bottle appears half-empty as it is nearly impossible to pump any product out of it.</li>
            <li> I have not been a fan of Olay in the past. There was something about the scent that I just couldn&#x27;t take. However, with this product I didn&#x27;t notice the scent being bad.     I have used this product on my face and also on my hands. I am impressed with the results. My skin feels better and looks moisturized. I especially like to use it on my hands because the product seems to make them look more youthful.</li>
            <li> Like the scent and the way it feels on skin. Not too heavy. I think it works on fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Ugh, Red rash and itchiness under eyes. Over a month later and still the symptoms persist. Never reacted to anything before this. BUYER BEWARE. Olay should seriously look into better testing of this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my skin (around the eyes), not greasy at all. It certainly has given the appearance of softening the wrinkles around my eyes as well. I&#x27;m very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Went on easy, but when I tried to put my foundation on, it was actually hard to spread because of the wrinkle complex.  Not a pleasant feeling!  And, my foundation went on unevenly.  NOT the product for me.  I like all the regenerist products I&#x27;ve used except for this one.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice face cream. It applies smoothly and evenly. One can use just a small amount to have good facial coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these Olay products have been well designed and developed. They are rich creams, over all fairly hypo-allergenic, and do the job they promise at a good and affordable price. The list of Olay dermatologists, scientists and product developers is impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using Olay products for years and am very pleased.  This whole new Regenerist line is a far cry from the Oil of Olay line of yesterday. That was nice, and probably formulated for 20 something skin.  This new Regenerist product line is definitely beneficial to more mature skin and helps it to look lovely even in dry and polluted city climates.</li>
            <li> Love the product, smells good and makes my face feel great</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the reviews that were unhappy with the pump not working on the Olay Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex.  In spite of Olay claiming that they had improved the situation, I wasn&#x27;t able to get the pump to work and have torn the thing apart in order to use the product.  That would make me think twice before purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Olay has a reputation for developing great skin products, especially for those with sensitive skin. My wife tried this product and liked it so much that she continues to purchase it. I have noticed some results in wrinkle reduction on her face, so I have to say it works as claimed. While I think it is a little over-priced, most of these type products are about the same. She did not have any problems with the pump mechanism, but it&#x27;s nice to see that Olay responded to the many concerns and has changed the pump design. I recommend that you give this one a try if you are looking to smooth out some of those wrinkles.</li>
            <li> First time using this product makes my make up go on smoother no wrinkles</li>
            <li> I am 29, and I have one wrinkle under my left eye that my foundation always creases in. After 3 or 4 days of using this, the make-up problem vanished. Yes the wrinkle is still there, but it must not be as deep because my foundation does not build up in it. Plus, the product feels and smells great on your skin. Using it twice a day, the 1.70 oz bottle lasts close to 3 months; so, it is an affordable product that works! Also, my mother-in-law who is in her 50&#x27;s has started using it, and she loves it too. She looks refreshed. Rather than looking tired, she looks like she just had a vacation. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have always used Olay products - the only products I have used in 50 years, since the pink stuff was all they had.  This wrinkle complex is showing signs of helping.  My wrinkles are very well established unfortunately, so there is a lot of age to overcome.  I can see improvement around my eyes after just 10 days or so, and I&#x27;m not applying it quite as often as recommended.  I will definitely buy it again, and this seller was excellent.</li>
            <li> First time buyer of this lotion. Have been happy with all other Olay products purchased. I think the product is good, but the packaging is terrible. The pump doesn&#x27;t work. Not sure why the container is designed like this. I&#x27;m returning the item to Amazon and going back to Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second bottle of this stuff.  I use it as a night cream as it is a little heavy.  I have seen a least a 50 % inmprovement in my skin condition.  Age spots are fading and minor wrinkles are disappearing.  I am 58 and have not really taken very good care of my skin.  I&#x27;ve always had oily skin but it is starting to dry out as I age.  I am very please with the Olay product line.</li>
            <li> I just bought my first bottle of this, and I have to say I&#x27;m amazed - it really does what it&#x27;s advertised to do! I put it on and my wrinkles (crows&#x27; feet and lines around my mouth - I&#x27;m 47) really do look a LOT less noticeable. And as an added bonus it helps the dark circles under my eyes too, something I wasn&#x27;t expecting. Great product - way to go, Olay!</li>
            <li> Have always been pleased with all of the Olay products I have used. My grandmother used them and always had such beautiful skin. I was happy to try out this product and once again am very happy.     My skin is very sensitive and I am always worried when I first try something new. No problems. This product goes on very light and smells wonderful. I used it for 14 days before reviewing. It was used on my crow&#x27;s feet and forehead. I don&#x27;t have very many wrinkles and I think this product will help me keep it that way. It definitely is working on my crow&#x27;s feet.    You don&#x27;t need to use very much of this product (like that very much) and I am very impressed and will certainly replace when it is gone.    Thank you again, Olay! Another great product!</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex didn&#x27;t disappoint me and delighted me with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was gentle to my skin so there was so \\&quot;brush burn\\&quot; feeling or redness. It softened wrinkles and either caused them to vanish or not be quite so obvious. The scent was light and soft so it didn&#x27;t overpower the scent of other HBA products or tussle with my perfume or other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see any immediate difference but after a few uses I began to notice a change in the appearance of both fine and deeper wrinkles. It only seems to improve my appearance with continued use. A definite improvement over other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because of how this product feels on my skin and performed. It is not greasy, oily, or thin and runny unlike other products I have tried. Even though it appears thick, it has a dry, light feel to it, spreads easily, and is very comfortable. I did not have any trouble applying makeup over it (I use a foundation, powder, and light blush only) or with my makeup \\&quot;melting&#x27; after a few hours. Because it is &#x27;dry&#x27; I had less problems with oily shine, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for reducing wrinkles, I did see improvement in a deep wrinkle between my eyebrows- the only place I have one, thanks to a lifetime of oily skin. As with all makeup or beauty products, your skin&#x27;s reaction will be an important factor. But, this product might work well for you if you have oily skin or prefer a lighter moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion would be that packaging be simplified since a squeeze tube would be easier to carry, less expensive, and less complicated than the pump/overly large container it is in now.</li>
            <li> Ok as a moisturiser but it has done nothing for wrinkles, not even the finest wrinkles have shown any difference at all in the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it. For me this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I gave up a good skin care system&#x27;s lotion to try this product.  (A decent line from the beauty supply store.)&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice a day, and at first I actually thought that this product made the lines worse--and by the end of three weeks see that it didn&#x27;t do a thing.  (I didn&#x27;t really expect it to, though--so I wasn&#x27;t too disappointed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles--just laugh lines and some forehead lines.  They are the same now as they were then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells good and has an interesting \\&quot;feel\\&quot; to it.  Unlike most wrinkle-reducers that you apply before makeup, it doesn&#x27;t tighten your skin.  It&#x27;s soft, almost a powdery feeling to it.  It isn&#x27;t greasy or wet.  I liked that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s not a bad product--it does moisturize your face, but it didn&#x27;t decrease the lines on my face.</li>
            <li> Reviewed by my wife ... \\&quot;I have enjoyed all the new line from Olay Regenerist line I have tried. This particular complex is effective over night and the application pump is easy to use. I like most that the product is not oily. It&#x27;s easily absorbed and has a light, pleasant smell.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This got a good review in O magazine. So I ordered it from Amazon. It arrived TOTALLY empty. I could not return it because when I started to use it, the return date had passed by three days. Do not buy this product unless you can check to make sure it has the product in it. It was a complete rip-off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to say this is a wonderful product, or even a mediocre product, but I still don&#x27;t know.   I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and in both cases, the pump didn&#x27;t work.   Guess I&#x27;ll just have to return this to the store (again), and find another product.</li>
            <li> I use Olay products extensively and this was an extreme disappointment.  The pump didn&#x27;t work at all.  Three people have tried it and could not make the product pump out until my husband had to break it apart.  It&#x27;s not a good idea to put your fingers into a moisturizing product -- even if they are clean, it compromises the product integrity.  I love Olay&#x27;s products but have long been dissatified with the packaging. The hard plastic cases are difficult to open, although they seem to be moving towards easier-to-open packages on some of the product line.  Avoid this one, though -- or make sure you keep the receipt in case it won&#x27;t open at all, like mine did.  I buy Olay from a number of stores and cannot remember which store I purchased this one from, so I&#x27;m out the $30+ dollars without ever getting to use any of it.  My other complaint is that Olay never returns emails.  Total waste of time.  I think it&#x27;s time for me to find another product line unfortunately.</li>
            <li> When I initially removed the lid, the entire top half of the container came apart (the large black pump part pulled away from the silver bottom portion).  A large amount of the product slopped into the sink and floor.  I could have cried. It was probably eight to ten days worth of the moisturizer.  I went ahead and used what went on the sink, but it was much, much more than I needed.  It felt OK, but I was so upset over the amount that was wasted that I&#x27;m not sure how I really feel about it.  Please be super careful when you remove the lid, or you will be extremely disappointed. Hopefully, after using it twice a day for two to three weeks, I can update this review with happy results.  Regenerist fragrance-free serum has been my go to moisturizer for years.  I&#x27;ve never had an experience like this with any Olay product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed on this item! The pump doesn&#x27;t work. I have to break the top cover to pieces to get the cream. I&#x27;m a Olay fan, but this one was so different and strange. Some material in this cream doesn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the fact that i use it twice a day and it is gone in two weeks makes me think that this is a scam.  Feel cheated that after two weeks and just using three pushes in the top lip that it would be gone so fast.  not a good thing guys</li>
            <li> This product is an OK thick moisturizer, which I decided to give a second try, despite my growing dissatisfaction with Olay&#x27;s deceptive packaging.  The container for this product is \\&quot;1.7 oz\\&quot;, and it is about twice the diameter of the container for Olay&#x27;s micro-sculpting cream [ASIN:B0039NMCPG Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum, 1.7 Ounce] also 1.7 oz, which is perhaps 1/2 inch taller.  If you do the math, the volume of the containers is NOT the same, and visually they are strikingly different.  To further the deception, all Olay products are packaged in boxes that are much larger than the product, which sits inside the box on a little paper platform, evidently to make it look bigger. How cheesy!  Olay is a good product.  It deserves honest, consumer-friendly packaging.  Olay is becoming better in \\&quot;friendliness\\&quot;-- earlier packaging had so much hard plastic encapsulating their product it required major surgery to unwrap it. The next step would be to refrain from the deceptive packaging.  As another issue, this time, when I opened the box, the container was broken, even though the product box was not-- and the box showed no damage, so evidently it was a lack of quality-control during the production run. NOT the fault of Amazon&#x27;s shipping!  I returned it, and Amazon promptly gave me a refund. Bless Amazon.</li>
            <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies! But the pump container needs to be replaced with a simple squeeze tube!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in this dry mountain air, I always welcome any kind of moisturizing skin care, especially since I love being outside in the great outdoors and playing up in the mountains both during winter and summer.  And if the moisturizer also smooths out wrinkles, that is an added bonus!  Several of us, all in our forties, first started using this last autumn, and we all give it a thumbs-up.  This does help to smooth out fine lines, especially around the eye area and forehead region, and when used twice a day, our skin felt smoother and tighter.  Larger wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet will not totally disappear, but they do become less noticeable over time with regular usage of this lotion.  This lotion has a nice creamy feel and smell to it.  Although everyone&#x27;s skin sensitivities and allergies may differ, none of our \\&quot;test panel\\&quot; of users experienced any allergic reactions, rashes, or itchiness from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am removing one whole star rating because the pump dispenser is really annoying to use when a simple squeeze tube would have been both easier to use and also more compact to carry.  Sometimes, the pump may even clog so no lotion can be pumped out.  In that case, you have to pry up the entire pump mechanism; the pump comes apart fairly easily after a bit of prying.  With the pumped now removed, you can just dip a finger into the tub to get lotion out.  The red cap and black pump can then be snapped back onto the tub.  But if you are unable to clear the clog on the pump, then you need to pry off the pump again when you use the lotion later.  When the container became empty and would no longer pump out more lotion, I pried off the pump part and found that there was still some lotion left inside the tub that could have been extracted if it was dispensed from a more flexible squeeze tube.  Since this lotion is not cheap, I would want every drop of lotion that I paid for.  So Olay should have packaged this lotion in a simple squeeze tube.this lotion is not cheap, I would want every drop of lotion that I paid for.  So Olay should have packaged this lotion in a simple squeeze tube.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much of a \\&quot;revolution\\&quot; is occurring on my face, my wrinkles seem to be pretty darned stubborn. However, this lotion does feel nice and never too heavy, and it does a very good job under foundation, seeming to keep makeup from gathering in my deepest wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed since beginning to use this product in place of my normal Neutrogena Healthy Defense that the skin on my neck and at the jawline feels a bit smoother.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased the Olay Wrinkle Revolution Complex.  I absolutely love it.  It is the only product that I have ever used that I actually have seen results from.  I have tried many, many products in the past, but this is the only one that I can say has actually made my wrinkles less noticable.  My daughter asked me if I had been using something different on my face.  I asked her why she asked me that question.  She responded that I did not have any wrinkles anymore.  I was shocked that she said that.  I knew my wrinkles looked less noticable, but I had no idea that other people would notice such a marked improvement.  I also got compliments from a co-worker.  I will definetly be purchasing more of this from now on.  I could not be happier!!!</li>
            <li> purchased as gift for wife. she says it seems ok as moisturizer, but has done little for wrinkles. very slight fading at best. if it was worth it id return it for a refund. the price was good though, but she had much higher hopes. after reading all of the positive reviews I was sure this would be THEE PRODUCT!. But alas, we are disappointed.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start from the beginning. Opening the product was a bit of a chore. Eventually I had to go get pliers and a screwdriver to get the thing open so the cream could be accessed. That&#x27;s when I found out a little deception in packaging was going on. The container is just over 3 1/2 inches tall, but the cream part measures only 1/2 of an inch deep. At $30 retail that&#x27;s a bit of a disappointment. It&#x27;s not so much I minded so little, it&#x27;s that they hid it. Plus it would be very difficult to tell when the product was running out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used the product (didn&#x27;t love the name:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Regenerist.\\&quot; It sounded like something that needed the name \\&quot;Ellen\\&quot; in front of it after she&#x27;s given a prize to an audience member, then given them another as a surprise.) for 3 weeks faithfully. I liked how it went on, thinly and smooth, no thick gunk to clog your pores.&lt;br /&gt;Nicely, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I observed carefully my amazing wrinkles before and after and concluded that while yes, the product did in fact reduce my wrinkles, they were still basically there. The large wrinkles by the side of my nose remained the same, whereas, the finer wrinkles around my lips were reduced slightly. But the thing is, even if my wrinkles were less than previous, I still had the same old face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided that overall, this would not be a product I would highly recommend. I doubt that prolonged use would make your wrinkles disappear altogether. Sooner or later you are going to get old and look old. The alternative is far more disagreeable. Better to spread joy across your face, for that is the best \\&quot;youth-making\\&quot; product of all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both ANEW by AVON and Olay and can say that Olay does a fine job moisturizing the face.  I like the way it smells, it seems to smell better to me than ANEW.  I always had a problem with these sort of lotions clogging my pores but Olay doesn&#x27;t seem to be as bad as ANEW has been (of course I&#x27;ve used Olay only a short time).  Overall, its a fine product and the price doesn&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an Olay brand product and I am very impressed, this product is easy to apply, leaves my skin so soft and with a velvety feeling, doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue (completely zero) I never had tried before a product that leaves that smooth feeling over my skin and the smell is smooth and pleasant. I bought two one for me and one for my mother. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet, but I&#x27;ve been noticed my skin is already losing firmness, I am 47 years old, really noticed my skin is softer and more firm, specially on my jaw line and around my lips. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I really do dislike any creams or lotions that have a greasy feel to them, and this does. However, it does seem to improve the wrinkles when used as directed, and that is the main point of it. But I find myself just not using it much because other products like Este Lauder seem to do as good of a job and not have the super-greasy feel to them. The price of this though is much more pleasing than the mall brands.</li>
            <li> Great as a primer, it really helps my frown lines, I put it on and wait for it to dry before applying my base. Just be gentle when smoothing on makeup so it won&#x27;t rub off- I liked it a lot and always use it now- holds up well all day.</li>
            <li> Nice, clean scent and penetrates skin nicely, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.  It&#x27;s a basic moisturizer backed by a company with LOTS of money who can hire a very convincing PR team.</li>
            <li> Great product but the packaging is definitely an issue.  The feedback on the pump device is so uniformly bad I wonder why the company continues to deliver a great skin treatment this way - when I buy it now, I just go ahead and remove the lid with a screwdriver and pliers, saving the insert portion to use as a cap.  A tiny dab is plenty and I find it lasts quite a long time, and gives me excellent smoothness and a &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; finish to my skin before applying powder.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! This product actually does what it claims to do. It instantly smooths the fine lines on my forehead, including the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34;, and gives my skin an overall fresher and more youthful tone. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and my skin has had no adverse reaction to it and it actually seems to have improved the texture of my skin. Try this, ladies!</li>
            <li> The bottle was damaged and did not work after the first couple uses.  I was not able to use after the first couple times.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a sheer coincidence and Olay just changed it (kind of doubt that), but I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time and just bought a couple from Amazon because of the good price. The pump is not the same and it smells different. The consistency and feel appear to be the same... I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it from the same merchant again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars to the original product, which I love. I only have an issue with the packaging. Once I had a problem with the pump; another time the whole can opened and splashed. I can see why Olay may want to improve the packaging, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d want to change the product itself. I can&#x27;t rate the real product I received from Amazon/Cosmetics Depot...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and unfortunately even at my age I broke out using this product. This may be just me as I don&#x27;t put very much product on my skin because of its sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I CANNOT GET ANYTHING OUT OF THE CONTAINER. I HAVE PUMPED AND PUMPED AND NOTHING COMES OUT TRYING TO GET THE DARN THING TO WORK</li>
            <li> product says it smooths out the wrinkles and crows feet. didnt work on my face.  maybe i&#x27;m too old for it to work</li>
            <li> I found that it was very drying if I used it as directed, twice a day.  So I use it only once or twice a week, and put moisturizers on top of it.  Maybe it clarifies my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> I use this after regenerist cleanser and micro-sculpting cream.  I have laugh lines, nose crinkles, and minor crows feet, and I noticed that in about a week, this product has really smoothed my face out without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> I do use it every day, 2x a day.  of course nothing will ever get rid of the wrinkles completely but this sure feels good and&lt;br /&gt;helps as much as possible.</li>
            <li> Saw raves about this on Consumers Digest 5 years ago, how it&#x27;s better than $300 creams.  Been using it since, everyday.  I&#x27;m now 39, and people always guess my age in my 20&#x27;s.  Of course I never tan anymore.  Was in a pool last week (with sunscreen! Lol), no makeup, and a stranger thought I was 23.  I swear by this product.  Get it!!</li>
            <li> This complex is very lightweight and leaves my skin very soft. Absorbs quickly. I can&#x27;t say how is it caring against wrinkles(I&#x27;m 30), But I have them very few :) only problem - for the ones with very dry skin- they will need additional moisture, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin silky smooth and makeup goes on a lot better. I use it morning and night and my skin seems to look fresher.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good night time moisturizer. Silky, slightly spackle-like texture. Does contain fragrance which my skin takes time to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Very little in bottle. Not what I expected out of Olay. I have always loved Olay product but was very disappointed in this. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> For two weeks, this was the only cosmetic item I had access to. I was amazed at how much better my skin looked when I finally got to a mirror. This stuff is good.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and soaks into skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a mask. My skin looks and feels better after using this for a couple weeks. I make this a regular part of my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels and because of the &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; it gives my skin  I no longer need to use a foundation primer.  This is highly recommended on beautypedia.com for having all the good stuff you want/need in a face cream without an exorbinate pricetag.</li>
            <li> very good cream, it does absorb very quick and great for under make up or for non make up days .. the skin get very hydrated and baby soft on touch , if you have very deep wrinkles use the intense hydration that is much stronger I mean a lot and will transfer your skin in 2 days..not for under make up.. this one more for younger skin with fine lines or for under make up as primer as it does not break up the make up as the others</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Olay products, but this gave me a rash.</li>
            <li> must be good my wife has no wrinkles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but no better.  While I love all the other Olay products, this one just seems to sit on the face without being absorbed. It also makes my face look shiny.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried this particular Olay product. Don&#x27;t really see any difference in my lines but it does keep my face feeling nourished. The only drawback is the grainey feel when it is applied. Once it has been on for a few minutes and I apply foundation, I don&#x27;t notice it anymore. Not sure if this is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex is a product that produces results. It has lessened some light lines around my eyes and I have been overall pleased with it. I even like the pump style canister it comes it. It pumps just enough to use. My biggest peeve is that every time I smooth it on, it has a very fine grit feel that I only feel on my face slightly irritating it. That part I don&#x27;t like, but overall Olay Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex is a good product - one of the few I&#x27;ve noticed visible results with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, but at 51 years of age, I am concerned about skin aging and NOT getting wrinkles. And I have noticed a few unwelcome lines appearing on my forehead, so I thought I would give this product a try. I do like the Olay&#x27;s line of products, normally, and find them to be beneficial and in a price range that is affordable for the average woman.    What I really liked about this product, and noticed immediately, was the way it went on my skin and the quickness with which it was absorbed. There was no \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; residue or \\&quot;icky\\&quot; feeling. My skin felt soft and moisturized and fresh - it had a very nice feel to it. The product states there is a \\&quot;cashmere\\&quot; feel, and I suppose that is what I&#x27;m attempting to describe, but I truly noticed it and liked the feeling. I felt as though I could apply make-up directly over this and not feel as if my face had a \\&quot;caked on\\&quot; feeling. Very nice.    I didn&#x27;t expect an immediate reaction on the lines on my forehead, so I waited a few days after using the product to check the lines on my forehead. The lines I have are not very deep, and my husband tells me they aren&#x27;t even all that noticeable to him, but I certainly don&#x27;t want them to get any deeper! After a few days of using this product as my sole moisturizer, I could say that there was some slight improvment, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was dramatic. I think if a woman who has much deeper lines or wrinkles uses this product, she may be a little disappointed. However, she may be as impressed with quality of moisturization that I was.    The one thing I was disappointed in (and the reason for giving this product 4 stars instead of 5) is there is no SPF protection in this product. I had a melanoma removed 4 years ago, and I am very sensitive to protecting my skin against UVA/UVB rays. When I wear a full face of make-up, it does contain SPF, but I rarely wear a full face of make- up - perhaps 2 - 3 times a year. The majority of the time, I wash my face and apply a moisturizer and go - and I want that moisturizer to contain SPF protection. This product does not have that, and I found that to be a great disappointment. Because of that, I would not use this product for daytime use; however, I would very much consider this product for a nighttime moisturizer. It goes on smooth, is not greasy or sticky, and I like the way it moisurizes.</li>
            <li> This is a good choice for a wrinkle cream in the median price range.  It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but after a couple of weeks of continuous usage you will notice some obvious and beneficial effects.  It makes the skin feel smooth and silky immediately after application, but with time you do notice a tightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major facial points where I&#x27;m seeing a difference are around the eyes and the forehead.  The indentations in those areas are not as pronounced.  Also, bonus points for not reacting with sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve noticed no breaks outs since testing began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With reasonable expectations, this product will improve the appearance of lines and wrinkles.  Overall, thumbs up and recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product in a couple of different ways, but so far haven&#x27;t seen the expected results. I started by using it around my eyes.  My skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily so I used it sparingly and will say it feels beautifully smooth to apply.  It is not at all greasy and leaves my skin feeling really nice, but I haven&#x27;t noticed improvement in the lines around my eyes.  At least I&#x27;ve had no breakouts so maybe further use will yield results. I decided to try it on other areas as well and on my hands where there are definitely wrinkles.  Maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much but so far the results are a bit underwhelming, even though the product makes a nice base to apply my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery system is not one I&#x27;d choose.  The bottle is not very tall, but big around, and the cap is the same circumference.  The entire cap is depressed to dispense the product, but doesn&#x27;t press down evenly, nor does the product come out smoothly.  The good thing about the limited amounts that come out with each effort is that you don&#x27;t waste product by dispensing too much by mistake, but it feels awkward and you have to press the top multiple times as it tips this way and that, to get enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands, especially, are hydrated and soft from using the product which seems to absorb very quickly, but the wrinkles are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: The product may be helpful to discourage lines and wrinkles from forming, and is a nice smooth base under makeup, but hasn&#x27;t improved existing wrinkles for me.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve been now and again tempted to spend way much more for a high-end skin-care product that didn&#x27;t seem to be all that much different from this or any other Oil of Olay products. Being that I am of (ahem) a certain age, but having never smoked or gone out for broiling myself regularly in the sun, the wrinkles I do boast are relatively minor anyway. I can&#x27;t insist that this product magically erased them and I looked half my age instantly ... but it is a very soothing product to use and absorbs almost instantly. It does not have that nasty, greasy feel when applied, as if you were slathering your face with warm butter -- which is something that I hate-hate-hate with a mad passion. A product like this which avoids this quality is a five-star in my book.</li>
            <li> I do like this product. It feels silky smooth on my skin and does diminish the appearance of wrinkles without leaving any kind of residue that rubs off or flakes. However the packaging is HORRIBLE. Maybe they&#x27;ve changed the pump since I purchased mine but the pump works poorly. When I thought the product had run out I got curious and broke the container open to find a HUGE amount of product left in the container. The pump seems to operate on suction so I guess when it reaches a certain point it no longer has the pressure to get the rest of the product out. I&#x27;ll be using the remaining product for probably another month, just taking it out of the container with my finger rather than with the pump. Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product that works as well if not better than other far more expensive products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It appears to help. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Health and beauty products are difficult to review because it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get empirical evidence to analyze efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this stuff, but my wife does, and she swears by it. Most people think she&#x27;s at least a decade younger than she is when they first meet her. Joanne has lived a life of relative moderation... no smoking or drugs ever, and sensible alcohol use... and maybe that has a lot to do with her youthful looks, but if you ask her, she will tell you that it&#x27;s also because she takes care of her skin with this and a few other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this in groceries stores and paid dearly for it and decided to try to buy it online.  I am so grateful that I did.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  The pump kind of sucks...but the lotion is amazing!  I use it every day, if I miss it, I notice.  Keeps my skin soft and greatly reduces fine lines and discoloration.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, including the gentlemen who went unrecognized by his cows and the lady who stated the \\&quot;11\\&quot; on her forehead disappeared, I decided to gamble with $20. And, boy was it worth it! After an application last night and this morning, my \\&quot;11\\&quot; disappeared. My face looks much smoother and I am very pleased. I&#x27;m a fluffy 41-year old and feel that I am getting new wrinkles by the minute. This product works so well that I&#x27;m considering trying the rest of the line. Olay has always been good, but not as impressive to me as Estee Lauder. This blows the competition away - well worth the $20. Try it and I think you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a moisturizer that won&#x27;t make me breakout or feel greasy.  I have found it!  And it really seems to be ironing out the wrinkles around my eyes. This is quite the revolution!</li>
            <li> Use on my neck and chest area and love the change in my skin.  Really did get rid of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have received 5 of these on Subscribe &amp; Save and 2out of 5 have had a broken pump.The price range has had a difference of as much as $4.98.If you dont mind clipping coupons its worth going to the store.Amazon will replace but who wants to have to wait for them to send another and have to send them the broken one back.</li>
            <li> I had checked other reviews before buying this and saw the comments about the pump that didn&#x27;t work but assumed that a company like Olay would have fixed the problem by now.  I found that this was not true.  I do not have an opinion about the product yet, not having used it enough, but I do know that I won&#x27;t be buying it again no matter how good it is.  I have jerryrigged a temporary solution, but I&#x27;m traveling soon and it just won&#x27;t do.  Very surprising and disappointing.</li>
            <li> I use practically every kind of Olay product and without fail, they have been extraordinary.    The Olay Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex combines Olay&#x27;s trademark moisture with micro-fillers that promise to smooth out the wrinkles--and guess what?  They do.  And it was noticeable within a week of using the product.    It also reduced my deep eye lines within that same period.      It&#x27;s soft and it&#x27;s non-greasy, leaves no build-up and is safe for daily use--basically all I&#x27;ve come to appreciate in the Olay Regenerist product line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and it seemed like overnight the skin under my eyes got all loose and saggy.  I&#x27;ve never used any face or eye care products before.  I started using this product twice a day about a month ago under my eyes and I can see a visible difference. The skin under my eyes is much smoother, tighter, and firmer and the dark circles have lightened a bit as well.  I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on crow&#x27;s feet or other skin issues, but I am very happy and surprised with my results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim like I do with many anti-aging products...being full of hope but half expecting it to not live up to the hype.  I had been using it 2 weeks before my wedding (for fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes), and when my best friend/maid of honor was in from Florida, she asked me out of the blue \\&quot;Did you get botox??\\&quot;  When I replied \\&quot;NO\\&quot; she didn&#x27;t believe me, looked at me skeptically and said \\&quot;Move your forehead.\\&quot;  It was only THEN that she believed I didn&#x27;t get botox. I&#x27;ve noticed the biggest improvement on my forehead.  The #11 wrinkles between my eyebrows are only visible when I scowl, and the texture of my skin is now very smooth.  I love this product!!!  The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is for the packaging...I really don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t tell when the product is almost empty.  I&#x27;m trying to figure out how I&#x27;m going to crack open this bottle to get the last little bit of product out once the pump won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> I consider myself very picky when it comes to what I put on my face. For years I have been searching for the perfect moisturizer - rich enough to hydrate, but not greasy. I discovered this Olay product through Beautypedia, where it is highly recommended for its ingredients and packaging, and I couldn&#x27;t agree more. I wear this day and night (with sunscreen during the day) and I am completely dedicated. Over the past 6 months I have seen great improvement in the texture and evenness of my skin. Thanks Olay for another great skincare product!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  Goes on so smoothly and my skin feels amazingly soft and my lines are definitely softened too!!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I must be allergic to something in this. It caused a rash.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells divine. Makes my skin feel so refreshed and soft. Diminishes appearance of wrinkles, under-eye circles and bags disappear. Pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it! Definitely cheaper on Amazon than in the stores!</li>
            <li> Save your money; no results at all; it&#x27;s like using a cheap moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was really optimistic about this product, which is why I was willing to pay the $25 price tag. However, after trying this product for an extended length of time I can safely say I am greatly disappointed. This product did nothing in terms of improving my skin. In fact, the only real difference I noticed was that it left me with a super shiny complexion. I mean, my face literally shined in the light, and not in a good way. In a gross, greasy way. My skin was left feeling slick as well. Not good, not good at all. I will be avoiding the regenerist line in the future and I suggest you do the same.</li>
            <li> I had intended this product for my wife but I am not above trying something that might improve the look and health of skin. No question, it works, and fast.</li>
            <li> The box looks like it has been returned by another buyer. The clip on the can that is suppose to be&lt;br /&gt;removed when you are ready to use the product was already removed, I thought I was getting a bargain&lt;br /&gt;but am very unsatisfy. So I don&#x27;t know if this product was returned by another customer.</li>
            <li> I received this product a few days ago and opened it to use yesterday. First of all, it does not say &amp;#34;Instant Fix&amp;#34; anywhere on the package or bottle like it shows in the picture. I do believe that &amp;#34;Instants fix&amp;#34; is part of a product line so it doesn&#x27;t appear to be the same product I thought I was buying. I opened it up to try a very small amount and instantly, my face felt very gritty. You  would think this is an exfoliator rather than a primer. This product is very strange and will be going back. Also, I&#x27;d appreciate receiving what the picture is showing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It packs a punch - immediately and longterm. I have been able to get rid of those squinch marks between my eyebrows with this. And it softens the lines on your face immediately without any strange feeling or residue. It&#x27;s great under makeup and alone and the texture is really nice. I&#x27;ve turned a friend and my husband on to this as well. And, my skin is acne prone but I have no problems with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and much cheaper than I can get it at Wal-Mart. Yay!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice face cream for the price.  I have tried MANY moisturizers over the years and a few stand out. Paying a lot of money for one does not mean it is any better than a less expensive brand.  Being of a certain age, the only way I am going to rid my face of lines is to &amp;#34;go under the knife&amp;#34; which is definitely not an option for me.  This cream goes on smoothly, has no annoying fragrance, and makes my skin feel very soft.  It does not diminish my lines, but it might work on very fine lines. I apply it to my face in the morning and then mix a little of it with an expensive tinted moisturizer and smooth that on. I think it looks very nice (almost totally &#x27;natural&#x27;). There were some complaints about the &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; mechanism on the container in some reviews I read, but mine works perfectly. Definitely recommend this product...just don&#x27;t expect too much from it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so good. wonderful product</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Goes on like silk, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works.  Makes your skin feel amazing and look great even without makeup!</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and going thru a funk where I feel like I look old and haggered. No one else thinks this except for me but the small lines on the sides of my mouth (smile lines?) and the small wrinkiles under my eyes are driving me crazy. I have become obsessed with caring for my skin now which I had never cared about before. I have been searching the internet for the best OTC wrinkle creams and OLAY has been at the top. After reading reviews I decided to try this one and was very excited to see results. I have to say that I was/am very disappointed in this product and am returning it. It felt horrible on my skin. It made it feel very dry where as I was expecting it to add moisture to my face. It actually seemed to make my wrinkles look worse which was really driving me crazy. I tried this product 3 times and the third time I had to wash it off my face and use a different moisturizer on it. Guess I will be doing some more research on another anti-wrinkle fighter.</li>
            <li> This product is awful in its current packaging. DO NOT BUY. Olay claimed to have fixed the product, which I purchased after reading other buyer beware claims. Lesson learned. The bottle is still faulty.&lt;br /&gt;I had to turn the bottle upside down to get the pump to work and when I thought it officially \\&quot;broke\\&quot; i realized there was no lotion left. There&#x27;s barely anything in the bottle, which basically falsely packaged to look larger than it is. I&#x27;ve used Kiehl&#x27;s products that might be more expensive, but they lasted longer and were in packaging that worked. I normally love Olay, but this one is a misfire. I love my other Olay products, but will pass on this one in the future.</li>
            <li> It felt a bit thicker and smelt different than the original one I purchased at the chemist!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year or two now, and really see a difference in the lines I have on my forehead. I haven&#x27;t found any other product that makes this type of difference, while leaving my skin soft without a greasy or oily effect.</li>
            <li> Actually I don&#x27;t know if I do or I don&#x27;t because the pump doesn&#x27;t work so it doesn&#x27;t come out.  Under comments someone said just take the plunger top off the can and use straight from can.  Well that might work for some but I have arthritis in my hands and even trying vice grips find that impossible to do.  Hope you get one with a working pump.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it. She loves it and uses it nightly like clockwork. Tries to get me to use it too.</li>
            <li> The lotion is great, goes on smoothly, and really works on my dry skin. I doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I haven&#x27;t use this regularly so I can&#x27;t really rate it.  I do love the way it feels on my skin, but don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> Not too sure yet.  So far no change.</li>
            <li> Have been using this recently and now not able to find it in stores locally . It goes on smooth and is great under make-up.</li>
            <li> This oil of Olay product not one of my favorites, very little product in container for the price you pay . would not use this one again.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this product but - as many other reviews will tell you - the packaging is terrible. I have bought 5 bottles of it now and only one of them worked until the lotion was gone. I returned three and just gave upon the last one. What is the point of protecting anti-oxident ingredients if you have to pry off the pump to get to the product? Exposure to air destabilizes the active ingredients I just paid for! I don&#x27;t understand Olay&#x27;s self-sabotage in frustrating consumers this way when they clearly are aware of the problem.</li>
            <li> Having used Olay products for several years, and generally being very happy with them, I decided to try their Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex. I knew there had been issues with faulty pumps in the past, but noted that the Olay rep had stated on more than one occasion, that the pump had been updated. So how is it that both of my bottles came with pumps that don&#x27;t work? So in order to use them, I&#x27;ll have to cut the containers open.  Perhaps Olay should send a mini drill with each purchase of this product, so customers can perform the necessary surgery to actually use it.</li>
            <li> Like many, I picked this up for my wife as she has become worried about small wrinkles that form on everyone past the age of 17 (You are as beautiful as the day we met honey!). My wife likes the product, I can&#x27;t say I notice much of a difference. With use her skin is certainly shinier, but in all honesty, that is about it. Deeper frown lines are not affected much. That all being said, she is happy with the product and she notices a difference. Placebo effect or is it just something men don&#x27;t notice like women do? I don&#x27;t know, but for my money, it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a year and it has really helped my skin. When you&#x27;re over 65 and people still compliment your skin, you know this product is for real!  Several of my family now use a variety of Olay products based on their age because they work....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchased this product from Target and l o v e d it. Based on three or so bottles, this was a go to product that truly improved the appearance of my complexion. Trying to save money, I purchased this through Amazon and was seriously disappointed. Instead of smoothing my complexion, it caused my foundation to clump and refused to blend. Instead of acting as a base to my foundation, it produced a horrible interaction, that left me feeling I like I should wash my face and start from the beginning. I put a call in to Olay who refused to support a refund or exchange telling me I should contact Amazon.  Olay thought it was likely the product had been poorly stored and this was what was caused it to behave badly. This seller made it impossible to get a refund. Never again!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work any better than regular moisturizer</li>
            <li> Nice thin, silky night moisturizer.  I buy every 2 months.</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream I have ever used. It starts working the first day you use it. It makes my skin look smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using for several weeks and see no difference.  Perhaps It is my advanced age when first starting to use.  Personally I like the Regenerist product I was using that comes in the glass bottle because it seems my foundation goes on smoother.  This product feels dry on my skin .  Not sure I like it being in a can and unable to see how much is left.  Right now I habe this product placed in the over promised  column.</li>
            <li> Would be nice but has silicone in it which can cause problems for your skin if your sensitive or acne prone like me</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old, past menopause, and my skin has lost its elasticity and is now easily wrinkling and lining.  I have to say that I have always had smooth skin and was not happy that my skin was now sagging and wrinkling due to age.  I haven&#x27;t ever been a sun bunny.  I bought this product based on the Amazon reviews.  First of all, Olay has fixed its problems with the packaging and the product dispenses without a hitch.  But how does it work on wrinkles?  Like a miracle.  By the time I finished using up the bottle of product, virtually all my eye wrinkles were gone.  The big crows feet--GONE.  The only thing left are some tiny wrinkles below my tear duck, and these are going away slowly.  I ran out of the product and didn&#x27;t bother to reorder any more for over a 1/2 year until I noticed that the wrinkles were starting to return.  I think that the amount of correction from this  product made speaks volumes about how potent this product is.  I have spent several thousand dollars over the years on botox injections for my eye and forehead areas for wrinkle correction.  This product won&#x27;t get rid of the deep furrow my forehead muscle creates; I&#x27;ll still use botox for that.  BUT the product does in fact get rid of my crows feet and the vertical winkles in my forehead, and that will save me thousands of dollars in the future.  I am reordering two packages of the product so that I don&#x27;t run out and forget to reorder.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the reviews,that this wasnt rated a bit higher,I love this stuff,I use it daily as my primer,I actually rotate it with the regenerist serum,that one I use in the summer as my primer,it makes total sense to use these products as primers,it saves me a ton of money also,I used to use smashbox photo finish primer and all of these products have silicone in them,so I figured I might as well use the olay,it makes so much more sense,with the olay regenerist products as my primers Im getting great ingredients that actually help my skin,like peptides,and vitamin b3 with my 42$primer Im pretty much getting dimethicones,silicones,nothing very benefical for my aging skin,I really love the olay regenerist line and highly recommend them to people to atleast give them a try,you really dont have to much to lose,and atleast their a great affordable price.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and doesn&#x27;t work at all! Do not waste your money! I would never recommended it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  When I got the package I was a bit leery that there was no seal on the lotion bottle.</li>
            <li> At 90 years I can&#x27;t expect too much, but since I&#x27;m fortunate not to have hardly ane deep wrinkles, I thought I would try this  to minimize the fine lines, and I may be seeing a bit of a result. The jury is still out.</li>
            <li> Love , love ,love and very good price</li>
            <li> The time it was delivered was way before schedule. I bought it this as a gift. It looks awesome but, sadly it doesn&#x27;t have the expiration date? It&#x27;s strange.</li>
            <li> I have no idea whether or not it does what it says, but she likes the way it makes her skin feel.</li>
            <li> The shipment on this product was fast!&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser is difficult to get going, but now it seems to be coming out fine. I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to give an assessment.  I will adjust review after two weeks.</li>
            <li> I like this product, except it seems to apply a  bit thick &amp; later wants to rub off? I do like tho, that it is a wrinkle treatment in addition to instantly smoothing the skin ;-)</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it morning and night. The difference I noticed after the first 2 weeks of use was remarkable. I&#x27;m 65 and do not look it!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product... but only if they get the packaging fixed! I keep buying it because I love the product... but I am done until this pump that never works, gets fixed!!!</li>
            <li> It is a great product.  Reduces appearance of wrinkles and takes care of that winter dryness - just leaves your face feeling soft and plump.</li>
            <li> I like this product but have just started using it so can&#x27;t give anymore feedback.</li>
            <li> i find the olay regenerist cream very pleasant and smooth to apply. sometimes its all i use on my face.  i purchased the product on amazon.</li>
            <li> The product is very nice.  This is my second purchase of this Olay.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I purchased a second time was Olay&#x27;s comments that the problem with the pump would be fixed, this statement was made over a year ago.  My second was just as bad as the first.  The product oozes out all around the base of the pump. I feel a very poor quality dispenser and don&#x27;t believe I will purchase again.  I notice the price has dropped considerably.</li>
            <li> I honestly Love This Stuff. I wish that I could bath in it. I love how it feels on my skin and I love how my skin looks. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is the packaging. After about 10 pumps it gave out, first I was thinking wow thats kind of expencive for so little but it is really good. ( I also read several other reviews that said the same thing) I decided to pop off the top and I had bearly used any. I can set the top back on and keep it fresh, if not I would have only given it 3 stars. If they change the packaging then I would give it 5 stars. I just ordered some more. If you get this and the pump stops just pop off the top, it will stay fresh if you put the top back on. I love how the Regenerist system works. Every once in a while I try some new fancy named product that is expencive and I always end up going back to Oil Of Olay. Their products are not only just as good as products at high end department stores a lot of times they are superior.</li>
            <li> This product caused my face to break out in a rash.  When I contacted Olay directly, I spoke to a representative who was rude, condescending and confusing.  I told her I had a partially used container and another one unopened.  All I asked for was a way to return the products.  When I called the number given, I was told to mail the product to a certain address.  I then went to their website to get better information, and upon checking return dates, the date for return was past for the new item.  Note to Amazon.com, Amazon.com and on your website, the date for return is past.  I have a partially used container, and a new one never opened................................and so it goes.  What do I do next?</li>
            <li> I have used olay products for years. They do what they say it does. I would recommend them to all ladies.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these on sale from my local supermarket and would have to say it&#x27;s one of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It has a horrible, thick synthetic texture and almost feels slightly scratchy when it goes on my skin. If I have exfoliated before applying the cream it also stings a bit. It does seem to absorb/dry quickly on the skin, and leaves it feeling quite smooth, but it also leaves my slightly oily/combination skin feeling and looking too dry. And every time I&#x27;ve used it my makeup has not looked as smooth and flawless as usual- it seems to make the makeup stand out in my pores and look obvious and ugly(no matter what type of foundation I have used).&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have just started to notice the tiniest lines under my eyes and over my eyebrows- this product did not make them disappear. And I was horrified to discover it contains aluminium!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay products for years.  The product is good but the top of the jar for squeezing it out did not work.  Luckily I&#x27;m able to just push down to get some of the lotion.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference using this product, but not a great difference. It moisturized well but at times left my skin feeling a little itchy, only mildly though it wasn&#x27;t something that would make me not use it.</li>
