    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>However, on \\&quot;C Wash\\&quot; days, where I skip the shampoos, this is EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>so it is the perfect choice for the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li>Maybe this will be the perfect conditioner for you.</li>
            <li>This hair conditioner is wonderful!</li>
            <li>That delicious tart smell that just makes your mouth water!</li>
            <li>Um, yeah, awesome stuff!</li>
            <li>And the price is excellent.</li>
            <li>However, I can overlook that issue, as this product also happens to be a great conditioner!  </li>
            <li>And the texture continued to be very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>this cherry/almond sent is very pleasant and not over powering.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good!</li>
            <li>Another great hair care product from Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li>When she uses it along with the matching shampoo her hair looks great.</li>
            <li>stuff is great.</li>
            <li>and they both are great.</li>
            <li>and it looks shiny and great.  </li>
            <li>She seems genuinely happy about this which is not something I have every seen out of her in regards to a shampoo or conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so incredibly drying, I think I&#x27;d actually be better off using nothing!  </li>
            <li>And they are very good products and safe for colored hair.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good conditioner at a good price.</li>
            <li>And the cherry almond scent smells really good.</li>
            <li>Good for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Good times.</li>
            <li>This smells just as good as the shampoo</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>And your hair will shine so lovely!</li>
            <li>It is an attractive candy like scent that is not overly strong.  </li>
            <li>It stayed smooth and looked great all</li>
            <li>I really liked this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the almond-cherry scent.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;After use, it rinses out nicely and there&#x27;s not hint of residue or filminess.</li>
            <li>The color treated is nice for chlorine damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something similar, this smells great and works great on my hair!</li>
            <li>Every time she showers, she comments on how nice her hair feels and looks.  </li>
            <li>The Vidal Sassoon Cherry Almond Classic shampoo and conditioner has to be one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Vidal Sassoon classic products are STILL the best!</li>
            <li>The scent is nice but very light, so no issues.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember the original scent, but I love scented hair products and was happy to give this one a go.  </li>
            <li>Being able to relive the 80s from the comforts of my own shower is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives me a smile every time I take a shower and makes this product a joy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine waist-length hair and most conditioners don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, light conditioner that does not leave a lot of residue.  </li>
            <li>I like mostly that it doesn&#x27;t appear to leave residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do more for me than detangle my hair.</li>
            <li>do more for me than detangle my hair.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, I get by on 2 shampoos per week.</li>
            <li>I love the cherry almond scent - it smells like shampoos I remember as a child.</li>
            <li>With so many choices out there, I hadn&#x27;t thought about Vidal Sassoon products in years.</li>
            <li>the scent could be a bit better</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d just like the smell, which I love, but it makes my hair so smooth too!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li>the conditioning part was okay.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a push-down button that opens up the top</li>
            <li>love the scent - it is like being a teenager again.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the conditioner and recommend it to anyone - the scent is gender neutral</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used this conditioner before, so I decided to give it a go when I saw that it was safe to use on color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I prefer more moisturizing for my hair.</li>
            <li>But  in fact I like my hair even better with this product.  </li>
            <li>I just love the smell of this cherry almond conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>While the scent is initially very, very strong, most of it dispersed leaving my hair smelling clean.  </li>
            <li>She tells me that this is one of the best conditioners she has used in a long time and it reminds her of the stuff they use on her at the hairdresser.</li>
            <li>The company brought back the iconic cherry almond scent introduced in 1977 while maintaining the top-notch product that will give you clean hair without drying out your hair.</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel like straw, doesn&#x27;t really smell that good.</li>
            <li>The scent is soooo good, but really does not stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so so great that I&#x27;m going to go buy a bottle of the classic clean shampoo to go with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so so great that I&#x27;m going to go buy a bottle of the classic clean shampoo to go with it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with either the shampoo or the condition, the shampoo smells less strong and smells good</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that the scent had become mild and incredibly pleasant with none of the marzipan odor.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner smell was so strong is induced migraines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the shampoo, to me, but it&#x27;s a decent product, nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Also, the scent is strong.</li>
            <li>I didnâ€™t notice an extraordinary shine or notable manageability.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s accurate.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light and leaves the scent in your hair for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>it was after it dried that the best surprises came.  </li>
            <li>The second day it was just as great</li>
            <li>It is so light weight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>I like how smooth my hair feels after using this product.  </li>
            <li>As a conditioner, it&#x27;s fairly light.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I experienced fewer frizzes after using this Vidal Sassoon conditioner but still enough for me to need leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t care for the scent all that much.  </li>
            <li>I KNOW there&#x27;s something still there since I can smell the almondy-ness, but my hair feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>In addition to be beautifully scented, this conditioner is nice and thick, yet rinses well, leaving my hair manageable without being over-conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>the shampoo is good stuff, but combine it with the conditioner, it made the wife&#x27;s hair very silky feeling and very shiny.  </li>
            <li>A bit like pastry or candy but very nice to smell on your dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I used the shampoo at the time more than the conditioner but really like this</li>
            <li>heck, the cherry/almond sent would be good enough for a perfume.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a good product</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad conditioner, by any means--</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t all that excited about the scent since I&#x27;m not crazy about the marzipan-type fragrance almonds give off</li>
            <li>And when I brushed it out, it felt lighter, looked more full of body and as bright as if I&#x27;d just given it a new dose of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the classic scent of cherry almond.</li>
            <li>and my wife thinks it is extraordinary.</li>
            <li>(I turn shampoo and conditioner bottles upside-down in the shower when they start running low to get the most out of the product; I can&#x27;t stand when manufacturers make the top rounded so that the bottles won&#x27;t balance upside-down!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>normally I can&#x27;t - and it still didn&#x27;t look or feel like it needed washing, but hey, three days.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li>normally I can&#x27;t - and it still didn&#x27;t look or feel like it needed washing, but hey, three days.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li>We normally use Herbal Essence shampoo and cream rinse because of the lovely smell.  </li>
            <li>I used the original scent for many years and opening the bottle was like greeting an old friend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely a new favorite, and I would not hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth a star, though, since the conditioner is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really more a kind of heavy, musky perfume.</li>
            <li>And then I was even more pleasantly surprised: the conditioner worked.  </li>
            <li>Has a fresh clean cherry almond smell and is a nice light conditioner for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I have just the right amount of moisture in my hair to allow the curl to have its way but my frizzy hairs are still under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just glided right through my brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>Smooths without weighing hair down and feeling grimy, a nice clean feeling instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh too heavy on my hair, and it has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t nearly as pleasant as the shampoo, but I did find that after my hair dried, some of that chemical smell had thankfully disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love cherry almond fragrance, and there isn&#x27;t enough of it in this to matter.</li>
            <li>It rinses away with the first wash, you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time trying to get it off.  </li>
            <li>I even use it on my beard and it works well on my facial hair which is generally more rigid than the hair on my head.  </li>
            <li>, first off, the scent of this conditioner fully lived up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Whereas the shampoo made my hair feel moisturized, but still allowed it to retain a good amount of volume and movement, I felt like the conditioner really weighed down my curly/wurly hair.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Cherry Almond Classic Clean Conditioner.</li>
            <li>let it stay loose, which I rarely do, and when I rebraided at bedtime, I was pleased to find out</li>
            <li>When I looked on the Amazon page to see how much I&#x27;d have to pay to continue using this product, I was overjoyed to see the very reasonable price.compliments, from the fragrance to a &amp;</li>
            <li>When I looked on the Amazon page to see how much I&#x27;d have to pay to continue using this product, I was overjoyed to see the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>high days...when fresh hair smell was what you lived for, indeed,&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Vidal Sassoon put some fun back into washing my hair with the return of the original scent.</li>
            <li>Vidal Sassoon Cherry Almond Classic Clean Conditioner leaves my hair soft and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only takes a little bit and works great.</li>
            <li>If you have very damaged hair you&#x27;ll want something stronger for repair and deep conditioning, but this conditioner works as a light detangler and smoother for all hair types.</li>
            <li>I must condition, and with a product that really takes out the tangles, otherwise I have a mat on my head.  </li>
            <li>My hair brushed out as smoothly as if I&#x27;d used the VO5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was the scent: it was relatively similar to what can be found with the shampoo, yet that cherry almond goodness took something of a backseat to a strange, chemically kind of odor.  </li>
            <li>Really like the smell and smoothness of my hair.</li>
            <li>so very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She really loves the fragrance, while I can take it or leave it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use conditioner, this is surplus to my needs--purely a test for scent.</li>
            <li>that cherry/almond smell to me is a real plus.  </li>
            <li>and I can now buy it at any grocery/discount store as opposed to when it used to only be available at a salon.</li>
            <li>At 4 dollars a pop, it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>a tiny bit does the job for silky smooth hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember ever really seeing VS around our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EITHER</li>
            <li>(I know you&#x27;re not SUPPOSE to, but I&#x27;ve been doing it my whole life and my hair</li>
            <li>I found that the scent is indeed, VERY retro.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t need much of this product to get good results and it&#x27;s fairly thick</li>
            <li>I did not think this conditioner, or any bottled conditioner, would be as good as the thick stuff.</li>
            <li>For those who are new to the scent, don&#x27;t expect it to smell exactly like cherries and almonds, because it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>This is a trip down memory lane, the scent really did take me back about thirty years and the conditioner itself is just as good today as it was then.</li>
            <li>Vidal Sassoon has brought back the original condtioner with the classic cherry almond scent I remember from years ago.</li>
            <li>I think it would probably work better for me on days when I dry and straighten my hair, but for the times when I want to embrace my natural curls, I don&#x27;t feel like this helps me in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a really good conditioner because I live in a dry climate and use a wood stove so my hair can get dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>It has what is apparently the old cherry-almond scent from the original Vidal Sassoon products.  </li>
            <li>What I DO like about the fragrance is that it is not overwhelming and is nice and faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the product is even better than it was back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to all of the above, the price on this product is extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li>The texture of it is different, a bit thick and when you put it on your hair, it stays there, doesn&#x27;t drip off the ends, which I love because the ends is where I need the most conditioning.  </li>
            <li>It is not a bad smell, just different.  </li>
            <li>The scent is lovely and the conditioner works as well as or maybe a little better than the other named brand conditioner Iâ€™ve been using.</li>
            <li>the wife&#x27;s hair after usage also seemed a little more active( the more bounce thing and looked fluffier/lighter)</li>
            <li>I used a healthy amount - like big dollop, about the same as I do with VO5 or anything else.</li>
            <li>This conditioner did a decent job of conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>The bottle says it&#x27;s for normal hair-</li>
            <li>I noticed that this conditioner was different from others I have used right away.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be over powering or not a good product but both the shampoo  and conditioner were lightly scented and just left a fresh but the same cherry-almond scent.</li>
            <li>So I have no strong memories of this scent that many others do.  </li>
            <li>I do wish that the scent lingered, however; I would live to pick up on the scent throughout the day, but I&#x27;ve found that it isn&#x27;t at all noticeable post-shower.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair easy to manage and with less flyaways.</li>
            <li>This is a nice thick conditioner that leaves my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>two big differences today over when it first came out:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too thick to easily get out of the squeeze top.  </li>
            <li>and he has always done such a fantastic job cutting my hair and somehow think that translates into him knowing more than me in this area!  </li>
            <li>I have been using very thick conditioners, the kind that comes in a tube rather than a bottle.</li>
            <li>This product does the job - it&#x27;s not heavy, doesn&#x27;t give me unmanageable hair, and it smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have a lot of natural curl.</li>
            <li>But this works if you have to wash often (daily) and don&#x27;t want to dampen your hair with too much oils.</li>
            <li>The scent is so soft and feminine.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m too young to remember what the VS Cherry Almond was like.</li>
            <li>I smoothed it on, rinsed it off, and my hair feels soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>well priced for a daily conditioner and will work well for people who donâ€™t need special conditioner (dry or oily hair.)  </li>
            <li>and I wish it wouldn&#x27;t weigh my hair down as much as it does, but it leaves my hair soft and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>It is very, very thick and if you have extremely dry hair and leave it on for about 4 minutes, most of the conditioner will get absorbed.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate not having to purchase two bottles - shampoo and rinse - while also maintaining a high standard in how my hair turns out.</li>
            <li>Some shampoo and conditioners dry my hair so much that it gets frizzy and flyaway while others over moisture and knock out all of my curl while making my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li>And it does NOT make your hair greasy, only very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate, so I prefer to use an intensive conditioner on a daily basis, but I did use this and had success as long as I did a &amp;#34;massage in, rinse, repeat, massage in, rinse&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so I will most likely go back to my heavy moisturizing conditioners, but wouldnâ€™t think twice about using this if my hair decided that it didnâ€™t need the more expensive conditioner.</li>
            <li>It also made it much easier to brush my hair when it was wet</li>
            <li>It feels thick, but is a lightweight conditioner that feels clean rinsing.  </li>
            <li>Cherry Almond is a nice nostalgic scent that takes you back to the days of aerobics and thong leotards.</li>
            <li>When I use this conditioner, my hair is not dry, there is no frizz</li>
            <li>It costs half as much as it used to</li>
            <li>My hair is short, thick, fine, graying, and dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of expensive conditioners with rather poor results; if I&#x27;m lucky, they work as well as the inexpensive VO5 cream rinse I normally use, but most often, I have to use the VO5 after the expensive product to be able to brush my hair.</li>

            <li> And the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> However, I can overlook that issue, as this product also happens to be a great conditioner!  </li>
            <li> And the texture continued to be very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> this cherry/almond sent is very pleasant and not over powering.  </li>
            <li> Smells so good!</li>
            <li> Another great hair care product from Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li> When she uses it along with the matching shampoo her hair looks great.</li>
            <li> stuff is great.</li>
            <li> and they both are great.</li>
            <li> and it looks shiny and great.  </li>
            <li> She seems genuinely happy about this which is not something I have every seen out of her in regards to a shampoo or conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so incredibly drying, I think I&#x27;d actually be better off using nothing!  </li>
            <li> And they are very good products and safe for colored hair.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good conditioner at a good price.</li>
            <li> And the cherry almond scent smells really good.</li>
            <li> Good for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Good times.</li>
            <li> This smells just as good as the shampoo</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> And your hair will shine so lovely!</li>
            <li> It is an attractive candy like scent that is not overly strong.  </li>
            <li> It stayed smooth and looked great all</li>
            <li> I really liked this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the almond-cherry scent.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;After use, it rinses out nicely and there&#x27;s not hint of residue or filminess.</li>
            <li> The color treated is nice for chlorine damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something similar, this smells great and works great on my hair!</li>
            <li> Every time she showers, she comments on how nice her hair feels and looks.  </li>
            <li> The Vidal Sassoon Cherry Almond Classic shampoo and conditioner has to be one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon classic products are STILL the best!</li>
            <li> The scent is nice but very light, so no issues.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember the original scent, but I love scented hair products and was happy to give this one a go.  </li>
            <li> Being able to relive the 80s from the comforts of my own shower is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives me a smile every time I take a shower and makes this product a joy to use.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine waist-length hair and most conditioners don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light conditioner that does not leave a lot of residue.  </li>
            <li> I like mostly that it doesn&#x27;t appear to leave residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do more for me than detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> do more for me than detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, I get by on 2 shampoos per week.</li>
            <li> I love the cherry almond scent - it smells like shampoos I remember as a child.</li>
            <li> With so many choices out there, I hadn&#x27;t thought about Vidal Sassoon products in years.</li>
            <li> the scent could be a bit better</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d just like the smell, which I love, but it makes my hair so smooth too!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> the conditioning part was okay.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a push-down button that opens up the top</li>
            <li> love the scent - it is like being a teenager again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the conditioner and recommend it to anyone - the scent is gender neutral</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this conditioner before, so I decided to give it a go when I saw that it was safe to use on color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer more moisturizing for my hair.</li>
            <li> But  in fact I like my hair even better with this product.  </li>
            <li> I just love the smell of this cherry almond conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I am in love.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> While the scent is initially very, very strong, most of it dispersed leaving my hair smelling clean.  </li>
            <li> She tells me that this is one of the best conditioners she has used in a long time and it reminds her of the stuff they use on her at the hairdresser.</li>
            <li> The company brought back the iconic cherry almond scent introduced in 1977 while maintaining the top-notch product that will give you clean hair without drying out your hair.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel like straw, doesn&#x27;t really smell that good.</li>
            <li> The scent is soooo good, but really does not stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so so great that I&#x27;m going to go buy a bottle of the classic clean shampoo to go with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so so great that I&#x27;m going to go buy a bottle of the classic clean shampoo to go with it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with either the shampoo or the condition, the shampoo smells less strong and smells good</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that the scent had become mild and incredibly pleasant with none of the marzipan odor.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner smell was so strong is induced migraines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the shampoo, to me, but it&#x27;s a decent product, nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Also, the scent is strong.</li>
            <li> I didnâ€™t notice an extraordinary shine or notable manageability.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s accurate.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s light and leaves the scent in your hair for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> it was after it dried that the best surprises came.  </li>
            <li> The second day it was just as great</li>
            <li> It is so light weight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I like how smooth my hair feels after using this product.  </li>
            <li> As a conditioner, it&#x27;s fairly light.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> I experienced fewer frizzes after using this Vidal Sassoon conditioner but still enough for me to need leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t care for the scent all that much.  </li>
            <li> I KNOW there&#x27;s something still there since I can smell the almondy-ness, but my hair feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> In addition to be beautifully scented, this conditioner is nice and thick, yet rinses well, leaving my hair manageable without being over-conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> the shampoo is good stuff, but combine it with the conditioner, it made the wife&#x27;s hair very silky feeling and very shiny.  </li>
            <li> A bit like pastry or candy but very nice to smell on your dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I used the shampoo at the time more than the conditioner but really like this</li>
            <li> heck, the cherry/almond sent would be good enough for a perfume.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a good product</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad conditioner, by any means--</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t all that excited about the scent since I&#x27;m not crazy about the marzipan-type fragrance almonds give off</li>
            <li> And when I brushed it out, it felt lighter, looked more full of body and as bright as if I&#x27;d just given it a new dose of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the classic scent of cherry almond.</li>
            <li> and my wife thinks it is extraordinary.</li>
            <li> (I turn shampoo and conditioner bottles upside-down in the shower when they start running low to get the most out of the product; I can&#x27;t stand when manufacturers make the top rounded so that the bottles won&#x27;t balance upside-down!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> normally I can&#x27;t - and it still didn&#x27;t look or feel like it needed washing, but hey, three days.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li> normally I can&#x27;t - and it still didn&#x27;t look or feel like it needed washing, but hey, three days.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li> We normally use Herbal Essence shampoo and cream rinse because of the lovely smell.  </li>
            <li> I used the original scent for many years and opening the bottle was like greeting an old friend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely a new favorite, and I would not hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth a star, though, since the conditioner is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really more a kind of heavy, musky perfume.</li>
            <li> And then I was even more pleasantly surprised: the conditioner worked.  </li>
            <li> Has a fresh clean cherry almond smell and is a nice light conditioner for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I have just the right amount of moisture in my hair to allow the curl to have its way but my frizzy hairs are still under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just glided right through my brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> Smooths without weighing hair down and feeling grimy, a nice clean feeling instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh too heavy on my hair, and it has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t nearly as pleasant as the shampoo, but I did find that after my hair dried, some of that chemical smell had thankfully disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love cherry almond fragrance, and there isn&#x27;t enough of it in this to matter.</li>
            <li> It rinses away with the first wash, you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time trying to get it off.  </li>
            <li> I even use it on my beard and it works well on my facial hair which is generally more rigid than the hair on my head.  </li>
            <li> , first off, the scent of this conditioner fully lived up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Whereas the shampoo made my hair feel moisturized, but still allowed it to retain a good amount of volume and movement, I felt like the conditioner really weighed down my curly/wurly hair.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Cherry Almond Classic Clean Conditioner.</li>
            <li> let it stay loose, which I rarely do, and when I rebraided at bedtime, I was pleased to find out</li>
            <li> When I looked on the Amazon page to see how much I&#x27;d have to pay to continue using this product, I was overjoyed to see the very reasonable price.compliments, from the fragrance to a &amp;</li>
            <li> When I looked on the Amazon page to see how much I&#x27;d have to pay to continue using this product, I was overjoyed to see the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> high days...when fresh hair smell was what you lived for, indeed,&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon put some fun back into washing my hair with the return of the original scent.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon Cherry Almond Classic Clean Conditioner leaves my hair soft and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only takes a little bit and works great.</li>
            <li> If you have very damaged hair you&#x27;ll want something stronger for repair and deep conditioning, but this conditioner works as a light detangler and smoother for all hair types.</li>
            <li> I must condition, and with a product that really takes out the tangles, otherwise I have a mat on my head.  </li>
            <li> My hair brushed out as smoothly as if I&#x27;d used the VO5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was the scent: it was relatively similar to what can be found with the shampoo, yet that cherry almond goodness took something of a backseat to a strange, chemically kind of odor.  </li>
            <li> Really like the smell and smoothness of my hair.</li>
            <li> so very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She really loves the fragrance, while I can take it or leave it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use conditioner, this is surplus to my needs--purely a test for scent.</li>
            <li> that cherry/almond smell to me is a real plus.  </li>
            <li> and I can now buy it at any grocery/discount store as opposed to when it used to only be available at a salon.</li>
            <li> At 4 dollars a pop, it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> a tiny bit does the job for silky smooth hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember ever really seeing VS around our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EITHER</li>
            <li> (I know you&#x27;re not SUPPOSE to, but I&#x27;ve been doing it my whole life and my hair</li>
            <li> I found that the scent is indeed, VERY retro.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t need much of this product to get good results and it&#x27;s fairly thick</li>
            <li> I did not think this conditioner, or any bottled conditioner, would be as good as the thick stuff.</li>
            <li> For those who are new to the scent, don&#x27;t expect it to smell exactly like cherries and almonds, because it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> This is a trip down memory lane, the scent really did take me back about thirty years and the conditioner itself is just as good today as it was then.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon has brought back the original condtioner with the classic cherry almond scent I remember from years ago.</li>
            <li> I think it would probably work better for me on days when I dry and straighten my hair, but for the times when I want to embrace my natural curls, I don&#x27;t feel like this helps me in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a really good conditioner because I live in a dry climate and use a wood stove so my hair can get dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It has what is apparently the old cherry-almond scent from the original Vidal Sassoon products.  </li>
            <li> What I DO like about the fragrance is that it is not overwhelming and is nice and faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the product is even better than it was back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to all of the above, the price on this product is extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li> The texture of it is different, a bit thick and when you put it on your hair, it stays there, doesn&#x27;t drip off the ends, which I love because the ends is where I need the most conditioning.  </li>
            <li> It is not a bad smell, just different.  </li>
            <li> The scent is lovely and the conditioner works as well as or maybe a little better than the other named brand conditioner Iâ€™ve been using.</li>
            <li> the wife&#x27;s hair after usage also seemed a little more active( the more bounce thing and looked fluffier/lighter)</li>
            <li> I used a healthy amount - like big dollop, about the same as I do with VO5 or anything else.</li>
            <li> This conditioner did a decent job of conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> The bottle says it&#x27;s for normal hair-</li>
            <li> I noticed that this conditioner was different from others I have used right away.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be over powering or not a good product but both the shampoo  and conditioner were lightly scented and just left a fresh but the same cherry-almond scent.</li>
            <li> So I have no strong memories of this scent that many others do.  </li>
            <li> I do wish that the scent lingered, however; I would live to pick up on the scent throughout the day, but I&#x27;ve found that it isn&#x27;t at all noticeable post-shower.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair easy to manage and with less flyaways.</li>
            <li> This is a nice thick conditioner that leaves my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> two big differences today over when it first came out:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too thick to easily get out of the squeeze top.  </li>
            <li> and he has always done such a fantastic job cutting my hair and somehow think that translates into him knowing more than me in this area!  </li>
            <li> I have been using very thick conditioners, the kind that comes in a tube rather than a bottle.</li>
            <li> This product does the job - it&#x27;s not heavy, doesn&#x27;t give me unmanageable hair, and it smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have a lot of natural curl.</li>
            <li> But this works if you have to wash often (daily) and don&#x27;t want to dampen your hair with too much oils.</li>
            <li> The scent is so soft and feminine.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m too young to remember what the VS Cherry Almond was like.</li>
            <li> I smoothed it on, rinsed it off, and my hair feels soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> well priced for a daily conditioner and will work well for people who donâ€™t need special conditioner (dry or oily hair.)  </li>
            <li> and I wish it wouldn&#x27;t weigh my hair down as much as it does, but it leaves my hair soft and very manageable.  </li>
            <li> It is very, very thick and if you have extremely dry hair and leave it on for about 4 minutes, most of the conditioner will get absorbed.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate not having to purchase two bottles - shampoo and rinse - while also maintaining a high standard in how my hair turns out.</li>
            <li> Some shampoo and conditioners dry my hair so much that it gets frizzy and flyaway while others over moisture and knock out all of my curl while making my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> And it does NOT make your hair greasy, only very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate, so I prefer to use an intensive conditioner on a daily basis, but I did use this and had success as long as I did a &amp;#34;massage in, rinse, repeat, massage in, rinse&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so I will most likely go back to my heavy moisturizing conditioners, but wouldnâ€™t think twice about using this if my hair decided that it didnâ€™t need the more expensive conditioner.</li>
            <li> It also made it much easier to brush my hair when it was wet</li>
            <li> It feels thick, but is a lightweight conditioner that feels clean rinsing.  </li>
            <li> Cherry Almond is a nice nostalgic scent that takes you back to the days of aerobics and thong leotards.</li>
            <li> When I use this conditioner, my hair is not dry, there is no frizz</li>
            <li> It costs half as much as it used to</li>
            <li> My hair is short, thick, fine, graying, and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of expensive conditioners with rather poor results; if I&#x27;m lucky, they work as well as the inexpensive VO5 cream rinse I normally use, but most often, I have to use the VO5 after the expensive product to be able to brush my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair can be very difficult to condition--it&#x27;s fine and thin and also tends towards oily, so it can be easily weighted down, but it also needs a powerful enough conditioner to avoid getting tangles and fly-aways.  </li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon Cherry Almond Classic Clean Conditioner was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m spoiled - my hair is much nicer than usual.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m spoiled - my hair is much nicer than usual.</li>
            <li> so the bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but lest it soft and smelling like the 80s.  </li>
            <li> I personally have dry hair</li>
            <li> In my experience, price has little to do with how much untangling a product can provide -- and I never thought  beyond the tangles to other things like body or shine.</li>
            <li> This seems to be focused on just your regular daily wash and condition; if you have needs beyond that you may want to look into their other products.  </li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;princess waves&amp;#34; from the braiding make my long hair look terrific if I let it loose.  </li>
            <li> I expected the scent to take me back in time...</li>
            <li> My hair is quite long - almost waist length</li>
            <li> Yes, it is possible to have dry hair that will turns greasy if over-conditioned or not washed at the proper intervals - and it&#x27;s not fun.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Has a fresh clean cherry almond smell and is a nice light conditioner for everyday use. If you have very damaged hair you&#x27;ll want something stronger for repair and deep conditioning, but this conditioner works as a light detangler and smoother for all hair types. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel like straw, doesn&#x27;t really smell that good. I love cherry almond fragrance, and there isn&#x27;t enough of it in this to matter. Too bad, I was so looking forward to it. Fortunately, it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smell was so strong is induced migraines. I wasn&#x27;t happy with either the shampoo or the condition, the shampoo smells less strong and smells good but it didn&#x27;t work for my hair it was thin and flat and pin straight and took all my waves out.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light conditioner that does not leave a lot of residue.  I remember the brown bottles from the 70&#x27;s with the almond-cherry smell.  I used the shampoo at the time more than the conditioner but really like this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light and leaves the scent in your hair for quite a while.  I like mostly that it doesn&#x27;t appear to leave residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up for a throwback conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really liked this conditioner.  It is very, very thick and if you have extremely dry hair and leave it on for about 4 minutes, most of the conditioner will get absorbed.  It rinses away with the first wash, you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time trying to get it off.  And it does NOT make your hair greasy, only very soft and manageable.  I really liked the almond-cherry scent.  A bit like pastry or candy but very nice to smell on your dry hair.  This is a great conditioner for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine waist-length hair and most conditioners don&#x27;t work for me. I must condition, and with a product that really takes out the tangles, otherwise I have a mat on my head.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of expensive conditioners with rather poor results; if I&#x27;m lucky, they work as well as the inexpensive VO5 cream rinse I normally use, but most often, I have to use the VO5 after the expensive product to be able to brush my hair. (I do this under running water in the shower - that&#x27;s the only way my hair cooperates.)  In my experience, price has little to do with how much untangling a product can provide -- and I never thought  beyond the tangles to other things like body or shine. Nothing ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Cherry Almond Classic Clean Conditioner. I used a healthy amount - like big dollop, about the same as I do with VO5 or anything else. I wasn&#x27;t all that excited about the scent since I&#x27;m not crazy about the marzipan-type fragrance almonds give off but I was pleasantly surprised by this: the fragrance was not overwhelming.  And then I was even more pleasantly surprised: the conditioner worked.  My hair brushed out as smoothly as if I&#x27;d used the VO5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was after it dried that the best surprises came.  I work at home so I braid my wet hair and let it dry slowly; the &amp;#34;princess waves&amp;#34; from the braiding make my long hair look terrific if I let it loose.  The first thing I noticed was that the scent had become mild and incredibly pleasant with none of the marzipan odor.  And when I brushed it out, it felt lighter, looked more full of body and as bright as if I&#x27;d just given it a new dose of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let it stay loose, which I rarely do, and when I rebraided at bedtime, I was pleased to find out it hadn&#x27;t snarled like it usually does after an hour or two of freedom. And the texture continued to be very pleasant.  The second day it was just as great and I went out and ended up with several compliments, from the fragrance to a &amp;#34;you finally colored your hair again!&amp;#34; remark. (It&#x27;s been three months. I&#x27;m lazy.) And I let it go a third day - normally I can&#x27;t - and it still didn&#x27;t look or feel like it needed washing, but hey, three days.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely in love with this product. I&#x27;ve never had a conditioner do more for me than detangle my hair. Now I&#x27;m spoiled - my hair is much nicer than usual. It&#x27;s so so great that I&#x27;m going to go buy a bottle of the classic clean shampoo to go with it. When I looked on the Amazon page to see how much I&#x27;d have to pay to continue using this product, I was overjoyed to see the very reasonable price.compliments, from the fragrance to a &amp;#34;you finally colored your hair again!&amp;#34; remark.

            <li> If you are nostalgic for that cherry almond scent, you will love this stuff.  It feels thick, but is a lightweight conditioner that feels clean rinsing.  I live in a very dry climate, so I prefer to use an intensive conditioner on a daily basis, but I did use this and had success as long as I did a &amp;#34;massage in, rinse, repeat, massage in, rinse&amp;#34; routine.  It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but lest it soft and smelling like the 80s.  The scent left on my hair isn&#x27;t overpowering, but it&#x27;s there.  I think this is a good conditioner at a good price.</li>
            <li> Another great hair care product from Vidal Sassoon. I picked this up for my girlfriend and she loves it. When she uses it along with the matching shampoo her hair looks great. And the cherry almond scent smells really good. And the scent lasts but it is not overpowering. She tells me that this is one of the best conditioners she has used in a long time and it reminds her of the stuff they use on her at the hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Good for my hair.  This conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh too heavy on my hair, and it has a pleasant scent.  I hope that other people will like it as uch as I did.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be very dry and frizzy. Most of the time, I get by on 2 shampoos per week. This conditioner is not moisturizing enough to use after a shampoo. However, on \\&quot;C Wash\\&quot; days, where I skip the shampoos, this is EXCELLENT! It is so light weight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. Yes, it is possible to have dry hair that will turns greasy if over-conditioned or not washed at the proper intervals - and it&#x27;s not fun. Vidal Sassoon Cherry Almond Classic Clean Conditioner leaves my hair soft and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great. It makes my hair feel nice and I can still smell it in my hair at the end of the day. I love the cherry almond scent - it smells like shampoos I remember as a child.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon put some fun back into washing my hair with the return of the original scent. I&#x27;d almost forgotten it.  While the scent is initially very, very strong, most of it dispersed leaving my hair smelling clean.  I have thick, slightly oily, color treated hair and I like how smooth my hair feels after using this product.  It stayed smooth and looked great all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t need much of this product to get good results and it&#x27;s fairly thick so the bottle should last a long time. With so many choices out there, I hadn&#x27;t thought about Vidal Sassoon products in years. Now, I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not too expensive, but has that &amp;#34;salon product&amp;#34; smell.  I have spent ridiculous amounts on shampoos and conditioners after having my haircut at high-end salons.  I seem to get sucked in because my hairdresser recommends it and he has always done such a fantastic job cutting my hair and somehow think that translates into him knowing more than me in this area!  Well, in retrospect, it&#x27;s just not necessary. This product does the job - it&#x27;s not heavy, doesn&#x27;t give me unmanageable hair, and it smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After two weeks of use I can no longer use.  It&#x27;s so incredibly drying, I think I&#x27;d actually be better off using nothing!  I tried multiple times in varying levels of application, nothing works.  It has stripped my hair down, I believe, and now I need to use another product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the shampoo that is this conditioner&#x27;s companion piece, so I felt compelled to pick this up and give it try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the scent: it was relatively similar to what can be found with the shampoo, yet that cherry almond goodness took something of a backseat to a strange, chemically kind of odor.  It wasn&#x27;t nearly as pleasant as the shampoo, but I did find that after my hair dried, some of that chemical smell had thankfully disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is a product whose claims include providing moisture that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  Well....that didn&#x27;t turn out to be the case for me.  Whereas the shampoo made my hair feel moisturized, but still allowed it to retain a good amount of volume and movement, I felt like the conditioner really weighed down my curly/wurly hair.  Now, for some people, that won&#x27;t necessarily be a bad thing (or even an issue, at all), especially because the conditioner is thick enough that it thoroughly coats the hair without having to use gobs and gobs of the stuff, and the moisture it provides does result in a lot of softness and a noticeable lack of tangles.  I think it would probably work better for me on days when I dry and straighten my hair, but for the times when I want to embrace my natural curls, I don&#x27;t feel like this helps me in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad conditioner, by any means-- the scent could be a bit better and I wish it wouldn&#x27;t weigh my hair down as much as it does, but it leaves my hair soft and very manageable.  It&#x27;s not as good as the shampoo, to me, but it&#x27;s a decent product, nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Really like the smell and smoothness of my hair. Only takes a little bit and works great. I ordered the cherry almond shampoo along with this and they both are great.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Just like I remembered it as a kid. That smell takes me back. We used to wash our hair in the backyard with a hose. Good times. Thought I&#x27;d just like the smell, which I love, but it makes my hair so smooth too! Don&#x27;t stop making this!!</li>
            <li> This smells just as good as the shampoo and I&#x27;m in love with it. My hair is shiny and manageable and smells so very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is with the thickness of the container. It&#x27;s sometimes difficult to squeeze out the product and I have to lean against the shower wall to force out the conditioner. If the container were made of thinner plastic, it would give a little easier. The product itself is thick, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to change that. I store it upside down in the shower and that makes it a little easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth a star, though, since the conditioner is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> The Vidal Sassoon Cherry Almond Classic shampoo and conditioner has to be one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used. The company brought back the iconic cherry almond scent introduced in 1977 while maintaining the top-notch product that will give you clean hair without drying out your hair. I appreciate not having to purchase two bottles - shampoo and rinse - while also maintaining a high standard in how my hair turns out. I cannot find anything negative to say about this product and will continue to use it from now on.</li>
            <li> Nothing not to like. My wife and I both use this, and we both have different hair. Mine is long and thin and hers is kinky/frizzy and long. She really loves the fragrance, while I can take it or leave it. What I DO like about the fragrance is that it is not overwhelming and is nice and faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use, it rinses out nicely and there&#x27;s not hint of residue or filminess. I KNOW there&#x27;s something still there since I can smell the almondy-ness, but my hair feels smooth and clean. Wife says same thing for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy 5 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon Cherry Almond Classic Clean Conditioner was a disappointment. I expected the scent to take me back in time...to my jr. high days...when fresh hair smell was what you lived for, indeed,&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t. It fell short of the (smell) I wanted...the conditioning part was okay. I don&#x27;t really use conditioner, this is surplus to my needs--purely a test for scent.</li>
            <li> I swim three times a week so I&#x27;m constantly fretting over the state of my luscious mane. Cherry Almond is a nice nostalgic scent that takes you back to the days of aerobics and thong leotards. Being able to relive the 80s from the comforts of my own shower is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a conditioner, this works quite well. The color treated is nice for chlorine damaged hair. This isn&#x27;t going to be a miracle worker for people who need deep conditioner, but it also isn&#x27;t advertised to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This a quality product at an affordable price. The scent is lovely. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We normally use Herbal Essence shampoo and cream rinse because of the lovely smell.  This one has a nice smell but the lid was horrible to open.  It&#x27;s a push-down button that opens up the top but I had to get my daughter to open it after I failed to get it to work and she finally did get it opened but injured her thumb in the process.  So to use it, I have to unscrew the lid.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely lightweight conditioner that isn&#x27;t horribly drying to my hair. My hair is quite long - almost waist length and I have a lot of natural curl. Some shampoo and conditioners dry my hair so much that it gets frizzy and flyaway while others over moisture and knock out all of my curl while making my hair feel greasy. This conditioner (and also the shampoo) does neither of those two things. I have just the right amount of moisture in my hair to allow the curl to have its way but my frizzy hairs are still under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent - it is like being a teenager again. I used the original scent for many years and opening the bottle was like greeting an old friend. However, the product is even better than it was back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to all of the above, the price on this product is extremely reasonable. I can buy a bottle for both my shower and for my guest bathroom and still save money over the other brands I have purchased in the past. I really enjoyed the conditioner and recommend it to anyone - the scent is gender neutral so it is the perfect choice for the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> like with the shampoo.  this cherry/almond sent is very pleasant and not over powering.  the shampoo is good stuff, but combine it with the conditioner, it made the wife&#x27;s hair very silky feeling and very shiny.  that cherry/almond smell to me is a real plus.  women after using this product--just be careful what perfume you use.  for the perfume can/may clash with the sent of your hair.  heck, the cherry/almond sent would be good enough for a perfume.  the wife&#x27;s hair after usage also seemed a little more active( the more bounce thing and looked fluffier/lighter)</li>
            <li> This is a trip down memory lane, the scent really did take me back about thirty years and the conditioner itself is just as good today as it was then. Smooths without weighing hair down and feeling grimy, a nice clean feeling instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only two big differences today over when it first came out: It costs half as much as it used to and I can now buy it at any grocery/discount store as opposed to when it used to only be available at a salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this conditioner before, so I decided to give it a go when I saw that it was safe to use on color treated hair. As a conditioner, it&#x27;s fairly light. I prefer more moisturizing for my hair. But this works if you have to wash often (daily) and don&#x27;t want to dampen your hair with too much oils. The scent is nice but very light, so no issues. At 4 dollars a pop, it&#x27;s very affordable. I&#x27;m waiting to see how well it &#x27;preserves&#x27; my color over time.</li>
            <li> My hair is short, thick, fine, graying, and dry. It didn&#x27;t used to be dry but is now that I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s.  I have been using very thick conditioners, the kind that comes in a tube rather than a bottle. I did not think this conditioner, or any bottled conditioner, would be as good as the thick stuff. But  in fact I like my hair even better with this product.  My hair is smooth and silky.  There is an underlying unpleasant odor though. Not unlike the sulpher smell of perming solutions. I don&#x27;t notice it after my hair (I always let it air dry) is fully dry. Another gripe is that the product is thick, possibly as thick as the kind in a tube, but its in a bottle and has to get out through a small hole. Not easy to accomplish. But still I like what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of this cherry almond conditioner.  I am always looking for a really good conditioner because I live in a dry climate and use a wood stove so my hair can get dry and frizzy.  I noticed that this conditioner was different from others I have used right away.  The texture of it is different, a bit thick and when you put it on your hair, it stays there, doesn&#x27;t drip off the ends, which I love because the ends is where I need the most conditioning.  When I use this conditioner, my hair is not dry, there is no frizz and it looks shiny and great.  I am in love.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely and the conditioner works as well as or maybe a little better than the other named brand conditioner Iâ€™ve been using. I experienced fewer frizzes after using this Vidal Sassoon conditioner but still enough for me to need leave in conditioner. I didnâ€™t notice an extraordinary shine or notable manageability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give an A for the scent and a C for the conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All hair is different. Maybe this will be the perfect conditioner for you.</li>
            <li> I grew up in the 80â€™s and 90â€™s â€“ but I did not use VS shampoo or conditioner, and neither did my mom.  So I have no strong memories of this scent that many others do.  The scent actually reminds me of Ludenâ€™s cherry cough drops.  It is an attractive candy like scent that is not overly strong.  I was a little confused as to why the main selling point of this product seems to be the scent rather then what it does for your hair.  This seems to be focused on just your regular daily wash and condition; if you have needs beyond that you may want to look into their other products.  I have been using this for about a week.  I think it is (at this point in time) well priced for a daily conditioner and will work well for people who donâ€™t need special conditioner (dry or oily hair.)  I personally have dry hair so I will most likely go back to my heavy moisturizing conditioners, but wouldnâ€™t think twice about using this if my hair decided that it didnâ€™t need the more expensive conditioner.</li>
            <li> This hair conditioner is wonderful! I absolutely love it! The scent is so soft and feminine. You will think of Japan in cherry blossom time! And your hair will shine so lovely! I give this a five star rating and a big thumbs up!</li>
            <li> a tiny bit does the job for silky smooth hair</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon has brought back the original condtioner with the classic cherry almond scent I remember from years ago. This condition is not too heavy and rinses clean with no residue left behind. It makes my hair easy to manage and with less flyaways. I love the classic scent of cherry almond.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m too young to remember what the VS Cherry Almond was like. Or my parents weren&#x27;t big on name brand products. I don&#x27;t remember ever really seeing VS around our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EITHER WAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a sucker for anything cherry or dark cherry. That delicious tart smell that just makes your mouth water! This is no different. It&#x27;s like a treat every time I wash my hair. Smells so good! Now to get my hands on the shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did leave my hair smoother and less... what&#x27;s the word I&#x27;m looking for... since I wash my hair at night and sleep on it, sometimes the next day my hair feels textured or gritty or fragile. I did not have this problem any time I used this product. It also made it much easier to brush my hair when it was wet (I know you&#x27;re not SUPPOSE to, but I&#x27;ve been doing it my whole life and my hair is so thick I wouldn&#x27;t notice if a few strands were to fall out). Seriously. It just glided right through my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you VS (and Vine) for making my night time hair washing routine easier!</li>
            <li> So very reminiscent scent, takes me back. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be over powering or not a good product but both the shampoo  and conditioner were lightly scented and just left a fresh but the same cherry-almond scent. And they are very good products and safe for colored hair. I will buy them both again!</li>
            <li> Um, yeah, awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product. It&#x27;s tha same as what my mom used back in the 80&#x27;s. The price is right too. I buy the matching shampoo also!</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon classic products are STILL the best! And the price is excellent. highly recommended</li>
            <li> After bath and body works discontinued their cherry blossom shampoo and conditioner I was looking for something similar, this smells great and works great on my hair!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.  Every time she showers, she comments on how nice her hair feels and looks.  She seems genuinely happy about this which is not something I have every seen out of her in regards to a shampoo or conditioner.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair but can say that I definitely notice the softness that this product produces.  I even use it on my beard and it works well on my facial hair which is generally more rigid than the hair on my head.  The odor of this product is weird.  I am not sure what cherry almond is supposed to smell like but this is not what I imagined.  It is not a bad smell, just different.  Overall I think this is a good product and my wife thinks it is extraordinary.</li>
            <li> This conditioner did a decent job of conditioning my hair.  The bottle says it&#x27;s for normal hair- medium conditioning without weighing down.  I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s accurate.  I smoothed it on, rinsed it off, and my hair feels soft and conditioned.  This conditioner is being marketed on the basis of its scent.  It has what is apparently the old cherry-almond scent from the original Vidal Sassoon products.  I don&#x27;t remember the original scent, but I love scented hair products and was happy to give this one a go.  I found that the scent is indeed, VERY retro.  It&#x27;s not just a cherry almond scent.  It&#x27;s some cherry and almond, but laid in a perfumey musk.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that either cherry or almond are the predominant note in the scent.  It&#x27;s really more a kind of heavy, musky perfume. I honestly don&#x27;t care for the scent all that much.  Those who have previous experience with this scent will know what they are getting into.  For those who are new to the scent, don&#x27;t expect it to smell exactly like cherries and almonds, because it doesn&#x27;t.  Also, the scent is strong.</li>
            <li> This is a nice thick conditioner that leaves my hair soft and silky.  It&#x27;s a little too thick to easily get out of the squeeze top.  I end up just unscrewing the lid.  The scent is soooo good, but really does not stay in my hair.  It reminds me of a lotion my mom used in the &#x27;70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I fully admit, I wanted to try this conditioner for the scent!  I LOVE cherry almond scent and still purchase Jergens lotion with the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; scent for that same reason.  However, several other things about this product appealed to me, including the generous size and the flat-topped bottle.  (I turn shampoo and conditioner bottles upside-down in the shower when they start running low to get the most out of the product; I can&#x27;t stand when manufacturers make the top rounded so that the bottles won&#x27;t balance upside-down!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, first off, the scent of this conditioner fully lived up to my expectations.  It gives me a smile every time I take a shower and makes this product a joy to use.  I do wish that the scent lingered, however; I would live to pick up on the scent throughout the day, but I&#x27;ve found that it isn&#x27;t at all noticeable post-shower.  However, I can overlook that issue, as this product also happens to be a great conditioner!  My hair can be very difficult to condition--it&#x27;s fine and thin and also tends towards oily, so it can be easily weighted down, but it also needs a powerful enough conditioner to avoid getting tangles and fly-aways.  In addition to be beautifully scented, this conditioner is nice and thick, yet rinses well, leaving my hair manageable without being over-conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a new favorite, and I would not hesitate to recommend it.</li>
