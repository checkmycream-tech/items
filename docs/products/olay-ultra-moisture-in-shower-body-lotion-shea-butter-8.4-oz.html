            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really easy to apply and it leaves my skin smelling great for hours.</li>
            <li>.. Works pretty good and the smells not the best but its ok.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, not to overbearing</li>
            <li>Makes a shower so nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>This is an effective moisturizer however the scent is very strong.</li>
            <li>And I actually liked Olay better</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, and has a WONDERFUL smell!</li>
            <li>This Olay product has great reviews around the Net and is a great convenience</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good and leaves my skin smelling lovely and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>i wish they have a more concentrated formula so i could use it even in the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also wonderful not to feel slimy or sticky the way some regular lotions can make the skin feel,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to know I can also purchase it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is the next best thing to sliced bread.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this In-Shower Lotion by Olay.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li>Your spouse won&#x27;t be able to resist touching you.</li>
            <li>I do love the idea that you can moisturize while in the shower, which I guess saves time for a lot of people, but this product has a lot of petrolatum in it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>And yes...that hole DOES make it convenient to use :-)</li>
            <li>like I said, I love it.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE the smell.  </li>
            <li>Love Love it.  </li>
            <li>When I use this product, it makes me feel awesome-rich and confident.</li>
            <li>I thought this would better than using baby oil after showering to moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I like the ritual of it and the scent of the 2 I use better</li>
            <li>(although the scent of this one is lovely - like a crisper version of cocoa butter).</li>
            <li>Also the oils I use makes my skin look more supple.</li>
            <li>Shipping was ok to.</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful and stays with you all day long.</li>
            <li>I love it because it really makes you feel good day or night.</li>
            <li>The best cure for winter dry skin!</li>
            <li>The product works, it really does a good job.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery and great price.</li>
            <li>This not only does every bit as good a job, but is easier and saves time!      </li>
            <li>This stuff goes on easy in the shower and leaves me feeling moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>A) it spreads on easily in the shower and b) unlike oils or lotions you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to try/absorb before putting on your close.</li>
            <li>Very easy &amp; quick for those of us who like silky, smooth skin</li>
            <li>This is a quick way to provide more moisture to your skin.</li>
            <li>Most lotion is sticky and dries out quickly.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;d already paid for it I was reluctant to simply toss it aside, and I was very, very pleased with the result!</li>
            <li>smells cheap.</li>
            <li>This might be a great way to use up left over conditioner or those tubes collected from hair dye boxes.  </li>
            <li>and then i LIGHTLY rinse it.</li>
            <li>and I feel it&#x27;s a pretty okay product, but</li>
            <li>I also like the clean smell it has.</li>
            <li>I love the silky smooth feel after my shower and it really moisturizes my skin.  </li>
            <li>If you can find the bigger size in stores, I suggest you do that because it&#x27;s probably more cost effective.  </li>
            <li>This body lotion is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>Smells nice and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>I loved this product, and I definitely would buy again!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much..</li>
            <li>Where can get it at price good enough for resale?</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has a very strong and sensitive nose, so coming from him that was the highest complement you can get for the scent!</li>
            <li>I would also consider using an all-natural mild scented conditioner so your skin doesn&#x27;t itch from perfumes.    </li>
            <li>My skin is softer and applying it in the shower and rinsing off is so convenient and quick.</li>
            <li>nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loyal to it for 6 years now.  </li>
            <li>This feels so good on your skin and it stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so soft after the first use, and after a week of use it feels and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I really was looking forward to using this product, but I found that the fragrance is way too strong for me and made me feel headachy.  </li>
            <li>Thinking that it was an Olay soap product, I was attracted because of the little hole at the top of the bottle; I thought it would be handy to use hanging from my shower caddy.    </li>
            <li>but it seems to have a cumulative effect so that your skin stays smooth and moisturized the whole time.</li>
            <li>It really works well to smooth and hydrate your skin while in the shower.  </li>
            <li>worth the money.</li>
            <li>Rinses off easily and leaves skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>Skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after a shower which I love!</li>
            <li>It will be great in summer, too, not to feel slick or greasy.  </li>
            <li>this lotion really works, plus saves time because you put it on in the shower, I love it, it keeps my skin soft and moisturerized</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my first time to use an in-shower &#x3D;body lotion</li>
            <li>it felt hydrated I also put on regular lotion after and it added more moisture.</li>
            <li>Amazon never fails to have things you would never imagine.  </li>
            <li>Functionally, this is a solid product as most Oil of Olay products are.</li>
            <li>At first I was aggravated--I bought this by accident.</li>
            <li>The scent is what drew me to it first.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday, and I still feel the effects today.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff and can only find in online!  </li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t consider myself overly sensitive to cosmetic odors, but this one was just over the top, cloying and long-lasting, and I ended up tossing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are at all &amp;#34;scent-sitive&amp;#34; you might want to buy the smallest bottle at first, to see if the fragrance is tolerable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when i tried it when just after i pat dry my skin for some reason my skin absorbed moisture better.</li>
            <li>Just test it out on your skin first before mixing up the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Super soft skin (and</li>
            <li>The skin is left feeling soft and smooth, as well as clean.</li>
            <li>and this helps so much.</li>
            <li>Makes shower VERY slippery.  </li>
            <li>Really is a game-changer.</li>
            <li>it really works no joke</li>
            <li>(My husband is a very manly man)  </li>
            <li>It leaves you feeling silky smooth, especially if you use it before you go to bed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really moisturizing my skin, versus just keeping the moisture from my shower in.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and it saves so much time.</li>
            <li>This is particular useful in the winter when less skin is exposed and it takes more time to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>You can make your own in-shower moisturizer with hair conditioner and a LITTLE BIT of high quality oil like almond, jojoba, shea, or coconut.  </li>
            <li>I also apply baby oil gel every other day on top of this treatment for added moisture.</li>
            <li>After rinsing and patting dry, your skin stays silky smooth for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>it left my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>However, not only is your skin soft and smooth at that time</li>
            <li>This 8.4fl oz is okay for now, but was priced at about the same price I pay when I get the bigger size in the store.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably still have to double up with something else for extra dry areas like elbows and knees, but for the rest of the year this is good on</li>
            <li>you can still feel it&#x27;s moisture and smell the fresh scent the next morning.</li>
            <li>I love using this in the shower especially in the winter when my skin gets really dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I joke that if you want a new husband/wife/boy-girlfriend/in-laws, I bet you Amazon can sell you</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this stuff...</li>
            <li>A must have for super dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft after without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I like the scent which I am also not overly sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how well this product moisturized.</li>
            <li>I will often add a little extra lotion here &amp; there on top of the Olay, but I notice a big difference if I am without the product.</li>
            <li>This not only makes my skin feel soft, If I put it on my legs after shaving they shine!</li>
            <li>I am a white female with normal skin.</li>
            <li>It has definitely remedied one of my major skin dryness problems.</li>
            <li>I know when im not drinking enough water the in shower lotion doesnt barely or sometimes help for just a couple of hours even with the lotion.</li>
            <li>and since i have a very dry skin even if i live in a tropic country i thought i might give this a try.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and I find that this lays down that first level of moisture .</li>

            <li> My skin is softer and applying it in the shower and rinsing off is so convenient and quick.</li>
            <li> nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loyal to it for 6 years now.  </li>
            <li> This feels so good on your skin and it stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so soft after the first use, and after a week of use it feels and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I really was looking forward to using this product, but I found that the fragrance is way too strong for me and made me feel headachy.  </li>
            <li> Thinking that it was an Olay soap product, I was attracted because of the little hole at the top of the bottle; I thought it would be handy to use hanging from my shower caddy.    </li>
            <li> but it seems to have a cumulative effect so that your skin stays smooth and moisturized the whole time.</li>
            <li> It really works well to smooth and hydrate your skin while in the shower.  </li>
            <li> worth the money.</li>
            <li> Rinses off easily and leaves skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> Skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after a shower which I love!</li>
            <li> It will be great in summer, too, not to feel slick or greasy.  </li>
            <li> this lotion really works, plus saves time because you put it on in the shower, I love it, it keeps my skin soft and moisturerized</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my first time to use an in-shower &#x3D;body lotion</li>
            <li> it felt hydrated I also put on regular lotion after and it added more moisture.</li>
            <li> Amazon never fails to have things you would never imagine.  </li>
            <li> Functionally, this is a solid product as most Oil of Olay products are.</li>
            <li> At first I was aggravated--I bought this by accident.</li>
            <li> The scent is what drew me to it first.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday, and I still feel the effects today.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff and can only find in online!  </li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t consider myself overly sensitive to cosmetic odors, but this one was just over the top, cloying and long-lasting, and I ended up tossing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are at all &amp;#34;scent-sitive&amp;#34; you might want to buy the smallest bottle at first, to see if the fragrance is tolerable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when i tried it when just after i pat dry my skin for some reason my skin absorbed moisture better.</li>
            <li> Just test it out on your skin first before mixing up the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Super soft skin (and</li>
            <li> The skin is left feeling soft and smooth, as well as clean.</li>
            <li> and this helps so much.</li>
            <li> Makes shower VERY slippery.  </li>
            <li> Really is a game-changer.</li>
            <li> it really works no joke</li>
            <li> (My husband is a very manly man)  </li>
            <li> It leaves you feeling silky smooth, especially if you use it before you go to bed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really moisturizing my skin, versus just keeping the moisture from my shower in.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and it saves so much time.</li>
            <li> This is particular useful in the winter when less skin is exposed and it takes more time to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> You can make your own in-shower moisturizer with hair conditioner and a LITTLE BIT of high quality oil like almond, jojoba, shea, or coconut.  </li>
            <li> I also apply baby oil gel every other day on top of this treatment for added moisture.</li>
            <li> After rinsing and patting dry, your skin stays silky smooth for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> it left my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> However, not only is your skin soft and smooth at that time</li>
            <li> This 8.4fl oz is okay for now, but was priced at about the same price I pay when I get the bigger size in the store.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably still have to double up with something else for extra dry areas like elbows and knees, but for the rest of the year this is good on</li>
            <li> you can still feel it&#x27;s moisture and smell the fresh scent the next morning.</li>
            <li> I love using this in the shower especially in the winter when my skin gets really dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I joke that if you want a new husband/wife/boy-girlfriend/in-laws, I bet you Amazon can sell you</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this stuff...</li>
            <li> A must have for super dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft after without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I like the scent which I am also not overly sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how well this product moisturized.</li>
            <li> I will often add a little extra lotion here &amp; there on top of the Olay, but I notice a big difference if I am without the product.</li>
            <li> This not only makes my skin feel soft, If I put it on my legs after shaving they shine!</li>
            <li> I am a white female with normal skin.</li>
            <li> It has definitely remedied one of my major skin dryness problems.</li>
            <li> I know when im not drinking enough water the in shower lotion doesnt barely or sometimes help for just a couple of hours even with the lotion.</li>
            <li> and since i have a very dry skin even if i live in a tropic country i thought i might give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and I find that this lays down that first level of moisture .</li>
            <li> Normally the heels of my feet will even be dry and rough after a shower in the water.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but after the first use I was hooked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without this stuff.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than expected when I bought it in the stores</li>
            <li> I was intending to get liquid soap, and this was on the same shelves, rather than with the other lotions.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and bought this product to help.  </li>
            <li> However, I did not expect this in-shower lotion to work on really dry areas like those.   </li>
            <li> and I think it tends to dry my skin faster.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice them looking dry.  </li>
            <li> even after they&#x27;re supposed to have \\&quot;soaked in.\\&quot; This in-shower lotion makes the skin feel hydrated and soft, with none of the residue that makes dressing after showering such a hassle; clothes don&#x27;t cling awkwardly to the skin, which makes layering in winter so much easier.</li>
            <li> live where there&#x27;s really hard water</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the Nivea in shower lotion for very dry skin the dark blue one.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this is the lotion for you!  </li>
            <li> it doesnt feel oily and my skin feels smooth without that annoying after itch feel i normally get after showering</li>
            <li> I get very dry skin in the winter and don&#x27;t always have time to apply lotion after shower.</li>
            <li> I get very dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> When I order it I usually buy several bottles at a time as I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll never be able to find it again.</li>
            <li> I showered a little with regular body wash, rinsed, and then applied this and rinsed.</li>
            <li> My skin will stay moist all day after using this lotion and I only have to use a little bit at a time</li>
            <li> my skin is extremely picky and will dry up like nothing.)</li>
            <li> Finding it in stores is becoming increasingly difficult, so I usually buy in bulk now.</li>
            <li> Mix very well and poor in a bottle.    </li>
            <li> I would be careful about the amount of oil</li>
            <li> have been using it for years, my coworker would buy it for me from the military exchange</li>
            <li> so I can usually make one bottle last far past winter.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, so I can never go without moisturizing or my skin feels tight and dry.</li>
            <li> It was no better than regular lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it at my local stores.  </li>
            <li> Putting on lotion after a shower is a time-consuming task that I have never liked, but feel is essential.  </li>
            <li> and I used less of it.</li>
            <li> After I got out the shower I did feel a difference from my previous showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish it cost less.</li>
            <li> Price is a little exorbitant.</li>
            <li> but just don&#x27;t have the time (or just plain lazy) to use lotion after a shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well it moisturizes</li>
            <li> Not sure why they don&#x27;t still sell it at the stores.</li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to find????</li>
            <li> It is rather confusing to think that you can apply lotion and then rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> and this has been a lifesaver for days when I&#x27;m running late.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so thick and fragrant.  </li>
            <li> other than that ill finish this bottle and not repurchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my only thing that saves me during the horrible long Minnesota winters.  </li>
            <li> It is really difficult to find, but lately I have found luck at Kroger, so I tried to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;The shower (even the mat)</li>
            <li> POOR product.</li>
            <li> Figuring it was just some marketing ploy, I thought it unlikely to work as described.</li>
            <li> Works on the worst winter dry skin!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a bad product, just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> It rocks, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> it&#x27;s my first time to use an in-shower &#x3D;body lotion and since i have a very dry skin even if i live in a tropic country i thought i might give this a try. i see no result when i tried following the instructions but when i tried it when just after i pat dry my skin for some reason my skin absorbed moisture better. it left my skin smooth and soft. i wish they have a more concentrated formula so i could use it even in the shower. also am not a fan of the scent. smells cheap. other than that ill finish this bottle and not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! On accutane and this helps so much. A must have for super dry skin.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order this product again. Smells nice and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent and you can still feel it&#x27;s moisture and smell the fresh scent the next morning. Great on elbows, knees and feet! Works on the worst winter dry skin! Just ordered my second bottle 😊</li>
            <li> I love using this in the shower especially in the winter when my skin gets really dry and flaky. It also smells great and my boyfriend compliments me everytime I use it. Very easy &amp; quick for those of us who like silky, smooth skin but just don&#x27;t have the time (or just plain lazy) to use lotion after a shower.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and bought this product to help.  Good when put on after a shower.  However, wears off within a couple of hours.  Makes shower VERY slippery.  Smells good.  Wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES this product. She use to buy it locally and could not find it anywhere, so I bought 6 bottles to keep her supplied</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without this stuff. Really is a game-changer. Super soft skin (and my skin is extremely picky and will dry up like nothing.) I loved this product, and I definitely would buy again!</li>
            <li> This not only makes my skin feel soft, If I put it on my legs after shaving they shine! Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one for my husband and one for me. We&#x27;re both delighted with the effectiveness of the lotion and the pleasant scent.  It&#x27;s also wonderful not to feel slimy or sticky the way some regular lotions can make the skin feel, even after they&#x27;re supposed to have \\&quot;soaked in.\\&quot; This in-shower lotion makes the skin feel hydrated and soft, with none of the residue that makes dressing after showering such a hassle; clothes don&#x27;t cling awkwardly to the skin, which makes layering in winter so much easier. It will be great in summer, too, not to feel slick or greasy.  I do still have to put additional lotions/creams on my hands, elbows, knees, and feet. However, I did not expect this in-shower lotion to work on really dry areas like those.   It also works remarkably well on my face. I was expecting a breakout as the result of trying it, but it didn&#x27;t happen. (Your experience may vary!) My face also seems to stay hydrated longer after using it, which I did not expect but was delighted to discover.</li>
            <li> You can make your own in-shower moisturizer with hair conditioner and a LITTLE BIT of high quality oil like almond, jojoba, shea, or coconut.  Baby oil would work on a budget.  If using shea or coconut oil it might be best to warm the conditioner and oil a bit to liquefy the oil for mixing.  Mix very well and poor in a bottle.    I would be careful about the amount of oil so your shower isn&#x27;t greasy and use a separate towel for your hair so it doesn&#x27;t get oily.  I would also consider using an all-natural mild scented conditioner so your skin doesn&#x27;t itch from perfumes.    This might be a great way to use up left over conditioner or those tubes collected from hair dye boxes.  Just test it out on your skin first before mixing up the whole bottle. Body lotion might work too.    This Olay product has great reviews around the Net and is a great convenience so I thought I&#x27;d share my idea for a homemade version.</li>
            <li> it really works no joke</li>
            <li> I will not ever go without this. I cannot find this at the local pharmacy. The product works, it really does a good job. It is rather confusing to think that you can apply lotion and then rinse it off.  However, not only is your skin soft and smooth at that time but it seems to have a cumulative effect so that your skin stays smooth and moisturized the whole time. It does not come off with your sweat and yet, you do not feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for years, my coworker would buy it for me from the military exchange but then I see Amazon has it, what does Amazon not carry. I joke that if you want a new husband/wife/boy-girlfriend/in-laws, I bet you Amazon can sell you one!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, GREAT PRODUCT, prompt delivery, excellent!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as advertised!!!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product when I stayed at a spa and loved it.  When my husband saw it in the bathroom, he wanted to try it too.  (My husband is a very manly man)  One of his guy friends told him about how well it works without leaving the skin sticky or smelling like a girl.  Olay might be surpsised to find out they have a lot of guys using this and recommending it.    I like it because it does a great job of moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t conflict with my perfume and it seems to be faster than applying lotion after my shower.    I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it at my local stores.  After my sample ran out, I went to three or four before I finally located it at Albertson&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m glad to know I can also purchase it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It soothes and smells wonderful. The skin is left feeling soft and smooth, as well as clean.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. I have tons of B&amp;BW&#x27;s and the like, they can&#x27;t even compare to this product. It smells sooooo good. My skin is so soft after without a greasy feeling. It is the next best thing to sliced bread. Try it!</li>
            <li> One of the best and most convenient ways to moistruze.  Why is it so hard to find????</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the Nivea in shower lotion for very dry skin the dark blue one. And I actually liked Olay better it was thicker and I used less of it. The Nivea was thinner and it went faster. Olay in shower lotion moisturized my skin it felt hydrated I also put on regular lotion after and it added more moisture. I like the scent which I am also not overly sensitive to fragrances. It kepted me moisturized all day until that night. I also drink plenty of water to help out also hydrate from the inside, out. Which helps also if you dont keep hydrated on the inside then there is not much a outside moisturizer can do. It cant work a miricle. I know when im not drinking enough water the in shower lotion doesnt barely or sometimes help for just a couple of hours even with the lotion. I will buy it again most defiantly!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! I was a little skeptical at first, but after the first use I was hooked. My skin felt so soft after the first use, and after a week of use it feels and looks amazing. I always get compliments. The smell is nice, not to overbearing so I can use my perfume after. It is really difficult to find, but lately I have found luck at Kroger, so I tried to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;The shower (even the mat) is slippery after use, so I spray the bottom of the tub with a shower cleaner after.</li>
            <li> Who knew your skin can also have a conditioner that you rinse just like your hair. This is a quick way to provide more moisture to your skin. I also like the clean smell it has. My skin is softer and applying it in the shower and rinsing off is so convenient and quick. I also apply baby oil gel every other day on top of this treatment for added moisture. I truly cannot shower without it now, I&#x27;m hooked. What a great idea, thank you.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  It was smaller than expected when I bought it in the stores it was 23.9 oz.  Since I&#x27;m home bound I&#x27;m ordering on line.  Will you carry larger sizes in the future?</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how well this product moisturized. I showered a little with regular body wash, rinsed, and then applied this and rinsed. After I got out the shower I did feel a difference from my previous showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live where there&#x27;s really hard water and I think it tends to dry my skin faster. Normally the heels of my feet will even be dry and rough after a shower in the water. After I applied the lotion and rinsed, I noticed that my heels were soft and when I dried off afterwards they were still soft. It has definitely remedied one of my major skin dryness problems. It smells excellent too! I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this In-Shower Lotion by Olay.  They discontinued it in the store (Walmart), and I could not find it anywhere - guess what?  Amazon never fails to have things you would never imagine.  This product is great and you don&#x27;t have to use lotion afterwards or perfume for that matter.  It rocks, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but, Oil of Olay has been a trusted product in my home since I can remember. My grandmother used this and I have adopted her need to have it within my home. This product however has surpassed my expectation. It leaves you feeling silky smooth, especially if you use it before you go to bed. Your spouse won&#x27;t be able to resist touching you. I love it because it really makes you feel good day or night.</li>
            <li> This is an effective moisturizer however the scent is very strong. To me it has the unmistakable smell of a generic but intensive Cucumber Melon scent. It&#x27;s nauseating to me but if you like that fragrance, you&#x27;ll be in heaven. I only took off two stars for the fragrance but that is a personal preference. Functionally, this is a solid product as most Oil of Olay products are.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, so I can never go without moisturizing or my skin feels tight and dry. I have this in my shower and I feel it&#x27;s a pretty okay product, but nothing extraordinary. I do love the idea that you can moisturize while in the shower, which I guess saves time for a lot of people, but this product has a lot of petrolatum in it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really moisturizing my skin, versus just keeping the moisture from my shower in. I do find that I have to use a lotion after my shower, but like how this product doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> Luxurious body wash, it feels so good! I love the silky smooth feel after my shower and it really moisturizes my skin.  The price for this in the stores is around $5.</li>
            <li> this lotion really works, plus saves time because you put it on in the shower, I love it, it keeps my skin soft and moisturerized</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well it moisturizes but it&#x27;s really easy to apply and it leaves my skin smelling great for hours.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Not sure why they don&#x27;t still sell it at the stores. Price is a little exorbitant.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and I can use all the help I can get. This helps. It&#x27;s oil-based, I guess, so the lotion doesn&#x27;t wash off with water like water based ones. It will make your shower slippery though.</li>
            <li> At first I was aggravated--I bought this by accident. I was intending to get liquid soap, and this was on the same shelves, rather than with the other lotions. Thinking that it was an Olay soap product, I was attracted because of the little hole at the top of the bottle; I thought it would be handy to use hanging from my shower caddy.    When it never lathered up, I took a closer look.  Figuring it was just some marketing ploy, I thought it unlikely to work as described. Since I&#x27;d already paid for it I was reluctant to simply toss it aside, and I was very, very pleased with the result! Putting on lotion after a shower is a time-consuming task that I have never liked, but feel is essential.  This not only does every bit as good a job, but is easier and saves time!      I love this product! And yes...that hole DOES make it convenient to use :-)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much.. I&#x27;ve been loyal to it for 6 years now.  I can&#x27;t always find it in the store so that&#x27;s why I had to order it on Amazon.  If you can find the bigger size in stores, I suggest you do that because it&#x27;s probably more cost effective.  This 8.4fl oz is okay for now, but was priced at about the same price I pay when I get the bigger size in the store.  As for the product itself, though- like I said, I love it.  I hate the feeling of putting on lotion after I&#x27;m dried off, so this is perfect for me.  I just use it on my legs and elbows and I put it on as my last step in the shower and then i LIGHTLY rinse it. LOVE LOVE the smell.  The scent is what drew me to it first.  My legs feel moisturized throughout the day.  I don&#x27;t notice them looking dry.  I totally recommend!</li>
            <li> it doesnt feel oily and my skin feels smooth without that annoying after itch feel i normally get after showering</li>
            <li> This lotion is so thick and fragrant.  It really works well to smooth and hydrate your skin while in the shower.  Rinses off easily and leaves skin very soft.  This softness last all day!  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;PLUS the shower is so slippery, the tub mat is not adhering to the bathtub anymore.&lt;br /&gt;NOT worth the money. POOR product.</li>
            <li> The best cure for winter dry skin!</li>
            <li> Makes a shower so nice. This feels so good on your skin and it stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This body lotion is by far my favorite! The scent is wonderful and stays with you all day long. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I get very dry skin in the winter and don&#x27;t always have time to apply lotion after shower. This product takes care of that. Super fast delivery and great price.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this stuff... I buy it whenever I can.  It&#x27;s my only thing that saves me during the horrible long Minnesota winters.  This stuff goes on easy in the shower and leaves me feeling moisturized all day.  Love Love it.  And it&#x27;s WAY faster to use this than to bother with actual lotion when you&#x27;re out of the shower.</li>
            <li> When I use this product, it makes me feel awesome-rich and confident. Lasting scent.I hope to find a body spray and lotion. Wish it cost less. This is so good I have to share it. Where can get it at price good enough for resale? My co-workers/ friends would love it!!</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff is amazing! I used it for the first time yesterday, and I still feel the effects today. My skin is soft, and has a WONDERFUL smell! Last night my boyfriend smelled my arm and said &amp;#34;What did you put on your arm? You smell amazing!&amp;#34;. My boyfriend has a very strong and sensitive nose, so coming from him that was the highest complement you can get for the scent! I get very dry skin in the winter so I am hoping that this will help. I&#x27;ll probably still have to double up with something else for extra dry areas like elbows and knees, but for the rest of the year this is good on it&#x27;s own. Definitely a buy again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good and leaves my skin smelling lovely and feeling smooth. Skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after a shower which I love!</li>
            <li> I thought this would better than using baby oil after showering to moisturize my skin.  It was no better than regular lotion and I don&#x27;t see how putting this on in the shower saves time vs. putting on lotion or oil out of the shower.  I don&#x27;t think I will but this again.  It wasn&#x27;t a bad product, just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I am a white female with normal skin. Most lotion is sticky and dries out quickly. This lotion is put on in the shower, so it locks in the moisture. After rinsing and patting dry, your skin stays silky smooth for 24 hours. In my opinion, you are throwing your money away if you buy anything else. I looked for 5 years for this after they stopped making it. I was so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now. Finding it in stores is becoming increasingly difficult, so I usually buy in bulk now. I have very dry skin, and I find that this lays down that first level of moisture . I will often add a little extra lotion here &amp; there on top of the Olay, but I notice a big difference if I am without the product. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff and can only find in online!  I can never find it in stores anymore.  If you have dry skin this is the lotion for you!  Rub it on in the shower after your body wash/soap and then rinse off.  My skin will stay moist all day after using this lotion and I only have to use a little bit at a time so I can usually make one bottle last far past winter.  When I order it I usually buy several bottles at a time as I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll never be able to find it again.</li>
            <li> I need to use a lot to apply all over my body. Feels like I am putting hair conditioner all over my body. Smells good but I personally think the reviews on Amazon.com here is overrated.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this has been a lifesaver for days when I&#x27;m running late. Overall I still prefer using body oil. I like the ritual of it and the scent of the 2 I use better (although the scent of this one is lovely - like a crisper version of cocoa butter). Also the oils I use makes my skin look more supple. But in terms of actually locking in moisture, this works just as well and it saves so much time. A) it spreads on easily in the shower and b) unlike oils or lotions you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to try/absorb before putting on your close. This is particular useful in the winter when less skin is exposed and it takes more time to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was going to start tanning and I needed to get my skin hydrated an moisturized.. Works pretty good and the smells not the best but its ok. Shipping was ok to. I went to Walmart the next day and there it was for the same price.</li>
            <li> I really was looking forward to using this product, but I found that the fragrance is way too strong for me and made me feel headachy.  Normally I don&#x27;t consider myself overly sensitive to cosmetic odors, but this one was just over the top, cloying and long-lasting, and I ended up tossing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are at all &amp;#34;scent-sitive&amp;#34; you might want to buy the smallest bottle at first, to see if the fragrance is tolerable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Olay.</li>
            <li> I love it! I grab several bottles when I make a purchase at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the winter time....it totally dries my skin out. But this in shower body lotion totally changes that! I love it! Your skin feels so moisterized after your shower and it smells so wonderful!</li>
