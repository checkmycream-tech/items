            <li>but they&#x27;re all wearable and comfortable.</li>
            <li>My biggest size is an 8 and those are my thumbs so with that being said there are a couple of the rings that don&#x27;t fit me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they were cheap.</li>
            <li>donate to womens shelter maybe someone else will like them and will fit</li>
            <li>They are worth much more.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more :)</li>
            <li>Rings for fun, they don&#x27;t look real but they are cute.</li>
            <li>What size are these there very pretty</li>
            <li>but it came earlier on time, you could barely see the design ok overall good for the price</li>
            <li>Fortunately they did not cost a fortune,not worth the cost to send back.</li>
            <li>cheap pieces with sharp edges...</li>
            <li>and they fit only my pink finger.</li>
            <li>these are so small none of them will fit any of my fingers,my hands are not big.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!!!</li>
