            <li>It hasn&#x27;t given me an allergic reaction (knock on wood) and it does make me face feel clean, so thats good.</li>
            <li>First, the sealed packaging is great and comes with three bars sealed within.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you keep on a drainable soap holder.</li>
            <li>It has  helped him better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li>It really does work great for everything people say.</li>
            <li>Most soaps make me itch</li>
            <li>I use it on my face mostly, and sometimes on my body.</li>
            <li>my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>Be sure to moisturize after every use.  </li>
            <li>Scent it in baby powder. :)</li>
            <li>I will need to purchase more to keep in stock bemuse</li>
            <li>my skin tone looks more even.</li>
            <li>My husband love it too.</li>
            <li>It is improving my skin for sure and will continue to use it unless things change then I will stop and update</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Not just the price was good but the soap does exactly what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pretty good but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>if you find anything you do not desire just pull it out quite easily.</li>
            <li>Also, this soap did an OK job of cleansing, nothing too special though like the results that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>Great product to use for my black soap shampoo, love it!</li>
            <li>I store it fine too because I use Idea Works Waterfall Soap Saver (from Amazon)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used black soap before, so when I ran out and a friend suggest I buy it from this vendor I found it great!</li>
            <li>The burning reduced to a light tingling.</li>
            <li>absolutely fabulous soap.</li>
            <li>I recently received one of your scented bar soaps I found it to be pleasant</li>
            <li>Feels good and leaves me feeling clean even after a double waitress shift at work (12 hours) or going to the gym.</li>
            <li>It get me super clean</li>
            <li>I gave this soap 4 stars because it gives an excellent clean with no residue and it helped to clear up my uneven skin tone, blackheads and light acne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve can remember a soap that has made me as clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Package came quickly..</li>
            <li>got my shipment quick.</li>
            <li>I have used other natural soaps but for my skin, this is the best.</li>
            <li>Very good but very messy.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best soap if ever used hands down!!</li>
            <li>because now there are 3 new soap bottles in the shower :)</li>
            <li>use it to wash my whole body (it leaves my skin smooth) and as a shampoo on my kinky hair.</li>
            <li>and I love the product it makes my skin soft without being oily</li>
            <li>It is drying so I would suggest you moisturize right after cleansing</li>
            <li>When I run out of this soap and have to use normal soap, my face does not feel clean.</li>
            <li>I mainly like it because there are no harsh chemicals in it, and it&#x27;s better for your skin.</li>
            <li>I received the package and it looks exactly like</li>
            <li>After first use of soap on my face I could defiantly feel the difference and see the difference.</li>
            <li>So far I really enjoy this</li>
            <li>thanks much!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really hopeful in this soap</li>
            <li>but it was cheap enough, I thought &amp;#34</li>
            <li>So, make sure to keep it closed up in a plastic bag or soap dish with no holes.</li>
            <li>I get ready to use this soap, I just cut a bit off and apply it with my hands.</li>
            <li>cleared up my scars from the acne very well.</li>
            <li>I use it for my whole body and face.</li>
            <li>It really gives you a glow.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I expected better results .Not</li>
            <li>I suggest using an exfoliating face brush with this and using a very moisturizing oil or face cream after.</li>
            <li>but if you have problem skin then you have to be very patient to see results.</li>
            <li>The quantity will last you for a while because you don&#x27;t have to use too much of it to get clean.</li>
            <li>I saw results the first time I used it, my skin was so soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s budget friendly and natural :) I will be ordering again from this company as soon as I&#x27;m down to my last soap.</li>
            <li>but the scent needs to be increased slight more to bring about the effects you are looking for, but I rather like the new bar.</li>
            <li>I use a tonic of apple cider vinegar and rosewater to get my skin back to the right</li>
            <li>Finally on the right path to an even skin</li>
            <li>and I went to put in a new one</li>
            <li>but that was my face trying to get used to a new product.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It make my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>Nice natural raw product!!</li>
            <li>I love African Black Soap.</li>
            <li>(can&#x27;t say for sure if they were mine or not) and also hard pieces</li>
            <li>but it hurt when I used it directly on my skin</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s kinda what you have to expect when you&#x27;re purchasing a natural product that is not heavily refined and processed...</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 2 year old when he developed perioral dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>And safe enough for me to let it sit on my face for a few before I rinse it off!</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend ordering this item.</li>
            <li>I normally slice it and place it in a soap sleeve, but when the bar got low</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d order from them exclusively, however, due to the current restriction I am forced to look elsewhere for a good deal.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really mind much if it wasn&#x27;t so messy and hard to clean up.</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks of use, his face was totally clear and it never came back.  </li>
            <li>the only soap that keeps my face clear for blemishes and pimples.</li>
            <li>I thought at first that maybe it could be a fibrous ingredient considering the product is natural, however, after I plucked a few stands out</li>
            <li>Maybe it was shaped and packaged while wet/warm, and that is the reason behind a more mushy/soft feeling?</li>
            <li>Buy a plastic container for this soap as it will ruin your shower and be hard to clean.</li>
            <li>After the first week I dealt with a little dryness around my lips and chin</li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t see myself purchasing this brand again and will stick to cutting and making my own bars from the other tried and true African Black Soap that I used from Ghana</li>
            <li>I received my raw African Black Soap on time and it was securely packaged.</li>

            <li> After the first week I dealt with a little dryness around my lips and chin</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t see myself purchasing this brand again and will stick to cutting and making my own bars from the other tried and true African Black Soap that I used from Ghana</li>
            <li> I received my raw African Black Soap on time and it was securely packaged.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I wanted to try something different from the normal black soap I buy.</li>
            <li> However, with this soap, it withered away very quickly in comparison to other African Black Soaps that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you leave it open on the bathroom counter it will turn black and get soft because it absorbs all the moisture from the air.</li>
            <li> Second, the consistency of this soap is softer, almost slimy when wet, allowing it to diminish very quickly when compared to that other Raw African Black Soap from Ghana I use.  </li>
            <li> My face had little blemishes and some pimples and now they&#x27;re completely gone.</li>
            <li> and I get the scrub I need without being too harsh on my sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> I have been using african black soap for some time now and this one was different than all others.</li>
            <li> I pat him dry then moisturize with a castor oil/coconut oil concoction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have been using African Black Soap for about two years</li>
            <li> My only complaints are that overuse can certainly dry out your skin (to be expected), and there are little rocks it that can scratch your skin if you don&#x27;t pull them out.</li>
            <li> I have spent 100s of dollars trying out different black soaps.</li>
            <li> up the great work and stick to the roots I am sick of all these chemicals/GMOs in the end we are changing nature rather its killing off the pollinators or changing DNA outcomes are unpredictable at the least.</li>
            <li> i cant believe it took me so long to find out about this!!!</li>
            <li> , I noticed all these tiny hairs trapped in the weaving of the sleeve.</li>
            <li> This African Black Soap is a bit different than the Raw African Black Soap from Ghana  that I usually buy from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower, and a little piece goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And I never used soap on my face because it makes it extremely dry, tight, and shiny.</li>
            <li> It did burn though and it was uncomfortable at first.  </li>
            <li> I admit that I tried this soap due to the uniform bars because that appealed to me.  </li>
            <li> And, yes, it does dry your skin out a LITTLE</li>
            <li> Also as People have pointed out, a lot of other black soaps are rougher, I think the softness of this soap is because it had been shaped into squares...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the regular soaps because they are hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> The dark spots are lightning up.</li>
            <li> But, to me look like little black rocks.</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin after a few days.</li>
            <li> It exfoliated and lifts up the dirt and dead skin from my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product alone in the summer months and in the winter I use it with a little bit of raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> This has slowly helped to lighten my dark marks and acne scars but it does take awhile to see a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not recommend for hair, just too messy and hard to lather hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure what that is.</li>
            <li> and my niece said the samething, but again, not sure if its supposed to or not.</li>
            <li> I have however found a small pebble in one bar.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast shipping and this is my favorite soap of all time for my face!</li>
            <li> Great for a body wash. Just make sure you keep on a drainable soap holder.</li>
            <li> Product as described.  Excellent quality.  Use it daily as a face wash and it works great on my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I like this soap but it hurt when I used it directly on my skin cause it have I don&#x27;t know what to call it. But, to me look like little black rocks. I&#x27;m not  goin to used it now until summer start cause it dry out my skin very bad.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. I have had acne and was treated with accutane seven months ago however my acne has been returning again. I wasn&#x27;t really hopeful in this soap but it was cheap enough, I thought &amp;#34; What the heck&amp;#34;. I am so glad I did! I saw results the first time I used it, my skin was so soft! It did burn though and it was uncomfortable at first.  After about 4 days I started breaking out and continued to do so for 3 weeks. I remember going through this type of purging before when I was on accutane so I didn&#x27;t stop using the soap. Then finally, my complexion started brightening up. I have issues with hyper pigmentation and this was such a welcomed surprise. The burning reduced to a light tingling. I use a tonic of apple cider vinegar and rosewater to get my skin back to the right pH then moisturize with organic coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this soap on my 5 yo who has eczema. He has tons of prescriptions but none of them work. The soap seems to stop the inflammation and itching though it does burn. I pat him dry then moisturize with a castor oil/coconut oil concoction. It has  helped him better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I cant believe it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses the soap for his Psoriasis and loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend for hair, just too messy and hard to lather hair. None of us have noticed improvement to scalp either.</li>
            <li> Package came quickly.. Dried out my skin after a few days. I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> This African Black Soap is a bit different than the Raw African Black Soap from Ghana  that I usually buy from Amazon.  First, the sealed packaging is great and comes with three bars sealed within.  Second, the consistency of this soap is softer, almost slimy when wet, allowing it to diminish very quickly when compared to that other Raw African Black Soap from Ghana I use.  I store it fine too because I use Idea Works Waterfall Soap Saver (from Amazon) and this keeps my soaps drier, lengthening the life of the bar of soap.  However, with this soap, it withered away very quickly in comparison to other African Black Soaps that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I admit that I tried this soap due to the uniform bars because that appealed to me.  However, I can&#x27;t see myself purchasing this brand again and will stick to cutting and making my own bars from the other tried and true African Black Soap that I used from Ghana (On Amazon).  Also, this soap did an OK job of cleansing, nothing too special though like the results that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used black soap before, so when I ran out and a friend suggest I buy it from this vendor I found it great! Not just the price was good but the soap does exactly what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to wash my whole body (it leaves my skin smooth) and as a shampoo on my kinky hair.</li>
            <li> love this soap,my skin feels great. The product arrive on time,package great,and for the price wow.will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I just wish they hadn&#x27;t reduced the purchase limit to a mere 1lb. I hope this is temporary. I&#x27;d order from them exclusively, however, due to the current restriction I am forced to look elsewhere for a good deal.</li>
            <li> I gave this soap 4 stars because it gives an excellent clean with no residue and it helped to clear up my uneven skin tone, blackheads and light acne BUT it makes my sink have a brown color and I keep having to wash it. Also, if you leave it open on the bathroom counter it will turn black and get soft because it absorbs all the moisture from the air. I wouldn&#x27;t really mind much if it wasn&#x27;t so messy and hard to clean up. So, make sure to keep it closed up in a plastic bag or soap dish with no holes.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin feel nice and clean. it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a good lather. works great on my daughter&#x27;s eczema! leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using african black soap for some time now and this one was different than all others. I dont mean this in a bad way, just different. It is a bit more sticky than all others and everytime I use it I cough as if something gets into my lungs as i wash around my mouth. Not sure what that is. Also, it burns when I use it and my niece said the samething, but again, not sure if its supposed to or not. It hasn&#x27;t given me an allergic reaction (knock on wood) and it does make me face feel clean, so thats good.</li>
            <li> I received the package and it looks exactly like what the picture showed I would receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using African Black Soap for about two years and I love the product it makes my skin soft without being oily and I get the scrub I need without being too harsh on my sensitive areas.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love it.. love it.. love it! This soap has done wonders for my skin. I use it on my face and neck. It exfoliated and lifts up the dirt and dead skin from my skin. I also wash my hair with it. A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I wanted to try something different from the normal black soap I buy. I normally slice it and place it in a soap sleeve, but when the bar got low and I went to put in a new one, I noticed all these tiny hairs trapped in the weaving of the sleeve. I thought at first that maybe it could be a fibrous ingredient considering the product is natural, however, after I plucked a few stands out I could tell that it was definitely hair... Even though the packaging was awesome and the soap did do its job, I probably won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Very good but very messy. Buy a plastic container for this soap as it will ruin your shower and be hard to clean. Nice natural raw product!! Great on my skin</li>
            <li> It really does work great for everything people say. My only complaints are that overuse can certainly dry out your skin (to be expected), and there are little rocks it that can scratch your skin if you don&#x27;t pull them out.</li>
            <li> I received my raw African Black Soap on time and it was securely packaged. I like the fact that it came in a zip loc bag that I could reuse. Anyway, I use the soap for both my face and body because it does wonders for my acne (on my face) and eczema. I haven&#x27;t tried everything on the market but I can say that this is the only product; specifically soap that I can use for both body and face. Most soaps make me itch so I always used body wash. And I never used soap on my face because it makes it extremely dry, tight, and shiny. But this soap does not irritate my skin. Plus, my complexion has improved a lot since using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get ready to use this soap, I just cut a bit off and apply it with my hands. The quantity will last you for a while because you don&#x27;t have to use too much of it to get clean. And it lathers and cleanse your skin without the use of a loofah or wash rag. And, yes, it does dry your skin out a LITTLE but that&#x27;s not a big deal. The problem can be easily solved with a good moisturizer. Overall, I highly recommend ordering this item. It&#x27;s budget friendly and natural :) I will be ordering again from this company as soon as I&#x27;m down to my last soap.</li>
            <li> Great product to use for my black soap shampoo, love it!</li>
            <li> The packaging is great!!! I use it on my face mostly, and sometimes on my body. When I run out of this soap and have to use normal soap, my face does not feel clean. I bought one pound and the three bars it came in lasted me a semester (about 4 months)... I did find some hairs (can&#x27;t say for sure if they were mine or not) and also hard pieces but that&#x27;s kinda what you have to expect when you&#x27;re purchasing a natural product that is not heavily refined and processed... Also as People have pointed out, a lot of other black soaps are rougher, I think the softness of this soap is because it had been shaped into squares... Maybe it was shaped and packaged while wet/warm, and that is the reason behind a more mushy/soft feeling? Just a thought.</li>
            <li> got my shipment quick. second time ordering this product. I have had no breakouts of cystic acne since I started using this soap. my skin looks so much better. I use this product alone in the summer months and in the winter I use it with a little bit of raw shea butter. cleared up my scars from the acne very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I bought it for my 2 year old when he developed perioral dermatitis.  Nothing else worked until I discovered this soap. Within 2 weeks of use, his face was totally clear and it never came back.  I also started using the soap and noticed that blemishes that I had become accustomed to coming and going on my forehead and face disappeared as well.  I&#x27;ve since purchased this for family and friends. Be sure to moisturize after every use.  I only use it on our faces.  I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap on the rest of the body.</li>
            <li> I LOVEEEEEE ITTTT !!!! The package was well wrapped and it came on time. I cut one bar for my two sisters and I&#x27;m definitely getting a 10 pound batch. So I can use it as a regular soap regiment</li>
            <li> The soap is good, but itchy for me, but the rest of my family has no complaints</li>
            <li> I have spent 100s of dollars trying out different black soaps. So trust me when I say, \\&quot;I have tried them all\\&quot;. First let me say, the PACKAGING of this product is THE BEST OUT THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you for taking time out and thinking about the end users of your product!! I am able to store it after use in the package that it came in!!! Which means everything to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the soap.... it deep cleans without irritating my skin!!!! And safe enough for me to let it sit on my face for a few before I rinse it off! I have seen IMPROVEMENTS in my skin since using this soap... Finally on the right path to an even skin complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you sooo much for supplying quality products and for the great packaging!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I love African Black Soap. I&#x27;ve used it before, and noticed a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for three weeks. I use it for my whole body and face. My face had little blemishes and some pimples and now they&#x27;re completely gone. The dark spots are lightning up. After the first week I dealt with a little dryness around my lips and chin and I broke out a bit but that was my face trying to get used to a new product. I use 4:1 water to apple cider vinegar as toner and that helps with the dryness. Google apple cider vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;But anyway, I got the soap within two days in great condition. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to anything else because I&#x27;ve tried everything for my face and this is the only thing that has worked for me. I&#x27;m brown skinned and it made my skin get like a tone lighter. I guess it&#x27;s because the soap really gets in there to get rid of all the dead skin. It really gives you a glow. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Arrived as stated. Shipping was fast. I use this soap because of the way my skin feels afterward. I can&#x27;t use the regular soaps because they are hard on my skin. I&#x27;ve used this soap for about 1 yr now and I am very pleased with it. I have used other natural soaps but for my skin, this is the best.</li>
            <li> the only soap that keeps my face clear for blemishes and pimples. Even prescribed medicated soap doesn&#x27;t measure up to this soap. I&#x27;ll never use anything else on my face!</li>
            <li> thanks much! everyone I know loves this stuff and once they use it, they never go back! absolutely fabulous soap.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best soap if ever used hands down!! I&#x27;ve been hoping to find soap this good for years. I&#x27;ve can remember a soap that has made me as clean and fresh. The only soap I&#x27;ll use for the rest of my life!!</li>
            <li> The product is as advertised and the price is great. I have a big family, so I look forward to ordering in the future.</li>
            <li> I expected better results .Not what it was led to believe.i have no plans on ordering it again.totally disappointed .misled</li>
            <li> Feels good and leaves me feeling clean even after a double waitress shift at work (12 hours) or going to the gym. Double bonus, all my roommates have stopped using my soap ( I didn&#x27;t know they did this before) because now there are 3 new soap bottles in the shower :) mwahahaha</li>
            <li> I have been using the product now for about ten years it continues to surpass my expectations. I recently received one of your scented bar soaps I found it to be pleasant but the scent needs to be increased slight more to bring about the effects you are looking for, but I rather like the new bar. Scent it in baby powder. :)</li>
            <li> i think this soap may have cured my cystic acne and i also use it for my body and hair!! i love it! i cant believe it took me so long to find out about this!!! please dont ever put it too expensive and i will buy it forever!!</li>
            <li> After first use of soap on my face I could defiantly feel the difference and see the difference. I will need to purchase more to keep in stock bemuse this is the only soap I will be using on my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am very pleased with this soap. I use it in the shower, and a little piece goes a long way. I mainly like it because there are no harsh chemicals in it, and it&#x27;s better for your skin. I will continue to use it every day.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It get me super clean my skin tone looks more even. My husband love it too. It make my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> So far I really enjoy this I have however found a small pebble in one bar. I use the bar unless it hurts then I switch to my hand  and also use it on my hair/scalp. if you find anything you do not desire just pull it out quite easily. It is improving my skin for sure and will continue to use it unless things change then I will stop and update this.&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the great work and stick to the roots I am sick of all these chemicals/GMOs in the end we are changing nature rather its killing off the pollinators or changing DNA outcomes are unpredictable at the least.</li>
            <li> Love it. I use it on my face body and hair. It is drying so I would suggest you moisturize right after cleansing</li>
            <li> The soap cleans deeply. I feel like im emptying my pours instead of just cleaning them but it does work well for my skin(combination/oily). I suggest using an exfoliating face brush with this and using a very moisturizing oil or face cream after. This has slowly helped to lighten my dark marks and acne scars but it does take awhile to see a difference. Overall it works well but if you have problem skin then you have to be very patient to see results.</li>
