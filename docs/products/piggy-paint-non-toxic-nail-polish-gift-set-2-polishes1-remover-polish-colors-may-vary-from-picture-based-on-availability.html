            <li>It&#x27;s good for about a day</li>
            <li>, the polish looks very cute on her</li>
            <li>My girls absolutely love piggy paint!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this item!</li>
            <li>Tried it out on her nails when she was 3 months old &amp; it was perfect!</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more but probably not another set like this.  </li>
            <li>You have to use the Piggy Paint basecoat and top coat in addition to your color of choice.</li>
            <li>Wish they had more color comes off really easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it easy to remove with the Piggy Paint remover.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for little toe nails.</li>
            <li>Very fun nail polish set.  </li>
            <li>I paint my 2 month old&#x27;s toes with it, it does not have any odor and the colors are so cute!</li>
            <li>I have yet to try the remover, but so far I love this polish!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping</li>
            <li>Easily came off when i was ready for it to.</li>
            <li>I was worried, being non-toxic, it wouldn&#x27;t be as effective but it works like regular polish remover.  </li>
            <li>Fun for The Little ones to use but, The nail polish doesn&#x27;t look nice...</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant, but I had to use like 3-4 coats to get the shading right.</li>
            <li>Looks nice but peels a little fast!</li>
            <li>Then make sure you use a hair dryer to dry it between each coat.</li>
            <li>We really like them</li>
            <li>And the remover works very well.  </li>
            <li>Really wanted a nontoxic approach to her makeup and polish for her recitals</li>
            <li>It takes more time, but totally worth avoiding those icky chemicals.</li>
            <li>They seem to dry pretty fast, faster than my nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I love the small brush-</li>
            <li>My 3 year old granddaughter loves the colors!</li>
            <li>Have to do two coats and then a clear coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the paint chips after a day or two of wear, it&#x27;s not disappointing, just contrary to other reviews.</li>

            <li> I paid 20$ and it doesn&#x27;t even stay on my daughter.  Give her a bath comes off paint again comes off.</li>
            <li> My girls absolutely love piggy paint! I plan on buying more but probably not another set like this.  The size of the paints is pretty small.  I used a 20 oz soda bottle to show the size of the paints.  I&#x27;m not complaining.  We really like them, I was just expecting them to be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Very fun nail polish set.  My daughter likes both colors.  They seem to dry pretty fast, faster than my nail polish.  And the remover works very well.  I was worried, being non-toxic, it wouldn&#x27;t be as effective but it works like regular polish remover.  This would make a great gift for a child.</li>
            <li> Great colors! I love the small brush- it&#x27;s perfect for little toe nails. I&#x27;ve found the paint chips after a day or two of wear, it&#x27;s not disappointing, just contrary to other reviews. I&#x27;ve found it easy to remove with the Piggy Paint remover. Both the paint and remover have minimal odor. My daughter is dazzled by her toes for a day or two and I remove it with no fuss. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my daughter. Tried it out on her nails when she was 3 months old &amp; it was perfect! Easily came off when i was ready for it to. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Have to do two coats and then a clear coat. The it looks great and lasts a week or so</li>
            <li> buy this for my granddaughter so she isn&#x27;t exposed to the chemicals in regular nail polish and remover, the polish looks very cute on her</li>
            <li> Tiny bottles. My 3 year old granddaughter loves the colors!</li>
            <li> I love this item! I paint my 2 month old&#x27;s toes with it, it does not have any odor and the colors are so cute!</li>
            <li> Looks nice but peels a little fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for about a day but then it chips.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Quick shipping</li>

            <li> Not shipped in the 2 day guarantee.  But product is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Wish they had more color comes off really easy</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant, but I had to use like 3-4 coats to get the shading right. You know how when you do 1-2 with Essie there&#x27;s no clear spots it&#x27;s all solid. And the nail Polish remover- follow the directions. I put Essie on my daughters toes- this stuff took it off with a small bit of rubbing. So next time I will soak. Literally no odor. Her dad didnt need to leave the room lol and she wasn&#x27;t fake dying all over the place. Really wanted a nontoxic approach to her makeup and polish for her recitals and I&#x27;m happy with this 100%</li>
