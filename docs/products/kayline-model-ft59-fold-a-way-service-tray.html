            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Very compact, and therefor awesome. should be called streamline.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>I have used many in the salon and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li>Rolls around effortlessly and love that it folds away for storage</li>
            <li>Love the ease of using this item.</li>
            <li>I love these trays they glide on the floor</li>
            <li>Very convenient folding option, great space saver.</li>
            <li>I probably should have read the information more closely.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty sturdy when set up and the tray appears to be made of good durable material.  </li>
            <li>and I love that they fold for easy storage</li>
            <li>folds away easily for storage and glides around as if on air.  </li>
            <li>It folds away easily when not in use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>But overall, works great for me</li>
            <li>Came with a free Sterling brand curling iron which was an added bonus.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t the smallest available, but they are sturdy for color/keratin treatment applications, just the right height for my assistant (5&#x27;3&amp;#34;) and me (5&#x27;7&amp;#34;), and have ample surface space.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without this!!!</li>
            <li>The first one lasted one year.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy, large surface to work on.</li>
            <li>But it is sturdy, rolls well, and has a good space for holding my essential oils and other items when giving a massage.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra $10.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when it&#x27;s folded up it&#x27;s pretty wobbly and doesn&#x27;t stand very well.  </li>
            <li>This Service tray is sturdy enough to hold hot stone pots, a microderma machine, and so on....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit higher than I expected -</li>
            <li>My wife uses it everyday and it is better then she expected.</li>
            <li>Often clients are here for a few hours when getting a complete new set of extensions and we order food for them.</li>

            <li> Love this! I don&#x27;t even use my trolley anymore, this works for everything in the salon. The size is perfect doesn&#x27;t get in the way and looks nicer to store folded up. Not like the plastic silver topped ones that are only $10 cheaper. Worth the extra $10.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had several of these trays in my 20+ styling career. They aren&#x27;t the smallest available, but they are sturdy for color/keratin treatment applications, just the right height for my assistant (5&#x27;3&amp;#34;) and me (5&#x27;7&amp;#34;), and have ample surface space. AND - fold up and store flat. Why fix what ain&#x27;t broke?  üòÅ</li>

            <li> This tray works perfectly where I need it.  It&#x27;s pretty sturdy when set up and the tray appears to be made of good durable material.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when it&#x27;s folded up it&#x27;s pretty wobbly and doesn&#x27;t stand very well.  But overall, works great for me and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> For use in my hair extension salon. Often clients are here for a few hours when getting a complete new set of extensions and we order food for them. This is the perfect cart to place their food or snacks on. Folds up...and rolls...perfect!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Wish I bought it sooner. Love how it folds up and is compact and not clunky like some trolleys!</li>

            <li> I use it every day and I love it.  This is my second tray cart.  The first one lasted one year.  The assembly method is prone to failure if you are folding and unfolding it several times per day.  When the second cart fails, I will buy another one.</li>
            <li> I have used many in the salon and this by far is the best. I was going to get the tray with the shelf below, just like this one but go this instead. Happy I did. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m missing out by not having that tray. Rolls great. Came with a free Sterling brand curling iron which was an added bonus. Money well spent!</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do, portable and good quality, ease of operation, and plastic material is good make</li>
