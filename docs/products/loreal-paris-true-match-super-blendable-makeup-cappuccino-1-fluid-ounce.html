    <ol>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s great service!!</li>
            <li>So before I purchased this product my go to was MAC because as a WOC I could never find a perfect shade and this one isn&#x27;t a perfect shade for me either.  </li>
            <li>But I mix this product with another one and it gets me my perfect shade.  </li>
            <li>and when I woke up my foundation STILL looked flawless.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>I was dissapointed, because it really is a great product.</li>
            <li>and I also need a great cover.</li>
            <li>I promise you, this is a great product for a woman of color.</li>
            <li>BUT THE PRICE WAS GREAT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wholly satisfied with this purchase and will continue the search for a match for myself!!</li>
            <li>which I guess is a good thing lol.</li>
            <li>Quality, good price..</li>
            <li>The color is good now for the summer.</li>
            <li>Hope it will be good for fall and winter.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving the product to my mother, as it works fairly well with her complexion.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my mom, she loved it.  </li>
            <li>This is a good foundation.</li>
            <li>And it was wrapped &amp; shipped all good, as soon as it arrived</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly after my purchase and was packaged wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>As it happens, this shade was too light for me, so I was able to pass it on to my friend for whom it was perfect.</li>
            <li>when I ordered the item, it was exactly what I wanted no mistakes in perfect packaging.</li>
            <li>lmao</li>
            <li>It really does blend well , and seemed to just magically become the perfect shade for her.  </li>
            <li>Its amazing :)</li>
            <li>I just love it..</li>
            <li>Does the job better than anything I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>it deserves much,much more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this, ladies.</li>
            <li>I love it and compare it, hip to hip, with MAC...</li>
            <li>I have ordered more....</li>
            <li>I love it and it exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth, natural looking and a perfect match for my coloring.</li>
            <li>So I thought to give this product  a try considering how many youtube beauty guru&#x27;s compare it.  </li>
            <li>This product is BETTER than MAC.  </li>
            <li>But this product looked way better than MAC on my face.  </li>
            <li>Looking forward to buying more.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine though because I just mix it with something else to make it all better.</li>
            <li>easily transferrable hence just 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>N7 alone is my shade most of the year).&lt;br /&gt;Dries quick and a light-medium coverage</li>
            <li>Its perfect for me, people recognize it how my face change by adding a little around my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to this being a much brighter and warm color, not the color of ruddy clay.</li>
            <li>THE FOUNDATION GOES ON SMOOTH AND COVERS</li>
            <li>She said the cover is even and the way it glides is smooth</li>
            <li>it feels so light on my face.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this product for such a great price.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this make up very much.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li>This L&#x27;Oreal True Match foundation color does not exist here in Chile..</li>
            <li>It was a full shade or two lighter than the formula sold into stores.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re going for a full foundation look it may take two applications, unlike MAC.</li>
            <li>I love this so much..</li>
            <li>I thought to myself, why am I spending 20 dollars on a foundation that doesn&#x27;t even fit my skin complexion right?  </li>
            <li>It was not the warm, vibrant blend-able color normally for this shade.  </li>
            <li>It was the right color</li>
            <li>It looks dark in the bottle, but looks good on.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product by my sister.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more of this product in the future</li>
            <li>One of two foundations I&#x27;ve tried when I first embarked on my make up journey.</li>
            <li>Shipping/Delivery fast!</li>
            <li>It blends better, it last longer, and it does not make me oily.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is because it blends better</li>
            <li>It matches my tone great as i am not too light or too dark, i am constantly getting compliments on my skin when i wear it, finally eureka.</li>
            <li>but it is buildable and very moinstrising.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>but when i put this on it really covered it and</li>
            <li>other summer foundation is 8.0 MAC Matchmaster (normally 7.5 most of the year).</li>
            <li>I currently use the L&#x27;Oreal True Match Makeup in N8 Cappuccino, as sold in Target and Ulta.</li>
            <li>This foundation sure does fit the description because it blends well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>As s I am unable to find that review to  edit, I&#x27;m anxious to report that I received this wonderful product in a timely manner, and every effort was made by the vendor to secure my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>High of summer or hot/sunny period for me of mid/late June to mid-September</li>
            <li>I would send it back, but I don&#x27;t feel comfortable sending back a beauty product (sanitary reasons and all) ...</li>
            <li>They even gave me small contacts more to call if there&#x27;s a problem.</li>
            <li>It was nearly 2 shades darker and the color was ruddy and muddy looking.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is smooth and goes on easy, a thin layer goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have alot of black spots on my face,but using True Match has given my face that AIR BRUSH look</li>
            <li>If you want to cut back on high end products, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Everything was tightly wrapped and the color matched my skin exactly.</li>

            <li> As a black woman i found it hard to find a true match for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> 2 go overs does it to last me at least 12 hours unless high of summer</li>
            <li> For reference I am Deep Dark in MAC MSF.</li>
            <li> THE COLOR OF THE FOUNDATION WAS A FEW SHADES  LIGHTER THAN THE ACTUAL COLOR</li>
            <li> When I use it is truly is blendable on my skin, it reduces the dark spots and acne on my face.</li>
            <li> BOD, benefit of doubt, my guess is is that it does affect the color, mine looked like a ruddy mud color - too dark.</li>
            <li> it just seemed extra thick.</li>
            <li> i see some other females who are a little darker than me who had to purchase the C8 also and mix it with this to get their color</li>
            <li> I wrote an unfavorable review previously in error.</li>
            <li> but I think that it slightly ocidizes making a little dark.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t as heavy as the MAC</li>
            <li> However, I bought this and the color was wrong.</li>
            <li> they sent me the wrong complection</li>
            <li> I was so shocked at this coverage.</li>
            <li> i hate it</li>
            <li> BUT THE COLOR WAS AWFUL...</li>
            <li> BUT THE COLOR IS HORRIBLE ,CHALKY AND PLASTIC</li>
            <li> LOOKING AWFUL</li>
            <li> i look like lil kim on her worst day</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Everything was tightly wrapped and the color matched my skin exactly. I would definitely be buying another bottle if I can find one.</li>
            <li> Quality, good price.. I just love it.. This L&#x27;Oreal True Match foundation color does not exist here in Chile.. So it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Does the job better than anything I have ever tried. It is smooth and goes on easy, a thin layer goes a long way. I never look cakey either! Add a finishing and this lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my sister. She gave it to me because it was my shade of color. When I use it is truly is blendable on my skin, it reduces the dark spots and acne on my face. Its perfect for me, people recognize it how my face change by adding a little around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus when I ordered the item, it was exactly what I wanted no mistakes in perfect packaging. They even gave me small contacts more to call if there&#x27;s a problem. Now that&#x27;s great service!!</li>
            <li> Rating it 5 star&#x27;s to me feels wronge cos it deserves much,much more.I have alot of black spots on my face,but using True Match has given my face that AIR BRUSH look cant stop smiling.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
            <li> High of summer or hot/sunny period for me of mid/late June to mid-September i&#x27;ll wear 2 parts of this to/with 1 part N7 (N7 alone is my shade most of the year).&lt;br /&gt;Dries quick and a light-medium coverage but it is buildable .... 2 go overs does it to last me at least 12 hours unless high of summer&lt;br /&gt;My other summer foundation is 8.0 MAC Matchmaster (normally 7.5 most of the year). .IMO easily transferrable hence just 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this make up very much. The color is good now for the summer. Hope it will be good for fall and winter. It looks dark in the bottle, but looks good on.</li>
            <li> This foundation sure does fit the description because it blends well and a little goes a long way. I would call this a medium coverage but it is buildable and very moinstrising. It&#x27;s great for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.  Definitely would recommend.  It matched my complextion to perfection.  Will be buying more of this product in the future</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly after my purchase and was packaged wonderfully.  However, I bought this and the color was wrong. It was not the warm, vibrant blend-able color normally for this shade.  It was nearly 2 shades darker and the color was ruddy and muddy looking.  The description is point on for what I was expecting to receive, like the bottle that I already had purchased somewhere else, but this was not.  The description makes no comment about sunscreen, but when I got it the bottle does show a reference to sunscreen, again, but not in the description. BOD, benefit of doubt, my guess is is that it does affect the color, mine looked like a ruddy mud color - too dark. I was dissapointed, because it really is a great product. The description should match whats on the bottle.  I&#x27;m used to this being a much brighter and warm color, not the color of ruddy clay.</li>
            <li> One of two foundations I&#x27;ve tried when I first embarked on my make up journey. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I wrote an unfavorable review previously in error. As s I am unable to find that review to  edit, I&#x27;m anxious to report that I received this wonderful product in a timely manner, and every effort was made by the vendor to secure my satisfaction. As it happens, this shade was too light for me, so I was able to pass it on to my friend for whom it was perfect. It really does blend well , and seemed to just magically become the perfect shade for her.  I&#x27;m wholly satisfied with this purchase and will continue the search for a match for myself!! I wish I could give it ten stars!!!</li>
            <li> I love this, ladies. If you want to cut back on high end products, this is the way to go. I have sensitive skin and I also need a great cover. I was so shocked at this coverage. I love it and compare it, hip to hip, with MAC...I promise you, this is a great product for a woman of color. I have ordered more....</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product for such a great price. I currently use the L&#x27;Oreal True Match Makeup in N8 Cappuccino, as sold in Target and Ulta. The product I received was labeled as N8 Cappuccino but is a completely different shade from the one sold in stores. It was a full shade or two lighter than the formula sold into stores. I may be wrong, but I think the product I ordered may be an older version of this product (I noticed that the bottle I purchased from Target stated &amp;#34;New Truer Color&amp;#34;). I would send it back, but I don&#x27;t feel comfortable sending back a beauty product (sanitary reasons and all) ... I ended up giving the product to my mother, as it works fairly well with her complexion.</li>
            <li> I love it and it exceeded my expectations.  It is smooth, natural looking and a perfect match for my coloring.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom, she loved it.  Shipping/Delivery fast!</li>
            <li> THE COLOR OF THE FOUNDATION WAS A FEW SHADES  LIGHTER THAN THE ACTUAL COLOR THE IN THE PHOTO THE COLOR IS DARKER I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF IT WAS THE LIGHTING OR SOMETHING  I DON&#x27;T THINK I WILL BE ORDERING ANYMORE BUT THE PRICE WAS GREAT BUT THE COLOR WAS AWFUL...THE FOUNDATION GOES ON SMOOTH AND COVERS VERY WELL BUT THE COLOR IS HORRIBLE ,CHALKY AND PLASTIC LOOKING AWFUL</li>
            <li> As a black woman i found it hard to find a true match for my skin tone. But about 3 years ago i discover this makeup in this shade and i have bought nothing else since then.It matches my tone great as i am not too light or too dark, i am constantly getting compliments on my skin when i wear it, finally eureka.</li>
            <li> My mom approved of this makeup. She said the cover is even and the way it glides is smooth which I guess is a good thing lol.</li>
            <li> So before I purchased this product my go to was MAC because as a WOC I could never find a perfect shade and this one isn&#x27;t a perfect shade for me either.  But I mix this product with another one and it gets me my perfect shade.  I thought to myself, why am I spending 20 dollars on a foundation that doesn&#x27;t even fit my skin complexion right?  It just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.  So I thought to give this product  a try considering how many youtube beauty guru&#x27;s compare it.  This product is BETTER than MAC.  No lie!  It blends better, it last longer, and it does not make me oily.  The only thing is because it blends better it isn&#x27;t as heavy as the MAC so if you&#x27;re going for a full foundation look it may take two applications, unlike MAC. But this product looked way better than MAC on my face.  I put this product on my face at 7-8 in the morning, did my every day routine and even took a nap around 6 and when I woke up my foundation STILL looked flawless.  No oily, no lines, no ANYTHING.  I say PURCHASE IT and say yourself 15 bucks!</li>
            <li> It was the right color it just seemed extra thick. It shipped on time but I am thinking about switching my foundation.</li>
            <li> i purchased this and it came 2 days before the estimated delivery!! I love this so much..i see some other females who are a little darker than me who had to purchase the C8 also and mix it with this to get their color but thank god i didn&#x27;t have to. I have a acne scar in between my eyebrows that I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to remove but when i put this on it really covered it and it feels so light on my face. I was always on the edge about Liquid Foundation but i will be buying another one of these.. Its amazing :)</li>
            <li> This is a good foundation. For reference I am Deep Dark in MAC MSF. I would say when I put it on it matches but I think that it slightly ocidizes making a little dark. That&#x27;s fine though because I just mix it with something else to make it all better. I probably won&#x27;t be re-purchasing this but I will use it up since I have it. Stll on my &amp;#34;perfect foundation&amp;#34; hunt.</li>
            <li> they sent me the wrong complection ughhh i hate it i look like lil kim on her worst day lmao</li>
            <li> It seems to match my skin tone! And it was wrapped &amp; shipped all good, as soon as it arrived I was excited to try it. Looking forward to buying more.</li>
