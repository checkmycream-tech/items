            <li>I love this cologne</li>
            <li>I have to work magic to try and get it to continue coming out.</li>
            <li>I keep ordering it because I love the smell</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery -  great product</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it......</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume, but have not been able to find it in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>stays on most all day and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this perfume for years and really love it.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to find it at such a good price!</li>
            <li>-- this is the most fabulous scent ever.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available for purchase.</li>
            <li>Ps: The delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>The delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>I think ordering it on Amazon was easy</li>
            <li>I am glad to get this special perfume because there is&lt;br</li>
            <li>nonetheless it was 1/2 the price for the same beautiful fragrance</li>
            <li>Surely the company must be aware of this problem by now, when it&#x27;s been going on for so many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light floral and fruit notes go from jeans to cocktail.  </li>
            <li>I have paid alot more for this in stores, it is the real scent that I love not a knock off.</li>
            <li>Simple but delicious recipe for a refined, classic, sweet floral perfume.</li>
            <li>The original sent De Borghese is no where to be found.  </li>
            <li>Smells fresh!  </li>
            <li>and she smelled so clean that I had to ask her what she was wearing.</li>
            <li>The service agent was very professional and courteous.</li>
            <li>I wear it for every day and special occasions.  </li>
            <li>This used to be my special occasion fragrance</li>
            <li>It is a matter of personal taste, but I loved this one.</li>
            <li>Sweet without being cloying, musky without smelling like chemicals and noticeable without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>What a joke, a full bottle of perfume and no way to apply it.</li>
            <li>This is why I&#x27;m awarding it 3 stars, I would give it a full 5 for the scent though.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super quick BUT the cap to the bottle squeaks and the sprayer comes out in a stream instead of a mist.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping and great low price....</li>
            <li>this fragrance met all my expectations i will enjoy it from now on thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Pretty!</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package to try some on, it would not spray!  </li>
            <li>I usually buy orential fragrances, however the fruity notes of pear, plum and peach are beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Co workers regularly ask what it is, and say how fresh and nice it smells.  </li>
            <li>&quot; that gives it a fresh pop.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I purchased to bottles and the shipping service was supper fast.</li>
            <li>Anything named The Kiss gets attention right?  </li>
            <li>great price love this perfume and its hard to find at local stores</li>
            <li>I received an Il Bacio perfume set for Christmas several years ago from my sister and immediately fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>But, overall, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume have used it for many years, it is hard to find today.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>This gentle perfume does not.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The bottle I received was very foul smelling and not what I ordered.</li>
            <li>It arrived very promptly</li>
            <li>I have loved Il Bacio for at least 15 years</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;longer than most other perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had paid more attention to the other reviews for this product before ordering it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve just not felt the same -- so glad to have my signature scent back</li>
            <li>Too bad because it was wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this fragrance for many years, LOVE IT, and am always fearful it will no longer be available!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nostalgic for this honeyed, rich fruity floral, I purchased several bottles of Il Bacio, all produced recently (not vintage ones).</li>
            <li>This is my signature scent and it is way more than the price here even at the discount perfume shops in the small.</li>
            <li>It is the ONLY fragrance I have worn (and I wear a variety) that elicits positive response from MEN AND women.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find that Amazon carried this very hard to find fragrance, so I rushed to order it.</li>
            <li>Moreover, certain oils can be substituted with cheaper versions to reduce the overall cost.</li>
            <li>It is the real McCoy not a lame imitation.</li>
            <li>I have since found a new fragrance for special occasions and just use the Il Bacio as a go too for everyday use.</li>
            <li>They all smelled cheap, synthetic and certainly NOT the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other perfumes, but this one always wins.  </li>
            <li>But you must be sure you get a well-rated vendor - sometimes the less expensive versions of this fragrance are old, or have been used as testers or the atomizer top no longer works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet fragrance with a little \\&quot;ping\\</li>
            <li>I will continue to wear it; I will be very careful to not purchase from this particular vendor.</li>

            <li> I have since found a new fragrance for special occasions and just use the Il Bacio as a go too for everyday use.</li>
            <li> They all smelled cheap, synthetic and certainly NOT the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other perfumes, but this one always wins.  </li>
            <li> But you must be sure you get a well-rated vendor - sometimes the less expensive versions of this fragrance are old, or have been used as testers or the atomizer top no longer works.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sweet fragrance with a little \\&quot;ping\\</li>
            <li> I will continue to wear it; I will be very careful to not purchase from this particular vendor.</li>
            <li> After using this perfume for over 20 yrs - I&#x27;m just as in love with it as the first day I got that softly wafting scent - and Tossed out at least 10 other bottles of expensive perfumes.  </li>
            <li> As it turned out, the perfume had turned rancid as it seems that it was exposed to air ( probably sitting on the shelf too long ).</li>
            <li> I received the parcel earlier than expected &lt;&#x3D;&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I ordered it from Amazon, and received the product only a few days after ordering.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, the cellophane wrap was missing from the box- red flag-</li>
            <li> Think my skin has changed over the years so the aroma doesn&#x27;t fit me as well as in years past, but there is nothing wrong with it at all.</li>
            <li> I sent an email to the vendor requesting replacement or return and refund at no cost due to defective product and received no reply.</li>
            <li> There are no more Borghese department stores counters or global launches rivalling Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> It say&#x27;s this perfume was introduced in1993, but that year is wrong my received it in a gift set back in the early 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li> it will be soured with a unfamiliar tinge, especially once on skin.</li>
            <li> After finally getting it to work I applied it as usual; the scent was no longer noticeable after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> It no longer transforms into that delectable trail of seductive petals, but instead smells sour and synthetic.</li>
            <li> Purchases from another site were watered down.  </li>
            <li> then the box was slightly damaged-</li>
            <li> Seems to have less fragrance.  </li>
            <li> He apologized for the bad product, and told me that I should expect a full refund for my purchase.</li>
            <li> I opened the box and noticed the color of the perfume was very dark, as opposed to its caramel color.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I noticed  that the protective plastic wrapping surrounding the  outer box was missing.</li>
            <li> After a few months the spray stop working</li>
            <li> but I have now bought it 3 times and every time the cologne stops coming out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> And got it in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I have to use pliers to get the bottle open every time, a bit ridiculous I think!</li>
            <li> But as any fragrance industry insider will tell you, fragrance formulations get modified all the time in order to comply with fragrance laws (IFRA, GRAS, REACH, etc), and also because raw materials change.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little weak.</li>
            <li> This seemed watered down was definitely not like the same one I got asa gift at Christmas...was very disappointed#</li>
            <li> Seem as though it is hard to find lately.</li>
            <li> My complaint is because the spray on the bottle does not work..  </li>
            <li> At least they will have a return policy for defective merchandise.</li>
            <li> But, like others, I will not order this perfume again from Amazon, which is too bad because it would have made it more convenient if I could. :(</li>
            <li> Such a shame because I was wanting this sooooo badly since I knew it was hard to find.</li>
            <li> Never a good sign.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for 10+ years and ordered from Amazon for the first time and it was horrible smelling.  </li>
            <li> Now I realize that a scent is supposed to be faint with just a hint; usually after I&#x27;ve applied a scent there is evidence of it if I scratch that area or rubbed it</li>
            <li> I think this product should be returnable since this is not the first time this perfume has smelled horrible, someone must ne producing faux bottles of this</li>
            <li> I used to wear this years ago but it is very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I think the sprayer is broken because it keeps getting stuck and not spraying at times.  </li>
            <li> She shared her secret, so I shouldn&#x27;t be selfish and pass it on.</li>
            <li> I disposed of the perfume and sadly, will now have to find another &#x27;signature&#x27; fragrance.</li>
            <li> sad truth is that the Borghese brand has fallen from its prestigious laurels.</li>
            <li> but I hate that it never works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find in stores, so thank goodness for the vendors on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it was so disgusting!</li>
            <li> This product smelled horrible abs I have been wearing this perfume for years.</li>

            <li> Its okay. There is no problem with it. Think my skin has changed over the years so the aroma doesn&#x27;t fit me as well as in years past, but there is nothing wrong with it at all.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent I use.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores.  Purchases from another site were watered down.  This is the real thing.  The original sent De Borghese is no where to be found.  Wish I knew what the company discontinues scents.</li>
            <li> This fragrance was given to me in 1995. I fell in love with it then. This fragrance carries a beautiful scent that lasts&lt;br /&gt;longer than most other perfumes.  I would definately purchase this again.!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You Amazon for carrying this fragrance !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I usually buy orential fragrances, however the fruity notes of pear, plum and peach are beautiful.  A bargain to boot.</li>
            <li> Sprayer on the perfume bottle doesn&#x27;t work. I sent an email to the vendor requesting replacement or return and refund at no cost due to defective product and received no reply. Ripped off and now question the quality of the product and definitely the quality/integrity of the vendor.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a VERY good price and received it from the seller in 2 days! I was very impressed with their attention to my order and their efficiency.</li>
            <li> this is the best smelling perfume i stray to c if i can find something better but no always come back the smell is amazing all the guys are always smellimg me at work lol!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, A++++Seller, came in perfect condition.  Thank you, will be back.</li>
            <li> Il Bacio is a life-long favorite scent for me.  It is the ONLY fragrance I have worn (and I wear a variety) that elicits positive response from MEN AND women.  Co workers regularly ask what it is, and say how fresh and nice it smells.  It&#x27;s a sweet fragrance with a little \\&quot;ping\\&quot; that gives it a fresh pop.</li>
            <li> I received an Il Bacio perfume set for Christmas several years ago from my sister and immediately fell in love with it.  Many perfumes stimulate a coughing response in me.  This gentle perfume does not.  I wear it for every day and special occasions.  It&#x27;s light floral and fruit notes go from jeans to cocktail.  Friends must lean in close to catch a whiff of this delicious fragrance, which makes it altogether very special.</li>
            <li> great price love this perfume and its hard to find at local stores</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, however the sprayer didn&#x27;t work...don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering from this company again</li>
            <li> The seller is wonderful and fast in shipping. Although this is not the Il Bacio that I remember. The smell is a little weak. I used to wear this fragrance back in the 90&#x27;s and men would flock to me wanting to know what I was wearing.  That&#x27;s not the reason that I purchased it though. I purchased this because I loved the way it used to smell fresh yet elegant, sexy and refined. This used to be my special occasion fragrance and that&#x27;s what I purchased it for. I have since found a new fragrance for special occasions and just use the Il Bacio as a go too for everyday use. Such a shame because I was wanting this sooooo badly since I knew it was hard to find. Good Luck I hope it works for you if you decide to purchase anyway!</li>
            <li> I wore this fragrance in the 90&#x27;s. I decided I wanted to start wearing it again. I ordered it from Amazon, and received the product only a few days after ordering. When I opened the package, the cellophane wrap was missing from the box- red flag- then the box was slightly damaged- another red flag. When I spritzed some on my wrist- EEEEWWW it was so disgusting! Not the Il Bacio I know and love. It had probably been sitting on the shelf for quite sometime. Bleh. I was upset when I read that I could not return it for a refund- so I contacted customer chat. The service agent was very professional and courteous. He apologized for the bad product, and told me that I should expect a full refund for my purchase. He then told me that since Amazon will not accept returns on Beauty Products, I can dispose of the perfume in any manner I choose. Pretty darn awesome! I recommend Amazon for all your Internet purchases!! **** for Amazon!  PS. The stinky rancid Il Bacio is now resting in the trash can outside! :D</li>
            <li> A co-worker passed by and she smelled so clean that I had to ask her what she was wearing. She shared her secret, so I shouldn&#x27;t be selfish and pass it on. I like fragrances that smell as if I just came out of the shower. I have tried numerous perfumes and body sprays. It is a matter of personal taste, but I loved this one.</li>
            <li> Take 5 plums &amp; 2 peaches.  Mash them with amber &amp; cream.   Warm it on medium heat.   Then pluck out 8 honeysuckles and add them to the creamy fruit compote.     Simple but delicious recipe for a refined, classic, sweet floral perfume. LOVE IT!    Ps: The delivery was very quick. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase overall.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this years ago but it is very hard to find in stores. When I put it on my husband and kids said &amp;#34;mom you smell awesome&amp;#34;. Glad I found it again.</li>
            <li> It say&#x27;s this perfume was introduced in1993, but that year is wrong my received it in a gift set back in the early 80&#x27;s and that&#x27;s when I fell in love with this fragrance!!!  a loyal wearer!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the perfume!  My complaint is because the spray on the bottle does not work..  It looks as tho the bottle has been tampered with ... The spray top is below the surface ... Thus the spray does not work and I cannot use the perfume.  I was suspicious when I read that. There was a no return policy, but I thought that Amazon was reputable.  I will definitely alert my friends as we do not have the cash funds to pay for defective merchandise.  i prefer to go on the Borghesi site and pay the regular price.  At least they will have a return policy for defective merchandise.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh!  Have received so many compliments.</li>
            <li> The best clean smelling spray it on you will love it! Makes you feel awesome.Pretty! Cant wait to spray it on after shower. Love it! Everytime someone stops to ask what perfume I am wearing!</li>
            <li> This is my signature sent for almost 20 years. i don&#x27;t know if it is close out or defects but I am only 1/3 of the bottle and the sprayer/mister does not work. I probably will not purchase on line again for this product. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have loved Il Bacio for at least 15 years and I&#x27;m only in my 30s -- this is the most fabulous scent ever.  Sweet without being cloying, musky without smelling like chemicals and noticeable without being overpowering.  The shipping was super quick BUT the cap to the bottle squeaks and the sprayer comes out in a stream instead of a mist.  nonetheless it was 1/2 the price for the same beautiful fragrance so I&#x27;ll deal with the bottle issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a break recently from Il Bacio and I&#x27;ve just not felt the same -- so glad to have my signature scent back, I will love this forever.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume have used it for many years, it is hard to find today. Will need to find another perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only perfume my mom likes. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available for purchase.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite perfume for almost 20 years. I don&#x27;t wear it all the time because I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;everyday &amp;#34; perfume. But I do love it!!</li>
            <li> I love but I always have. Thanks I&#x27;ll buy more when I run out of this bottle!</li>
            <li> Still my favorite fragrence.</li>
            <li> This product smelled horrible abs I have been wearing this perfume for years. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a. Knock off but I&#x27;ll never purchase again.</li>
            <li> The delivery was very quick. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase overall.I have paid alot more for this in stores, it is the real scent that I love not a knock off.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume for my grandmother, and of course, the spray does not work, and the item is not refundable. Shame on the vendor. Will never order anything again.</li>
            <li> this was for my wife .she liked it</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and everyone knows it.  It&#x27;s become my signature perfume - I get compliments quite often.  The fragrance is one of two they carry - and I get them both!</li>
            <li> I wore this scent several years ago and I have been searching for it every since. This fragance is breathtaking everywhere I go people ask what I&#x27;m wearing. I love it so much I purchased to bottles and the shipping service was supper fast. I Love Amazon anything I think I want I&#x27;m able to find it here.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and great low price....</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd and last time I order from this place! Both times we received the product and it doesn&#x27;t work(the spray/pump).  What a joke, a full bottle of perfume and no way to apply it.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find that Amazon carried this very hard to find fragrance, so I rushed to order it. When it arrived, I noticed  that the protective plastic wrapping surrounding the  outer box was missing. Never a good sign. I opened the box and noticed the color of the perfume was very dark, as opposed to its caramel color. As it turned out, the perfume had turned rancid as it seems that it was exposed to air ( probably sitting on the shelf too long ). I phoned Amazon and ass told that perfume is an itmem that cannot be returned, but when I explained how dissatisfied I was with the product, customer service offered, and refunded, my entire purchase price as well as shipping. I disposed of the perfume and sadly, will now have to find another &#x27;signature&#x27; fragrance. Too bad because it was wonderful.</li>
            <li> Well, this used to be great--back in the 90s. But as any fragrance industry insider will tell you, fragrance formulations get modified all the time in order to comply with fragrance laws (IFRA, GRAS, REACH, etc), and also because raw materials change. Moreover, certain oils can be substituted with cheaper versions to reduce the overall cost. That&#x27;s why some fragrances don&#x27;t smell the same as you recall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nostalgic for this honeyed, rich fruity floral, I purchased several bottles of Il Bacio, all produced recently (not vintage ones). They all smelled cheap, synthetic and certainly NOT the same. The result of cost-cutting, and transfer of ownership/license.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sad truth is that the Borghese brand has fallen from its prestigious laurels. There are no more Borghese department stores counters or global launches rivalling Estee Lauder. Costco owns the Borghese skincare/bath license, and who knows what company owns the fragrance license. Brand integrity? Kaput.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly, you can purchase a recently produced bottle and sorta-kinda get a whiff of nostalgia from the topnotes --but it will be soured with a unfamiliar tinge, especially once on skin. It no longer transforms into that delectable trail of seductive petals, but instead smells sour and synthetic. Not the heavenly Il bacio you once loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, an unforgettable fragrance is best reminisced in the mind, in the context of good memories.</li>
            <li> The search is over for the perfect perfume! Why no stores carry anymore..who knows.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 1.7oz. parfum for a friend, I also purchased one for myself, since I had never used IL Bacio by Princess Marcella Borghese. after trying it I love it. I will purchase it again. thank you.</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent and it is way more than the price here even at the discount perfume shops in the small. It is the real McCoy not a lame imitation. My nose would know. Great deal!!!</li>
            <li> Been wearing this for over 13 years and I still love it.  I have not found anything close to it, plus Amazon sells it for $20 instead of over $65 in Dillards.  A must try.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for 10+ years and ordered from Amazon for the first time and it was horrible smelling.  I wish I had paid more attention to the other reviews for this product before ordering it.  Amazon did make it right by refunding my money since I am a very good customer and I will continue to be because they did take care of the problem. But, like others, I will not order this perfume again from Amazon, which is too bad because it would have made it more convenient if I could. :(</li>
            <li> Anything named The Kiss gets attention right?  After using this perfume for over 20 yrs - I&#x27;m just as in love with it as the first day I got that softly wafting scent - and Tossed out at least 10 other bottles of expensive perfumes.  Borghese - you have my loyalty!</li>
            <li> This has been my &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; for years.  I think ordering it on Amazon was easy and it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> This seemed watered down was definitely not like the same one I got asa gift at Christmas...was very disappointed#</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for many years, LOVE IT, and am always fearful it will no longer be available!  It&#x27;s impossible to find in stores, so thank goodness for the vendors on Amazon!  But you must be sure you get a well-rated vendor - sometimes the less expensive versions of this fragrance are old, or have been used as testers or the atomizer top no longer works.  This order was definitely 5-star.</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> Borghese Is Number One! Fresh &amp; Sensational!</li>
            <li> I received the parcel earlier than expected &lt;&#x3D;&#x3D; well done&lt;br /&gt;and I am glad to get this special perfume because there is&lt;br /&gt;no way to buy it in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot + see you next time.</li>
            <li> My mom has been buying this perfume for years. This year it was her only Christmas request. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for myself, but I do like how it smells.</li>
            <li> Why else, My Wife loves it and has for many years.  Seem as though it is hard to find lately.</li>
            <li> After a few months the spray stop working and I cannot get the perfume out. But, I am still a big&lt;br /&gt;fan of the Borgnese products.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne but I have now bought it 3 times and every time the cologne stops coming out after a few uses. I have to work magic to try and get it to continue coming out. I keep ordering it because I love the smell but I hate that it never works well.</li>
            <li> Love it. Arrived on time for my sisters Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for years and have ordered is several times on Amazon. The bottle I received was very foul smelling and not what I ordered. I advised Amazon of this and per their procedure you cannot send the item back but they still refunded me the money, a stand up thing to do. I will continue to order from Amazon just not this perfume.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery -  great product</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get this perfume anywhere. When I found it, I ordered it immediately. And got it in just a few days. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it...... I think the sprayer is broken because it keeps getting stuck and not spraying at times.  But, overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume.  I&#x27;ve been wearing if forever.  I&#x27;ve tried other perfumes, but this one always wins.  I get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  It&#x27;s nice to be able to find it at such a good price!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, but have not been able to find it in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I hope I can continue to find it.</li>
            <li> have been using this perfume for years. it is my favorite. stays on most all day and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> this fragrance met all my expectations i will enjoy it from now on thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I have worn this colonge before; I thought I would purchase a larger bottle for myself.  When I first opened the package to try some on, it would not spray!  After finally getting it to work I applied it as usual; the scent was no longer noticeable after a few hours.  Now I realize that a scent is supposed to be faint with just a hint; usually after I&#x27;ve applied a scent there is evidence of it if I scratch that area or rubbed it; that was not the case with this purchase!  I will continue to wear it; I will be very careful to not purchase from this particular vendor.</li>
            <li> Spray works wonderfully which is not always the case for this cologne.  It arrived very promptly and I always enjoy this scent!!</li>
            <li> Great service - Love this perfume!</li>
            <li> It is great. The price was amazing for the size of the bottle. Excellent value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfume for years and really love it. The only thing is the pump on the bottle for the spray NEVER EVER works. Surely the company must be aware of this problem by now, when it&#x27;s been going on for so many years. I have to use pliers to get the bottle open every time, a bit ridiculous I think! This is why I&#x27;m awarding it 3 stars, I would give it a full 5 for the scent though.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love...this is one of my all time favorites...i&#x27;ve been wearing it for years...i&#x27;s my winter fragrance!</li>
            <li> once again I ordered the Il Bacio perfume and the smell is rancid.  AND you can not return the purchase.  I think this product should be returnable since this is not the first time this perfume has smelled horrible, someone must ne producing faux bottles of this</li>
            <li> Seems to have less fragrance.  Not sure why.</li>
