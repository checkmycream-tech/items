            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>(http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z7D51Y/).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin on my face, neck, and shoulders are looking much better</li>

            <li>Just got this product today and really in love with it because it leaves no residue whatsover, unlike the CLinique stull I&#x27;ve been using</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite cleanser when it comes to my face.</li>
            <li>the three, I&#x27;m able to keep my acne and blemishes in check across all walks of my life.</li>
            <li>so I end up spilling most of the water on my pajamas.</li>

            <li>There wasn&#x27;t that many beads every time I pump it out.</li>
            <li>Love the refreshing feeling and the smell in the morning.</li>
            <li>Most OTC foaming cleansers contain the ingredient Sodium lauryl sulfate as the foaming agent.</li>
            <li>okay scent (</li>
            <li>Love it and love the price for it.</li>
            <li>love this product and will be ordering again.  </li>
            <li>I think more products should have a pump.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for more than a year or so</li>
            <li>no products worked for me but this stuff is A.W.E.S.O.M.E :)</li>
            <li>even though I haven&#x27;t started-:)</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed the scent too.</li>
            <li>i use this most days.</li>
            <li>and i have to use lotion to make it better.</li>
            <li>besides that i love this</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser is awesome.</li>
            <li>I like to use this more in the summer to keep my face nice and cool when I wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good at first glance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sensitive, but this wash has been great.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I love this product because I always feel clean and refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>It smells great and actually makes me feel more awake when I smell it in the morning.</li>
            <li>and i used this before, just bought it online because it was easy</li>
            <li>Burst Facial Cleanser is more superior than most because it not only does a good job, but it is also affordable!</li>
            <li>At first, this smelled kind of like hand soap?</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel more awake after washing with it, my face just feels fresh and cool for awhile and smells pretty good</li>
            <li>I gave it to my friend and she seems to like it just fine.</li>

            <li>it really makes your face very clean!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d better buy a new one! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This can be drying and needs to be followed with a toner (stick to the Clean &amp; Clear line, since all their products are formulated to be used together) and a good night moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I would most certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li>You are probably familiar with this product, so I am not going to review it.  </li>
            <li>in all, pretty satisfied, and would buy again</li>
            <li>My skin feels nice and cool after using it, particularly around the nose (oiliest) area.</li>
            <li>using this, my skin was squeaky clean</li>
            <li>And I feel so clean after using it.</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry after using it, and it has a great scent as well.</li>

            <li>It smells good, it actually does wake you up when I use it in the morning, and I can see my skin get noticeabley clearer and smoother.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel cool (temperature-wise) immediately.</li>

            <li>I love the smell of this face wash and felt it did a decent job of cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you&#x27;re probably better off searching for a more moisturizing facial</li>
            <li>good clean but too dry</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and this Facial Cleanser has been very effective for me.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and has never broken/dried me out unlike many other cleansers.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle but also strong on acne.</li>
            <li>I also definitely felt much more awake, but it wasn&#x27;t from splashing water on my face!</li>
            <li>have eczema, so I try to avoid cleansers that are too strong, in case it makes my skin even drier, and this face wash does a really good job of allowing my face to keep the essential natural oils without being oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this cleanser has really great little beads that seem to help refresh me in the morning and help with slough factor</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes my skin soft and tingly</li>
            <li>I’ve also found that this product is really useful for getting stubborn scents off your hands- namely things like garlic and cigarettes.</li>
            <li>I saw a routine of keeping your face hydrated and looking fresh and she started with his product</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Facial Cleanser was exhilarating.</li>
            <li>use this item and then apply the Clean &amp; Clear Oil Free Shine Control Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing, the beads lightly scrub your face, and it leaves my face feeling even more soft and dry.</li>
            <li>(I have eczema, rosacea, and allergies) and give me just the right amount of exfoliation.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>After a day of sweating this stuff strips all the oil and nastiness right off but doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s over drying or anything.</li>
            <li>Really gets your face clean.</li>
            <li>My face is clear &amp; my cheeks look shiny and clean!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice anything special from the bursting beads, but maybe that&#x27;s just me not paying attention.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have this product and keep having the same quality, it leaves your skin soft and with a delicious citrus scent.</li>
            <li>The bursting beads and fresh citrus scent really does wake you up!</li>

            <li>it smells more like hand soap than a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Oh...&amp; the smell definitely helps to wake me up in the morning :-)</li>
            <li>This product works much better than traditional hand soap to help get rid of it.</li>
            <li>Morning Burst is exactly what this is .I</li>
            <li>Cleanses pretty well, though not completly if I&#x27;m wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>It keeps my brown skin smooth &amp; clear</li>
            <li>Very affordable!</li>
            <li>has Sodium lauryl sulfate and doesn&#x27;t mention it, fragrance is one of the first ingredients, scent is too synthetic</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser was pretty okay for my skin</li>
            <li>It works much much better then others more expensive and famous brands..</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>The vitamin C really makes your face wake up and feel fresh.</li>

            <li>Pure Tea Tree Oil + FREE Acne Fighting Blemish Roll-on Stick with Tea Tree Oil]] is a natural cleanser I can use without water.</li>
            <li>although i now find it really synthetic and not that uplifting at all), contains vitamin c and vitamin e that leaves your skin quite soft and smooth , cleans pretty well&lt;</li>

            <li>Clean &amp; Clear Persa-gel 10, Maximum Strength Acne Medication 1.0 Oz]] &amp;lt;- for night.</li>
            <li>Also I would like to recommend the Clean &amp; Clear Morning Glow Moisturizer, SPF-15.</li>
            <li>I swear by the clean and clear line...</li>
            <li>It takes off pretty much all of my makeup, but I also use baby oil to get mascara/eye liner off.</li>
            <li>The clean &amp; clear brand has a lot of products, but none have ever done as much for me as the morning burst has.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;Morning Burst,&amp;#34; but it seems to work fine as a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I follow this up with the clean and clear acne control kit in the evening, and the occassional use of the clean and clear astringent in sensitive.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li>The microbeads actually wake me up and makes my skin feel so smooth when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating for a product that is oil-free.</li>
            <li>I gently scrub using the SWISSCO</li>
            <li>after using the dg brand, i decided to buy the real cleanser</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to anyone.</li>
            <li>and I think the ginseng really works wonders with my skin type.</li>
            <li>This really helped keep it under control.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like citrus</li>
            <li>and you can feel when washing which is really neat.</li>
            <li>It works really well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between</li>
            <li>and it really does the job on my oily</li>
            <li>/&gt;Especially if I&#x27;ve been eating potato chips, crunchy peanut butter, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Those bursting beads feel like liquid sandpaper, but, much softer of</li>
            <li>After using it my skin felt really oily and like it had a layer of film over it, I even rinsed my face off a couple of times.</li>
            <li>I can feel my whole face tingle and my skin feels awake.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>So, that being said, I highly recommend this line/brand!</li>
            <li>works really well</li>
            <li>The product itself came fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li>It clears up my face really well and is really gentle of the face.</li>
            <li>Really cleanses your face very well.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do much for it.</li>
            <li>Very bubbly.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>In addition this stuff really wakes me up in the morning as well.</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear is a winning facial cleanser product in that it actually helps keep pores from clogging up.</li>
            <li>when i first started using face cleanser, i bought the dollar general knock off brand of clean and clear because it was cheaper</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d recommend following it up with a gentle face lotion, but I do like the fact that it is oil-free which is awesome but that has its downfall of leaving your face a little bit dry, but</li>

            <li>I like this cleanser because it leaves my face clean but doesn&#x27;t dry it, feels soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>I started using this, and my skin is almost completely cleared up!</li>
            <li>When I first tried this, I tried the tiny &amp;#34;samplers&amp;#34; from Target.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 years while I was in college, since I first seen the commercial on tv.</li>
            <li>Same stuff as in the tube, which is a decent, nice smelling, fairly harsh facial cleanser, just with fewer beads.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t like to wash my face in the sink because my sink doesn&#x27;t have a large rim</li>
            <li>It helps eliminate acne and mild blemishes a lot quicker than other face washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this product in conjunction with Sea Breeze Actives Clear Pore Astringent, 10 Ounces</li>

            <li>put a band aid over it to protect pillowcases, sheets, and clothing.ean &amp; Clear Persa-gel</li>
            <li>It helps to keep me awake, and it helps keep your skin clear.</li>
            <li>My face is sensitive.</li>
            <li>You know the old saying if it burns that means it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>Still, pretty affordable, and lasts a long time, even with using it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t neccesarily clear it completely</li>
            <li>I believe the microbead problem was fixed because when I use the product the beads will rub away as you scrub it into your face and are not plastic.</li>
            <li>It removes oil and leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I love this and use it daily, after using it my skin feels tight and literally refreshed!</li>
            <li>actually apply the C&amp;C to my face and neck and rinse clean and then apply it to my shoulders and upper back.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any teen or adult looking to clear up their face.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it can leave your skin kind of dry after a few minutes after application and cause irritation if you do not use some type of moisturizer after applying it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really been a big help for me in my personal and professional presentation and it&#x27;s given me confidence I wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise had.</li>
            <li>I have tried many acne washes since I have dealt with acne since middle school &amp; this wash is tough enough yet gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it worked really well to dry up my acne.</li>
            <li>Not a miracle, by any means, but it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much</li>
            <li>but as close as I&#x27;m going to come apparently.</li>
            <li>In fact the more I use it, the worse my zits again.</li>
            <li>Just that I bought it for my 11 year old daughter and it is too rough for her young skin.  </li>
            <li>but we have to always mix it with another cleaner to make her skin not dry</li>
            <li>The top shipped from Amazon broken - not simply disconnected.</li>
            <li>The beads aren&#x27;t too harsh and the formula is mild, so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>The smell of grapefruit and slight ginger is very addicting.</li>
            <li>after exfoliating my face with extra virgin olive oil and sugar, i wash my face with the morning cleanser, towel dry, then apply olay sensitive face lotion to my face.  </li>

            <li> I have really enjoyed the scent too.</li>
            <li> i use this most days.</li>

            <li> and i used this before, just bought it online because it was easy</li>
            <li> Burst Facial Cleanser is more superior than most because it not only does a good job, but it is also affordable!</li>
            <li> At first, this smelled kind of like hand soap?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel more awake after washing with it, my face just feels fresh and cool for awhile and smells pretty good</li>
            <li> I gave it to my friend and she seems to like it just fine.</li>
            <li> :B003BQLAQS Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser Scrub, 5-Ounce Tube (Pack of 2)]] &amp;lt;- AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This is a great basic cleaner.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s citrus scented and smells really fresh and appealing.</li>
            <li> my face feels smooth and it glows.</li>
            <li> I really like how the beads give my face a nice glow after use.</li>
            <li> And I was so happy to hear they had a body wash and different smells.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Why is this important?</li>
            <li> Great product..very suggested if you want to take care of your skin properly.</li>
            <li> it really makes your face very clean!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d better buy a new one! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This can be drying and needs to be followed with a toner (stick to the Clean &amp; Clear line, since all their products are formulated to be used together) and a good night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I would most certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li> You are probably familiar with this product, so I am not going to review it.  </li>
            <li> in all, pretty satisfied, and would buy again</li>
            <li> My skin feels nice and cool after using it, particularly around the nose (oiliest) area.</li>
            <li> using this, my skin was squeaky clean</li>
            <li> And I feel so clean after using it.</li>
            <li> makes my face feel clean without drying it out.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry after using it, and it has a great scent as well.</li>
            <li> This face wash leaves you feeling clean</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin feel much smoother and look much better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out either it gives it a nice clean glow which I love.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These bursting beads make my face feel so cool</li>
            <li> Good for basic face wash.</li>
            <li> It smells good, it actually does wake you up when I use it in the morning, and I can see my skin get noticeabley clearer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel cool (temperature-wise) immediately.</li>
            <li> not so much so that I wouldn&#x27;t use it, I like it:)</li>
            <li> It leaves my face super clean and seems to be helping with my mild acne problem.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, make sure you have a super amazing moisturizer if you&#x27;re going to use this product.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh orange scent and makes my face feel refreshed and clean.</li>

            <li> I love the smell of this face wash and felt it did a decent job of cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you&#x27;re probably better off searching for a more moisturizing facial</li>
            <li> good clean but too dry</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and this Facial Cleanser has been very effective for me.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and has never broken/dried me out unlike many other cleansers.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle but also strong on acne.</li>
            <li> I also definitely felt much more awake, but it wasn&#x27;t from splashing water on my face!</li>
            <li> have eczema, so I try to avoid cleansers that are too strong, in case it makes my skin even drier, and this face wash does a really good job of allowing my face to keep the essential natural oils without being oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this cleanser has really great little beads that seem to help refresh me in the morning and help with slough factor</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my skin soft and tingly</li>
            <li> I’ve also found that this product is really useful for getting stubborn scents off your hands- namely things like garlic and cigarettes.</li>
            <li> I saw a routine of keeping your face hydrated and looking fresh and she started with his product</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Facial Cleanser was exhilarating.</li>
            <li> use this item and then apply the Clean &amp; Clear Oil Free Shine Control Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing, the beads lightly scrub your face, and it leaves my face feeling even more soft and dry.</li>
            <li> (I have eczema, rosacea, and allergies) and give me just the right amount of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> After a day of sweating this stuff strips all the oil and nastiness right off but doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s over drying or anything.</li>
            <li> Really gets your face clean.</li>
            <li> My face is clear &amp; my cheeks look shiny and clean!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice anything special from the bursting beads, but maybe that&#x27;s just me not paying attention.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have this product and keep having the same quality, it leaves your skin soft and with a delicious citrus scent.</li>
            <li> The bursting beads and fresh citrus scent really does wake you up!</li>
            <li> This product really gets me to wake up and leaves a cool feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> A good quality product is a very positive find especially when there are so many other products to choose from.</li>
            <li> This product is good to use in the morning as a face cleanser especially if you have sensitive or oily skin like me.</li>
            <li> it smells more like hand soap than a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Oh...&amp; the smell definitely helps to wake me up in the morning :-)</li>
            <li> This product works much better than traditional hand soap to help get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Morning Burst is exactly what this is .I</li>
            <li> Cleanses pretty well, though not completly if I&#x27;m wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> It keeps my brown skin smooth &amp; clear</li>
            <li> Very affordable!</li>
            <li> has Sodium lauryl sulfate and doesn&#x27;t mention it, fragrance is one of the first ingredients, scent is too synthetic</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser was pretty okay for my skin</li>
            <li> It works much much better then others more expensive and famous brands..</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>

            <li> Also I would like to recommend the Clean &amp; Clear Morning Glow Moisturizer, SPF-15.</li>
            <li> I swear by the clean and clear line...</li>
            <li> It takes off pretty much all of my makeup, but I also use baby oil to get mascara/eye liner off.</li>
            <li> The clean &amp; clear brand has a lot of products, but none have ever done as much for me as the morning burst has.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;Morning Burst,&amp;#34; but it seems to work fine as a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I follow this up with the clean and clear acne control kit in the evening, and the occassional use of the clean and clear astringent in sensitive.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying this product!</li>

            <li> after using the dg brand, i decided to buy the real cleanser</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to anyone.</li>
            <li> and I think the ginseng really works wonders with my skin type.</li>
            <li> This really helped keep it under control.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like citrus</li>

            <li> After using it my skin felt really oily and like it had a layer of film over it, I even rinsed my face off a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I can feel my whole face tingle and my skin feels awake.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> So, that being said, I highly recommend this line/brand!</li>

            <li> Really cleanses your face very well.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do much for it.</li>
            <li> Very bubbly.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>

            <li> Clean &amp; Clear is a winning facial cleanser product in that it actually helps keep pores from clogging up.</li>
            <li> when i first started using face cleanser, i bought the dollar general knock off brand of clean and clear because it was cheaper</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d recommend following it up with a gentle face lotion, but I do like the fact that it is oil-free which is awesome but that has its downfall of leaving your face a little bit dry, but</li>

            <li> I started using this, and my skin is almost completely cleared up!</li>
            <li> When I first tried this, I tried the tiny &amp;#34;samplers&amp;#34; from Target.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 years while I was in college, since I first seen the commercial on tv.</li>
            <li> Same stuff as in the tube, which is a decent, nice smelling, fairly harsh facial cleanser, just with fewer beads.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like to wash my face in the sink because my sink doesn&#x27;t have a large rim</li>

            <li> You know the old saying if it burns that means it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Still, pretty affordable, and lasts a long time, even with using it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t neccesarily clear it completely</li>
            <li> I believe the microbead problem was fixed because when I use the product the beads will rub away as you scrub it into your face and are not plastic.</li>
            <li> It removes oil and leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I love this and use it daily, after using it my skin feels tight and literally refreshed!</li>
            <li> actually apply the C&amp;C to my face and neck and rinse clean and then apply it to my shoulders and upper back.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to any teen or adult looking to clear up their face.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it can leave your skin kind of dry after a few minutes after application and cause irritation if you do not use some type of moisturizer after applying it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really been a big help for me in my personal and professional presentation and it&#x27;s given me confidence I wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise had.</li>
            <li> I have tried many acne washes since I have dealt with acne since middle school &amp; this wash is tough enough yet gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it worked really well to dry up my acne.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle, by any means, but it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much</li>
            <li> but as close as I&#x27;m going to come apparently.</li>
            <li> In fact the more I use it, the worse my zits again.</li>
            <li> Just that I bought it for my 11 year old daughter and it is too rough for her young skin.  </li>
            <li> but we have to always mix it with another cleaner to make her skin not dry</li>
            <li> The top shipped from Amazon broken - not simply disconnected.</li>
            <li> The beads aren&#x27;t too harsh and the formula is mild, so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> The smell of grapefruit and slight ginger is very addicting.</li>
            <li> after exfoliating my face with extra virgin olive oil and sugar, i wash my face with the morning cleanser, towel dry, then apply olay sensitive face lotion to my face.  </li>
            <li> so after everyone of these failed attempts, what did i do, went back to clean and clear...</li>
            <li> You only need a small (pea-sized) amount of product for it to slightly lather up and clean your face.</li>
            <li> told my friends who had worse acne to use this and other Clean &amp; Clear products, and believe me, they all thanked me.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m older, this is too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> one pump is enough to do the job so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus: The beads really do &amp;#34;burst&amp;#34;-- in other words, they aren&#x27;t little balls of plastic that will ultimately make its way into the ocean.</li>
            <li> Finally a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin or make it flaky.</li>
            <li> Then I found a problem of pumper, it s hard to install it correctly, that may be a problem of delivery to cause the unusual problem.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like every other facial cleanser out there, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily skin, so I&#x27;m surprised this dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> They’re not too harsh on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Its actually cheaper on amazon then in stores which are roughly around $6-$9</li>
            <li> For those concerned about the environment, the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t the same as in other exfoliants as they &amp;#34;burst&amp;#34; or dissolve as you&#x27;re washing your face with them, hence the name.</li>
            <li> My pores are tiny, due to exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is dry but oily in the T-zone.</li>
            <li> I wash my face once in the morning and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This product gave my daughter who is 12 really dry skin.</li>
            <li> However, I do not feel it is well-suited for dry skin.</li>
            <li> but it leaves the skin dry</li>
            <li> But it did leave my face very very dry after about a week of using it.</li>
            <li> Other then the dry skin part</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find simple facial cleansers/scrubs that won&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In only using it for a few days I have noticed my skin clearing up.</li>
            <li> I’ve used this facial cleanser for a few years now</li>
            <li> I would like to know if anyone tries these produces together?</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the feel of this product when I&#x27;m washing my face, but after a few days of using this every morning, my skin got very dry and flaky :(( especially on my chin and nose, which are the oiliest parts of my face.</li>
            <li> Your skin will not feel dried out as with other products such as bar cleansers.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t break out that much, but I have annoying breakouts every once in a while and so far I haven&#x27;t had</li>
            <li> The small beads are so beneficial - I could feel it exfoliate and actually stimulate my pores - my cheeks looked rosy pink and skin</li>
            <li> but be careful, this bleaches fabrics!</li>
            <li> but be careful, this bleaches fabrics!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the other type of stuff out there where your skin burns.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;woken up\\&quot; from it as I do from any other cleanser.</li>
            <li> Even lightened my dark spots.</li>
            <li> The whole morning burst thing is a bit silly</li>
            <li> , it cleared up the rough bumps on my arms after a few washings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with fairly mild but annoying acne for several years.</li>
            <li> Wet your face, pump twice, and distribute over your face then rinse!!</li>
            <li> i know they say use cold water it the only part that i find hard to do first thing in the morning</li>
            <li> I also like how this product doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin as some cleansers can be very harsh.</li>
            <li> In less time, I use the blemish stick.</li>
            <li> The slight orange fragrance is awakening.</li>
            <li> /turned my face to a flakey sandpapery mess...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean dry as in flaky, but no longer oily.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that it was terrible but it just wasn&#x27;t amazing.</li>
            <li> Some, like St. Ives, were too harsh.</li>
            <li> I actually found that medicated ones made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> Alcohol, dove green soap, and this, are the only things that haven&#x27;t broken me out or really dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for face wash that isn&#x27;t harsh or dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is harsh on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I work in a consulting firm and I get pressured quite a bit from my colleagues.</li>

            <li> Every foaming cleanser on the market has dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I buy it on the subscribe and save program and its less than $5!</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave any icky residue, which other products like his have done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day since I&#x27;ve gotten it, usually once in the morning and sometimes at night.</li>
            <li> My skin has been a lot smoother and clearer than usual.</li>
            <li> I also like the small beads in the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t like scented cleansers but the citrus flavor</li>
            <li> I carry a really small bottle of tea-tree oil with me to help curb those problems.</li>
            <li> have been using this for the past 3 years</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth the few bucks!</li>
            <li> I find this ingredient to dry out my skin without fail.  </li>
            <li> use it at least once a day</li>
            <li> Not really effective for make up removal</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m under extreme deadlines where entire accounts are riding on me, and that&#x27;s when the acne tends to hit me the worst.</li>
            <li> and it is very thick and has a soap feel to it</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product; I use it everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Before receiving the product, I was afraid the citrus scent would be too overpowering and artificial, like dish soap.</li>
            <li> When the bottle arrived, the dispenser had broken off.  </li>
            <li> I never really had very bad acne, just a few bumps here and there.</li>
            <li> Not that I’m a smoker, but I’ll smoke occasionally and the scent lingers something awful.</li>
            <li> is use cold water</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who had used everything (including Proactiv) had really bad acne which was effecting her self esteem.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it took me a while to get used to the smell of the cleanser. it smells more like hand soap than a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> My go-to cleanser. It feels nice and has never broken/dried me out unlike many other cleansers. For those concerned about the environment, the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t the same as in other exfoliants as they &amp;#34;burst&amp;#34; or dissolve as you&#x27;re washing your face with them, hence the name.</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear is a winning facial cleanser product in that it actually helps keep pores from clogging up. The beads were mild to my oily skin type and I was impressed with both the ease of ordering, and the quality of the product. A good quality product is a very positive find especially when there are so many other products to choose from. Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Facial Cleanser is more superior than most because it not only does a good job, but it is also affordable!</li>
            <li> How great to find a product that is inexpensive, but does the job! Leaves your face feeling clean but not dried out! Love this!</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and it literally wakes me up. my skin feels better, even my mood gets better! highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a great basic cleaner.  I use it in the morning and at night.  It takes off pretty much all of my makeup, but I also use baby oil to get mascara/eye liner off.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows this product. However, the bottle started giving me problems after some time.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my skin soft and tingly, it cleared up the rough bumps on my arms after a few washings. Great on my skin</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It has a fresh orange scent and makes my face feel refreshed and clean. It also makes my skin feel much smoother and look much better.</li>
            <li> Face feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy I found this, as it&#x27;s the thing that has cleared up my skin. I&#x27;ve been struggling with fairly mild but annoying acne for several years. I&#x27;ve tried many scrubs and washes. Some, like St. Ives, were too harsh. I actually found that medicated ones made my skin worse. I started using this, and my skin is almost completely cleared up! The beads aren&#x27;t too harsh and the formula is mild, so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. However, it&#x27;s strong enough to exfoliate and clear out my pores.   I have combination skin that is dry but oily in the T-zone. It&#x27;s very sensitive, but this wash has been great. I&#x27;ve also had luck with Aveeno face wash. I would highly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li> This product is good to use in the morning as a face cleanser especially if you have sensitive or oily skin like me. The microbeads actually wake me up and makes my skin feel so smooth when I&#x27;m done. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out either it gives it a nice clean glow which I love. The best think for me is it helps with my acne and blackheads it doesn&#x27;t completely git rid of it but it does keep my skin under control so I won&#x27;t have more breakouts. I tend to use this in the morning and the \\&quot;Clean &amp; Clear foaming facial cleanser sensitive skin&#x27; at night.</li>
            <li> Love the velvety texture of this &amp;#34;Morning Burst&amp;#34; on my skin! You only need a small (pea-sized) amount of product for it to slightly lather up and clean your face. The smell of grapefruit and slight ginger is very addicting. The small beads are so beneficial - I could feel it exfoliate and actually stimulate my pores - my cheeks looked rosy pink and skin felt instantly smooth afterwards. Very hydrating for a product that is oil-free. Would use this also on my neck and chest for softness and a nice glow. Bottle has a nice slim shape and the pump make it very easy to use - great product.</li>
            <li> Within one use, my face was visibly brighter and my pores looked smaller. I also definitely felt much more awake, but it wasn&#x27;t from splashing water on my face! It also doesn&#x27;t leave any icky residue, which other products like his have done. It&#x27;s does exactly what it says it will, and makes my face feel really soft. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> You are probably familiar with this product, so I am not going to review it.  I am reviewing the online purchase of this product.  Do not do it.  When the bottle arrived, the dispenser had broken off.  As such, the product is unusable.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this, I tried the tiny &amp;#34;samplers&amp;#34; from Target. My problem area is my cheeks &amp; forehead. My pores are tiny, due to exfoliation. I&#x27;m on depo (birth control, for 7 months) and it helped with my pms acne! Even lightened my dark spots. Now that I&#x27;m using this, I use this in the morning or when my face feels oily in the middle of the day. It&#x27;s refreshing, the beads lightly scrub your face, and it leaves my face feeling even more soft and dry. I don&#x27;t mean dry as in flaky, but no longer oily. My face is clear &amp; my cheeks look shiny and clean! My face is sensitive. I&#x27;ve tried prescription from the Doc to help with acne and it broke me out after some use. Witch hazel eventually broke me out. Alcohol, dove green soap, and this, are the only things that haven&#x27;t broken me out or really dried out my skin. SO happy that my mom found this product!! 😁</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0019I83N8 Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Facial Cleanser, 8 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product every morning when I wake up. I find that this works great! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I use this product in conjunction with Sea Breeze Actives Clear Pore Astringent, 10 Ounces (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007OERN0/).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the cleanser in the shower, then the Sea Breeze after the shower. I use generic cotton pads for application of the Sea Breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually apply the C&amp;C to my face and neck and rinse clean and then apply it to my shoulders and upper back. I gently scrub using the SWISSCO 16-Inch Contoured Tortoise Handle Bath Brush 12624 (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z7D51Y/).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin on my face, neck, and shoulders are looking much better and I now use both the Clean &amp; Clear and Sea Breeze on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the feel of this product when I&#x27;m washing my face, but after a few days of using this every morning, my skin got very dry and flaky :(( especially on my chin and nose, which are the oiliest parts of my face. I have combination oily skin, so I&#x27;m surprised this dried out my skin. Unless you have VERY oily skin, I don&#x27;t recommend using this everyday, or even buying it at all.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! In only using it for a few days I have noticed my skin clearing up. I have tried many acne washes since I have dealt with acne since middle school &amp; this wash is tough enough yet gentle on my sensitive skin. I would highly recommend this to any teen or adult looking to clear up their face. Oh...&amp; the smell definitely helps to wake me up in the morning :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day since I&#x27;ve gotten it, usually once in the morning and sometimes at night. My skin has been a lot smoother and clearer than usual. I generally don&#x27;t break out that much, but I have annoying breakouts every once in a while and so far I haven&#x27;t had any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema, so I try to avoid cleansers that are too strong, in case it makes my skin even drier, and this face wash does a really good job of allowing my face to keep the essential natural oils without being oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s citrus scented and smells really fresh and appealing.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product.  Just that I bought it for my 11 year old daughter and it is too rough for her young skin.  It has beads in it.  So I use it for my feet.</li>
            <li> I’ve used this facial cleanser for a few years now and I love it. Its citrusy scent is so bright and energizing, it’s the perfect thing to wake up to in the morning. I also like the small beads in the cleanser. They’re not too harsh on my sensitive skin (I have eczema, rosacea, and allergies) and give me just the right amount of exfoliation. I’ve also found that this product is really useful for getting stubborn scents off your hands- namely things like garlic and cigarettes. Not that I’m a smoker, but I’ll smoke occasionally and the scent lingers something awful. This product works much better than traditional hand soap to help get rid of it.</li>
            <li> The product it self is really good.The pump does not work thought</li>
            <li> It is great with pores.</li>
            <li> I know that i am gonna use this, and it is a good deal.  Not only is it better or the same price as I can buy it anywhere else, but it is also deliver to my front door.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for face wash that isn&#x27;t harsh or dries out my skin. when i first started using face cleanser, i bought the dollar general knock off brand of clean and clear because it was cheaper and i didn&#x27;t know where to start. after using the dg brand, i decided to buy the real cleanser and i love it. after exfoliating my face with extra virgin olive oil and sugar, i wash my face with the morning cleanser, towel dry, then apply olay sensitive face lotion to my face.  i only exfoliate 2-3 times a week. my face feels smooth and it glows.</li>
            <li> This product makes you feel awake because of the smell and tinkle when you wash, but it doesn&#x27;t remove your zits. In fact the more I use it, the worse my zits again. I really wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have this product and keep having the same quality, it leaves your skin soft and with a delicious citrus scent.</li>
            <li> It really clean and clear! ha~&lt;br /&gt;These bursting beads make my face feel so cool, I think it more suitable for summer.&lt;br /&gt;In a word : good!</li>
            <li> Smells and works great! You might get a couple beads in your hair but otherwise cleans well and leaves your face tingly. The citrus scent is refreshing and there are Vitamins in here hopefully replenishing the oils that get stripped when washing.</li>
            <li> Morning Burst is exactly what this is .I wash my face when  I wake up &amp; this refreshes me .Love the orange smell - aroma just right. When I wash my face at the end of my day it washes off the make-up on the 1st wash .To be honest , I&#x27;ve tried more expensive high end facial cleansers ,and  I like this 1 the most.</li>
            <li> I have built this in as my standard cleanser for my morning routine. It is actually surprisingly refreshing and I think the ginseng really works wonders with my skin type. I really like how the beads give my face a nice glow after use. Usually I don&#x27;t like scented cleansers but the citrus flavor i just so refreshing I love it. I also like how this product doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin as some cleansers can be very harsh.</li>
            <li> Smells great, first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I used this when I was a teenager to keep my skin clear. I never really had very bad acne, just a few bumps here and there. This really helped keep it under control. Luckily when I reached my early twenties my breakouts became only bothersome once monthly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told my friends who had worse acne to use this and other Clean &amp; Clear products, and believe me, they all thanked me. A friend of mine who had used everything (including Proactiv) had really bad acne which was effecting her self esteem. I made her a gift basket with this, a scrub, toner, and moisturizer. In a few weeks her skin was looking sooo much better. She stopped wearing makeup to let her skin breathe, and the difference was shocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be drying and needs to be followed with a toner (stick to the Clean &amp; Clear line, since all their products are formulated to be used together) and a good night moisturizer. I recommend using a scrub 2-3 times a week too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this, my skin was squeaky clean and I was constantly getting compliments. Now that I&#x27;m older, this is too harsh for me. I switched to Olay once acne was no longer a daily concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are products I recommend using with this cleanser:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BG6KV6U Clean &amp; Clear Oil-Free Dual Action Moisturizer 4 fl oz (120 ml)]] &amp;lt;- for night.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001E96LWW Clean &amp; Clear Morning Glow Moisturizer, SPF-15, 4-Ounce Pump Bottles (Pack of 3)]] &amp;lt;- for day, under makeup or alone&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003BQLAQS Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser Scrub, 5-Ounce Tube (Pack of 2)]] &amp;lt;- AMAZING!

            <li> At first, this smelled kind of like hand soap? I dont know, but I figured out it&#x27;s just the smell. Wet your face, pump twice, and distribute over your face then rinse!! It wakes me up every morning and it&#x27;s really really good! Doesn&#x27;t really smell like citrus, I think it&#x27;s supposed to. Otherwise, great!!</li>
            <li> This is a good face wash if you want a nice crisp feeling when washing your face. It features tiny microbeads that pop and you can feel when washing which is really neat. The scent is refreshing and opens your eyes in the morning. I like to use this more in the summer to keep my face nice and cool when I wash. I often use Aveeno face wash during winter which is a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This product is harsh on the skin.  I stopped using it and my skin is much better.  Will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. Makes my face feel great and clean. The beads feel great and make my skin tingle. I&#x27;ll probably stick with this facial cleanser for a while.</li>
            <li> Just got this product today and really in love with it because it leaves no residue whatsover, unlike the CLinique stull I&#x27;ve been using so yea I would buy this again and again and again.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite cleanser when it comes to my face. I have a lot of acne stemming from anxiety- it&#x27;s not constant but it&#x27;s really annoying. The clean &amp; clear brand has a lot of products, but none have ever done as much for me as the morning burst has. I wash my face once in the morning and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It helps eliminate acne and mild blemishes a lot quicker than other face washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I can&#x27;t carry the face wash with me to work and that&#x27;s where a lot of my anxiety comes from. I work in a consulting firm and I get pressured quite a bit from my colleagues. Sometimes I&#x27;m under extreme deadlines where entire accounts are riding on me, and that&#x27;s when the acne tends to hit me the worst. In those crunch situations, especially when I have to lead or participate in a presentation, I am always worried about my face. I carry a really small bottle of tea-tree oil with me to help curb those problems. Tea tree oil [[ASIN:B00I42CK4A 100% Pure Tea Tree Oil + FREE Acne Fighting Blemish Roll-on Stick with Tea Tree Oil]] is a natural cleanser I can use without water. I just dab the oil and rub it in- it dries relatively quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look or feel to your skin. It helps to clear pores and it really works well for me in those crunch situations where I have about an hour or so to prepare. In less time, I use the blemish stick. It works really well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the three, I&#x27;m able to keep my acne and blemishes in check across all walks of my life. It&#x27;s really been a big help for me in my personal and professional presentation and it&#x27;s given me confidence I wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise had.</li>
            <li> Perfect product you can feel it cleaning your face</li>
            <li> This product gave my daughter who is 12 really dry skin. It did make her awake but we have to always mix it with another cleaner to make her skin not dry so she won&#x27;t break out. Other then the dry skin part it cleans your skin good.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product; I use it everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Before receiving the product, I was afraid the citrus scent would be too overpowering and artificial, like dish soap. Instead, it is soft and light, like something actually meant for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather: Fiscally great; with this product, I can pump a pea-sized amount and it works up into a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After-effect: After drying my face, it doesn&#x27;t feel taut or too dried out. My face feels rejuvenated (especially in the mornings!) and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: The beads really do &amp;#34;burst&amp;#34;-- in other words, they aren&#x27;t little balls of plastic that will ultimately make its way into the ocean. It&#x27;s a feel-good for your conscience.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I use it in the shower. I personally don&#x27;t like to wash my face in the sink because my sink doesn&#x27;t have a large rim so I end up spilling most of the water on my pajamas. Anyways, I love this product because I always feel clean and refreshed after using it. Actually, my bottle is almost running out so I&#x27;d better buy a new one! :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my 60+ face.&lt;br /&gt;I use it at least once a day and it really does the job on my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Especially if I&#x27;ve been eating potato chips, crunchy peanut butter, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Those bursting beads feel like liquid sandpaper, but, much softer of&lt;br /&gt;course and the scent is not cloyingly sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. After using it my skin felt really oily and like it had a layer of film over it, I even rinsed my face off a couple of times. I gave it to my friend and she seems to like it just fine.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it every time I take a shower. It&#x27;s not like the other type of stuff out there where your skin burns. You know the old saying if it burns that means it&#x27;s working. Not so for this stuff. I can feel my whole face tingle and my skin feels awake. It feels really nice. And I feel so clean after using it. I always had a problem with breaking out when Aunt Flo came to visit, or when I was stressed out. But after about 3 weeks of using this I have yet to break out. And I was so happy to hear they had a body wash and different smells. I bought the set. Plus I use Nixon on my hair because of P.C.O.S. It helps with hair lose. All together I love taking a shower lol. Also I would like to recommend the Clean &amp; Clear Morning Glow Moisturizer, SPF-15. After cleaning your face with the morning burst use the morning glow. I promise you that you will love it. The morning glow actually gives you a glow and no oily skin. Its very refreshing. I would like to know if anyone tries these produces together?</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this face wash and felt it did a decent job of cleaning my face. However, I do not feel it is well-suited for dry skin. If you have dry skin, make sure you have a super amazing moisturizer if you&#x27;re going to use this product. Otherwise, you&#x27;re probably better off searching for a more moisturizing facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend with oily skin was alright with it, however. I won&#x27;t fault the product for not working for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It leaves my face super clean and seems to be helping with my mild acne problem.  I only use this once a day and it seems to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I saw a routine of keeping your face hydrated and looking fresh and she started with his product i know they say use cold water it the only part that i find hard to do first thing in the morning is use cold water</li>
            <li> I swear by the clean and clear line...this cleanser has really great little beads that seem to help refresh me in the morning and help with slough factor/getting rid of those pesky dead skin cells...I follow this up with the clean and clear acne control kit in the evening, and the occassional use of the clean and clear astringent in sensitive. I&#x27;ve dealt w/acne for almost 20 years, mild to mid level (not severe or cystic) but in that time, if they make it I&#x27;ve tried it, stridex, clearisil, cetaphil, neutrogena, and yes proactive..of all those proactive was the only one that worked for me but it was too severe/turned my face to a flakey sandpapery mess...so after everyone of these failed attempts, what did i do, went back to clean and clear...yep, you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d learn my lesson...but I keep looking for that miraculous line that will eliminate every one of my blemishes...not gonna happen. So all in all, the clean and clear definitely keeps my skin the MOST blemish free...not perfect...but as close as I&#x27;m going to come apparently. So, that being said, I highly recommend this line/brand!</li>
            <li> works really well, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this and use it daily, after using it my skin feels tight and literally refreshed! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like every other facial cleanser out there, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good at first glance. Then I found a problem of pumper, it s hard to install it correctly, that may be a problem of delivery to cause the unusual problem. After all, the burst beads are great.</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t too effective for me.There wasn&#x27;t that many beads every time I pump it out. I didn&#x27;t feel more awake after washing with it, my face just feels fresh and cool for awhile and smells pretty good which is why I am giving it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I use this facial cleanser in the shower every morning and will continue to buy it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Facial Cleanser was exhilarating. It left my skin feeling clean and fresh. I felt awake and invigorated. Your skin will not feel dried out as with other products such as bar cleansers. I would recommend this to everyone. This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Good for basic face wash. Not really effective for make up removal</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and this Facial Cleanser has been very effective for me. Highly recommended for people with oily skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good item. Cleanses pretty well, though not completly if I&#x27;m wearing makeup. My skin feels nice and cool after using it, particularly around the nose (oiliest) area. I don&#x27;t really notice anything special from the bursting beads, but maybe that&#x27;s just me not paying attention. I don&#x27;t feel anymore \\&quot;woken up\\&quot; from it as I do from any other cleanser. Still, pretty affordable, and lasts a long time, even with using it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution, it can be somewhat drying in the non-very-oily aread of the face, so always remember to moisturize afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, pretty satisfied, and would buy again</li>
            <li> The product itself came fast and well packaged. It is in my opinion a very good product. It smells good, it actually does wake you up when I use it in the morning, and I can see my skin get noticeabley clearer and smoother. The only downside is that it can leave your skin kind of dry after a few minutes after application and cause irritation if you do not use some type of moisturizer after applying it. So just put lotion or something on your skin after use and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> WOW...it really makes your face very clean!  You can feel it in your face as soon as you&#x27;re done.  Makes your face feel cool (temperature-wise) immediately.</li>
            <li> as I put to my roommate &amp;#34;it literally feels like morning burst onto my face.&amp;#34; when you use it, let it sit for about 30 seconds to a minute, and you&#x27;ll feel it work. after you scrub it off, you&#x27;ll feel your face breathe and you&#x27;ll feel like you have a new face. it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
            <li> highly recommended to anyone to purchase. have been using this for the past 3 years and i can surely say it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Finally a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin or make it flaky. Love the refreshing feeling and the smell in the morning.</li>
            <li> I like the facial cleaner. It works well, smells good and is very refreshing. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle product for sensitive skin (like mine). The item is gel-like, so not a lot has to be used to spread over the face.  The slight orange fragrance is awakening.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly! It feels like you are suddenly awake in the morning after using it. I had bad acne before. It didn&#x27;t neccesarily clear it completely but it did help.... A lot!!!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of this and faithfully used it every morning. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 years while I was in college, since I first seen the commercial on tv. It smells great and actually makes me feel more awake when I smell it in the morning. It keeps my brown skin smooth &amp; clear, I hope they never discontinue this product. I havent tried all the scents, because they don&#x27;t smell all that great. I&#x27;ll just stick to the orange bottle. Its actually cheaper on amazon then in stores which are roughly around $6-$9</li>
            <li> This is great! It clears up my face really well and is really gentle of the face. A nice product. Very affordable!</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser because it leaves my face clean but doesn&#x27;t dry it, feels soft and moist.  I have rosacea and it&#x27;s hard to find simple facial cleansers/scrubs that won&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this item and then apply the Clean &amp; Clear Oil Free Shine Control Moisturizer.  It helps out a lot with my combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item was also well packed and did not have any problems between purchasing and shipping.  I hope this review helps out.</li>
            <li> The bursting beads and fresh citrus scent really does wake you up! Great tingling sensation on the skin. Feels great and light and clean. Removes make up well. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I just finished purchasing this item. I had used it before and I love it! It gives you that nice wake me up aroma and burst in the morning. Really cleanses your face very well.</li>
            <li> Title says it all.  Same stuff as in the tube, which is a decent, nice smelling, fairly harsh facial cleanser, just with fewer beads.</li>
            <li> This is a foaming cleanser. That information should be included on the front label of the product. Since I bought this online, i didn&#x27;t know that it was foaming until i had the product in my hands and read the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is this important? Most OTC foaming cleansers contain the ingredient Sodium lauryl sulfate as the foaming agent. I find this ingredient to dry out my skin without fail.  Every foaming cleanser on the market has dried out my skin. My friend and sister have dry skin, and they do fine with this ingredient, and i have oily skin and cannot. I guess everyone&#x27;s skin is different&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not complaining about the ingredient Sodium lauryl sulfate, since some people tolerate it well - in fact, some people can&#x27;t stand to be without it - i am complaining about the lack of information on the front bottle. the fact that a cleanser foams is a crucial piece of information to the consumer; it needs to be mentioned on the front of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros of this cleaner: okay scent (although i now find it really synthetic and not that uplifting at all), contains vitamin c and vitamin e that leaves your skin quite soft and smooth , cleans pretty well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: has Sodium lauryl sulfate and doesn&#x27;t mention it, fragrance is one of the first ingredients, scent is too synthetic</li>
            <li> I love using this stuff every morning when i wake up! makes my face feel clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Smells so good in the morning. Love it and love the price for it. Definitely happy that it&#x27;s cheaper than in stores.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser was pretty okay for my skin but it didn&#x27;t do much for it. I still had pop up pimples and all of that. However, it was very refreshing to use in the morning. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it was terrible but it just wasn&#x27;t amazing. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product really gets me to wake up and leaves a cool feeling on my face. I believe the microbead problem was fixed because when I use the product the beads will rub away as you scrub it into your face and are not plastic.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product but I forgot it in the public restroom and lost it. I would buy it again. Very bubbly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product and it arrived in the specified time, so I recommend it to anyone who knows what they are buying.&lt;br /&gt;thanks God bless</li>
            <li> It helps alot with keeping my face clean, very refreshing and its also helping reduce acne just by cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the few bucks!</li>
            <li> This works well to keep my face clean without drying out my skin.  I appreciate the grits in it that help exfoliate.</li>
            <li> good clean but too dry</li>
            <li> gives you a clean, energized feeling after use.  love this product and will be ordering again.  one pump is enough to do the job so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a very long time. I have very oily skin and it worked really well to dry up my acne. But it did leave my face very very dry after about a week of using it. Make sure that you also apply a good moisturizer with after you wash with this. I do like the pump a lot! I think more products should have a pump. I will be using this again.</li>
            <li> I always use this stuff and I really like it.  In addition this stuff really wakes me up in the morning as well.</li>
            <li> The top shipped from Amazon broken - not simply disconnected. The product itself does resonate ginseng, until you use a quarter of the supply (with three-quarters of the product remaining).</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling fresh after each use, especially with the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; feeling it leaves. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry after using it, and it has a great scent as well. I would most certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for more than a year or so and it works great. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a amazing product! I use it every morning and i can say this worked amazing for my acne! no products worked for me but this stuff is A.W.E.S.O.M.E :)</li>
            <li> I give 5 star even though I haven&#x27;t started-:)</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it every morning and every night and it makes my face feel fresh.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells good!&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s also helping with my acne, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;Morning Burst,&amp;#34; but it seems to work fine as a facial cleanser. I use it with my Clarisonic. Not a miracle, by any means, but it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much and it foams up nicely.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great seller.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and it  actually  wakes you up. It is so gentle but also strong on acne. I have really enjoyed the scent too. This is over all a great product :)</li>
            <li> 5 stars!! Great product..very suggested if you want to take care of your skin properly. It works much much better then others more expensive and famous brands..</li>
            <li> Really gets your face clean. After a day of sweating this stuff strips all the oil and nastiness right off but doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s over drying or anything. I use this every time I shower. The whole morning burst thing is a bit silly, I don&#x27;t feel the beads do a blessed thing or get any tingling but if it&#x27;s oil you&#x27;re after then this is your product.</li>
            <li> This face wash leaves you feeling clean and it is very thick and has a soap feel to it but it leaves the skin dry, it&#x27;s good to use but I&#x27;d recommend following it up with a gentle face lotion, but I do like the fact that it is oil-free which is awesome but that has its downfall of leaving your face a little bit dry, but not so much so that I wouldn&#x27;t use it, I like it:)</li>
            <li> i use this most days. and i used this before, just bought it online because it was easy and i have prime. thanks!</li>
            <li> This face soap is great! The vitamin C really makes your face wake up and feel fresh. I buy it on the subscribe and save program and its less than $5! Can&#x27;t beat that deal! It seems to help control the oil on my face and smells great too.</li>
            <li> I use this face wash every morning, It&#x27;s awesome and it really works but it dries my face up and i have to use lotion to make it better. besides that i love this</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is awesome. It will literally wake you up in the morning and it has an awesome fresh smell to it that will leave the skin of your face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> It removes oil and leaves skin soft.  I will definitely buy it here again. Thank you Amazon.  It&#x27;s easier to buy here rather than go to the drugstore.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders.  I use it every morning when I wake up.  It helps to keep me awake, and it helps keep your skin clear.</li>
