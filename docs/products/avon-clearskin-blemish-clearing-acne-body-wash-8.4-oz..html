    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>My daughter is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>You just gotta try it out to see what works best for you, but in my experience this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li>Was nice on my skin but the smell wasn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Neutrogena body wash, and I haven&#x27;t had as good results as I&#x27;ve had with this product.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li>Plus it has a nice, refreshing scent.  </li>
            <li>What more do you want?</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Then, a couple more weeks passed and I saw more improvement.</li>
            <li>Love Avon products and</li>
            <li>this is a favorite for my teenagers.</li>
            <li>but I havnt had any more.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I surprised at how good the smell was.</li>
            <li>This cleared them up quickly and is helping to keep them away!</li>
            <li>It works and it&#x27;s dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a few days and the results are OUTSTANDING!!!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more based on the reviews, but after using it consistently for three weeks, I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li>I still get the stray blemish here and there, nothing&#x27;s perfect, but I have had very few blemishes since using this stuff.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this before something more expensive and I&#x27;m so happy I did!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers but it doesn&#x27;t leave a scent on your skin really and its not nearly as bad as some of the \\&quot;skin clearing\\&quot; tea tree washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have used so many products to help my body acne that I have, and I finally found something that works!</li>
            <li>When it arrived the first thing I did was take a shower.</li>
            <li>Of course, no one&#x27;s exactly alike.</li>
            <li>I have always had breakouts on my arms, chest, and back and have used so many products with no results.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash for my shoulders and back.</li>
            <li>so maybe this just isn&#x27;t strong enough</li>
            <li>This really worked for me,</li>
            <li>Really helped with my chest acne.</li>
            <li>you can also cut it with some dial antibacterial soap if you really can&#x27;t stand the smell my mom does that with it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This product really cleared up my break outs.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I usually never review products.</li>
            <li>my arms and back/shoulders are completely clear.</li>
            <li>I work out a lot and my skin is so sensitive to anything, including make up and sweat.  </li>
            <li>Not only is my skin sensitive and acne proned</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have major acne on my arms/back, but it was enough to make me want to get something to fix it.</li>

            <li> but I also work in a hot restaurant which makes it hard to keep breakouts under control.</li>
            <li> and I actually wanted the skin in that area to be dry but no improvement after about a month.  </li>
            <li> This body wash has absolutely no effect - it&#x27;s like washing with water.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is simple and plain and that&#x27;s probably why it works so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m wondering what smells so bad about it because to me it smells fine.</li>
            <li> A few people were complaining about the smell on other reviews, but it&#x27;s hypoallergenic</li>
            <li> If I could give it less than one star, I would.  </li>
            <li> If you want something that smells like peaches and rainbows, go buy some fruity neutrogena crap from Walmart that doesn&#x27;t work because it has too many fragrances in it that can further irritate your skin and make your acne even worse.</li>
            <li> After just a few times of using it, my pimples have went away or dried up within that day of using this product.</li>
            <li> Using it on your face will dry the absolute crap out of your skin.</li>
            <li> My husband is a chef he gets horrible heat rashes from sweating so much in the kitchen this cleared that up in 2 weeks and keeps his skin clear.</li>
            <li> I am going a different route and am not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> i bought this for when I break out with body acne after a hard day of work sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad acne on my chest and back</li>
            <li> I have acne on my chest and back and it was getting so bad</li>
            <li> The smell of this product was so horrible that I only used it a few times before throwing it out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a ton of extra foo foo crap in it to make it appeal to teenagers and princesses.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> And it does NOT smell bad...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was nice on my skin but the smell wasn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> I have used so many products to help my body acne that I have, and I finally found something that works! I usually never review products. But I will be buying this product again! After just a few times of using it, my pimples have went away or dried up within that day of using this product. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have major acne on my arms/back, but it was enough to make me want to get something to fix it. This really worked for me, my arms and back/shoulders are completely clear. A few people were complaining about the smell on other reviews, but it&#x27;s hypoallergenic so they don&#x27;t add scents. That&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Neutrogena body wash, and I haven&#x27;t had as good results as I&#x27;ve had with this product.  Plus it has a nice, refreshing scent.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference at all. I have really bad acne on my chest and back so maybe this just isn&#x27;t strong enough</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t help my skin at all.</li>
            <li> i bought this for when I break out with body acne after a hard day of work sometimes.  I have not noticed any type of improvement and I actually wanted the skin in that area to be dry but no improvement after about a month.  I am going a different route and am not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> It works and it&#x27;s dirt cheap. Really helped with my chest acne. What more do you want?</li>
            <li> Both my husband and i started using this about a month ago and both our skin has totally cleared up. I have always had oily blemished skin and have never found a product that works this does! My husband is a chef he gets horrible heat rashes from sweating so much in the kitchen this cleared that up in 2 weeks and keeps his skin clear. It doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers but it doesn&#x27;t leave a scent on your skin really and its not nearly as bad as some of the \\&quot;skin clearing\\&quot; tea tree washes I&#x27;ve used. you can also cut it with some dial antibacterial soap if you really can&#x27;t stand the smell my mom does that with it and she says it works just the same.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a blemish since I started using this product a couple weeks ago. Highly recommended! Works great! Will buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li> Useless. If I could give it less than one star, I would.  This body wash has absolutely no effect - it&#x27;s like washing with water.  I was hoping for more based on the reviews, but after using it consistently for three weeks, I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a while now and I absolutely love it. I had tried a bunch of stuff before I tried this and none of it worked. I have acne on my chest and back and it was getting so bad I thought I&#x27;d have it forever. Finally, my mother found this on Avon&#x27;s website and we bought it on a whim. When it arrived the first thing I did was take a shower. To be honest, I surprised at how good the smell was. I&#x27;ve read the other reviews and I&#x27;m wondering what smells so bad about it because to me it smells fine. It smells like soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of using this I noticed improvement on my skin. The blemishes were smaller and my skin looked healthier. Then, a couple more weeks passed and I saw more improvement. I still get the stray blemish here and there, nothing&#x27;s perfect, but I have had very few blemishes since using this stuff. Of course, no one&#x27;s exactly alike. You just gotta try it out to see what works best for you, but in my experience this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Love Avon products and this is a favorite for my teenagers. Came on time and is just what we wanted.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product was so horrible that I only used it a few times before throwing it out. It may work for acne eventually, but I&#x27;ll find a different method.</li>
            <li> I have always had breakouts on my arms, chest, and back and have used so many products with no results. I decided to try this before something more expensive and I&#x27;m so happy I did! Not only is my skin sensitive and acne proned but I also work in a hot restaurant which makes it hard to keep breakouts under control. I have used this product for a few days and the results are OUTSTANDING!!! Not only did my breakouts disappear but I havnt had any more. I&#x27;m recommending this acne wash to everyone!</li>
            <li> I work out a lot and my skin is so sensitive to anything, including make up and sweat.  I have been breaking out on my back, stomach and arms from sweating.  This product really cleared up my break outs.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews and decided to try this for myself. Since I have joined the gym I was beginning to get breakouts. This cleared them up quickly and is helping to keep them away!</li>
            <li> My daughter has acne on her chest and back, but she also has eczema. This cleanser seems to be working well on the breakouts, and, after 2 weeks, hasn&#x27;t caused an eczema flare. My daughter is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash for my shoulders and back. Cleared up my skin nicely without drying everything out like crazy.</li>
            <li> This body wash works wonders. And it does NOT smell bad... it just doesn&#x27;t smell like anything which may throw some people off. If you want something that smells like peaches and rainbows, go buy some fruity neutrogena crap from Walmart that doesn&#x27;t work because it has too many fragrances in it that can further irritate your skin and make your acne even worse. This stuff is simple and plain and that&#x27;s probably why it works so well. It doesn&#x27;t have a ton of extra foo foo crap in it to make it appeal to teenagers and princesses. It&#x27;s basic. It works. I will continue to buy it. Also, DO NOT use it on your face... It is made specifically for the body and is stronger to penetrate and heal the thicker epidermis on your back. Using it on your face will dry the absolute crap out of your skin.</li>
