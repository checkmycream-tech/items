            <li>I love how rich it is</li>

            <li>Smells amazing and adds a subtle but beautiful shimmer to my skin!</li>
            <li>It has a mild but enjoyable fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and a just a touch of a shimmer.</li>
            <li>Light moisturizer with just a hint of shimmer...</li>
            <li>Silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Smelled so good , so soft</li>
            <li>Wonderful amount of shimmer - more of a glisten than a glitter, for a subtle glow.</li>
            <li>I love the hempz products especially the body butters and souffle, it is one of the best body butter products texture wise, that it have tried.highly recommend especially if u suffer with dry skin</li>
            <li>: 6/4/2014 Love this so much</li>
            <li>My husband and I are religious users of their &amp;#34;Original Herbal Body Moisturizer.&amp;#34; I sampled the coconut souffle at a salon and loved the shimmering effect and enticing smell.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft</li>
            <li>I love this product so much I bought two.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will absolutely purchase this again and would encourage anyone looking for a rich, non-greasy cream to give it a try!  </li>
            <li>It did seem more oily than the other but pretty good all and all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sparkly in a very pretty way...</li>
            <li>Well worth every sweet smelling scent :</li>
            <li>surprised by the &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34;,  love the smooth consistency, nice low -level fragrance.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it in the winter or fall because the smell is distinctly summer</li>
            <li>Scent is always fresh, lotions are always easily absorbed and non greasy.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of shimmer, smells DELISCIOUS.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised, this creamy, rich souffle delivers!  </li>
            <li>Not much shimmer, but effective</li>
            <li>This adds a really pretty sparkle anywhere you want it.</li>
            <li>I figured I would give this a try first.</li>
            <li>I love it especially going in to spring/summer.</li>
            <li>Complete moisture with unique and alluring smell.  </li>
            <li>Better then lotion for dry skin during these winter months.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think about it at the time, but I am going to return it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the shimmer but be careful.</li>
            <li>This smells really nice and tropical and has a very low key shimmer to it.</li>
            <li>It is a good thick body cream with allot of shimmerl/glitter.</li>
            <li>I also love the scent, it&#x27;s not  real strong especially when it gets hot this summer.  </li>
            <li>I expected a lightly scented lotion.</li>
            <li>I go through a lot of lotion, and am pretty particular about what I use, but Hempz brand satifies my various needs again and again!</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and tried many different body lotions.</li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy it again, and much cheaper than buying at my tanning salon.</li>
            <li>but it definitely provides enough moisture to be effective year round.</li>
            <li>The sheen is subtle yet lasts for many hours.</li>
            <li>I bought the same product from a local tanning place and it was twice as much.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday right out of the shower and mix it with organic coconut oil</li>

            <li> I put a little on the back of my hand and it left residue, which the same product bought elsewhere did not.</li>
            <li> the fragrance didn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality product for moisturizing and has lots of shimmer, wear all daty long.</li>
            <li> Never greasy, definitely heavier than the other Hempz lotions</li>
            <li> The scent of coconut with a subtle shimmer makes this my new fav.</li>
            <li> I bought this Souffle blindly, thinking it might be a fun &amp;#34;try out.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> and I guess it is my fault for not really reading it.</li>
            <li> First tried this product at my hair salon...  too expensive there...  </li>
            <li> Love the fragrance but disappointed in the lack of &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> But within the month I have had this item the oil that&#x27;s in it is separating from the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> If I am wearing black my clothes gets glittery.  </li>
            <li> AS I have said in previous Hempz purchases their products are always as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a slight shimmer on your skin.</li>
            <li> I think the small pieces of glitter can actually get trapped in your pores as weird as that sounds.</li>
            <li> Delicately scented and not at all overpowering, and soaks into my skin without feeling greasy or slimy.</li>
            <li> but there is nothing subtle about the glitter/shimmer so unless your stage name is and Jasmine keep the shimmer factor in mind</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse and my hands take a beating being washed hundreds of times, wearing gloves and now dealing with the bitter cold of winter.  </li>
            <li> Its very thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really thought the smell of it was awful too.</li>
            <li> Subtle shimmer!</li>
            <li> and I feel at my age it looks silly.</li>
            <li> Blah. :(</li>
            <li> I HATE THE SHIMMER</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like glitter and very annoying.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is literally the smelliest stuff I&#x27;ve ever encountered. I guess because it&#x27;s coconut I expected a lightly scented lotion. No. It was so potent I had to go wash it off. And it isn&#x27;t shimmery at all. Blah. :(</li>
            <li> Not much shimmer, but effective</li>
            <li> This adds a really pretty sparkle anywhere you want it. It&#x27;s not GLITTERY...it&#x27;s sparkly in a very pretty way...I use it on my face, chest, arms and legs. In the sun it looks so lovely</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance. It&#x27;s smooth and a just a touch of a shimmer. Perfect.</li>
            <li> This body soufflé is perfect for any occasion. The scent of coconut with a subtle shimmer makes this my new fav.</li>
            <li> This smells really nice and tropical and has a very low key shimmer to it.</li>
            <li> Like a combination between just left a tanning salon and the beach.  YUM!</li>
            <li> Yes this Lotion smells great and moisturizes but there is nothing subtle about the glitter/shimmer so unless your stage name is and Jasmine keep the shimmer factor in mind</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the info when I purchased this item. It has an almost glittery look to it and I feel at my age it looks silly. I gave it to my daughter to use. She says it&#x27;s ok but she wouldn&#x27;t purchase it because of the shine.</li>
            <li> Love it will buy it again</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing. The sheen is subtle yet lasts for many hours. I wouldn&#x27;t use it in the winter or fall because the smell is distinctly summer but it definitely provides enough moisture to be effective year round.</li>
            <li> Smells good haven&#x27;t tried yet</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It works so well - best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Smells amazing and adds a subtle but beautiful shimmer to my skin!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Complete moisture with unique and alluring smell.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> First tried this product at my hair salon...  too expensive there...  surprised by the &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34;,  love the smooth consistency, nice low -level fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Subtle shimmer!</li>
            <li> the fragrance didn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and tried many different body lotions. I was going to get The \\&quot;Josie Maran\\&quot; argon oil body souffl&amp;eacute;. It was quite pricey. I figured I would give this a try first. I love the shimmer. Its not too crazy but enough to give my skin a nice glow. I love it especially going in to spring/summer. Its very thick and moisturizing. The coconut smell is so good.&lt;br /&gt;Update: 6/4/2014 Love this so much I&#x27;m ordering it again. Love the shimmer on my skin</li>
            <li> Love it! Light moisturizer with just a hint of shimmer...</li>
            <li> It smells AMAZING gives off a perfect shimmer and moisture. I use it everyday right out of the shower and mix it with organic coconut oil so I can make it last longer. I&#x27;m in love with it and have got all my friends hooked. I&#x27;m buying more!!!</li>
            <li> This is delicious stuff (no, I didn&#x27;t literally eat it but it smells like I could)!  I bought this Souffle blindly, thinking it might be a fun &amp;#34;try out.&amp;#34;  Pleasantly surprised, this creamy, rich souffle delivers!  Never greasy, definitely heavier than the other Hempz lotions but that was what I shopped for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely purchase this again and would encourage anyone looking for a rich, non-greasy cream to give it a try!  FIVE Stars!!</li>
            <li> I like the shimmer BUT it get&#x27;s everywhere!  If I am wearing black my clothes gets glittery.  I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase.  It smells like pineapple punch?</li>
            <li> It is a good thick body cream with allot of shimmerl/glitter. The value for the price is just ok. I still prefer tge larger bottles like the pomegranate by Hempz.</li>
            <li> Shimmery the following day!! Great smell and feel</li>
            <li> Hempz products are simply amazing. My husband and I are religious users of their &amp;#34;Original Herbal Body Moisturizer.&amp;#34; I sampled the coconut souffle at a salon and loved the shimmering effect and enticing smell. Amazon.com was about $5 cheaper than I have seen it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I love this shimmering souffl&amp;eacute;.  It gives your legs a wonderful glow now that its short season.  I have already ordered two more.  I also love the scent, it&#x27;s not  real strong especially when it gets hot this summer.  I would definitely recommend this if you like a product that gives you a glow and has some shimmer.</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> bought for my mister, didn&#x27;t realize it was shimmering ...his loss my gain..i love this stuff :)</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. Smells good, absorbs fast. Nice and soft</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read this product over well before I bought it. I didn&#x27;t know it would &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34;. But I don&#x27;t even care, because this stuff smells like HEAVEN. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> So good. I love this product. So soft. Smells awesome. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Mine also arrived open. I didn&#x27;t really think about it at the time, but I am going to return it. I really thought the smell of it was awful too.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance but disappointed in the lack of &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Smelled so good , so soft</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the shimmer but be careful. I think the small pieces of glitter can actually get trapped in your pores as weird as that sounds. My mom and I both used it and kept feeling like there was something in our skin akin to the stinger from a bug or a splinter but it didn&#x27;t hurt, just itched.</li>
            <li> I love how rich it is and I love the smell. Just be prepared to be as shimmery as a stripper. Next time, I&#x27;ll probably order something with no glitter.</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my home. could not be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> maybe I should give this more stars. the lotion itself has a nice feel to it and I guess it is my fault for not really reading it. I HATE THE SHIMMER it&#x27;s like glitter and very annoying. I use it on my legs at night so I don&#x27;t have to deal with the annoying glitter lol</li>
            <li> LOVE....LOVE ....LOVE THIS STUFF IT IS AWSOME....</li>
            <li> Love love love this lotion, my fav. Well worth every sweet smelling scent :0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality product for moisturizing and has lots of shimmer, wear all daty long. Glow in sun or shine at the club.</li>
            <li> LOVE this Hempz coconut fusion cream!  I&#x27;m a nurse and my hands take a beating being washed hundreds of times, wearing gloves and now dealing with the bitter cold of winter.  I forgot to use this cream for two shifts and BAM my knuckles were open again.  I&#x27;m back to buy a second bottle and one for my daughter in low.  OH and the smell is terrific!</li>
            <li> When I received my order, I opened up the lid to find that the contents were not sealed in any way, aside from the screw on cap. I put a little on the back of my hand and it left residue, which the same product bought elsewhere did not. That squicked me out enough to throw the entire thing away.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product! But within the month I have had this item the oil that&#x27;s in it is separating from the other ingredients. I have a friend who has the same product but hers is not separating like mine.</li>
            <li> Loved the body butter....I just didn&#x27;t read that it was shimmering.  I could do without that.</li>
            <li> FACE FEELS REFRESH INSTANTLY</li>
            <li> AS I have said in previous Hempz purchases their products are always as advertised.  Scent is always fresh, lotions are always easily absorbed and non greasy.</li>
            <li> What a treat after a shower!  Hempz moisturizer with just a hint of sparkle left on my skin.</li>
            <li> I like how this product sparkles on my skin and stayes that way all day. It has a mild but enjoyable fragrance.</li>
            <li> This was just what I thought it would be. I bought the same product from a local tanning place and it was twice as much. It did seem more oily than the other but pretty good all and all.</li>
            <li> Better then lotion for dry skin during these winter months. Smells wonderful. Leaves a slight shimmer on your skin. I love this product so much I bought two.  I don&#x27;t ever want to run out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Very smooth when rubbed in. The shimmer last all day.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth skin. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I love the hempz products especially the body butters and souffle, it is one of the best body butter products texture wise, that it have tried.highly recommend especially if u suffer with dry skin</li>
            <li> I love HEMPZ products.  HEMPZ Coconut Fusion is a great moisturizer and the scent reminds me of spring while keeping my skin soft, smooth, and shimmery.  My Valentine&#x27;s Day present to myself!</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of shimmer, smells DELISCIOUS. Would definitely buy it again, and much cheaper than buying at my tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Wonderful amount of shimmer - more of a glisten than a glitter, for a subtle glow. Delicately scented and not at all overpowering, and soaks into my skin without feeling greasy or slimy. I go through a lot of lotion, and am pretty particular about what I use, but Hempz brand satifies my various needs again and again!</li>
