            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be used on your top or bottom waterlines.</li>
            <li>I wear makeup most days.</li>
            <li>Yes, its more money</li>
            <li>but it is so much better than whatever this stuff is</li>
            <li>This product is so cheap and it works amazing</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Will have to do more research on it before I reorder though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly my favorite eyeliner</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Are you trying to find a cheap , good working eyeliner thats easy to easy ?</li>
            <li>Goes on super smooth, dries fast, perfect for wings.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for the price, took forever to ship.</li>
            <li>Wait was longer than anticipated but we&#x27;ll worth the wait for the price!!</li>
            <li>It applies easily and is smudge free (yay!), but it cracks</li>
            <li>Shipped sooner than expected and is an awesome product!</li>
            <li>It is very flaky and does not look good</li>
            <li>I tried it on my hand first and what surprised at how great the quality was nice smooth line easy to get a nice fine point on a wing.</li>
            <li>I love how it glides on smoothly and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>I do notice that it doesn&#x27;t smear as much as other liners I have used before (I have oily skin around the eyes), so I am very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Wipes off easily and it has a foam tip.</li>
            <li>But overall a great product and for so cheap!</li>
            <li>So easy to apply,  Water proof , No  smudges, and</li>
            <li>it goes on so easy</li>
            <li>It came of easy with baby wipe</li>
            <li>Has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for people that are just getting into makeup or are looking for a good felt tip eyeliner.</li>
            <li>This was an amazing product for the first.. 5 uses?</li>
            <li>so this is perfect for someone thats able to use it on my upper eye lid because i cant seem to apply it very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with how it doesn&#x27;t run down my face at all.</li>
            <li>It glides on easy and smooth and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to do and I love how smooth it is on my eyes.</li>
            <li>It can make a very precise line, but the color fades very quickly, within the first couple minutes of application.</li>
            <li>I figured it was a cheap price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap and works so well.</li>
            <li>But overall, it looks great 😊</li>
            <li>It was cheap and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Gave me the perfect wing and wasn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li>This is essentially a marker which works great.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Should never ever trust cheap brand like this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand before, but I decided to buy it to make the minimum free shipping requirement.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Let that kitty 🐱 come out to play with this beautifully packages long wearing eye liner today.</li>
            <li>Ive used manyyyy liquid eyeliners and different brands.. and for this price, its really good. :)</li>
            <li>i think its my new favorite !</li>
            <li>Great for that cat eye look, it truly lasts I prefer this a million over the more popular brands  e.l.f waterproof eyeliner or maybeline&#x27;s, wet and wild, revlon&#x27;s or loreal&#x27;s &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; eyeliners&lt;br /&gt;Truly</li>
            <li>It is not waterproof and it smudges quite easily, but it was only two or three dollars, which is good for the price.</li>
            <li>This is very easy to apply and very easy to remove from skin, as it simply crumbles away when you rub your eyes with or without water.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>and although I may need to wait forever before getting it, it&#x27;s all worth it once it hits your mailbox!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I use it over my pencil liner or gel liner to clean up the edges and make it darker.</li>
            <li>Great for the price, easy to apply, stays on and goes on dark.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed when I tested this out because this stays on pretty well and glides easily on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect that much because the price was so low, but I received this early (which is never a bad thing) and the quality is super good!</li>
            <li>Full coverage all day.</li>
            <li>It works well and true to color.</li>
            <li>Its not bad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, it is totally water proof and is so cheap with free shipping!</li>
            <li>4 star mainly because tho I love this</li>
            <li>The color is super pigmented but it dries fast😒</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent liner though, but I wouldn&#x27;t wait three weeks for it to ship again when there are better products in the US.</li>
            <li>however it ran out kinda quickly</li>
            <li>The color is super pigmented and darker</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than some of the high end eyeliner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It stays on pretty well, and goes on somewhat smooth, but it&#x27;s what I would expect for a $3 eyeliner.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SUPER CHEAP TOO JUST FANTASTIC QUALITY FOR THE PRICE HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>New favorite.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a cheap kind, it stays on all day long</li>
            <li>Came earlier, and works pretty good</li>
            <li>Really good eyeliner pen love it but hard to do winged eyeliner</li>
            <li>Took forever to come but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different liquid pen liners from drug store to name brand and this one is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Its definitely not water proof and kind of rubs off,  </li>
            <li>For the price I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>and it lasts all day and for the price it was so worth buying</li>
            <li>Stays on all day and has a nice finish..doesn&#x27;t flake when putting on the second coat.</li>
            <li>Worth the price though I would say.</li>
            <li>anyhow, right out the mail.</li>
            <li>but it just didn&#x27;t look right to me</li>
            <li>Super amazing eyeliner that dries fast, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and will last all day.</li>
            <li>The color is nice and dark and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Smoky grey would be nice, too.</li>
            <li>Works super good, stays on at least a full 12 hrs</li>
            <li>I have recently reordered the product because I liked it so much</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and super waterproof.</li>
            <li>I actually just bought this item because it was a great price, I didn&#x27;t except it to actually work as well as it did.</li>
            <li>Second day using it, so far so good</li>
            <li>Goes on clean and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>If you love smooth, clean and easy to remove waterproof eyeliner, but don&#x27;t love how expensive it is, buy this pen!</li>
            <li>It IS waterproof, and very very durable.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s obvious and looks very cheap, I brought it to work and was doing my makeup in the car ad used this.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and stays put a long time.</li>
            <li>Very easy to handle, precise tip, and although others have mentioned an unattractive smell I haven&#x27;t noticed anything like that while applying it nor after it has dried.</li>
            <li>i cant even explain its like a sharpie of somewhat lol its hard to explain</li>
            <li>and it was really hot and humid</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, just as I expected.</li>
            <li>Love the price and will definitely be a regular customer!</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>Kinda like a big super fine sharpie.  </li>
            <li>This is the first liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve used and it has made me a fan.</li>
            <li>This is exactly like using a marker to do your liner.</li>
            <li>Everyone said in their reviews that it smells funny.</li>
            <li>All liquid liner smells funny, so don&#x27;t let that deter you from considering it.</li>
            <li>and I have very oily lids!</li>
            <li>Also, if you have a good amount of eyeshadow on, of course you&#x27;re going to have to sweep this one a few times to get over all that pigment.</li>
            <li>Idk what is up with all the peeps saying it dries out so fast or didn&#x27;t work or cracked right off the bat</li>
            <li>Shipping was decent, and well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>very pleased, came faster then expected, no runny, easy to apply, and lasts for long days</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing lots of Eyeliner lately to find one I love and this one rates at the top of my list.  </li>
            <li>It stayed on through a good few tears after stubbing my toe and then losing my whole nail.</li>
            <li>The only good things about it is that it is 100% waterproof and a very nice dark shade of black.</li>
            <li>Comes off pretty easy, similiar to a permanent marker actually.</li>
            <li>Was very liquidy at first</li>
            <li>It is a nice dark color</li>
            <li>its gos on a little more thick  than I.wanted but still works good!</li>
            <li>It does come off easily but only when you want it to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply but you have to apply constantly throughout the day for it to stay.</li>
            <li>Definitely waterproof and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It works just as good if not better than the high priced department store brands!</li>
            <li>Then smudged, smeared, washed dishes, played with bubbles with baby, etc....by the end of the day, and the next morning, the lines were as strong as they were when I drew them on.</li>
            <li>This is a great eyeliner pen with a slightly thicker tip for more dramatic looks, although a skilled applier of makeup can easily create fine and delicate lines as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great back-up or purse pen for touch-ups on the go!</li>
            <li>This guy was much easier but still took a couple times to get used to.</li>
            <li>im really picky with my eyeliners</li>
            <li>It works really well for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very reliable.</li>
            <li>and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>If you can apply eyeliner with a pencil, you can apply this, and it&#x27;s so much easier to fill in the lash line with liquid liner than it is to fill it in with pencil.</li>
            <li>Shipped much faster than promised.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this eyeliner</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really close to drying out</li>
            <li>Very bummed out.</li>
            <li>but the pencil is much easier and dont get in your eye.</li>
            <li>very goood</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>This is a very opaque product.</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t really notice unless you were looking for it</li>
            <li>Its also very waterproof and doesn&#x27;t smudge at all-</li>
            <li>Goes on well, very opaic.</li>
            <li>I have eye liner that isn&#x27;t water proof but because I dont really wear makeup alot</li>
            <li>can take it of when im ready.</li>
            <li>Applies easily Just wish it was much blacker because I&#x27;m dark skinned More than likely</li>
            <li>It was nicely wrapped in bubble wrap, and then the actual item was covered in a tight plastic that needed to be peeled off before being able to open it.</li>
            <li>The color is very black which I love, easy application, and it actually stays on disappearing or without smudging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and comes out pretty dark.</li>
            <li>it was good but just not good quality</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if that affect the wear of this product, but it was really nice.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s full of pigment and dries almost instantly</li>
            <li>The pen has great color and is extremely good/versatile but my only complaint is that when it got here, the top part of the pen was snapped off for some reason.</li>
            <li>so I put on a fair amount and only a little came off where my eye kinda waters a lot throughout the night.  </li>
            <li>but it clumps easily and is harder to put on.</li>
            <li>black eyeliner goes on easy and smooth and last four hours.</li>
            <li>It glides on so smooth an once its dry</li>
            <li>The very end of the tip is super small which can give you elaborate details if you wanted to do something extra.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying a few more.</li>
            <li>Dried out after two days, with the top on.</li>
            <li>Has a strong smell that I don&#x27;t really like but the smell goes away once its dried.</li>
            <li>Tip also a bit more stiff than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it comes off pretty easily but other then that it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>im new to make up</li>
            <li>I am new to liquid eyeliner bc</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and it still works like new.</li>
            <li>but, dry out quick</li>
            <li>If you are really good with liner you might like this but for me it is just to difficult and messes up my whole eye if I have to remove it.</li>
            <li>it does dry quick</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews on this product and for the price I had to try it and was very surprised.  </li>
            <li>The cap sometimes doesn&#x27;t go on all the way, so make sure you push it all the way down!!</li>
            <li>Dried out pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>Super pigmented and stays on ALL DAY LONG!!</li>
            <li>I will buy more of this, no more drug store eyeliner that cost $10 a tube &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>my only problem is that it isn&#x27;t fully opaque when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>It is very dark and easy too apply.  </li>
            <li>Tested on my hand after it dried and it was easily wiped away with a damp washrag.</li>
            <li>It stings a little as it goes on, but once it dries, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It feathers off with no mess!</li>
            <li>I used it on my eyes the next day to tight line the top</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, stays in place, and comes off with a little makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Love this pen, its crazy bold!</li>
            <li>Its not long lasting, I only would use it for practice then use the expensive stuff that GREAT !</li>
            <li>So far I like it,</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying this eyeliner since 2015 and I absolutely can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li>It literally comes completely off just with water.</li>
            <li>The liner has a felt tip , much like similar liners that look like this.</li>
            <li>Wow this silvercell  </li>
            <li>I was surprised it arrived early, so I opened and try to use it</li>
            <li>it makes the line super defined and last a long time.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t know is whether this is from China or other countries like China, so I don&#x27;t know how safe it is to use on a daily basis or whether they use animal testing, etc.</li>
            <li>The tip is very thin and good for details and lines.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, the only downside is, it doesn&#x27;t really work with shimmery/metallic eyeshadow unless you absolutely have primer on, otherwise it mixes and makes the black look dull.</li>
            <li>The only negative I have is that it&#x27;s hard to open but other than that I am really happy :)</li>
            <li>First of all, props for actually receiving this item, and getting it before the estimated delivery day (almost three weeks earlier!</li>
            <li>First of all... I&#x27;ve used many expensive sephora brands eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Okay eyeliner for the price and for just throw around makeup, but not good if you are looking for a professional look</li>
            <li>The tip is very pointed so it&#x27;s easy to get a thin line.  </li>
            <li>Very dark, true liner.  </li>
            <li>It dry&#x27;s quickly and lasts long.</li>
            <li>Love the application but looks very dry and harsh after a couple hours.</li>
            <li>It tends to dry out really fast 😞</li>
            <li>Its does dry fast and  dosnt smear</li>
            <li>but you can still easily make thick lines.</li>
            <li>so im not careful</li>
            <li>Shipping took forever and the lettering on the tube is super crooked and some letters re missing.</li>
            <li>so you have to be careful and only use the very tip</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this item again from the seller in the near future.</li>
            <li>Seem as though the first time I used it,  I dried out</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this, just go buy the higher quality stuff.</li>
            <li>It is very dark and easy to mess it up.</li>
            <li>This is NOT waterproof and seems to dry out completely after only a couple uses !</li>
            <li>Fine tip for thin lines, thicker part f</li>
            <li>Actually, it&#x27;s cut my eye liner fails to nearly zero and is sooooooo easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Then when I passed out from the pain, the next day the eyeliner was still there (seriously though, true story.)</li>

            <li> but it works good</li>

            <li> Goes on super smooth, dries fast, perfect for wings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price, took forever to ship.</li>
            <li> Wait was longer than anticipated but we&#x27;ll worth the wait for the price!!</li>
            <li> It applies easily and is smudge free (yay!), but it cracks</li>
            <li> Shipped sooner than expected and is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> It is very flaky and does not look good</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hand first and what surprised at how great the quality was nice smooth line easy to get a nice fine point on a wing.</li>
            <li> I love how it glides on smoothly and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I do notice that it doesn&#x27;t smear as much as other liners I have used before (I have oily skin around the eyes), so I am very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Wipes off easily and it has a foam tip.</li>

            <li> It came of easy with baby wipe</li>
            <li> Has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for people that are just getting into makeup or are looking for a good felt tip eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This was an amazing product for the first.. 5 uses?</li>
            <li> so this is perfect for someone thats able to use it on my upper eye lid because i cant seem to apply it very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with how it doesn&#x27;t run down my face at all.</li>
            <li> It glides on easy and smooth and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to do and I love how smooth it is on my eyes.</li>
            <li> It can make a very precise line, but the color fades very quickly, within the first couple minutes of application.</li>
            <li> I figured it was a cheap price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap and works so well.</li>
            <li> But overall, it looks great 😊</li>
            <li> It was cheap and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Gave me the perfect wing and wasn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li> This is essentially a marker which works great.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Should never ever trust cheap brand like this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand before, but I decided to buy it to make the minimum free shipping requirement.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Let that kitty 🐱 come out to play with this beautifully packages long wearing eye liner today.</li>
            <li> Ive used manyyyy liquid eyeliners and different brands.. and for this price, its really good. :)</li>
            <li> i think its my new favorite !</li>
            <li> Great for that cat eye look, it truly lasts I prefer this a million over the more popular brands  e.l.f waterproof eyeliner or maybeline&#x27;s, wet and wild, revlon&#x27;s or loreal&#x27;s &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; eyeliners&lt;br /&gt;Truly</li>
            <li> It is not waterproof and it smudges quite easily, but it was only two or three dollars, which is good for the price.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to apply and very easy to remove from skin, as it simply crumbles away when you rub your eyes with or without water.</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> and although I may need to wait forever before getting it, it&#x27;s all worth it once it hits your mailbox!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I use it over my pencil liner or gel liner to clean up the edges and make it darker.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, easy to apply, stays on and goes on dark.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed when I tested this out because this stays on pretty well and glides easily on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect that much because the price was so low, but I received this early (which is never a bad thing) and the quality is super good!</li>
            <li> Full coverage all day.</li>
            <li> It works well and true to color.</li>
            <li> Its not bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, it is totally water proof and is so cheap with free shipping!</li>
            <li> 4 star mainly because tho I love this</li>
            <li> The color is super pigmented but it dries fast😒</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent liner though, but I wouldn&#x27;t wait three weeks for it to ship again when there are better products in the US.</li>
            <li> however it ran out kinda quickly</li>
            <li> The color is super pigmented and darker</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than some of the high end eyeliner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It stays on pretty well, and goes on somewhat smooth, but it&#x27;s what I would expect for a $3 eyeliner.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S SUPER CHEAP TOO JUST FANTASTIC QUALITY FOR THE PRICE HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> New favorite.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a cheap kind, it stays on all day long</li>
            <li> Came earlier, and works pretty good</li>
            <li> Really good eyeliner pen love it but hard to do winged eyeliner</li>
            <li> Took forever to come but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different liquid pen liners from drug store to name brand and this one is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Its definitely not water proof and kind of rubs off,  </li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> and it lasts all day and for the price it was so worth buying</li>
            <li> Stays on all day and has a nice finish..doesn&#x27;t flake when putting on the second coat.</li>
            <li> Worth the price though I would say.</li>
            <li> anyhow, right out the mail.</li>
            <li> but it just didn&#x27;t look right to me</li>
            <li> Super amazing eyeliner that dries fast, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and will last all day.</li>
            <li> The color is nice and dark and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Smoky grey would be nice, too.</li>
            <li> Works super good, stays on at least a full 12 hrs</li>
            <li> I have recently reordered the product because I liked it so much</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and super waterproof.</li>
            <li> I actually just bought this item because it was a great price, I didn&#x27;t except it to actually work as well as it did.</li>
            <li> Second day using it, so far so good</li>
            <li> Goes on clean and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> If you love smooth, clean and easy to remove waterproof eyeliner, but don&#x27;t love how expensive it is, buy this pen!</li>
            <li> It IS waterproof, and very very durable.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s obvious and looks very cheap, I brought it to work and was doing my makeup in the car ad used this.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and stays put a long time.</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle, precise tip, and although others have mentioned an unattractive smell I haven&#x27;t noticed anything like that while applying it nor after it has dried.</li>
            <li> i cant even explain its like a sharpie of somewhat lol its hard to explain</li>
            <li> and it was really hot and humid</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Love the price and will definitely be a regular customer!</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Kinda like a big super fine sharpie.  </li>
            <li> This is the first liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve used and it has made me a fan.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like using a marker to do your liner.</li>
            <li> Everyone said in their reviews that it smells funny.</li>
            <li> All liquid liner smells funny, so don&#x27;t let that deter you from considering it.</li>
            <li> and I have very oily lids!</li>
            <li> Also, if you have a good amount of eyeshadow on, of course you&#x27;re going to have to sweep this one a few times to get over all that pigment.</li>
            <li> Idk what is up with all the peeps saying it dries out so fast or didn&#x27;t work or cracked right off the bat</li>
            <li> Shipping was decent, and well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> very pleased, came faster then expected, no runny, easy to apply, and lasts for long days</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing lots of Eyeliner lately to find one I love and this one rates at the top of my list.  </li>
            <li> It stayed on through a good few tears after stubbing my toe and then losing my whole nail.</li>
            <li> The only good things about it is that it is 100% waterproof and a very nice dark shade of black.</li>
            <li> Comes off pretty easy, similiar to a permanent marker actually.</li>
            <li> Was very liquidy at first</li>
            <li> It is a nice dark color</li>
            <li> its gos on a little more thick  than I.wanted but still works good!</li>
            <li> It does come off easily but only when you want it to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply but you have to apply constantly throughout the day for it to stay.</li>
            <li> Definitely waterproof and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It works just as good if not better than the high priced department store brands!</li>
            <li> Then smudged, smeared, washed dishes, played with bubbles with baby, etc....by the end of the day, and the next morning, the lines were as strong as they were when I drew them on.</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeliner pen with a slightly thicker tip for more dramatic looks, although a skilled applier of makeup can easily create fine and delicate lines as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great back-up or purse pen for touch-ups on the go!</li>
            <li> This guy was much easier but still took a couple times to get used to.</li>
            <li> im really picky with my eyeliners</li>
            <li> It works really well for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very reliable.</li>
            <li> and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> If you can apply eyeliner with a pencil, you can apply this, and it&#x27;s so much easier to fill in the lash line with liquid liner than it is to fill it in with pencil.</li>
            <li> Shipped much faster than promised.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this eyeliner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really close to drying out</li>
            <li> Very bummed out.</li>
            <li> but the pencil is much easier and dont get in your eye.</li>
            <li> very goood</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> This is a very opaque product.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t really notice unless you were looking for it</li>
            <li> Its also very waterproof and doesn&#x27;t smudge at all-</li>
            <li> Goes on well, very opaic.</li>
            <li> I have eye liner that isn&#x27;t water proof but because I dont really wear makeup alot</li>
            <li> can take it of when im ready.</li>
            <li> Applies easily Just wish it was much blacker because I&#x27;m dark skinned More than likely</li>
            <li> It was nicely wrapped in bubble wrap, and then the actual item was covered in a tight plastic that needed to be peeled off before being able to open it.</li>
            <li> The color is very black which I love, easy application, and it actually stays on disappearing or without smudging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and comes out pretty dark.</li>
            <li> it was good but just not good quality</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if that affect the wear of this product, but it was really nice.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s full of pigment and dries almost instantly</li>
            <li> The pen has great color and is extremely good/versatile but my only complaint is that when it got here, the top part of the pen was snapped off for some reason.</li>
            <li> so I put on a fair amount and only a little came off where my eye kinda waters a lot throughout the night.  </li>
            <li> but it clumps easily and is harder to put on.</li>
            <li> black eyeliner goes on easy and smooth and last four hours.</li>
            <li> It glides on so smooth an once its dry</li>
            <li> The very end of the tip is super small which can give you elaborate details if you wanted to do something extra.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying a few more.</li>
            <li> Dried out after two days, with the top on.</li>
            <li> Has a strong smell that I don&#x27;t really like but the smell goes away once its dried.</li>
            <li> Tip also a bit more stiff than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it comes off pretty easily but other then that it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> im new to make up</li>
            <li> I am new to liquid eyeliner bc</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and it still works like new.</li>
            <li> but, dry out quick</li>
            <li> If you are really good with liner you might like this but for me it is just to difficult and messes up my whole eye if I have to remove it.</li>
            <li> it does dry quick</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews on this product and for the price I had to try it and was very surprised.  </li>
            <li> The cap sometimes doesn&#x27;t go on all the way, so make sure you push it all the way down!!</li>
            <li> Dried out pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> Super pigmented and stays on ALL DAY LONG!!</li>
            <li> I will buy more of this, no more drug store eyeliner that cost $10 a tube &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> my only problem is that it isn&#x27;t fully opaque when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> It is very dark and easy too apply.  </li>
            <li> Tested on my hand after it dried and it was easily wiped away with a damp washrag.</li>
            <li> It stings a little as it goes on, but once it dries, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It feathers off with no mess!</li>
            <li> I used it on my eyes the next day to tight line the top</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, stays in place, and comes off with a little makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Love this pen, its crazy bold!</li>
            <li> Its not long lasting, I only would use it for practice then use the expensive stuff that GREAT !</li>
            <li> So far I like it,</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying this eyeliner since 2015 and I absolutely can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> It literally comes completely off just with water.</li>
            <li> The liner has a felt tip , much like similar liners that look like this.</li>
            <li> Wow this silvercell  </li>
            <li> I was surprised it arrived early, so I opened and try to use it</li>
            <li> it makes the line super defined and last a long time.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t know is whether this is from China or other countries like China, so I don&#x27;t know how safe it is to use on a daily basis or whether they use animal testing, etc.</li>
            <li> The tip is very thin and good for details and lines.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, the only downside is, it doesn&#x27;t really work with shimmery/metallic eyeshadow unless you absolutely have primer on, otherwise it mixes and makes the black look dull.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is that it&#x27;s hard to open but other than that I am really happy :)</li>
            <li> First of all, props for actually receiving this item, and getting it before the estimated delivery day (almost three weeks earlier!</li>
            <li> First of all... I&#x27;ve used many expensive sephora brands eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Okay eyeliner for the price and for just throw around makeup, but not good if you are looking for a professional look</li>
            <li> The tip is very pointed so it&#x27;s easy to get a thin line.  </li>
            <li> Very dark, true liner.  </li>
            <li> It dry&#x27;s quickly and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Love the application but looks very dry and harsh after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> It tends to dry out really fast 😞</li>
            <li> Its does dry fast and  dosnt smear</li>
            <li> but you can still easily make thick lines.</li>
            <li> so im not careful</li>
            <li> Shipping took forever and the lettering on the tube is super crooked and some letters re missing.</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful and only use the very tip</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this item again from the seller in the near future.</li>
            <li> Seem as though the first time I used it,  I dried out</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this, just go buy the higher quality stuff.</li>
            <li> It is very dark and easy to mess it up.</li>
            <li> This is NOT waterproof and seems to dry out completely after only a couple uses !</li>
            <li> Fine tip for thin lines, thicker part f</li>
            <li> Actually, it&#x27;s cut my eye liner fails to nearly zero and is sooooooo easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Then when I passed out from the pain, the next day the eyeliner was still there (seriously though, true story.)</li>
            <li> The colour is extremely pigmented (it&#x27;s a dark black) and the formula isn&#x27;t runny and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I order this because of the price, I tryed it on and people said it had a bad smell when I read the reviews it doesnt really have a strong smell</li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t last month&#x27;s long</li>
            <li> It is also long lasting and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> so watery and doesnt last long but this one!  </li>
            <li> It last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it takes itself off when you go back over it, like a dry erase marker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a super thin tip</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these eyeliners and I was excited when I received the a little earlier than the expected delivery but one was dried out and the other one was leaking.</li>
            <li> Stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to update to see how long before it dries out on me.</li>
            <li> my only problem was that the felt tip is not very sharp/thin</li>
            <li> so it was a long wait.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, put it on once</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time, did not have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about this product being dry when it was received</li>
            <li> It did not work on me was dry and it spilled all over my hand</li>
            <li> I let it dry.</li>
            <li> I put a mark on my hand, let it dry</li>
            <li> Went dry after a couple uses</li>
            <li> then i found out the tip of the pen is dry.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t dry up and cake off.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, I am usually left with nothing or a few splotches of some eyeliner left on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and it&#x27;s completely dry !</li>
            <li> be careful and don&#x27;t let it dry out.</li>
            <li> but it is only slightly waterproof.</li>
            <li> Currently I have 4 black eye liners.  </li>
            <li> But sometimes you have to put on a little extra.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep it and put a little bit of it over my regular eye liner to keep it from smudging.</li>
            <li> You can see the tip is really thick which can be a bad thing at times as well as good.</li>
            <li> Arrived way before expected.</li>
            <li> I had to wet the applicator at every use.  </li>
            <li> The liquid dried out in only about 3 weeks - Waited for the delivery longer than the item lasted!</li>
            <li> Not to mention, it came 2 weeks sooner than expected, even in a bulk.</li>
            <li> Product is drier than expected so the pen tip sometimes irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Got it two weeks later than said, and it was completely dried out.</li>
            <li> My sister just spent $30 on eyeliner, and wanted to trade me.lol.</li>
            <li> but it is still kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> it is difficult to get a bold dark line with it.</li>
            <li> Other.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because it&#x27;s from china</li>
            <li> It is waterproof and does take a while for it to come off so be careful!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use it for long as it dried up because the cap don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed:)</li>
            <li> Came a lot sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> My eyes lids are oily and I have a hard time getting liner to actually stay in place.</li>
            <li> It was really hard to get off and it made my eyelids itchy and red!</li>
            <li> But once it starts running through it glides and doesn&#x27;t leave a goopy mess on your lashes like other liquid liners.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because this company didn&#x27;t offer dark brown.</li>
            <li> but I have trouble using it, maybe because I am inexperienced with makeup</li>
            <li> It gives a very dark and sharp line, which is what I am looking for in an eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Then it completely dried up and the only way I can use it is if I press ridiculously hard.</li>
            <li> I put some black eye shadow over my eyeliner to make it appear less shiny</li>
            <li> , there were black marks on my hand that must have come from the cap...</li>
            <li> The ink in this eyeliner doesnt show up as black as I would like.</li>
            <li> It gives me the ability to make the desired wing I want without making too much of a mess.</li>
            <li> If you mess up, no worries.</li>
            <li> She has had a lot of problems finding something that does not irritate or make a mess during the day.</li>
            <li> and I find that I need to sweep off the little black pieces under my eyes after a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> If I wanted a professional look that was impossible, and if I wanted a bold it would harden and be sticky and feel weird.</li>
            <li> so I was a little nervous.  </li>
            <li> and although a little bit did come off, the majority of it stayed.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s less than half the price!</li>
            <li> I even rubbed my eyes a little bit and no smudge.</li>
            <li> The tip was very short and made it very hard to apply.</li>
            <li> It seems to disappear too after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> after 2 weeks, it dried out.</li>
            <li> Dried out and broke within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few moths and its worked wonders.</li>
            <li> It came dried up, and I have to dip the tip of the eyeliner in water in order to get anything out of it.</li>
            <li> It came completely dried out</li>
            <li> Dried out within a day of using it.</li>
            <li> I tested it immediately by drawing a few lines on my hand.</li>
            <li> Completely dried out when it arrived, and the packaging was ripped</li>
            <li> Product was dried up when it was delivered.</li>
            <li> I ran a washcloth over it a few times and it still did not budge.</li>
            <li> I use this like everyday.</li>
            <li> It dried out after two days</li>
            <li> Comes out really black just like i wanted it too!</li>
            <li> I tried it out today and It is very black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usable, yes, but I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to dry out because I can&#x27;t properly close it now.</li>
            <li> I am so bad at appyling eyeliner, this is the first time I can do it where it doesn&#x27;t look like a globby mess!</li>
            <li> When I mess up and use make up remover and try to apply it again (after taking off the makeup remover), the eyeliner becomes faded and hard to use...</li>
            <li> It is really messy and it leaks, hard to get off</li>
            <li> so if it turned out to be bad I didn&#x27;t lose much.  </li>
            <li> Cracks in small peices if you rub on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the product wasn&#x27;t dripping, I&#x27;m not sure how the ink got there.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> There was black ink on the pen like broken packaging but none on the felt tip.</li>
            <li> The ink is hard to get started and you have to press hard to keep it going.</li>
            <li> I rubbed really hard</li>
            <li> This stuff never smears and you can wear it for at least two days.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too watery or thick.</li>
            <li> This is a liner if you&#x27;re looking to create a medium to thick line.</li>
            <li> dried up and broken when it was delivered.</li>
            <li> Too thick.</li>
            <li> and I could not get it to look subtle.</li>
            <li> It gets all smears not good at all</li>
            <li> uncomfortable to wear and felt very stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got shaky hands!</li>
            <li> Crap, dried out when I received it .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money for this crap</li>
            <li> Very thin and watery.</li>
            <li> and if you need it desperately, it could do the job.</li>
            <li> Horrible dried out when received in the mail.</li>
            <li> So I decided when this happens I want something that wont smudge and make me look crazy.</li>
            <li> The one thing I hate about it, is the tip is angled in a weird way.</li>
            <li> Makes it nearly impossible to apply neatly.</li>
            <li> Just bad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn too bad but it did for me, for you it may not.</li>
            <li> and it makes me frustrated.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> And I hate that phrase!</li>
            <li> Worst eyeliner I ever bought !</li>
            <li> I thought that this product was absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible and you should not buy it!</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice, I use it when im on a hurry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not mat. Has a strong smell. Stays for a long time. Cracks in small peices if you rub on it.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> Baught it for my sister and she love it..</li>
            <li> It applies easily and is smudge free (yay!), but it cracks and I find that I need to sweep off the little black pieces under my eyes after a couple of hours.  It seems to disappear too after a few hours.  At the end of the day, I am usually left with nothing or a few splotches of some eyeliner left on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good eyeliner for the price.I was not disappointed when I tested this out because this stays on pretty well and glides easily on my eyes.I am the type of person who likes the winged eyeliner look.</li>
            <li> Love!!!!!! Wears all day doesn&#x27;t smudge when sweat!!!</li>
            <li> So far I like it, glad I bought 2, better than the waterproof maybelline I tried before.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smudge or anything.  It&#x27;s legit.</li>
            <li> I baught this for my wife she said she loves it it&#x27;s like the Kat Von D eyeliner!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like the elf eyeliner at HEB for like $1.</li>
            <li> after 2 weeks, it dried out. :-( and I only used it 3 times a week. it was good but just not good quality</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for. Comes off pretty easy, similiar to a permanent marker actually. You can see the tip is really thick which can be a bad thing at times as well as good.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AMAZING EYELINER!</li>
            <li> Took forever to come but was worth the wait. Works super good, stays on at least a full 12 hrs</li>
            <li> This product came on time and it is lovely.  It goes on very easy, and is also very easy to use.  It isn&#x27;t a cheap kind, it stays on all day long and I also tested it over night while sleeping and it stayed on all day and even through the night, and I also do winged eyeliner so I put on a fair amount and only a little came off where my eye kinda waters a lot throughout the night.  So yes, very good product, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Arrived in 18 days which was a week earlier than  estimated. Works great</li>
            <li> I have recently reordered the product because I liked it so much</li>
            <li> Excellent does come off if i wipe my eye.</li>
            <li> Arrived way before expected. Doesn&#x27;t smudge and last all day.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about this product being dry when it was received so I was a little nervous.  I figured it was a cheap price so if it turned out to be bad I didn&#x27;t lose much.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It is very dark and easy too apply.  The tip is very pointed so it&#x27;s easy to get a thin line.  I put some black eye shadow over my eyeliner to make it appear less shiny so I&#x27;m not sure if that affect the wear of this product, but it was really nice.  I placed some on my hand and tried to rub it off and nothing happened.  I licked my finger and did it again and although a little bit did come off, the majority of it stayed.  I wore this to go putt putt golfing with my family and it was really hot and humid so I was sweating.  But my eyeliner looked as perfect at the end of the day as it did when I put it on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! It&#x27;s a perfect dupe for the stilla eyeliner! I would almost say this one is better and it&#x27;s less than half the price! Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase!</li>
            <li> I will buy again it works amazing even though it does a stench but no worries because it goes away! Perfect eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I do like it but, dry out quick</li>
            <li> I love this product ! It goes on just like an eyeliner pencil</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth the tip was more flexible than I thougt it was gonna be so that&#x27;s a plus :)</li>
            <li> Full coverage all day. It last for a very long time. You may have to use a really good eye makeup remover to remove this product though.</li>
            <li> Dried out and broke within a few weeks.  I had to wet the applicator at every use.  I would never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is waterproof. It comes off very easily and needed to be reapplied. Won&#x27;t purchase again. The tip was very short and made it very hard to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Very good waterproof eyeliner. Goes on clean and highly pigmented. Stays put all day. Makeup remover is required to get this stuff off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different liquid pen liners from drug store to name brand and this one is my absolute favorite. The color is very black which I love, easy application, and it actually stays on disappearing or without smudging. I just ordered 3 more! Love the price and will definitely be a regular customer!</li>
            <li> Love it buying more for sure</li>
            <li> This is really good eye liner. My eyes lids are oily and I have a hard time getting liner to actually stay in place. New favorite.</li>
            <li> The liquid dried out in only about 3 weeks - Waited for the delivery longer than the item lasted! Low price. Guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Love this liner! It works just as good if not better than the high priced department store brands! Will order again!</li>
            <li> Crap, dried out when I received it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few moths and its worked wonders. im new to make up but it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li> Worth the money. It&#x27;s a liquid eyeliner so it takes practice.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, easy to apply, stays on and goes on dark.</li>
            <li> I love it and will be ordering more...</li>
            <li> It stings a little as it goes on, but once it dries, it&#x27;s fine. It stayed on all day, so I&#x27;m really happy with it!</li>
            <li> Yes, I brought back the 90s/early 00s! And I hate that phrase! But that&#x27;s how good this stuff is! Idk what is up with all the peeps saying it dries out so fast or didn&#x27;t work or cracked right off the bat bc this is heaven sent! I am new to liquid eyeliner bc I suck at applying! I&#x27;ve got shaky hands! I was using a MAC liquid liner and it&#x27;s nice but it clumps easily and is harder to put on. This guy was much easier but still took a couple times to get used to. Also, if you have a good amount of eyeshadow on, of course you&#x27;re going to have to sweep this one a few times to get over all that pigment. But once it starts running through it glides and doesn&#x27;t leave a goopy mess on your lashes like other liquid liners. Love this stuff! Even if it doesn&#x27;t last month&#x27;s long I don&#x27;t care! It&#x27;s so easy to use, it is totally water proof and is so cheap with free shipping! What&#x27;s not to love!?</li>
            <li> Really good eyeliner pen love it but hard to do winged eyeliner</li>
            <li> Great job!! Came earlier, and works pretty good</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I liked it! It glides on easy and smooth and it lasts all day. It looks so good! Almost perfect! And, considering the price, I should&#x27;ve ordered 10!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot like a marker. The ink is hard to get started and you have to press hard to keep it going. I was expecting a thicker ink and this one bleeds. The tip is nice tho.</li>
            <li> The pen leaks and gets all over my fingers when I try to open it.  Other. Great stay on power.</li>
            <li> 4 star mainly because tho I love this it does not go on the water line...</li>
            <li> Product as described. Prompt delivery</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner ive ever had!!!!!!</li>
            <li> its a nice colour but it doesnt go on the waterline well at all and it makes me frustrated.</li>
            <li> THIS LAST ALL DAY NO NEED TO REAPPLY. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I can&#x27;t help myself! I have been buying this eyeliner since 2015 and I absolutely can&#x27;t get enough of it! I was skeptical at first because it&#x27;s from china and I always hear about people getting eye infections and stuff, but I&#x27;m so glad I got it! It&#x27;s so cheap and works so well.</li>
            <li> Are you trying to find a cheap , good working eyeliner thats easy to easy ? Then this is it !!!! Its such a good eyeliner!! Makes good lines &amp; easy to use !! Shipping took a while but I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I recommend It !!!</li>
            <li> Need to go over it once or twice but i love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this gift for my mom and she loved it! It is waterproof and does take a while for it to come off so be careful! But overall, it looks great 😊</li>
            <li> I love it so much! I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and it still works like new. I plan on buying more in the future. It works amazingly. Definitely get this if you&#x27;re a beginner.</li>
            <li> good product, I love the price of it and the quality is amazing I will buy more of this, no more drug store eyeliner that cost $10 a tube &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Great! Comes out nicely</li>
            <li> Shipped sooner than expected and is an awesome product! I love how it glides on smoothly and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I like this liner but the cover falls off all the time. I didn&#x27;t get to use it for long as it dried up because the cap don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> Great for that cat eye look, it truly lasts I prefer this a million over the more popular brands  e.l.f waterproof eyeliner or maybeline&#x27;s, wet and wild, revlon&#x27;s or loreal&#x27;s &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; eyeliners&lt;br /&gt;Truly worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful and don&#x27;t let it dry out.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I was hoping for,  it is difficult to get a bold dark line with it.</li>
            <li> The product was alright. It came dried up, and I have to dip the tip of the eyeliner in water in order to get anything out of it. It stays on pretty well, and goes on somewhat smooth, but it&#x27;s what I would expect for a $3 eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is amazing! It&#x27;s easy to apply and comes out pretty dark. It is also long lasting and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> im really picky with my eyeliners i dont like mine so watery and doesnt last long but this one!  my loooord i think its my new favorite ! it goes on easy its really good i cant even explain its like a sharpie of somewhat lol its hard to explain but it works good i  love , love , love it ! i need to order 3 more as soon as i get more money !!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Easy peasy lemon squeezie!  Very dark, true liner.  Kinda like a big super fine sharpie.  Comes from China though, so expect to wait a bit before it comes in.</li>
            <li> Great waterproof eyeliner. I love eyeliner and this one is good. The pen tip is the perfect size and it&#x27;s not too watery or thick.</li>
            <li> I was looking for alternatives to Avon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Extralasting&amp;#34; waterproof liquid eyeliner because they stopped selling it and decided to give this eyeliner pen a try. I love it EVEN MORE than Avon&#x27;s stuff! This is very easy to apply and very easy to remove from skin, as it simply crumbles away when you rub your eyes with or without water. If you love smooth, clean and easy to remove waterproof eyeliner, but don&#x27;t love how expensive it is, buy this pen!</li>
            <li> Super amazing eyeliner that dries fast, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and will last all day. It IS waterproof, and very very durable. The very end of the tip is super small which can give you elaborate details if you wanted to do something extra. I read the reviews and immediately ordered more than one! Not to mention, it came 2 weeks sooner than expected, even in a bulk.</li>
            <li> It works really well for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product! I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> i would buy more of thisss!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love! Although just make sure you dont leave the cap off. It tends to dry out really fast 😞</li>
            <li> It came completely dried out</li>
            <li> The color is super pigmented but it dries fast😒</li>
            <li> It did not work on me was dry and it spilled all over my hand</li>
            <li> Product is drier than expected so the pen tip sometimes irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Was very liquidy at first but overall is perfect!</li>
            <li> Not terrible. I&#x27;m impressed with how it doesn&#x27;t run down my face at all. It&#x27;s very reliable. But sometimes you have to put on a little extra. It isnt entire opaque.</li>
            <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner I have found so far! It does not rub off even with water! Lasts a very long time, did not have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Silvercell Waterproof Eyeliner! It gives me the ability to make the desired wing I want without making too much of a mess. The only negative I have is that it&#x27;s hard to open but other than that I am really happy :)</li>
            <li> Have to dip the point in water before it will go on.</li>
            <li> Was gud for a minute. Dried out within a day of using it. Would not  purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great! Very pigmented and super waterproof. The tip is very thin and good for details and lines. Doesn&#x27;t smear or anything. It&#x27;s way better than some of the high end eyeliner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this eyeliner works fairly well. The color is nice and dark and it goes on smoothly. If you mess up, no worries. It literally comes completely off just with water. The one thing I hate about it, is the tip is angled in a weird way. Makes it nearly impossible to apply neatly. Especially if you&#x27;re doing wing styled eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite liquid liner! Goes on smooth, stays in place, and comes off with a little makeup remover. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner!!!!! It works as good as the waterproof liquid eyeliner from Stila, except you can get 8 of these for the price of one Stila eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Its definitely not water proof and kind of rubs off,  but hey its a 2 dollar eyeliner and if you need it desperately, it could do the job.</li>
            <li> This is a liner if you&#x27;re looking to create a medium to thick line. Unlike the skinny liner, you only need to draw a line or two depending on how think you want it. It doesn&#x27;t run and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> First of all, props for actually receiving this item, and getting it before the estimated delivery day (almost three weeks earlier! ~~yes, it does take forever to get to you, no two day prime shipping for this item!)  anyhow, right out the mail. It was nicely wrapped in bubble wrap, and then the actual item was covered in a tight plastic that needed to be peeled off before being able to open it. The liner has a felt tip , much like similar liners that look like this. I tested it immediately by drawing a few lines on my hand. I let it dry. Then smudged, smeared, washed dishes, played with bubbles with baby, etc....by the end of the day, and the next morning, the lines were as strong as they were when I drew them on. There was no fading, and no feathering either! I used it on my eyes the next day to tight line the top and it worked really well. No irritation. It stayed through 95 degree humid heat, through constant face washes, and eye allergy itches. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised! Now I took a star off bc when I applied it, there were black marks on my hand that must have come from the cap...the product wasn&#x27;t dripping, I&#x27;m not sure how the ink got there. I&#x27;ll try to update to see how long before it dries out on me. But for now, the inital thoughts are that it&#x27;s awesome...and although I may need to wait forever before getting it, it&#x27;s all worth it once it hits your mailbox!</li>
            <li> would totally buy this again !!</li>
            <li> Seem as though the first time I used it,  I dried out</li>
            <li> Hmm...great pigment, yet I do not believe this is waterproof. Tested on my hand after it dried and it was easily wiped away with a damp washrag. It&#x27;s a decent liner though, but I wouldn&#x27;t wait three weeks for it to ship again when there are better products in the US.</li>
            <li> It is really messy and it leaks, hard to get off</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Could be more pigmented. Sometimes it takes itself off when you go back over it, like a dry erase marker. Don&#x27;t let a metal lash curler touch it or it&#x27;&#x27;ll be gone.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and the color is great. If you can apply eyeliner with a pencil, you can apply this, and it&#x27;s so much easier to fill in the lash line with liquid liner than it is to fill it in with pencil. I&#x27;m sold. For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Trash. I would give this no stars if I could. Completely dried out when it arrived, and the packaging was ripped</li>
            <li> Its not long lasting, I only would use it for practice then use the expensive stuff that GREAT !</li>
            <li> Love the application but looks very dry and harsh after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I love love love this eyeliner. Best I&#x27;ve ever used. It was cheap and lasts all day. I plan on buying a few more.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner its good for the price</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed with this. Got it two weeks later than said, and it was completely dried out. :/</li>
            <li> Product was dried up when it was delivered. I could not apply and the more I tried to make it work, the more my eye became irritated! You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Gave me the perfect wing and wasn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li> It is a nice dark color but I have trouble using it, maybe because I am inexperienced with makeup but it is only slightly waterproof. When I mess up and use make up remover and try to apply it again (after taking off the makeup remover), the eyeliner becomes faded and hard to use...</li>
            <li> First of all... I&#x27;ve used many expensive sephora brands eyeliner. I was on a low budget recently &amp; felt I should add a lil extra something to  my makeup collection. One of the best eyeliners ever! Came in perfect condition, no scent, super easy to apply! Best part is it takes a lot to get it off. I tested it on my arm &amp; rubbing it / trying to smear it wouldnt even get it off! Does not smear! I rubbed really hard it still wouldnt smear! I even scrubbed it with soap and water the next day, it feathered a tiny bit but still looked legit! This stuff never smears and you can wear it for at least two days. It feathers off with no mess! No smearing! Nothing! Really good product &amp; i&#x27;m literally going to buy 10 of these!</li>
            <li> Great for even the hottest weather!</li>
            <li> Wow this silvercell  black eyeliner goes on easy and smooth and last four hours. It will make your eyes pop with the lining of a seductive kitten . Meow ladies . Let that kitty 🐱 come out to play with this beautifully packages long wearing eye liner today.</li>
            <li> Worst eyeliner I ever bought ! It doesn&#x27;t work and it&#x27;s completely dry ! I waited for this product for nothing ! Don&#x27;t buy it ! Don&#x27;t waste ur money for this crap it doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and looks great!</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing lots of Eyeliner lately to find one I love and this one rates at the top of my list.  I had read the reviews on this product and for the price I had to try it and was very surprised.  I put a mark on my hand, let it dry and it did not smudge. I ran a washcloth over it a few times and it still did not budge. I slept with it on and it was still perfect the next morning. It was also still on my eyes. I am buying 5 more today.  It is like a marker and goes on very easy with great precision. LUV IT</li>
            <li> I use this like everyday. It&#x27;s super easy to do and I love how smooth it is on my eyes. This is a MUST GET</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle, precise tip, and although others have mentioned an unattractive smell I haven&#x27;t noticed anything like that while applying it nor after it has dried. It dry&#x27;s quickly and lasts long. Very happy with this product. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love it. It stays on during the Arizona heat (sweat). My sister just spent $30 on eyeliner, and wanted to trade me.lol. I know what shes getting for her birthday</li>
            <li> This is NOT waterproof and seems to dry out completely after only a couple uses !</li>
            <li> I do not wear makeup often and I suck at eyeliner. This is essentially a marker which works great. This is the first liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve used and it has made me a fan.</li>
            <li> I thought that this product was absolutely terrible. It dried out after two days and I could not get it to look subtle. If I wanted a professional look that was impossible, and if I wanted a bold it would harden and be sticky and feel weird. Don&#x27;t buy this but a liquid instead of this crappy felt tip.</li>
            <li> I love this, it applys smoothly, and lasts for an incredible time. I tried it out on my hand and it lasted all day with washing dishes. It does come off easily but only when you want it to.</li>
            <li> Horrible dried out when received in the mail. Just bad. I couldn&#x27;t even use it. There was black ink on the pen like broken packaging but none on the felt tip. I don&#x27;t know how some people say it&#x27;s the best and the greatest when it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li> Fantastic. It makes applying neat lines so easy! Fine tip for thin lines, thicker part f</li>
            <li> This is exactly like using a marker to do your liner. It is very dark and easy to mess it up. If you are really good with liner you might like this but for me it is just to difficult and messes up my whole eye if I have to remove it.</li>
            <li> Very thin and watery. You have to apply several coats. Went dry after a couple uses</li>
            <li> Its a really nice product</li>
            <li> Wipes off easily and it has a foam tip. It&#x27;s pretty good for the price, took forever to ship.</li>
            <li> Dried out after two days, with the top on. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Comes out really black just like i wanted it too! Very easy to use, the only downside is, it doesn&#x27;t really work with shimmery/metallic eyeshadow unless you absolutely have primer on, otherwise it mixes and makes the black look dull. But overall a great product and for so cheap! Got it alot faster then the delivery time told me. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> It is not waterproof and it smudges quite easily, but it was only two or three dollars, which is good for the price.</li>
            <li> The ink in this eyeliner doesnt show up as black as I would like. So I have to go over it again a second time. Can&#x27;t be used on your top or bottom waterlines. It feels kind of like a Sharpie marker with just a touch of a softer tip. Update: 01/01/16 I wear makeup most days. And I have a lot ofeyeliners. Currently I have 4 black eye liners.  One of which is this one, 2 gels, and 1 pencil.  9  out of 10 applications  I&#x27;m going with the pencil, 1 out of 10 I&#x27;m using this.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply doesn&#x27;t crease or smudge which is great and a great product for makeup users!</li>
            <li> great eyeliner. it makes the line super defined and last a long time.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner looks very good on! my only problem was that the felt tip is not very sharp/thin so you have to be careful and only use the very tip or else it goes where you don&#x27;t want it to. Tip also a bit more stiff than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner isn&#x27;t waterproof, lasts only a couple hours and then it smudged to s***, and it has chemicals in it I have never even heard of before. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this, just go buy the higher quality stuff. Yes, its more money but it is so much better than whatever this stuff is they say is eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner may not run done my face but it disappears</li>
            <li> Excellent! Shipped much faster than promised. Easy application, beautiful results! A must have for my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> dried up and broken when it was delivered.</li>
            <li> This product is so cheap and it works amazing I definitely  recommend this</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this eyeliner, it&#x27;s full of pigment and dries almost instantly but after about 4-5 uses I&#x27;ve realized THIS is why my eyes burn and are irritated. It doesn&#x27;t burn too bad but it did for me, for you it may not. Great product tho.</li>
            <li> The colour is extremely pigmented (it&#x27;s a dark black) and the formula isn&#x27;t runny and easy to apply. I highly recommend this product for people that are just getting into makeup or are looking for a good felt tip eyeliner. I will definitely buy this item again from the seller in the near future.</li>
            <li> Very nice nice product however it ran out kinda quickly</li>
            <li> I like the liner does not stay on great if sweaty.  It works well and true to color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from two dollar eyeliner, but tbh it&#x27;s the best liquid pen eyeliner I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s has a super thin tip but you can still easily make thick lines. Goes on super smooth, dries fast, perfect for wings.</li>
            <li> I am a happy customer !!</li>
            <li> Too lite. Looks brown ..</li>
            <li> I actually just bought this item because it was a great price, I didn&#x27;t except it to actually work as well as it did. The color is super pigmented and darker then I excepted which is great. The only problem is that it comes off pretty easily but other then that it works like a charm. For the price I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it and then some.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these eyeliners and I was excited when I received the a little earlier than the expected delivery but one was dried out and the other one was leaking. It&#x27;s easy to apply but you have to apply constantly throughout the day for it to stay.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner. Arrived in a timely manner and just as described. Can&#x27;t beat the price. Would buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! So easy to apply,  Water proof , No  smudges, and most importantly it makes it so much more easier to do the perfect Cat eye look!</li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t even last for 3 hours and I got a picture to show you guys.</li>
            <li> I was surprised it arrived early, so I opened and try to use it then i found out the tip of the pen is dry.  i even shaked and checked if there&#x27;s liquids in the pen but out of luck.  Should never ever trust cheap brand like this one.  NEVER buy it again.</li>
            <li> Seriously love this stuff! Definitely waterproof and easy to apply. Just bought a ton more! The wait on it being shipped is the only downfall. Took about a month to get!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really close to drying out and i just got it</li>
            <li> Everyone said in their reviews that it smells funny. All liquid liner smells funny, so don&#x27;t let that deter you from considering it. I bought it, came from China so it was a long wait. I was a bit concerned with being a no name brand but I tried it and had zero issues. Actually, it&#x27;s cut my eye liner fails to nearly zero and is sooooooo easy to apply. It stayed on through a good few tears after stubbing my toe and then losing my whole nail. Then when I passed out from the pain, the next day the eyeliner was still there (seriously though, true story.) I also work 10 hour days and it stayed put all day with no smudges and it didn&#x27;t dry up and cake off. I&#x27;m buying more for sure!</li>
            <li> This was an amazing product for the first.. 5 uses? Then it completely dried up and the only way I can use it is if I press ridiculously hard. Very bummed out.</li>
            <li> Its not bad but the pencil is much easier and dont get in your eye. I have an issue with things around my eyes so this is perfect for someone thats able to use it on my upper eye lid because i cant seem to apply it very well so I use it only when i have help otherwise I ues the eye pencil on the lower lid</li>
            <li> Too thick. But it does last. Wont come off unless you wash it off.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am so bad at appyling eyeliner, this is the first time I can do it where it doesn&#x27;t look like a globby mess! It lasts all day too! Try this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed:)</li>
            <li> I tried it out today and It is very black. Easy to apply, not runny when applied, best of all its water proof, it stayed on all day . I even rubbed my eyes a little bit and no smudge. I gave it four stars because of the marker smell it has when opened .</li>
            <li> I was amazed how good this liquid liner work it goes on so easy and it lasts all day and for the price it was so worth buying I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Dried out wayyy too fast..</li>
            <li> Stays on all day and has a nice finish..doesn&#x27;t flake when putting on the second coat. Wait was longer than anticipated but we&#x27;ll worth the wait for the price!!</li>
            <li> Waterproof as stated. Applies easily Just wish it was much blacker because I&#x27;m dark skinned More than likely i will purchase again</li>
            <li> very goood&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Love this pen, its crazy bold! The cap sometimes doesn&#x27;t go on all the way, so make sure you push it all the way down!!</li>
            <li> Came in early and works great!  Very pigmented. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Very good anyone can use it no matter how unskilled you are at eyeliner like me :)</li>
            <li> I loooove this liquid liner! Ive used manyyyy liquid eyeliners and different brands.. and for this price, its really good. :)</li>
            <li> its not water proof and rubs off !!</li>
            <li> Love it, just perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! Great pigment, rich and defined. Lasts a long time, put it on once and it stayed all day. Shipping was decent, and well worth the wait. Best eyeliner Ever!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite eyeliner. It&#x27;s not all liquidy and it doesn&#x27;t get everywhere.</li>
            <li> Terrible! After a couple of times using it, the liquid liner did not go through the tip. It&#x27;s terrible and you should not buy it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent eye liner for a very inexpensive price.  I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand before, but I decided to buy it to make the minimum free shipping requirement.  It gives a very dark and sharp line, which is what I am looking for in an eyeliner.  I do notice that it doesn&#x27;t smear as much as other liners I have used before (I have oily skin around the eyes), so I am very happy with the product.  The only thing I don&#x27;t know is whether this is from China or other countries like China, so I don&#x27;t know how safe it is to use on a daily basis or whether they use animal testing, etc. etc.  As far as its performance, I am very happy with it. Will have to do more research on it before I reorder though.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and stays put a long time. I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because this company didn&#x27;t offer dark brown. Smoky grey would be nice, too.</li>
            <li> Very good eye liner, no smuges and stays on all day. Second day using it, so far so good</li>
            <li> I could not even get it to write on my skin.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect that much because the price was so low, but I received this early (which is never a bad thing) and the quality is super good! It&#x27;s honestly my favorite eyeliner and I wish I&#x27;d ordered more than one! The color is great and it stays on all day. Very happy, and highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li> Dried out pretty quickly.  Started out okay but if you don&#x27;t use it often enough it dries out.  Worth the price though I would say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this pen! It glides on so smooth an once its dry it doesn&#x27;t smudge until you wash it off! I use it over my pencil liner or gel liner to clean up the edges and make it darker. This is a very opaque product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice. my only problem is that it isn&#x27;t fully opaque when you first put it on. You wouldn&#x27;t really notice unless you were looking for it but it is still kind of annoying. Overall it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> It gets all smears not good at all</li>
            <li> Came a lot sooner than expected! Has a strong smell that I don&#x27;t really like but the smell goes away once its dried. Super pigmented and stays on ALL DAY LONG!! LOVE IT! Its also very waterproof and doesn&#x27;t smudge at all-and I have very oily lids! Next time will buy a bunch. Super recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> The pen has great color and is extremely good/versatile but my only complaint is that when it got here, the top part of the pen was snapped off for some reason. It&#x27;s usable, yes, but I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to dry out because I can&#x27;t properly close it now. That&#x27;s greatly distressing on my end.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here ..its gos on a little more thick  than I.wanted but still works good! Its does dry fast and  dosnt smear</li>
            <li> Nice price and it works.</li>
            <li> worked very good. Its definitely waterproof as well</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this pen. She has had a lot of problems finding something that does not irritate or make a mess during the day. She would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Goes on well, very opaic.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this! I&#x27;ve only used it once. I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to makeup until I used this. Shipping took forever and the lettering on the tube is super crooked and some letters re missing. And it reminds me of permanent marker ink not an actual eyeliner marker. It was really hard to get off and it made my eyelids itchy and red!</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve bought. Stays in humid weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use all sorts of liquid pencils for years and thought I&#x27;d give this one a go because of it&#x27;s reviews and affordable price. I though this would be great, unfortunately it is not. It is very flaky and does not look good, it&#x27;s obvious and looks very cheap, I brought it to work and was doing my makeup in the car ad used this. It was horrible. uncomfortable to wear and felt very stiff. The only good things about it is that it is 100% waterproof and a very nice dark shade of black. Will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeliner pen with a slightly thicker tip for more dramatic looks, although a skilled applier of makeup can easily create fine and delicate lines as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great back-up or purse pen for touch-ups on the go!</li>
            <li> I received this eyeliner today and it it great I tried it on my hand first and what surprised at how great the quality was nice smooth line easy to get a nice fine point on a wing. I then put it on and was impressed with how easily and quickly I got the perfect wing! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!! IT&#x27;S SUPER CHEAP TOO JUST FANTASTIC QUALITY FOR THE PRICE HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> very pleased, came faster then expected, no runny, easy to apply, and lasts for long days</li>
            <li> It can make a very precise line, but the color fades very quickly, within the first couple minutes of application. Okay eyeliner for the price and for just throw around makeup, but not good if you are looking for a professional look</li>
            <li> Honestly this liquid liner scared me when I tryed it when I got it. I have eye liner that isn&#x27;t water proof but because I dont really wear makeup alot I didnt bother trying a liquid water proof liner. Im used to rubbing my face and eyes whenever I want so im not careful sometimes I dont even remember I have on makeup till I see it on my hand. So I decided when this happens I want something that wont smudge and make me look crazy. I order this because of the price, I tryed it on and people said it had a bad smell when I read the reviews it doesnt really have a strong smell but it does smell like a permanent marker. I put it on my hand cuz I thought if I put it on my lid it wouldn&#x27;t come off. It came of so that was good to know can take it of when im ready. It came of easy with baby wipe it does dry quick but it just didn&#x27;t look right to me it was like a marker on a white erase board. I didnt like it but I dont like to waist money so since it does have good quality I decided to keep it and put a little bit of it over my regular eye liner to keep it from smudging. I dont know since im not used to liquid eye liner it thats how there supposed to look. Just my opinion</li>
