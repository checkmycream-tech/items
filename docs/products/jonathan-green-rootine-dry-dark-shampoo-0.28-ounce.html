    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>size is perfect to throw in your purse for touch-ups on the go.  </li>
            <li>I love it!!!</li>
            <li>It works incredibly well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea, but just don&#x27;t work for what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li>Also, the brown powder stains my fair skinned scalp</li>
            <li>That review was posted in 2011, so I presume there used to be some kind of a dial.</li>
            <li>A nice, clean scent would be a great improvement.</li>
            <li>The product is portable and very easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s best NOT to apply too much near the roots, instead dab it on just the hair itself.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>The box doesn&#x27;t have fantastic directions and sometimes I really have to shake it to get the powder out, but when it works, it is awesome.</li>
            <li>It just causes static.  </li>
            <li>and I thought this might be better with my darker hair.</li>
            <li>Its also gluten free!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this works</li>
            <li>But I was even more excited when I tried it, and it worked!</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s a pretty good root concealer, too.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is easy to blend into my hair</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not the greatest dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Easy to extend a blowout with this product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to bring with you anywhere.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t  have a problem dispensing the product like some other reviewers but it seems the brush is not the ideal way to apply it, a shaker would be better.  </li>
            <li>The Batiste brand is far superior.</li>
            <li>My hair ends up looking clean and full of body without any visible powder residue.</li>
            <li>I have dark blond hair, and the light hair version blends in great.</li>
            <li>The most upvoted review says that there is a dial to change how much product comes out.</li>
            <li>I love that it is not white powder, blends better into my hair.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I have super fine, straight hair and this product</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy more and recommend to friends!</li>
            <li>So fun I had to try it.</li>
            <li>More like sandy brown - not dark brown.</li>
            <li>The actual shampoo works excellent, takes the greasiness out of your hair without making is stiff as a board like spray-on shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I am confident one will last me 6</li>
            <li>- there&#x27;s a pin you have to remove first.  </li>
            <li>The brush idea sounds great, but the hole for the powder is just one small hole, so it doesn&#x27;t really cover the whole brush, but remains concentrated in the center, so when you put it onto your head, it doesn&#x27;t dust it, it just comes out kind of in blotches that you have to force out by bouncing it onto your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited to find a fragrance free dry shampoo, since I have allergies and chemical sensitivities.</li>
            <li>I am sure there are other dry shampoos out there which would be more satisfactory.</li>
            <li>It travels very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell--in fact, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all.  </li>
            <li>Too much of a struggle to make it work.</li>
            <li>Very pricey.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, though a little messy at times, but I just make sure I&#x27;m standing over a sink to catch the excess during application and clean up is</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a nice small, compact tube, so</li>
            <li>Also, I have slightly darker roots than highlights and have been using the product to blend the two colors better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sweaty summer days at the beach, unexpected sleepovers, and any other time your hair starts to look a little too grody for comfort.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to use this for times I have to work long hours with no time to drive home for a quick shower before going out again at night.</li>
            <li>It takes a little effort to apply the right amount and rub it in, but I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>I personally disagree; I feel the brush allows me to put the product exactly where I want it which reduces the amount you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty simple.</li>
            <li>The JONATHAN Green Rootine Dry Shampoo is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this product if you have fine, Caucasian hair - it will do nothing but waste your money.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and this product is just what I needed for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My hair is still soft and clean-feeling with it in.  </li>
            <li>I have short, fine dark brown hair</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s definitely not dark.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to get the product out , the little bit you can get out of the brush is good product though</li>
            <li>It probably was designed for spot \\&quot;dry shampooing\\&quot;, which for me defeats the real purpose.</li>
            <li>I have dark hair and when I first put it on my hair I can see it</li>
            <li>being said, you can see where it is being applied (at least I can because I have black hair) and then use your fingers to then kind of rub it into your scalp.</li>
            <li>I have tried other dry shampoos in the past and really liked how they gave my hair some volume, while minimizing oil and the resulting shine.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t review this as a &#x27;dry shampoo,&#x27; as I never got it to open properly!  </li>
            <li>Then I tried just hitting little knob that was left in the brush, and absolutely nothing - no powder!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Then I tried just hitting little knob that was left in the brush, and absolutely nothing - no powder!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the aerosol and weird, toxic ingredients of most dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to deal with white powder like the one-size-fits-all dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work well and doesn&#x27;t make me itch or shy away from touching my hair like other dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I ended up throwing it in the trash; it was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless other brands and always have some issue with the product.  </li>
            <li> I have really dark hair and the Dry Dark Shampoo takes the oily look out and leaves my hair feeling soft, manageable, and like I just washed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to Oscar Blandi Pronto Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I recommend this dry shampoo to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of work to have to actual powder come out, but once you got the technique down</li>
            <li> This is everything I&#x27;ve been looking for in a dry shampoo!  </li>
            <li> Definitely has less of a chemical smell than the spray-on type shampoos, as well.</li>
            <li> BUT the amount of powder that comes out of the brush is too little that (even if I set it to max output) it takes forever to \\&quot;dry shampoo\\&quot; an entire head.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it is a tiny container and</li>
            <li> not much comes out at a time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the results I expected with this product.  </li>
            <li> but the amount you use is minimal</li>
            <li> I used to try baby powder on my dark hair but it makes my hair look light-colored, almost grey, so the Jonathan Product Green Rootine Dry Shampoo for DARK hair was supposed to do  it.</li>
            <li> and I use this every other day between washes.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other brands and they always left my hair with white specks or weighed it down to the point it was difficult to style.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to tell if you are actually applying any product, and after letting it sit and brushing it out, I don&#x27;t notice any marked improvement in the condition of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Only four stars as it is sometimes hard to shake out.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there is no scent to it.  </li>
            <li> Just to get the powder out you gotta turn it upside down and shake it.</li>
            <li> I would instead recomend Osis hair powder, which is easier to apply and gives the same effect with a very small amount of product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave that awful white residue that most do.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to the brush format or what,</li>
            <li> That being said, it does not work half as well in controlling oil as the Oscar Blandi or just plain baby powder/talcum powder.</li>
            <li> but I like to go a few days between shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Adds volume to limp hair, absorbs oil, and does not stain.  </li>
            <li> have read other reviews where people say the brush delivery method is hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> That day came, and I opened the box, followed the directions to tap the little &#x27;stick&#x27; on something hard so it would allow the powder to get on the brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying it, the hair looks matt again and no more oily shiny looks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> months if not more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I usually get greasy hair by end of the day.</li>
            <li> And all without harsh chemicals or animal by-products!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t one today, and no matter how hard I hit - and you can imagine it&#x27;s not very pleasant to be hitting your head with a stiff brush - almost nothing ever comes out.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair, and this never leaves behind any whitish or gray residue.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the brush is hard to use.</li>
            <li> the powder has a hard time coming out.</li>
            <li> I have to shake it really hard to get anything out</li>
            <li> This product is messy and difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> In comparison, this dry shampoo has a scent that isn&#x27;t terrible, but I prefer the scent of other shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Fail!  </li>
            <li> As the title says, it is nigh impossible to get any powder out.</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave that awful white residue that most do.  My only complaint is it is a tiny container and not much comes out at a time.</li>
            <li> The product is portable and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The way it open and close helps to keep the powder from coming out.&lt;br /&gt;After applying it, the hair looks matt again and no more oily shiny looks.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the results I expected with this product.  It is difficult to tell if you are actually applying any product, and after letting it sit and brushing it out, I don&#x27;t notice any marked improvement in the condition of my hair.  It still looks as oily as it did before.</li>
            <li> The JONATHAN Green Rootine Dry Shampoo is an amazing product. I have tried numerous other brands and they always left my hair with white specks or weighed it down to the point it was difficult to style. I have really dark hair and the Dry Dark Shampoo takes the oily look out and leaves my hair feeling soft, manageable, and like I just washed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read other reviews where people say the brush delivery method is hard to get used to.

            <li> I recently got bangs and thought this would help with the end of the day oily bang syndrome.  It just causes static.  And then my bangs are all over the place.  It&#x27;s a great idea, but just don&#x27;t work for what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> I do not have greasy hair but I like to go a few days between shampoos.  By applying along the scalp and then brushing out it absorbs the excess oil to give me one extra day between shampoos.  I have dark hair and when I first put it on my hair I can see it but once I brush it in it disapears.  I have short hair and this product is just what I needed for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Fail!  I have super fine, straight hair and this product did not work as claimed at all.  I tried and tried to make it work, but to no avail.  I ended up throwing it in the trash; it was a complete waste of money.  Do not buy this product if you have fine, Caucasian hair - it will do nothing but waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I usually get greasy hair by end of the day. I wanted to use this for times I have to work long hours with no time to drive home for a quick shower before going out again at night. I used to try baby powder on my dark hair but it makes my hair look light-colored, almost grey, so the Jonathan Product Green Rootine Dry Shampoo for DARK hair was supposed to do  it. It does work BUT the amount of powder that comes out of the brush is too little that (even if I set it to max output) it takes forever to \\&quot;dry shampoo\\&quot; an entire head. It probably was designed for spot \\&quot;dry shampooing\\&quot;, which for me defeats the real purpose. Also, the brown powder stains my fair skinned scalp so it&#x27;s best NOT to apply too much near the roots, instead dab it on just the hair itself.</li>
            <li> Easy to extend a blowout with this product.  Adds volume to limp hair, absorbs oil, and does not stain.  My only complaint is that there is no scent to it.  A nice, clean scent would be a great improvement.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of work to have to actual powder come out, but once you got the technique down it&#x27;s pretty simple. The actual shampoo works excellent, takes the greasiness out of your hair without making is stiff as a board like spray-on shampoo. Definitely has less of a chemical smell than the spray-on type shampoos, as well. Just to get the powder out you gotta turn it upside down and shake it.</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed.  The product seems to work well and doesn&#x27;t make me itch or shy away from touching my hair like other dry shampoos.  In fact, it&#x27;s a pretty good root concealer, too.  But, it&#x27;s definitely not dark.  More like sandy brown - not dark brown.</li>
            <li> Have not had a chance to use as I was in the hospital and needed something before this arrived</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get the product out , the little bit you can get out of the brush is good product though</li>
            <li> As the title says, it is nigh impossible to get any powder out. The most upvoted review says that there is a dial to change how much product comes out. That review was posted in 2011, so I presume there used to be some kind of a dial. There isn&#x27;t one today, and no matter how hard I hit - and you can imagine it&#x27;s not very pleasant to be hitting your head with a stiff brush - almost nothing ever comes out. So I can&#x27;t tell if the powder actually works or not.</li>
            <li> This is a teeny, tiny bottle of product. The instructions for opening it were incomplete - there&#x27;s a pin you have to remove first.  Trying to get it open, I dumped about 1/4 of the bottle into my sink.  Once I got it working, it still drops powder all over my shirt.  I would instead recomend Osis hair powder, which is easier to apply and gives the same effect with a very small amount of product.</li>
            <li> I have an oily scalp and even though I shampoo daily my hair still gets oily after about eight hours. I purchased this as an alternative to Oscar Blandi Pronto Dry Shampoo. I like the Oscar Blandi but it goes on white and I thought this might be better with my darker hair. I didn&#x27;t  have a problem dispensing the product like some other reviewers but it seems the brush is not the ideal way to apply it, a shaker would be better.  That being said, it does not work half as well in controlling oil as the Oscar Blandi or just plain baby powder/talcum powder. Maybe I&#x27;ll mix the them together and try that!?</li>
            <li> It works incredibly well and I recommend this dry shampoo to all my friends. I don&#x27;t like the aerosol and weird, toxic ingredients of most dry shampoos. I have short, fine dark brown hair and I use this every other day between washes. The powder doesn&#x27;t show, it reduces the greasy look, and it adds volume and fluffiness to my hair. It travels very well.</li>
            <li> Only four stars as it is sometimes hard to shake out. I love that it is not white powder, blends better into my hair. Its also gluten free!</li>
            <li> This is everything I&#x27;ve been looking for in a dry shampoo!  I&#x27;ve tried countless other brands and always have some issue with the product.  JONATHAN restores your hair to a just-showered look without any strings (or stringiness) attached.  I have dark brown hair, and this never leaves behind any whitish or gray residue.  It doesn&#x27;t rub off or stain my pillowcases, clothing, or fingers if I touch my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell--in fact, it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all.  My hair is still soft and clean-feeling with it in.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, though a little messy at times, but I just make sure I&#x27;m standing over a sink to catch the excess during application and clean up is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is perfect to throw in your purse for touch-ups on the go.  It&#x27;s great for sweaty summer days at the beach, unexpected sleepovers, and any other time your hair starts to look a little too grody for comfort.  And all without harsh chemicals or animal by-products!</li>
            <li> I use this product when I am taking the kiddos to school before I go running so I don&#x27;t shower twice in the morning.  I don&#x27;t feel as gross!  Also, I have slightly darker roots than highlights and have been using the product to blend the two colors better.</li>
            <li> So fun I had to try it. Seems to work well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this product works well at all. I have very fine hair and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to the brush format or what, but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting any of the powder out and onto my hair. Too much of a struggle to make it work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this works well if you can figure out how to correctly dispense it.  Very pricey.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. The box doesn&#x27;t have fantastic directions and sometimes I really have to shake it to get the powder out, but when it works, it is awesome. Love that it is easy to blend into my hair and I don&#x27;t have to deal with white powder like the one-size-fits-all dry shampoos. Would definitely buy more and recommend to friends!</li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoos in the past and really liked how they gave my hair some volume, while minimizing oil and the resulting shine. In comparison, this dry shampoo has a scent that isn&#x27;t terrible, but I prefer the scent of other shampoos I&#x27;ve used. The thing I did like was the fact that it came in different shades so I could match the color of my hair and it didn&#x27;t look like I dumped baby powder on my head.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t review this as a &#x27;dry shampoo,&#x27; as I never got it to open properly!  After it arrived, I stuck it in my hair drawer to have on hand when I needed it.  That day came, and I opened the box, followed the directions to tap the little &#x27;stick&#x27; on something hard so it would allow the powder to get on the brush.  The stick broke.  Then I tried just hitting little knob that was left in the brush, and absolutely nothing - no powder!  I tried to return it, but I missed the deadline by a day!  I am sure there are other dry shampoos out there which would be more satisfactory.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like brown baby powder.  It works but it&#x27;s not the greatest dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  The Batiste brand is far superior.</li>
            <li> This product is messy and difficult to use.  Also, it makes your scalp orange.  It is overpriced, to boot.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a fragrance free dry shampoo, since I have allergies and chemical sensitivities. But I was even more excited when I tried it, and it worked! It takes a little effort to apply the right amount and rub it in, but I think it&#x27;s well worth it. My hair ends up looking clean and full of body without any visible powder residue. I have dark blond hair, and the light hair version blends in great. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> The design of the product leaves a bit to be desired. The brush idea sounds great, but the hole for the powder is just one small hole, so it doesn&#x27;t really cover the whole brush, but remains concentrated in the center, so when you put it onto your head, it doesn&#x27;t dust it, it just comes out kind of in blotches that you have to force out by bouncing it onto your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, you can see where it is being applied (at least I can because I have black hair) and then use your fingers to then kind of rub it into your scalp. The product doesn&#x27;t smell like anything, but does leave your hair feeling lighter and fresher. Also, it&#x27;s a nice small, compact tube, so it&#x27;s easy to bring with you anywhere.</li>
            <li> I feel like the brush is hard to use. the powder has a hard time coming out. I have to shake it really hard to get anything out</li>
