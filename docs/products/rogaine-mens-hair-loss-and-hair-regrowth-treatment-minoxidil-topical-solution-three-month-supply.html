            <li>I began with the Rogaine foam but switched to the solution because I believe more of it reaches my scalp where it is needed, and after I read a dermatologist&#x27;s website where he said he achieved better patient results with the solution.</li>

            <li> It was hard to get into a schedule with the Rogaine because it makes your head shiny and wet for almost 4 hours.  </li>
            <li> Rogaine caused worse balding, however after quitting it, it regrew some and is back to where it was before Rogaine.</li>
            <li> Until now, i dont see any change, i did shed few hair that before, still trying it, i feel, now the amount of hair fall is reducded.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know which of these products specifically or what combination is what&#x27;s helping me get my hair back, but I am not willing to risk cutting any one of them and losing all the progress made so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so anxious about my hair loss</li>
            <li> I still am not thrilled about using it twice a day and working with how my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> My hair is indeed thicker than when I began, but not as thick as it was when I was 25.  </li>
            <li> I hated using Rogaine at first.  </li>
            <li> The eye dropper design is a  bit messy and inconvenient in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> This item made my scalp tough and itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I am one out of 4 people who has no response to minoxidil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scary.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair look greasy and had really bad side effects.  </li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had high hopes for the Rogaine topical solution I ordered on Amazon. However, I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it enough to see any results.  The eye dropper design is a  bit messy and inconvenient in my opinion.  It was hard to get into a schedule with the Rogaine because it makes your head shiny and wet for almost 4 hours.  Putting it on and leaving the house was not really an option.  I found that when applying it at home I would accidentally end up with more on my furniture and bedding than I intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant attest to the effectiveness of the product, since the inconvenience of the liquid solution caused me to stop using it.  I have however invested in the foam version, and hope that makes a bit of a difference when it comes to consistently applying it 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I like the foam better.  I find that this one is harder to work with than the foam because it runs and makes it more difficult to target the area you want.</li>
            <li> It really works. Excellent product</li>
            <li> Rogaine caused worse balding, however after quitting it, it regrew some and is back to where it was before Rogaine.</li>
            <li> This item made my scalp tough and itch like crazy. I stopped using it and my scalp softened up. I purchased another product and my hair is almost completely grown back in. It may work for you but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Made my hair look greasy and had really bad side effects.  I had to stop using it after one day.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> IT was awesome. Got some hair back</li>
            <li> I got this for my roomate we shop at the store and they sale it for a much higher price. This thing works but dont expect you can stop using it beacase it is not a cure, but yes it works and you need to keep buying it for hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely working after 7 months and does not cause a breakout like a generic brand.</li>
            <li> Very drying. Time will tell about regrowth.</li>
            <li> Bait and Switch makes it look like you are getting the foam but once delivered it is actually topical.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Combined with Biotin pills, Revivogen shampoo and conditioner, Nizoral and Bosley hair gel, I have notice regrowth on my hairline and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know which of these products specifically or what combination is what&#x27;s helping me get my hair back, but I am not willing to risk cutting any one of them and losing all the progress made so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going on month 2 of this process and already seeing great results.</li>
            <li> My previous favorite hair regrower potion reduced their percentage of active ingredient so I went to this name brand. I have thinning hair at the hairline, esp on one side. I don&#x27;t use this as often as recommended, more like a few times a week, and just at night (as its supposed to be contraindicated for women.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so much fuller, and while it will never be and never has been a lush mane (except in the back!), I am really happy with the regrowth. In fact the side I was concentrating on, which was the sparser side, now is the more filled in side!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it doesn&#x27;t do anything untoward to my system, but in the conservative way I use it, I will take the chance. Vanity prevails.</li>
            <li> I am a woman in my 40&#x27;s with hereditary hair loss (androgenetic alopecia). I have lost 50% of my hair in the last two years. I was told to use 5% Rogaine twice daily by my dermatologist. Unfortunately for me, I am one out of 4 people who has no response to minoxidil. Very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fifty-five-year-old woman diagnosed with androgenic hair loss.  That is, I have a receding hairline.  It started as as small bald spot right in the front.  It started to grow.  I thought it was alopecia areata and went immediately to my dermatologist.  She ran every test in the book.  Finally, after a biopsy, I was diagnosed with the hereditary alopecia.  I have a head full of thick, pretty hair and I wasn&#x27;t about to go down without a fight!  She prescribed mens&#x27; Rogaine.  Even though it says it can&#x27;t be used in the front, it can.  The only warning she gave me is that it sometimes causes hair growth on the forehead.  Big deal, I can pluck it.  I also started taking a lot of fish oil, multi-vitamins and Saw Palmetto (which helps to reduce male hormones).  I hated using Rogaine at first.  It kind of made my hair look stiff and icky.  You have to work with it.  I squeeze the dropper full into the lid and then apply it with my fingers.  You have more control that way.  I apply it twice daily, faithfully.  I definitely see results!  I noticed continued shedding for the first several weeks, which is supposed to be  normal.  It&#x27;s scary.  I saw my bald spot grow instead of fill in.  Finally, after about four weeks it stopped.  When I look closely in a magnifying mirror I now see a lot of small new hair growth.  It&#x27;s been about seven weeks.  I was so anxious about my hair loss I was experiencing physical symptoms and lack of sleep.  I still am not thrilled about using it twice a day and working with how my hair looks.  But I&#x27;m getting used to it and just making it a part of my daily regimen... like brushing my teeth.  I only wash my hair every other day.  I find that if I put the Rogaine on right after I wash my hair while it&#x27;s still wet it styles much better.  I have read that Rogaine results are better if the hair loss is fairly new.  If you have been balding for a long time it may not work.  So, don&#x27;t delay, start it!  I highly recommend it.  I feel so much relief and hopeful.nd hopeful.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work as well as the foam product. You use a dropper apply the product in liquid form and it doesn&#x27;t have the ease of use the foam does.</li>
            <li> It works apply wherever you feel like..but be patience...</li>
            <li> I bought this item on the 6th of October, I have used it religiously since I bought it.  For me, this product did not work, I am almost at the end of two months using but I have not noticed any gains.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rogaine for about 18 months and am satisfied with the results. I began with the Rogaine foam but switched to the solution because I believe more of it reaches my scalp where it is needed, and after I read a dermatologist&#x27;s website where he said he achieved better patient results with the solution. I believe my satisfaction is based on realistic expectations. My hair is indeed thicker than when I began, but not as thick as it was when I was 25.  Rogaine is part of an overall strategy that involves using the right shampoo and conditioner (I use Nioxin System 6 for Noticeably Thinning hair), having the right haircut and style,, and using the right products. Use it as directed and as part of an overall strategy and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results. Oh - in hindsight I&#x27;d say, if you&#x27;re in doubt, start as soon as you think you may need it.</li>
            <li> Used twice a day for nine months I did not miss one day and I saw nothing no shedding no growth no nothing.</li>
            <li> Product name was why I purchased this.  Good for over plucked eye brows which it hasn&#x27;t be used for just yet.  There are sections on the Internet for getting one&#x27;s eye brows to grow.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I expected in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I need this product but it makes me itch.</li>
            <li> It was cheap and it works. Used it for many years and then stop. Now I&#x27;m back on it and its kicking in again.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like it........</li>
            <li> great product and fast shipment.. I recommend this product. This is my second bottle and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping... But this product maybe not suitable for people who have bald in front... please read carefully before purchase.</li>
            <li> Until now, i dont see any change, i did shed few hair that before, still trying it, i feel, now the amount of hair fall is reducded. will update this later</li>
