            <li>I was pleased</li>
            <li>Many people describe 2005 &amp;#34;MDC&amp;#34; as having noticeable tones of caramel and strawberry.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this scent.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this perfume a year ago.  </li>
            <li>and I love how I get compliments on the smell.  </li>
            <li>I get many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>My all-time favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 years and still love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Smells sophisticated and just makes you feel that much better because you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
            <li>Post-2011, if you intend to buy the original 1947 “Miss Dior” eau de parfum, be sure to buy “Miss Dior L’Originale.</li>
            <li>A very nice and sweet lingering smell that will definitely make heads turn.  </li>
            <li>So fresh!</li>
            <li>product I purchased here is the original 2005 eau de parfum &amp;#34;Miss Dior Cherie&amp;#34; created by Christine Nagel.  </li>
            <li>If you want to capture the original 2005 “Miss Dior Cherie” eau de parfum today, in the post-2011 era, buy “Miss Dior.”  </li>

            <li>So pretty!</li>
            <li>To be kind, the 2011 Demachy version has a certain charm...if you like your candy cane doused with flowers, Old Spice and re-tread tires.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I adore the aroma and nostalgia and the elegant niceties of that bygone era; eau de parfum was an essential, as important as hat or gloves.  </li>
            <li>But, what&#x27;s in a name, right, Juliet?  </li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>I would love to wear it all the time, but save it especially for date night!</li>
            <li>I first smelled this perfume from a sample in the magazine that a friend was look at while I was driving home.  </li>
            <li>The REAL &amp;#34;Miss Dior&amp;#34; is the original classic of the post-war era.  </li>
            <li>After some quick research, I realized Dior has been marketing the perfume under its new shortened name.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not liking it too much.</li>
            <li>or maybe iam just not use to spending that much.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>and I specifically went to make the purchase at a major retail chain and was willing to pay the $95.00 to $125.00 a bottle and much to my dismay</li>
            <li>To the eternal chagrin of true Diorians everywhere, this hogs wallop in a bow, bastardized from the 2005 Nagel &amp;#34;MDC&amp;#34; was presented to the public as the new “Miss Dior Cherie.”  </li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>There are not many things this New Orleans Diorian enjoys more than pretty glass bottles of volatile particles lining the shelves of her perfume collection.  </li>
            <li>In my mind, the original 2005 “MDC” embodies the freshness of youth on the threshold of life and the unknown.  </li>
            <li>Facts show the 2005 “MDC” began to outsell the original 1947 “Miss Dior” wildly and noticeably, causing the level of panic de perfumier which makes October 29, 1929 look less like Black Tuesday and more like Fat Tuesday.  </li>

            <li>It is light, floral and a little citrusy.</li>

            <li>&quot; when you order this product, as it&#x27;s simply the newer version of the same pretty scent.</li>
            <li>A little more flowerey than other Christian Dior scents.  </li>
            <li>Subtle, classy, floral but not too sweet, this is going to become my signature scent.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for about 10years now....Everything is PERFECT about Miss Dior!! And my ordering experience thru Amazon was perfect. The perfume was delivered 3 days before the actual delivery day...I was pleased</li>
            <li> A little more flowerey than other Christian Dior scents.  Very lovely though.  I’m happy with my purchase of Miss Dior.</li>

            <li> There are not many things this New Orleans Diorian enjoys more than pretty glass bottles of volatile particles lining the shelves of her perfume collection.  In normal times, proof of corporate chicanery would permanently bar a future relationship with the source of such essence-ial evil.  But, speak in hushed tones when you talk of Absinthe, K&amp;B Nectar Soda, the Forms of Plato, and Dior.  The sacred things in life must be preserved; sometimes, we must pardon and protect them from themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corporate chicanery causes the post-2011 Diorian to exercise diligent care in the selection and purchase of her chosen elixir.  The REAL &amp;#34;Miss Dior&amp;#34; is the original classic of the post-war era.  When I close my eyes, I can remember my paternal grandmother, pressing and releasing the atomizer, “whoosh,” misting me with the heavenly beads of scent as I played “dress up” in her gloves, pearls, pumps and netted hats.  I adore the aroma and nostalgia and the elegant niceties of that bygone era; eau de parfum was an essential, as important as hat or gloves.  Post-2011, if you intend to buy the original 1947 “Miss Dior” eau de parfum, be sure to buy “Miss Dior L’Originale.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I purchased here is the original 2005 eau de parfum &amp;#34;Miss Dior Cherie&amp;#34; created by Christine Nagel.  This product has been labeled &amp;#34;Miss Dior.&amp;#34;  But, what&#x27;s in a name, right, Juliet?  This eau de parfum enjoys aromatic ascendancy in my collection.  Many people describe 2005 &amp;#34;MDC&amp;#34; as having noticeable tones of caramel and strawberry.  I find its combination of innocence and seduction with a soupcon of patchouli to be ethereal and mystic.  In my mind, the original 2005 “MDC” embodies the freshness of youth on the threshold of life and the unknown.  It is a signature scent to be worn as a sign of happiness, so, be sure to buy &amp;#34;Miss Dior&amp;#34; to purchase this timeless essence and be the happy Diorian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s in a name?  Well, I will tell you.  Facts show the 2005 “MDC” began to outsell the original 1947 “Miss Dior” wildly and noticeably, causing the level of panic de perfumier which makes October 29, 1929 look less like Black Tuesday and more like Fat Tuesday.  Unfortunately, neither commercial ethics nor common sense prevailed; a game of “cuckold the consumer” commenced in earnest.  A campaign of repackaging, re-coloring, re-labeling and reformulating nearly every product in sight culminated in 2011 when Francois Demachy burst forth with a &amp;#34;new MDC&amp;#34;.

            <li> Excellent product. I bought this for my girlfriend and she can&#x27;t stop thanking me. Highly recommended. This was money well spent.</li>
            <li> Love love love this scent. It is light, floral and a little citrusy. I get a lot of compliments and people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume from a sample in the magazine that a friend was look at while I was driving home.  She rubbed the sample perfume and I fell in love with the fragrance.  I love this perfume!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this perfume a year ago.  The price was right and I love how I get compliments on the smell.  Only wished it came in a gift set, but I suppose I can wait until the Christmas season to get another one.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that the formulation of the product is so very different (or at least, what I got, was so much less potent and dissimilar to previous bottles of Miss Dior) that I will never purchase this perfume online again. It&#x27;s just not worth the disappointment when you get an inferior product after having still spent a substantial amount of money for it.</li>
            <li> Only scent I will ever wear. It is absolutely perfect. I get many compliments when I wear it. Miss Dior is exquisite!</li>
            <li> I have used Christian Dior Miss Cherie for years and I specifically went to make the purchase at a major retail chain and was willing to pay the $95.00 to $125.00 a bottle and much to my dismay, I was told that not only had the name changed but the formula had been changed as well. I was so upset because this is \\&quot;my fragrance\\&quot;. You know the one we all find that we wear for life. So I had to make a change to another fragrance and I&#x27;m not liking it too much. I wish they would change it back.</li>
            <li> the perfume smells good. I have to say a bit pricey for the size bottle. or maybe iam just not use to spending that much. overall smells good</li>
