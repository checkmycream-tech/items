            <li>Still loving this product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to take a picture because it was kind of crazy/scary</li>
            <li>I bought this product as a gift and it was reported to me the user liked the product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for some time and find it quite effective.</li>
            <li>I have really liked all the murad products in the resurgence line, but this product has a offensive odor to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Murad Age Reform for a month and can honestly say I love this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love Murrad</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin glow too.</li>
            <li>Noticeably smoother &amp; more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels tighter and looks better.</li>
            <li>I love this product, have been using for about a month now, can tell the difference with my skin, it keeps foliating itself.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on my skin all the time, and I love how it smells (lavender).</li>
            <li>Love these prices compared to retail.</li>
            <li>She has used it for so many years.</li>
            <li>Have used this for two years along with the Murad Refreshing Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will be satified.</li>
            <li>The pump has to be pressed many times to get anything out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>love it, works for me</li>
            <li>For this kind of price (and I paid full price before I found it on Amazon cheaper), you&#x27;d think they would have experimented with the functionality of the packaging.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 2 years now, its great for fighting acne and keeping skin looking young.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Murad products but cannot always afford to spend so much on their products.</li>
            <li>Helps decrease fine lines, wrinkles and with firmness.</li>
            <li>but I bet that I will be lucky to get 75% of it out--and at this price?!?</li>
            <li>Use every night and makes the texture of my skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s really light and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I am not a pricey creams kindof woman, but this keeps my face blemish free and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m new to Murad, and like some of the products more than others, but this is at the top of the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin</li>
            <li>First, let me state that I actually love this product.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best facial product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic for a woman my age (40&#x27;s) who wants to take better care of her skin.  </li>
            <li>I was attracted by the lower price, and most certainly got a lower quality product.  </li>
            <li>I used my Sephora points to get the Murad Age Reform deluxe sample of Murad&#x27;s Complete Reform.</li>
            <li>If you shave or wax, its also good to use daily to prevent any ingrown hairs if you get those.</li>
            <li>I will update once I see the full results</li>
            <li>It goes on very nicely, isn&#x27;t greasy and sinks into your skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I put it on and my face started burning and turning super splotchy</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because I don&#x27;t think its for me, but maybe for more mature skin.</li>
            <li>I feel like it has helped clear up my skin and my skin looks a lot more even toned in conjunction with the intensive wrinkle reducer.</li>
            <li>Great product for clearing dead skin cells gently every night!</li>
            <li>The best part found it for almost half the regular price of the spa.</li>
            <li>It does have a bit of a funny smell and will sting if you have open acne sores but its very effective in drying up and healing open acne wounds quickly.  </li>
            <li>I first tried it in the kit and had to continue ordering it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels tighter and actually appears more youthful.  </li>
            <li>I only which it was more affordable....</li>
            <li>Moisturizing is an absolute MUST!  </li>
            <li>Really helps to refine the texture of the skin!  </li>
            <li>and now I must unscrew the pump and knock the lotion out into my palm--not exactly desirable considering that I am also NOT going to be able to get the last of the lotion out and it will go in the trash.</li>
            <li>It worked so well for me that I can now feel confident enough to go a day without make up.</li>
            <li>Love this product.... can definitely see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>it had a positive impact.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product as a sample that gave me a week&#x27;s worth of use and was very surprised it the results..</li>
            <li>Nothing dramatic so far, but I&#x27;m hoping for great results!  </li>
            <li>It does sink in to the skin nicely, but it stings slightly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for the amount of money I paid compared to the normal price but the lotion is yellow and oily.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to give a fair review.  </li>
            <li>Normally I really like Murad products, but not this one.  </li>
            <li>didnt really do much to my skin..</li>
            <li>I follow this up with a moisturizer and it really brings out a glow with my skin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>This makes me question it&#x27;s efficacy because I really didn&#x27;t notice any changes to my skin after using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I really think this product makes a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Really tightens your skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>One squirt and my whole face is done.  </li>
            <li>look, how it feels, skin tone is much more&lt;</li>
            <li>Miracle Murad Complete Reform!!!</li>
            <li>Murad is a new favorite of mine after trying many similar products in typical retail stores.</li>
            <li>I have for years, used many different facial products to help reduce any and all signs of aging and this particular product will remain a permanent item on my \\&quot;skin care\\&quot; shelf!!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and from the first time I tried Murad reform</li>
            <li>Fortunately, Amazon.com has allowed me to make these purchases very affordable and since I&#x27;ve tried the Complete Reform, I have noticed such a difference in the complexion of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product previously and love it.  </li>
            <li>This is a mild glycolic so please use a mositurizer (Murad&#x27;s Hydrodynamic Ultimate Moisture works wonders!).  </li>
            <li>Mild enough to use every night.</li>
            <li>Do be careful though, the pump in this one broke pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li>A little tingle when you first put it on your face and this goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I returned the first bottle thinking it was simply defective</li>
            <li>Really makes older skin look younger.</li>
            <li>After gave a tried on the sample of Murad Complete Reform with Glyco Firming complex, my skin reform to smoothly and firmly right away.  </li>
            <li>Being a complete product &amp;#34;ho&amp;#34;, I tried this for two weeks and didn&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin following the instructions.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be gentle enough for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin or anything like that</li>
            <li>but I was busy trying to fix it.....  </li>
            <li>or if maybe it&#x27;s old</li>
            <li>but it seemed to be old product.</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all and this product felt like it burned on my face.</li>
            <li>Really hydrates dry skin</li>
            <li>I am 52 years old and am a red head with a ruddy complexion naturally</li>
            <li>I have found nothing better than this to clear up dark spots/marks from my face in such little time.</li>
            <li>After this experience I am likely just going to buy the Age Reform sampler kit to get the 0.33 oz tube of the Glyco because it is likely more economical all around and at least I can get the last of the lotion out of the little 0.33 oz tube.</li>
            <li>Have used Myrad for 6 months, face is much softer, only need very small amount for each Myrad product, meaning the $$$ you spend on it is quite economical.</li>
            <li>When you first try it, use it every other day to see your skin&#x27;s tolerance until you can build up to daily use.  </li>

            <li> When you first try it, use it every other day to see your skin&#x27;s tolerance until you can build up to daily use.  </li>
            <li> Skin smoother and dark spots nearly gone in a month!</li>
            <li> The price is unbelievable in comparison and will certainly repurchase when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Apparently when the bottle changed from white to dark gray, the pump mechanism changed as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li> I use other Murad products so it is possible that I am resilient to some of the products?</li>
            <li> Why did this happen?&lt;br /&gt;Because the formula has been changed or that&#x27;s not exactly the same product that I expecting?&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> , oily in t-zone and dry elsewhere...all this just evens out....  </li>
            <li> and I feel like this really helps firm up my skin without a heavy oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;even, moisture is not too oily or dry, balances out any problem areas you may have had...uneven patches, rough patches,&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels great after cleansing and under the moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, I am very disappointed by this pump bottle.</li>
            <li> This is so silky feeling and makes your skin look so luminous and feel so silky after the first time you use it!&lt;br /&gt;It makes a dramatic effect after each week you have been using it; and at one month....</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in only a few days.</li>
            <li> It sinks in and leaves my skin feeling silky if that makes</li>
            <li> I have only used the product for a few days but have noticed improvement in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t do what I expected, based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> and I do see some small improvement in the smaller wrinkles</li>
            <li> My skin tone has evened out and there is a freshness to my skin that was not there with other products.  </li>
            <li> So this is not the same lotion I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Since it requires such a small amount each time, it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> It makes me think that this seller purchased defective bottles and sold half empty or altered in some way.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is the price and that the company keeps changing its products.</li>
            <li> Like a few other reviews, the pump stopped working after about a month</li>
            <li> product that compared with the previous Sample (got it from Sephora).  </li>
            <li> I feel like It made a slight difference.</li>
            <li> A little does go along way.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft and I see that it has made my skin smoother and taken away weird little road bumps that were coming up on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m afraid to even spend that much money and try it out.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin firm and glowing</li>
            <li> Works well to tighten and refine the skin surface without being as harsh as the Retin-A.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no strong odor</li>
            <li> Then, out of curiosity, I popped off the little cap on the bottom of the bottle and was SHOCKED to see that the product is only housed in the UPPER INCH or so of the pump bottle--what a waste of plastic!</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> : /  </li>
            <li> and this product has helped to take out some of the redness, reduce bumps and a small scar ..</li>
            <li> Not sure about this product yet.</li>
            <li> Received a small sample one in the sampler packs and wanted the biggest size I could find.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Normally I really like Murad products, but not this one.  Made my skin break out (which never happens) and didn&#x27;t improve the texture/tone/look of my skin in any way.</li>
            <li> Great product for clearing dead skin cells gently every night!</li>
            <li> Really hydrates dry skin and I do see some small improvement in the smaller wrinkles</li>
            <li> Great product. I love Murrad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Murad products but cannot always afford to spend so much on their products. Fortunately, Amazon.com has allowed me to make these purchases very affordable and since I&#x27;ve tried the Complete Reform, I have noticed such a difference in the complexion of my skin. I have for years, used many different facial products to help reduce any and all signs of aging and this particular product will remain a permanent item on my \\&quot;skin care\\&quot; shelf!!</li>
            <li> didnt really do much to my skin..I dont think this is a good investment.</li>
            <li> one of the greatest product ever used. The results were rapid, in about 4 days my skin improved drastically in respect of lift, skin tone and overall appearance.  Thank you Dr. Murad</li>
            <li> I first tried it in the kit and had to continue ordering it. I saw a difference in only a few days. Do be careful though, the pump in this one broke pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Have used Myrad for 6 months, face is much softer, only need very small amount for each Myrad product, meaning the $$$ you spend on it is quite economical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> Being a complete product &amp;#34;ho&amp;#34;, I tried this for two weeks and didn&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin following the instructions. I use other Murad products so it is possible that I am resilient to some of the products? Not sure. Tried it...moving on.</li>
            <li> Still loving this product. My skin feels tighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks, but it seems to be doing the job.  My skin feels tighter and actually appears more youthful.  Nothing dramatic so far, but I&#x27;m hoping for great results!  There&#x27;s no strong odor and it seems to be gentle enough for my sensitive skin.  I only which it was more affordable....</li>
            <li> I used my Sephora points to get the Murad Age Reform deluxe sample of Murad&#x27;s Complete Reform. I&#x27;ve been using them for about a week and noticed that I started developing tiny whiteheads. It does sink in to the skin nicely, but it stings slightly. I gave it 2 stars because I don&#x27;t think its for me, but maybe for more mature skin. I am 28 with very fair skin.</li>
            <li> This product takes some time to see results.  I tried it for about a month last year and didn&#x27;t care for it but now I love it!  I use it once at night after cleanse and tone.  Moisturizing is an absolute MUST!  This is a mild glycolic so please use a mositurizer (Murad&#x27;s Hydrodynamic Ultimate Moisture works wonders!).  When you first try it, use it every other day to see your skin&#x27;s tolerance until you can build up to daily use.  Really helps to refine the texture of the skin!  I just turned 40 in December and all of my clients are shocked because I look like I&#x27;m 28</li>
            <li> I love it. My skin has never felt so soft and I see that it has made my skin smoother and taken away weird little road bumps that were coming up on my cheeks. I love how it makes my skin glow too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin or anything like that but omg, this stuff tried to kill me.  I put it on and my face started burning and turning super splotchy, I washed it off twice and my face and neck was still all red and blotchy.  I wanted to take a picture because it was kind of crazy/scary but I was busy trying to fix it.....  : /  Definitely will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product as a sample that gave me a week&#x27;s worth of use and was very surprised it the results.. My skin tone has evened out and there is a freshness to my skin that was not there with other products.  I am 52 years old and am a red head with a ruddy complexion naturally and this product has helped to take out some of the redness, reduce bumps and a small scar .. I follow this up with a moisturizer and it really brings out a glow with my skin.</li>
            <li> Shipped and arrived as promised. Love this product!  Noticeably smoother &amp; more even skin tone.  Murad is a new favorite of mine after trying many similar products in typical retail stores.</li>
            <li> This is smoothing my skin and getting rid of surface irregularities along the way.  I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
            <li> Can see a difference after just one night&#x27;s use.  But this will be the second one I&#x27;ve returned as I can&#x27;t get the lotion out of the bottle!  Apparently when the bottle changed from white to dark gray, the pump mechanism changed as well. I returned the first bottle thinking it was simply defective but now I&#x27;m experiencing the same with the second bottle.  For this kind of price (and I paid full price before I found it on Amazon cheaper), you&#x27;d think they would have experimented with the functionality of the packaging.</li>
            <li> Good product although very small .</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Skin feels tighter and looks better. The best part found it for almost half the regular price of the spa.</li>
            <li> I love this product, have been using for about a month now, can tell the difference with my skin, it keeps foliating itself. Yes, I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. Really makes older skin look younger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the amount of money I paid compared to the normal price but the lotion is yellow and oily. I am wondering if it is supposed to be that way or if maybe it&#x27;s old</li>
            <li> I love my murad! This is a wonderful product. Mild enough to use every night. Leaves you with softer, firmer skin in the morning.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this product yet. Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  I get compliments on my skin all the time, and I love how it smells (lavender).</li>
            <li> This is like gold to me!!!  Keeps my skin firm and glowing</li>
            <li> My favorite Murad product! Use every night and makes the texture of my skin so smooth.  Love these prices compared to retail.</li>
            <li> After gave a tried on the sample of Murad Complete Reform with Glyco Firming complex, my skin reform to smoothly and firmly right away.  That&#x27;s the reason why I decided to ordered this 1.0 fl. oz. pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product arrived, found out the color of bottle is \\&quot;BLACK\\&quot;, different from the Ads. that shown \\&quot;WHITE\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle same as the sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wondering if Murad had changed it recently and start to use this product, I can feel it&#x27;s totally&lt;br /&gt;Different product that compared with the previous Sample (got it from Sephora).  Why did this happen?&lt;br /&gt;Because the formula has been changed or that&#x27;s not exactly the same product that I expecting?&lt;br /&gt;Just disappointed.</li>
            <li> No burning! No peeling! Use this immediately after my morning shower and it is great! Skin smoother and dark spots nearly gone in a month!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a gift and it was reported to me the user liked the product. She has used it for so many years.</li>
            <li> Have used this for two years along with the Murad Refreshing Cleanser. Great product line!</li>
            <li> The product itself came out yellow. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s normal but it seemed to be old product. This makes me question it&#x27;s efficacy because I really didn&#x27;t notice any changes to my skin after using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I really think this product makes a difference in my skin.  I only use it at night before bed.</li>
            <li> Delivery of the product exceeded my expectations.  I&#x27;ve used the product previously and love it.  However, I had never purchased through AMAZON.  The price is unbelievable in comparison and will certainly repurchase when the time comes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 years now, its great for fighting acne and keeping skin looking young.  It does have a bit of a funny smell and will sting if you have open acne sores but its very effective in drying up and healing open acne wounds quickly.  I use the murad anti aging skin line to keep good looking skin and this is part of the package.  If you shave or wax, its also good to use daily to prevent any ingrown hairs if you get those.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using this product.  Received a small sample one in the sampler packs and wanted the biggest size I could find.  I&#x27;m sure I will be satified.</li>
            <li> Really tightens your skin.</li>
            <li> Great for the aging women! Helps decrease fine lines, wrinkles and with firmness. A little tingle when you first put it on your face and this goes away quickly.  This is a great product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and great price through amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It goes on very nicely, isn&#x27;t greasy and sinks into your skin quickly. I feel like it has helped clear up my skin and my skin looks a lot more even toned in conjunction with the intensive wrinkle reducer. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> So this is not the same lotion I&#x27;ve used in the past. I could handle the bottle color changing, but not the lotion, and if it did change, why orange?  The pump has to be pressed many times to get anything out of the bottle.  It makes me think that this seller purchased defective bottles and sold half empty or altered in some way.  You get what you pay for, I suppose.  I was attracted by the lower price, and most certainly got a lower quality product.  Don&#x27;t do what I did, go back and get the product from a source you trust.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Murad Age Reform for a month and can honestly say I love this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to Murad, and like some of the products more than others, but this is at the top of the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and I feel like this really helps firm up my skin without a heavy oily feeling.  A little does go along way.  One squirt and my whole face is done.  It sinks in and leaves my skin feeling silky if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial product.  I&#x27;ve noticed a definite firming of my skin and my pours have gotten a lot smaller.  This stuff is fantastic for a woman my age (40&#x27;s) who wants to take better care of her skin.  Plus it&#x27;s really light and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> First, let me state that I actually love this product. It feels great after cleansing and under the moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, I am very disappointed by this pump bottle. Like a few other reviews, the pump stopped working after about a month and now I must unscrew the pump and knock the lotion out into my palm--not exactly desirable considering that I am also NOT going to be able to get the last of the lotion out and it will go in the trash. Then, out of curiosity, I popped off the little cap on the bottom of the bottle and was SHOCKED to see that the product is only housed in the UPPER INCH or so of the pump bottle--what a waste of plastic! After this experience I am likely just going to buy the Age Reform sampler kit to get the 0.33 oz tube of the Glyco because it is likely more economical all around and at least I can get the last of the lotion out of the little 0.33 oz tube. The pump bottle is supposed to be 1.0 oz  but I bet that I will be lucky to get 75% of it out--and at this price?!?</li>
            <li> I have found nothing better than this to clear up dark spots/marks from my face in such little time. It worked so well for me that I can now feel confident enough to go a day without make up. My skin looks great!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this, as I already use prescription Retin-A. I am glad I did. Works well to tighten and refine the skin surface without being as harsh as the Retin-A. I alternate use daily and use this under the Murad Hydro-Dynamic Ultimate. Great combo for awesome skin!</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for years.  Some work.  Some don&#x27;t.  This works!</li>
            <li> I have only used the product for a few days but have noticed improvement in the condition of my skin. I will update once I see the full results</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and from the first time I tried Murad reform it had a positive impact. It definitely delivers!</li>
            <li> I am not a pricey creams kindof woman, but this keeps my face blemish free and soft.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the price and that the company keeps changing its products.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all and this product felt like it burned on my face. I don&#x27;t know if this is the same as the one in the actualy murad store but I&#x27;m afraid to even spend that much money and try it out. I feel like It made a slight difference.</li>
            <li> love it, works for me</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time and find it quite effective. Since it requires such a small amount each time, it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> Immediate results for me!</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t do what I expected, based on other reviews. I believe everyone&#x27;s skin reacts different, so try it. It may work for you.</li>
            <li> I have really liked all the murad products in the resurgence line, but this product has a offensive odor to me. I would not recommend this product,</li>
            <li> Love this product.... can definitely see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to give a fair review.  I was a devoted &amp;#34;Night Reform&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Product user which I was hoping this product took the place of.  It has a different&lt;br /&gt;consistency so the jury&#x27;s out for now.</li>
            <li> This is so silky feeling and makes your skin look so luminous and feel so silky after the first time you use it!&lt;br /&gt;It makes a dramatic effect after each week you have been using it; and at one month....it is amazing to see&lt;br /&gt;the effects it has made to transform the effects of you skins feeling, look, how it feels, skin tone is much more&lt;br /&gt;even, moisture is not too oily or dry, balances out any problem areas you may have had...uneven patches, rough patches,&lt;br /&gt;redness, oily in t-zone and dry elsewhere...all this just evens out....  Miracle Murad Complete Reform!!!</li>
