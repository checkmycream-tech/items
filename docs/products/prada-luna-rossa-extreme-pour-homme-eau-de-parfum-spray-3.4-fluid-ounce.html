            <li>So I&#x27;m very happy and</li>
            <li>Shipment was expedient and the fragrance is perfect</li>
            <li>THE SCENT IS AWESOME.  </li>
            <li>Smells great!</li>
            <li>Excellent aroma.</li>
            <li>from beautiful Armenia.</li>
            <li>wonderful product and even better price!</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT...</li>
            <li>I would say longevity is about a good 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Brother loved his gift.</li>
            <li>too good, a scent that lingers a lot and legencia smell that leaves a mark.</li>
            <li>This smells good..</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>and I wish all men smelled like this. :)</li>
            <li>but I will say there are better fragrances on the market.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this fragrance as soon as I smelled it at Macy&#x27;s, but their price was ludicrous in comparison.  </li>
            <li>What I like most is that this fragrance steps away from the crowd, so you won&#x27;t get that feeling of &amp;</li>
            <li>This fragrance is amazing, the smell is not too strong, has a touch of spice but also a sweet smell, my hubby loves it</li>
            <li>I was very well pleased.</li>
            <li>Has a somewhat sweet smell but also spicy</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a fragrance that separates itself from the Cool Water and Aqua di Gio crowd, this may be your ticket.</li>
            <li>When I initially put it on it was very overwhelming, too strong.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered!  </li>
            <li>Shipping was free, it was almost half the price as the retail store, would purchase again for sure!</li>
            <li>My brother got this cologne for him,but he thought, it was fresh without reading,but it wasn&#x27;t, then he give to my husband Christmas present, and I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I like the regular better</li>
            <li>It last all day and smells better by the hour...</li>
            <li>I like it ok, but it didn&#x27;t smell quite the same as the magazine fold out.</li>
            <li>Shipment arrived ahead of schedule, and the quality is first class.</li>
            <li>but the standard Luna Rossa is still better.</li>
            <li>This is a classy man&#x27;s fragrance that would likely be suitable for an evening out.  </li>
            <li>Not at all a useful product and down not seem original Prada</li>
            <li>this might work for a older person like 40 and over</li>
            <li>i ordered this Parfum thinking it should last long, but it does not even stay for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>Makes the ladies go crazy :) Makes you smell like a man!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This scent is addicting, that&#x27;s the only way too describe it. I&#x27;ve been wearing Prada scents for years and saw this had three (3) left so picked up two of them.</li>
            <li> Was what i expected .love it</li>
            <li> I was very well pleased.</li>
            <li> My brother got this cologne for him,but he thought, it was fresh without reading,but it wasn&#x27;t, then he give to my husband Christmas present, and I love the fragrance. So I&#x27;m very happy and my husband too.</li>
            <li> I like the regular better this might work for a older person like 40 and over</li>
            <li> i ordered this Parfum thinking it should last long, but it does not even stay for more than an hour. Not at all a useful product and down not seem original Prada</li>
            <li> It is an oriental spicy fragrance.  Has a somewhat sweet smell but also spicy, it is a man&#x27;s scent.  Has both a pepper &amp; lavender smell to it. When I initially put it on it was very overwhelming, too strong.&lt;br /&gt;But after about 1/2 to 1 hour the scent &amp;#34;matured&amp;#34; and you could smell all the parts to this cologne.  I would say longevity is about a good 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I read this somewhere in which somewhat stated for a serious classy man, very well said.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is amazing, the smell is not too strong, has a touch of spice but also a sweet smell, my hubby loves it and so do i! It last all day and smells better by the hour... Def would recommend! Shipping was free, it was almost half the price as the retail store, would purchase again for sure!</li>
            <li> Makes the ladies go crazy :) Makes you smell like a man! (so ive been told)</li>
            <li> Shipment was expedient and the fragrance is perfect</li>
            <li> Great. Brother loved his gift. I love the smell and I wish all men smelled like this. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greetings from beautiful Armenia.</li>
            <li> wonderful product and even better price!</li>
            <li> grown man smell! must have item.</li>
            <li> too good, a scent that lingers a lot and legencia smell that leaves a mark.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT...THE SCENT IS AWESOME.  HOWEVER, THE TIME IT TOOK TO GET TO ME WAS TOO LONG.</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne because I smelled it in a magazine fold out. I like it ok, but it didn&#x27;t smell quite the same as the magazine fold out. My friend hates it tho and says it smells like Lysol. I would recommend it but I will say there are better fragrances on the market.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered!  Smells great!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this fragrance as soon as I smelled it at Macy&#x27;s, but their price was ludicrous in comparison.  It&#x27;s a seriously spicy scent that frankly doesn&#x27;t have much in common with other designer fragrances.  I&#x27;d characterize it as having lots of  lavender, cinnamon, tobacco and maybe a bit of sandalwood.  This is the same as Luna Rossa but turned up a notch so I would apply sparingly to avoid overpowering a room.  This is a classy man&#x27;s fragrance that would likely be suitable for an evening out.  What I like most is that this fragrance steps away from the crowd, so you won&#x27;t get that feeling of &amp;#34;This smells like...&amp;#34;  It oozes sophistication.  If you&#x27;re looking for a fragrance that separates itself from the Cool Water and Aqua di Gio crowd, this may be your ticket.</li>
            <li> My experience was terriffic! Shipment arrived ahead of schedule, and the quality is first class.</li>
            <li> This smells good.. to me has a slight chocolate smell...  but the standard Luna Rossa is still better.</li>
            <li> Excellent aroma. Doesn&#x27;t last as long as you would expect for parfum. Makes you wonder if you should get it from a big box store</li>
