            <li>The Conair Curling Brush was amazing!  </li>
            <li>You can easily change the voltage so it was perfect.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the brush is good.</li>
            <li>I used the dryer a couple times at home before the trip and loved it.</li>
            <li>Good for travel.</li>
            <li>The good thing is it does convert to the euro system.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly on a Bob cut on my straight hair!</li>
            <li>Glad I got it!</li>
            <li>Worked amazing</li>
            <li>Nice bristles.  </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that this device could be used without a voltage converter as it converted the voltage itself.</li>
            <li>I had one before, so I knew I liked it.  </li>
            <li>So, the handwriting on the wall is that they won&#x27;t stand by their own product, but buyer beware.</li>
            <li>Good size with controls that are easy to understand.  </li>
            <li>I find it very easy to use and control.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my dtr, I love mineðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>When I got to Italy, I switched the voltage switch to 250 on the curling brush, used the appropriate plug adapter and turned it on.  </li>
            <li>I received this as a Christmas gift and it is OK</li>
            <li>but I think it would work better on someone that has longer hair.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the instructions to set the curling brush to the lower voltage and use the adapters while in Europe.</li>
            <li>The power was excellent and the drying time the same as in the U.S.</li>
            <li>Switched this over to appropriate wattage in Italy and plugged in using the appropriate converter and it burned up within a couple minutes.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, the brush curling iron I currently use is perfect for shorter hair</li>
            <li>Better for longer hair.  </li>
            <li>However, I was thrilled to find one of the curling brushes available in dual voltage because I often travel out of the country.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best for someone with shorter, fine hair, as the barrel and brushes are longer than some similar type dryers.</li>
            <li>With that being said if you have natural hair ladies I&#x27;d advise you to find another more sturdy blow dryer the bristles are great though just flimsy</li>
            <li>Easy to exchange brushes.</li>
            <li>Easily falls off the handle.</li>
            <li>I like the two sizes of barrels and they are easy to install.</li>
            <li>I like the curling brush; it&#x27;s compact, easy to store and to pack  when I travel.</li>
            <li>As you get used to using brush it works just fine .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a curling brush in Lucca, Italy and it worked fine the rest of the trip.</li>
            <li>Had room in the suitcase, so threw it in at the last minute and was very glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Works great &amp; u only need the plug adapter instead of the transformer.</li>
            <li>I needed to find a tool that would work for me and fit the travel requirements as outlined by our tour rules.  </li>
            <li>While it is a bit large, it is fairly light and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It helps tremendously in managing my curls making it so much easy and faster.</li>
            <li>My hair takes its shape easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have not been totally satisfied with something purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The power is much lower on this unit than on most, but that was fine with me.</li>
            <li>I mostly dry my hair before  using this curing brush and my hair looked great.</li>
            <li>The large barrel has plastic bristles which I dislike and no place on the site was I able to find that information.</li>
            <li>However, you have to remember to switch it to the right voltage!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off with a reasonable blow dryer and brushes of your choice.</li>
            <li>The brush is too soft and slides over my hair instead of catching hold of it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product as a good alternative to trying to find a transformer that actually works.</li>
            <li>I did not purchase it from Amazon and to deal with Conair to try and get it repaired will cost me as much as purchasing a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments on this unit are very easy to interchange; Conair should use this design on every one of their products!</li>
            <li>My hair is short (but not real short) and it worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I needed something that would style my hair quickly, and add volume and a bit of a finish to the end of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It also cools quickly</li>
            <li>But, it didn&#x27;t heat up to a very hot temperature.  </li>
            <li>I expected a more powerful curling brush as it said it was 50% more powerful.</li>
            <li>The core of the brush seems to be heated by the airflow only and never get terribly warm.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the newer ones with &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; (causes static) vs this one with the harder curling spikes (much better) and no tangling or burning of face, scalp or hands.</li>
            <li>After having used the Helen of Troy with the PLASTIC BARREL (!), my experience has been that this metal-barreled brush is far more effective.</li>
            <li>But, It would be nice to have an additional brush or comb attachment smaller in diameter for shorter hair.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly but wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>and this one is priced right and works for us.</li>
            <li>I bought it to use in Europe- dual voltage, right?  </li>
            <li>The teeth broke off right away.  </li>
            <li>When set for the higher voltage, it will only run on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; but this was as effective as the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting on the lower voltage in the US.  </li>
            <li>Liked it so much, we ordered a second one as a back-up.</li>
            <li>I used it on the low setting only (per the instructions) in Great Britain and Ireland with no problem.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the bristles are soft which we like and heat is fine.</li>
            <li>I used the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting and was happy with how hard the blower blew and how hot the barrel became.</li>
            <li>Well, it blew the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>B001G1CTWY Conair Curling Brush 1.5\\&quot; Hot Air Dual Voltage]]</li>
            <li>It has 2 speeds, and i use the higher.</li>
            <li>I have had two more of these in past and love them  never had a problem .</li>
            <li>I also love it for touching up my hair the second day after washing/styling (dry hair -</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get warm, much less hot on</li>
            <li>Plus you need to run it on the higher setting to get much heat out of it.</li>
            <li>If I had written this review before this past week I would have given the brush 5 stars, I loved it.</li>
            <li>I bought it prior to my trip to France to see how I liked it generally.  </li>
            <li>But once in Italy and using the high-voltage option, the low setting worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I ended up happy with the product, although I prefer soft bristles to the hard ones on this product.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research to choose this product yet the dryer isn&#x27;t strong enough for my hair and the bristles aren&#x27;t long enough or strong enough to grab my hair effectively for styling purposes.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product in the 1.5\\&quot; size.</li>
            <li>The dual voltage curling iron brush worked really well in Italy.</li>
            <li>Does the job at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>Otherwise the product works very well.</li>
            <li>Utterly useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this to the seller (HOUSEWARES), who were, btw, fantastic to deal with.</li>
            <li>so I was very worried about looking presentable in Europe this fall.</li>
            <li>Works very well here.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well in the U.K.</li>
            <li>I do like this Conair, it works very well.</li>
            <li>I have not found that these devices are capable of creating curls as some advertise</li>
            <li>other thing I loved about this unit was the big brush.</li>
            <li>I am still using it at home, choosing it over the many other curling brushes/irons in my arsenal of hair tools.  </li>
            <li>The low setting on Europe current  delivered much more power than it had in the USA and the brush did a fine job providing body and style to my short hair.</li>
            <li>(I gave up); using it on dry hair is only minimally effective on the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting.  </li>
            <li>my medium length hair is left full and shiny.</li>
            <li>In the past I have always liked &amp; trusted Conair products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saving my brush for my many European trips as I have a similar one in 110V.</li>
            <li>Using it as dual voltage was the main reason I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>It will not even allow the user to click it to high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I had high hopes that it would solve my hair problems with curly hair in Europe.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4c hair with a lot of shrinkage!!</li>
            <li>This is nothing more than an anemic blow dryer with a couple of inferior round brushes you can attach to the end.  </li>
            <li>has no power and does not get hot enough to curl straight hair.  </li>
            <li>The converter worked fine for the other stuff I took.</li>
            <li>Back home I changed the setting back to US strength, and it is working fine.</li>
            <li>As reported by other reviewers, it makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>The bristles are different on each, but both are long enough and effective for me.</li>
            <li>Wish Conair would come out with a new ceramic model...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this Conair 1.5\\&quot; Hot Air Dual Voltage Curling Brush.  </li>
            <li>Adds body and slight curl to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to read the reviews documenting that this works in Europe, even though only on the Low setting.</li>
            <li>It works, but would take me hours to dry/curl my hair, which is pretty short.</li>
            <li>One that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34;, etc~ Same price point and that blows hot air like this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed a dual voltage hot air curling brush for a recent overseas trip.</li>
            <li>The low setting is pretty wimpy.</li>
            <li>The smaller brush was still too large and uncomfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Conair brush has flexible, SOFT bristles, which works well for my hair.</li>
            <li>Not a lot of power as far as air , but does the job .</li>
            <li>My hair looks far healthier after drying with this appliance (using the plastic teeth attachment, not the brush attachment--haven&#x27;t tried that one).  </li>
            <li>This curling brush is lighter than the old one I had.</li>
            <li>What are they thinking?), low air speed, and very ineffective.</li>
            <li>The main brush was much too big to actually get under my hair.  </li>
            <li>I routinely use this hot air brush + gel to add body to my fine, thin, shoulder-length hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li>I had one of the older Conair drying hairbrushes back in the day and when it died i went into mourning...</li>
            <li>Be aware this brush will only work on the low setting if you are using the 240 option.</li>
            <li>This dual voltage hot air round brush works very well in both the US and Europe</li>
            <li>and I did not get the same results as using on the high setting in the US?</li>
            <li>It just took a little longer to style my hair with this one than the hot air curling brush I normally use here in the US.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what I expected it to!</li>
            <li>It will only work on the low speed and not on the high.</li>
            <li>so in other words the brush needs to be changed and a finer regular hair brush with more bristles and less gaps should be  attached.</li>
            <li>The instructions say that it must be used on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting when using the high-voltage option, and it barely seemed to work here at home on that setting.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s dual voltage setting, and barely blows any air at all.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s several months old now).  </li>
            <li>The dual voltage switch was a bit difficult to change; but it was nice not to have to carry a converter with me.</li>
            <li>This cuts so much time out of my daily routine, now i can just dry and curl in one step and</li>
            <li>The hot air does not blow hard enough to actually dry your hair from wet, but it is plenty strong enough to curl under the ends of my not quite shoulder length hair after using a regular dryer.  </li>
            <li>Cord is to short and if not careful hair will tangle in brush .</li>
            <li>The low setting  barely puts out any air</li>
            <li>However, they are very useful for adding height at the crown, styling bangs, and finishing up the back of my hair, which is so hard to do with blow drier and brush!  </li>

            <li> You&#x27;re better off with a reasonable blow dryer and brushes of your choice.</li>
            <li> The brush is too soft and slides over my hair instead of catching hold of it.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product as a good alternative to trying to find a transformer that actually works.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase it from Amazon and to deal with Conair to try and get it repaired will cost me as much as purchasing a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments on this unit are very easy to interchange; Conair should use this design on every one of their products!</li>
            <li> My hair is short (but not real short) and it worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> I needed something that would style my hair quickly, and add volume and a bit of a finish to the end of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It also cools quickly</li>
            <li> But, it didn&#x27;t heat up to a very hot temperature.  </li>
            <li> I expected a more powerful curling brush as it said it was 50% more powerful.</li>
            <li> The core of the brush seems to be heated by the airflow only and never get terribly warm.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the newer ones with &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; (causes static) vs this one with the harder curling spikes (much better) and no tangling or burning of face, scalp or hands.</li>
            <li> After having used the Helen of Troy with the PLASTIC BARREL (!), my experience has been that this metal-barreled brush is far more effective.</li>
            <li> But, It would be nice to have an additional brush or comb attachment smaller in diameter for shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly but wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> and this one is priced right and works for us.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use in Europe- dual voltage, right?  </li>
            <li> The teeth broke off right away.  </li>
            <li> When set for the higher voltage, it will only run on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; but this was as effective as the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting on the lower voltage in the US.  </li>
            <li> Liked it so much, we ordered a second one as a back-up.</li>
            <li> I used it on the low setting only (per the instructions) in Great Britain and Ireland with no problem.</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the bristles are soft which we like and heat is fine.</li>
            <li> I used the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting and was happy with how hard the blower blew and how hot the barrel became.</li>
            <li> Well, it blew the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> B001G1CTWY Conair Curling Brush 1.5\\&quot; Hot Air Dual Voltage]]</li>
            <li> It has 2 speeds, and i use the higher.</li>
            <li> I have had two more of these in past and love them  never had a problem .</li>
            <li> I also love it for touching up my hair the second day after washing/styling (dry hair -</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get warm, much less hot on</li>
            <li> Plus you need to run it on the higher setting to get much heat out of it.</li>
            <li> If I had written this review before this past week I would have given the brush 5 stars, I loved it.</li>
            <li> I bought it prior to my trip to France to see how I liked it generally.  </li>
            <li> But once in Italy and using the high-voltage option, the low setting worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I ended up happy with the product, although I prefer soft bristles to the hard ones on this product.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research to choose this product yet the dryer isn&#x27;t strong enough for my hair and the bristles aren&#x27;t long enough or strong enough to grab my hair effectively for styling purposes.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product in the 1.5\\&quot; size.</li>
            <li> The dual voltage curling iron brush worked really well in Italy.</li>
            <li> Does the job at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Otherwise the product works very well.</li>
            <li> Utterly useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this to the seller (HOUSEWARES), who were, btw, fantastic to deal with.</li>
            <li> so I was very worried about looking presentable in Europe this fall.</li>
            <li> Works very well here.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well in the U.K.</li>
            <li> I do like this Conair, it works very well.</li>
            <li> I have not found that these devices are capable of creating curls as some advertise</li>
            <li> other thing I loved about this unit was the big brush.</li>
            <li> I am still using it at home, choosing it over the many other curling brushes/irons in my arsenal of hair tools.  </li>
            <li> The low setting on Europe current  delivered much more power than it had in the USA and the brush did a fine job providing body and style to my short hair.</li>
            <li> (I gave up); using it on dry hair is only minimally effective on the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting.  </li>
            <li> my medium length hair is left full and shiny.</li>
            <li> In the past I have always liked &amp; trusted Conair products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving my brush for my many European trips as I have a similar one in 110V.</li>
            <li> Using it as dual voltage was the main reason I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> It will not even allow the user to click it to high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that it would solve my hair problems with curly hair in Europe.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4c hair with a lot of shrinkage!!</li>
            <li> This is nothing more than an anemic blow dryer with a couple of inferior round brushes you can attach to the end.  </li>
            <li> has no power and does not get hot enough to curl straight hair.  </li>
            <li> The converter worked fine for the other stuff I took.</li>
            <li> Back home I changed the setting back to US strength, and it is working fine.</li>
            <li> As reported by other reviewers, it makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> The bristles are different on each, but both are long enough and effective for me.</li>
            <li> Wish Conair would come out with a new ceramic model...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this Conair 1.5\\&quot; Hot Air Dual Voltage Curling Brush.  </li>
            <li> Adds body and slight curl to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to read the reviews documenting that this works in Europe, even though only on the Low setting.</li>
            <li> It works, but would take me hours to dry/curl my hair, which is pretty short.</li>
            <li> One that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34;, etc~ Same price point and that blows hot air like this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed a dual voltage hot air curling brush for a recent overseas trip.</li>
            <li> The low setting is pretty wimpy.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush was still too large and uncomfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Conair brush has flexible, SOFT bristles, which works well for my hair.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of power as far as air , but does the job .</li>
            <li> My hair looks far healthier after drying with this appliance (using the plastic teeth attachment, not the brush attachment--haven&#x27;t tried that one).  </li>
            <li> This curling brush is lighter than the old one I had.</li>
            <li> What are they thinking?), low air speed, and very ineffective.</li>
            <li> The main brush was much too big to actually get under my hair.  </li>
            <li> I routinely use this hot air brush + gel to add body to my fine, thin, shoulder-length hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I had one of the older Conair drying hairbrushes back in the day and when it died i went into mourning...</li>
            <li> Be aware this brush will only work on the low setting if you are using the 240 option.</li>
            <li> This dual voltage hot air round brush works very well in both the US and Europe</li>
            <li> and I did not get the same results as using on the high setting in the US?</li>
            <li> It just took a little longer to style my hair with this one than the hot air curling brush I normally use here in the US.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what I expected it to!</li>
            <li> It will only work on the low speed and not on the high.</li>
            <li> so in other words the brush needs to be changed and a finer regular hair brush with more bristles and less gaps should be  attached.</li>
            <li> The instructions say that it must be used on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting when using the high-voltage option, and it barely seemed to work here at home on that setting.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dual voltage setting, and barely blows any air at all.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s several months old now).  </li>
            <li> The dual voltage switch was a bit difficult to change; but it was nice not to have to carry a converter with me.</li>
            <li> This cuts so much time out of my daily routine, now i can just dry and curl in one step and</li>
            <li> The hot air does not blow hard enough to actually dry your hair from wet, but it is plenty strong enough to curl under the ends of my not quite shoulder length hair after using a regular dryer.  </li>
            <li> Cord is to short and if not careful hair will tangle in brush .</li>
            <li> The low setting  barely puts out any air</li>
            <li> However, they are very useful for adding height at the crown, styling bangs, and finishing up the back of my hair, which is so hard to do with blow drier and brush!  </li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t dry or curl my short hair in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li> and it is not getting nearly hot enough to do my (thin) hair properly.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try it abroad, but since the instructions advise only using the low setting in foreign countries, I&#x27;m not too hopeful that it will work well for me.</li>
            <li> It would take a long time to style my hair with the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li> The Conair Curling Brush used abroad in 220 Watts does not have enough heat, along the front of the brush is all plastic, which is not very healthy&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> this lasts a long time</li>
            <li> (that makes me laugh; it&#x27;s totally impossible from my experience) or styling my whole head of hair.</li>
            <li> It took twice as long to dry my hair</li>
            <li> The brush attachment is 1&amp;#34; but the other attachment is much larger.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy, dry, frizzy hair of medium thickness.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair with a blower usually provided by the hotel and shaped it while just damp with my Hot Air brush.  </li>
            <li> For my second try, I narrowed it down to this Conair or the comparable Revlon model, but chose the Conair because the recent reviews of the Revlon were very poor (apparently it has been redesigned recently), and when i looked at the Revlon in the store i could see that it has very short bristles, which definitely would not work for me.</li>
            <li> The previous year I had taken a different product that did not have dual voltage.  </li>
            <li> This brush works really well here in the US, but as it only operates on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting in other countries, it is next to useless for travel..  </li>
            <li> Using this on wet hair would take forever</li>
            <li> Therefore, my hair never really curled.</li>
            <li> Does not really lock in place.</li>
            <li> Was a tad skeptical at first</li>
            <li> One has a wider barrel and shorter bristles, the other has a narrower barrel with longer bristles.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of money!</li>
            <li> More disappointed when I found out that I have to pay to return the defective product,</li>
            <li> I bought this brush locally instead of on Amazon because the first hot air brush i tried was terrible and the Amazon vendor gave me the run aournd when i tried to return it.</li>
            <li> In France, on the recommended lower setting, it has so little force of air that it&#x27;s pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> The whole concept is a bit silly...</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> (The hot air brushes with \\&quot;HARD bristles\\&quot; tangle my hair around the bristles into a frustrating, damaged mess.)</li>
            <li> I can ONLY use the wider brush and my hair gets caught so badly that it rips out whole locks of hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush leaved the hair wavy in odd places.</li>
            <li> Curls were too tight.  </li>
            <li> As reported by other reviewers, it does blow some of the surrounding hair depending upon its position, but that is slight and that isn&#x27;t a problem for me, maybe because I usually apply hair spray after styling each section.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money ladies.</li>
            <li> Feel I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> This is a device that, for all intents and purposes, is unusable and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I needed a curling brush to take to Europe, not easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> dual voltage option (which is the reason I purchased the product) has one small problem that you don&#x27;t read about until after you&#x27;ve broken into the flesh-eating plastic packaging to retrieve the instructions: when using this product on 250v, you can only use the product on its &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time that I did not have to worry about having \\&quot;bad hair\\&quot; while abroad.</li>
            <li> Our itinerary included seven nights on a small yacht.  </li>
            <li> Travel aboard small ships does not allow curling irons so that was another dilemma.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work at all in Italy - even when I tried keeping the device on the setting for US current and using my converter.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I was traveling and realized that only the low speed worked.  </li>
            <li> There are very few dual voltage  hair dryers on the market</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you brush hard the brush part falls out.</li>
            <li> I opened the product to give it a try here.....on full power, and it was terribly underpowered and generated very little heat.</li>
            <li> My trip was to Africa, and I ordered too late to return or reorder.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that the smaller brush on the dual voltage was so different from the one I use at home.  </li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Have been looking to stock up on this Conair product as hard to find now!</li>
            <li> Bristles are very hard and hurt scalp when using.  </li>
            <li> I have had this product for a couple of years now, and  I have to say that it is one of the absolute worst hair products out there.</li>
            <li> Sorry for late Review!</li>
            <li> By far the worst purchase.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair that is very difficult to style, so I thought I would give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m horrible with regular blow dryers so this worked for me...</li>
            <li> Alas, they have returned!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s useless as a dryer.</li>
            <li> Complaint after one use it broke!!!</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m afraid this brand is being discontinued</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I purchased travel curlers for another trip to Europe about eighteen months ago but hated the way my hair looked.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in Amazon on this one.</li>
            <li> but I am very disappointed in the dual voltage curling brush..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If I had written this review before this past week I would have given the brush 5 stars, I loved it. However, it died after only 4 months of use! I did not purchase it from Amazon and to deal with Conair to try and get it repaired will cost me as much as purchasing a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments on this unit are very easy to interchange; Conair should use this design on every one of their products! The power is much lower on this unit than on most, but that was fine with me. I never had the need to use the dual voltage, it was just there, not something I looked for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I loved about this unit was the big brush. It gripped the hair and gave it volume and shape.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Dried my hair with a blower usually provided by the hotel and shaped it while just damp with my Hot Air brush.  I&#x27;m saving my brush for my many European trips as I have a similar one in 110V.</li>
            <li> Was a tad skeptical at first I have natural 4c hair with a lot of shrinkage!! Worked amazing I&#x27;m horrible with regular blow dryers so this worked for me... Complaint after one use it broke!!! With that being said if you have natural hair ladies I&#x27;d advise you to find another more sturdy blow dryer the bristles are great though just flimsy</li>
            <li> Cord is to short and if not careful hair will tangle in brush . As you get used to using brush it works just fine .&lt;br /&gt;  Evelyn</li>
            <li> Had to  return the product as the piece seem to be defective...</li>
            <li> I ordered the brush for a trip. The instructions say it can only be used on LOW when the voltage is changed to 250(it has a switch to change voltage). This was a dissapointment. Otherwise the brush is good.Delivery was on time when promised.</li>
            <li> I love my Conair Curling Brush that is not a dual voltage but am disappointed with this Conair Curling Hot Air Dual Voltage. It will only work on the low speed and not on the high. It will not even allow the user to click it to high. Since I was leaving for Europe the day after I received it, I took it along but could only use it at the low speed. This is the first time that I have not been totally satisfied with something purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much, we ordered a second one as a back-up.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dtr, I love mineðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Has dial for selecting whether to use 110 or 220.  It has 2 brush heads.  One has a wider barrel and shorter bristles, the other has a narrower barrel with longer bristles.  Nice bristles.  It has a \\&quot;Low\\&quot; and a \\&quot;High\\&quot; setting.  I used it in Spain with a plug adapter and it did a great job.  I used the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting and was happy with how hard the blower blew and how hot the barrel became.</li>
            <li> Bought for a trip in Europe. Works great &amp; u only need the plug adapter instead of the transformer. It is milder than using a regular curling brush on your hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t take this curling brush on my trip to France as I tried it on low setting at home and found it quite inadequate to the task of styling my hair.  Had room in the suitcase, so threw it in at the last minute and was very glad I did!  The low setting on Europe current  delivered much more power than it had in the USA and the brush did a fine job providing body and style to my short hair.</li>
            <li> I routinely use this hot air brush + gel to add body to my fine, thin, shoulder-length hair after shampooing. (The hot air brushes with \\&quot;HARD bristles\\&quot; tangle my hair around the bristles into a frustrating, damaged mess.) This Conair brush has flexible, SOFT bristles, which works well for my hair. I used it on the low setting only (per the instructions) in Great Britain and Ireland with no problem. Of course a prong adapter is needed for your specific destination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thrown out all my hard-bristled curling brushes. Thanks for this product in the 1.5\\&quot; size. Please continue to offer it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Conair dual voltage Curling Brush to take to Italy. When I got to Italy, I switched the voltage switch to 250 on the curling brush, used the appropriate plug adapter and turned it on.  It worked for 10 minutes and died. Never would turn back on. The voltage is 220 there. I bought a curling brush in Lucca, Italy and it worked fine the rest of the trip. I left the Conair curling brush in my room when I checked out. A total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I recently took this item on a two week trip to France.  It worked perfectly for 14 days.  The previous year I had taken a different product that did not have dual voltage.  Well, it blew the first time I used it.  I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> A must have for your wife if your traveling abroad.  There are very few dual voltage  hair dryers on the market and this one is priced right and works for us.</li>
            <li> The dual voltage curling iron brush worked really well in Italy. It&#x27;s the first time that I did not have to worry about having \\&quot;bad hair\\&quot; while abroad. The dual voltage switch was a bit difficult to change; but it was nice not to have to carry a converter with me. I&#x27;ll definetly take it along on my next trip.</li>
            <li> Does the job at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I used this product in Europe.. You can easily change the voltage so it was perfect.</li>
            <li> This brush works really well here in the US, but as it only operates on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting in other countries, it is next to useless for travel..  It would take a long time to style my hair with the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting.  I will buy a converter and take my John Frieda brush next time.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product when I tried it in the States before my trip. The instructions say that it must be used on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting when using the high-voltage option, and it barely seemed to work here at home on that setting. But once in Italy and using the high-voltage option, the low setting worked just fine. I ended up happy with the product, although I prefer soft bristles to the hard ones on this product.</li>
            <li> The brush does not grasp the hair as it should. so in other words the brush needs to be changed and a finer regular hair brush with more bristles and less gaps should be  attached. This brush leaved the hair wavy in odd places.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift and it is OK but I think it would work better on someone that has longer hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using the curling brush for years &amp; I&#x27;m afraid this brand is being discontinued - so I found it on amazon&lt;br /&gt;love it!</li>
            <li> Bristles are very hard and hurt scalp when using.  Otherwise the product works very well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this Conair 1.5\\&quot; Hot Air Dual Voltage Curling Brush.  I bought it prior to my trip to France to see how I liked it generally.  My hair is short (but not real short) and it worked wonderfully.  When I traveled to France I switched it to the 250voltage, used my adapter for France and it worked great. Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! I had one of the older Conair drying hairbrushes back in the day and when it died i went into mourning...Alas, they have returned! This cuts so much time out of my daily routine, now i can just dry and curl in one step and my medium length hair is left full and shiny. The volume lasts all day too!~~</li>
            <li> The Conair Curling Brush used abroad in 220 Watts does not have enough heat, along the front of the brush is all plastic, which is not very healthy&lt;br /&gt;for the hair.</li>
            <li> This broke after 3 days while on vacation. Not a good product. Do not buy. I will not buy again. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great thing for travel. However, you have to remember to switch it to the right voltage!</li>
            <li> This thing is garbage.  Dont waste your money ladies.</li>
            <li> I expected a more powerful curling brush as it said it was 50% more powerful. This won&#x27;t dry or curl my short hair in a timely manner.  I sent an email asking to  return it and have heard nothing. Very disappointed in Amazon on this one.</li>
            <li> This curling iron  worked for about 2 minutes, then died.  I purchased the adapter and converter recommended for this product, but to no avail!! Don&#x27;t buy it if you need dual voltage!!!</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.  I bought it to use in Europe- dual voltage, right?  It doesn&#x27;t get warm, much less hot on it&#x27;s dual voltage setting, and barely blows any air at all.  I threw it away in France- total garbage appliance.</li>
            <li> My bride was a happy woman in France with this curler.  If the brush rotated, she would have been ecstatic.</li>
            <li> I used it once. The next time it did not work. We tried to get it to work but ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> I needed a curling brush to take to Europe, not easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;The Conair curling Brush was recommended to me by a friend who&lt;br /&gt;bought it for her trips to Europe, since she is &amp;#34;particular&amp;#34; I felt it was a&lt;br /&gt;safe recommendation. I have used it at home and am happy with it. I will&lt;br /&gt;be taking it on a European River Cruise this Fall.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly but wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was hoping for. It&#x27;s not the best for someone with shorter, fine hair, as the barrel and brushes are longer than some similar type dryers. Plus you need to run it on the higher setting to get much heat out of it. I have yet to try it abroad, but since the instructions advise only using the low setting in foreign countries, I&#x27;m not too hopeful that it will work well for me. Using it as dual voltage was the main reason I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research to choose this product yet the dryer isn&#x27;t strong enough for my hair and the bristles aren&#x27;t long enough or strong enough to grab my hair effectively for styling purposes.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve been using it daily on my chin length bob and it works great! Adds body and slight curl to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> My husband and I were headed to Greece and Turkey for three weeks.  Our itinerary included seven nights on a small yacht.  My hair is cut short - length is just even with my jaw line. I purchased travel curlers for another trip to Europe about eighteen months ago but hated the way my hair looked.  Curls were too tight.  I needed something that would style my hair quickly, and add volume and a bit of a finish to the end of my hair.  Travel aboard small ships does not allow curling irons so that was another dilemma.  I needed to find a tool that would work for me and fit the travel requirements as outlined by our tour rules.  The Conair Curling Brush was amazing!  Worked like a charm each and every time.  While it is a bit large, it is fairly light and very easy to use.  I am still using it at home, choosing it over the many other curling brushes/irons in my arsenal of hair tools.  Be sure to follow the instructions to set the curling brush to the lower voltage and use the adapters while in Europe.</li>
            <li> Pro ally purchased this product for a trip to Italy. I liked the fact that this device could be used without a voltage converter as it converted the voltage itself. I used the dryer a couple times at home before the trip and loved it. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work at all in Italy - even when I tried keeping the device on the setting for US current and using my converter. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> In the past I have always liked &amp; trusted Conair products but I am very disappointed in the dual voltage curling brush.. It was purchased to use in Europe to dry/curl my hair. Instructions say that only low speed should  be used when using the converter feature or the dryer can overheat &amp; &#x27;burn out&#x27;. The low setting  barely puts out any air so it&#x27;s useless as a dryer. Feel I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> I got this for travel in Europe. You have to use it on the low setting there. I tried that here and it is not getting nearly hot enough to do my (thin) hair properly. I will take it with me, but probably end up having to buy one there.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a two week trip to France for the dual-voltage.  Wouldn&#x27;t work.  The large barrel has plastic bristles which I dislike and no place on the site was I able to find that information.</li>
            <li> This is nothing more than an anemic blow dryer with a couple of inferior round brushes you can attach to the end.  You&#x27;re better off with a reasonable blow dryer and brushes of your choice. The whole concept is a bit silly... the air comes from *inside* the brush, so your hair gets blown... away from the brush.  The core of the brush seems to be heated by the airflow only and never get terribly warm.  Using this on wet hair would take forever (I gave up); using it on dry hair is only minimally effective on the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting.  Which brings me to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dual voltage option (which is the reason I purchased the product) has one small problem that you don&#x27;t read about until after you&#x27;ve broken into the flesh-eating plastic packaging to retrieve the instructions: when using this product on 250v, you can only use the product on its &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting.  Utterly useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this to the seller (HOUSEWARES), who were, btw, fantastic to deal with.</li>
            <li> has no power and does not get hot enough to curl straight hair.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This did work in Iceland.  It didn&#x27;t blow a circuit as I had feared.  But, it didn&#x27;t heat up to a very hot temperature.  Therefore, my hair never really curled.</li>
            <li> Did not work in Germany. (50 Hz) Works in US (60 Hz)</li>
            <li> I have been using this gizmo for years in the States and my hair is just blah without it. I have never mastered the two-handed brush and hair dryer way so I was very worried about looking presentable in Europe this fall. I was so excited to read the reviews documenting that this works in Europe, even though only on the Low setting. It does! I mostly dry my hair before  using this curing brush and my hair looked great. Back home I changed the setting back to US strength, and it is working fine.</li>
            <li> My wife does not like it.</li>
            <li> I kept looking for blow- dryer/curling iron and finally found it! Works perfectly on a Bob cut on my straight hair!</li>
            <li> Is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a couple of years now, and  I have to say that it is one of the absolute worst hair products out there. I have extremely thick hair that is very difficult to style, so I thought I would give this a shot. I can ONLY use the wider brush and my hair gets caught so badly that it rips out whole locks of hair.&lt;br /&gt; By far the worst purchase. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Works very well here.  I&#x27;m eager to use it overseas.  Good size with controls that are easy to understand.  Easy to exchange brushes.</li>
            <li> In the U.S., this brush works great. In France, on the recommended lower setting, it has so little force of air that it&#x27;s pretty much useless. It works, but would take me hours to dry/curl my hair, which is pretty short.</li>
            <li> Works here and in Europe.</li>
            <li> great product.  Good for travel.</li>
            <li> Have been looking to stock up on this Conair product as hard to find now! Don&#x27;t like the newer ones with &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; (causes static) vs this one with the harder curling spikes (much better) and no tangling or burning of face, scalp or hands. Wish Conair would come out with a new ceramic model... One that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34;, etc~ Same price point and that blows hot air like this one.&lt;br /&gt;Timely arrival- well packaged. Sorry for late Review! But Happy~</li>
            <li> I would never never buy again form this seller. The hair dryer was supposed to be dual voltage, it worked in Miami but when I tried to use in Chile (after switching it to 220) it didn&#x27;t work. I paid for the shipping form Chile to return it after I explained that I hadn&#x27;t brought the package all the way to south america (it was just a plastic wrapper and there was no manual) but now they say that the return is not valid.&lt;br /&gt;NEVER NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER !!!</li>
            <li> Good we are very happy.</li>
            <li> Took it to Germany and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I always buy this hair drier. It helps tremendously in managing my curls making it so much easy and faster.</li>
            <li> Wife dis-liked this because the brush would not stay on.</li>
            <li> I needed a dual voltage hot air curling brush for a recent overseas trip. This brush was well priced and was everything that I needed and wanted in such a product. It worked very well in the U.K. The power was excellent and the drying time the same as in the U.S.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of power as far as air , but does the job . Have t yet trip out in Europe , but will do that soon .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my needs. I had one before, so I knew I liked it.  I use it at home and used it on a cruise to Eastern Europe.&lt;br /&gt;Donna Davis</li>
            <li> The teeth broke off right away.  Don&#x27;t bother with this!  I sent it back.  Not worth the money.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> My hair was looking so fried after blow-drying that I thought I needed a trim to get rid of split ends.  Tried this curling brush at a friend&#x27;s house and had to have one.  My hair looks far healthier after drying with this appliance (using the plastic teeth attachment, not the brush attachment--haven&#x27;t tried that one).  Hope this lasts a long time (it&#x27;s several months old now).  I&#x27;d be so bummed at having to go back to a regular hair dryer.  In fact I think I just talked myself into buying a backup for when this one eventually dies, in case they&#x27;re discontinued.</li>
            <li> Brush is fragile. Easily falls off the handle. Does not really lock in place. Therefore, if you brush hard the brush part falls out. Otherwise the bristles are soft which we like and heat is fine. It also cools quickly</li>
            <li> Switched this over to appropriate wattage in Italy and plugged in using the appropriate converter and it burned up within a couple minutes.  The converter worked fine for the other stuff I took.</li>
            <li> would buy again since I can use it in the USA and Overseas!</li>
            <li> My trip was to Africa, and I ordered too late to return or reorder.  I have shorter hair.  The main brush was much too big to actually get under my hair.  The smaller brush was still too large and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;  I have always used Conair products.  As a matter of fact, the brush curling iron I currently use is perfect for shorter hair AND I&#x27;ve had it for 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;  I was very disappointed that the smaller brush on the dual voltage was so different from the one I use at home.  Oh, well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have enough voltage and the brushes were too big.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I was traveling and realized that only the low speed worked.  More disappointed when I found out that I have to pay to return the defective product,</li>
            <li> I needed this product for the duel voltage option it provides.  Be aware this brush will only work on the low setting if you are using the 240 option. The low setting is pretty wimpy. It took twice as long to dry my hair and I did not get the same results as using on the high setting in the US?</li>
            <li> Great for Greece.  Needed dual voltage for international travel.  Not used yet but very happy with product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a trip to France. I had high hopes that it would solve my hair problems with curly hair in Europe. I opened the product to give it a try here.....on full power, and it was terribly underpowered and generated very little heat. When I applied for a return form, the company informed me that it wasn&#x27;t a dryer....only a curler and that it was only 300 watts, only returnable if the packaging was intact, and that there would be a re-stocking fee. So, the handwriting on the wall is that they won&#x27;t stand by their own product, but buyer beware. This is a device that, for all intents and purposes, is unusable and a waste of money. DO NOT BUY THIS.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001G1CTWY Conair Curling Brush 1.5\\&quot; Hot Air Dual Voltage]]</li>
            <li> The brush attachment is 1&amp;#34; but the other attachment is much larger.  Better for longer hair.  The good thing is it does convert to the euro system.</li>
            <li> This curling brush is lighter than the old one I had. Does exactly what I expected it to! Glad I got it!</li>
            <li> I could not find the watts on the description.  This brush is only 300W.  I currently use a 1000W and was looking for a dual voltage 1000W.  I think Amazon should put the watts in the description.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush locally instead of on Amazon because the first hot air brush i tried was terrible and the Amazon vendor gave me the run aournd when i tried to return it. That was the Helen of Troy. It has great reviews on Amazon but i didn&#x27;t like it at all. PLASTIC BARREL (i coudln&#x27;t belive it! What are they thinking?), low air speed, and very ineffective. For my second try, I narrowed it down to this Conair or the comparable Revlon model, but chose the Conair because the recent reviews of the Revlon were very poor (apparently it has been redesigned recently), and when i looked at the Revlon in the store i could see that it has very short bristles, which definitely would not work for me. I do like this Conair, it works very well. It has 2 speeds, and i use the higher. As reported by other reviewers, it does blow some of the surrounding hair depending upon its position, but that is slight and that isn&#x27;t a problem for me, maybe because I usually apply hair spray after styling each section. I like the two sizes of barrels and they are easy to install. The bristles are different on each, but both are long enough and effective for me. I have wavy, dry, frizzy hair of medium thickness. I have not found that these devices are capable of creating curls as some advertise (that makes me laugh; it&#x27;s totally impossible from my experience) or styling my whole head of hair. However, they are very useful for adding height at the crown, styling bangs, and finishing up the back of my hair, which is so hard to do with blow drier and brush!  I also love it for touching up my hair the second day after washing/styling (dry hair - can&#x27;t wash it every day). After having used the Helen of Troy with the PLASTIC BARREL (!), my experience has been that this metal-barreled brush is far more effective. My hair takes its shape easily and quickly. (FYI, i always use mousse. Can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness with no hair products). As reported by other reviewers, it makes my hair smooth and shiny. I find it very easy to use and control.</li>
            <li> The brush is too soft and slides over my hair instead of catching hold of it.  It just took a little longer to style my hair with this one than the hot air curling brush I normally use here in the US.  However, I was thrilled to find one of the curling brushes available in dual voltage because I often travel out of the country.</li>
            <li> This dual voltage hot air round brush works very well in both the US and Europe (I used it in Italy).  When set for the higher voltage, it will only run on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; but this was as effective as the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting on the lower voltage in the US.  The hot air does not blow hard enough to actually dry your hair from wet, but it is plenty strong enough to curl under the ends of my not quite shoulder length hair after using a regular dryer.  I recommend this product as a good alternative to trying to find a transformer that actually works.</li>
            <li> It did not work, when I plugged it in it did not turn on. I have had two more of these in past and love them  never had a problem . This one must be a defective one.</li>
            <li> I like the curling brush; it&#x27;s compact, easy to store and to pack  when I travel.I do like the dual voltage. But, It would be nice to have an additional brush or comb attachment smaller in diameter for shorter hair.  Also, a flaired nozzle attachment for blow-drying hair, clothes, etc.</li>
