            <li>Both are very good (and noncomedogenic) and recommended by many dermatologists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This seller is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is great for keeping my skin looking smooth.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>works well, has 2.5% bp which is as effective as the 5-10% they sell at drugstores.</li>
            <li>Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch</li>
            <li>This is too soon for this kind of product.</li>
            <li>Used the original repairing lotion for years as a stand-alone acne treatment with great results.  </li>
            <li>He needed something to help manage his acne and found Proactive to be most effective.</li>
            <li>5/15/11 Still going strong!</li>
            <li>This product was shipped super fast, and came in perfect condition!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Healthy food means fruits and vegetables and NOT eating processed junk.</li>
            <li>The diet made the most difference (give it three months), not just for my skin or my weight but for my life.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Personally, it works best when i use it at night</li>
            <li>I am 24 i never ever had so many pimples on my face as i have now after 3 days of using this cream</li>
            <li>they just come out more</li>
            <li>Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a lotion that would help replenish my skin and make it more even toned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can guarantee, you will love it too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice I could find more available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>SURE you never use a moisturizer or a suncreen (either separately or as a combo)</li>
            <li>I put it on my forehead every night, but I use it more like an on the spot treatment for the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had excellent results using it as described above.</li>
            <li>I love this Proactiv lotion.  </li>
            <li>and they love proactive repairing lotion and</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Pleased</li>
            <li>smells okay.</li>
            <li>The toner (step 2) is ok  </li>
            <li>the lotion is good and the expiration date is right.</li>
            <li>I did research and specifically bought this, though it wasn&#x27;t the most cost effective, because I thought it was the original</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this after reading so many good positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, this type of product works fine after the expiration date, and it was cheaper!</li>
            <li>Good product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>fast shipping and good product.</li>
            <li>it is very creamy and smooth and smells good.</li>
            <li>It has a very smooth application and absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived in time and was fine except it had an expiration date in 2 months.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>You feel the change in your face quickly!</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use for daily control of acne.  </li>
            <li>Virgin coconut oil applied to face and body lightly once or twice a day is all I need for my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I stay blemish free.</li>
            <li>- it literally lays on top of your skin instead of being absorbed into</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve found Acne dot org&#x27;s 8oz bottle of \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; which is 2.5% BP; it&#x27;s the cheapest lotion/gel available these days.</li>
            <li>Great product, will definitely buy again and reccommend to any one who is looking for such a product good job seller.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and it is very effective.</li>
            <li>When I first started using proactive it worked really well, but over time is no longer effective.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product which helps keep your skin clear.</li>
            <li>Believe me, this lotion works good only if you spot treat with clearasil after you use it.</li>
            <li>Good product that actually works,</li>
            <li>And didn&#x27;t have to pay full price like on the proactiv site..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free and comes in an easy to use large bottle.</li>
            <li>this seller was quick.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Ships quickly..</li>
            <li>So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product to clear skin without completely drying and flaking skin around blemish.  </li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for years, but stopped getting it from proactive sites because this is the main product I love.  </li>
            <li>Received item quickly and it was as described.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive or dry skin, you&#x27;d be wise to top with a noncomedogenic lotion like CeraVe at night, since this is not moisturizing like the AcneFree lotion was.</li>
            <li>Think positive and get out and enjoy life.  </li>
            <li>and it really works!!  </li>
            <li>They just ship you a new formula instead of original!</li>
            <li>It is a great preventative acne lotion for everyday application.  </li>
            <li>Proactiv is the only product that has ever cleared my skin, and I think the lotion is the most important component of the \\&quot;system\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
            <li>a month right around my \\&quot;time of the month\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>When I need more I can always count on Amazin to not only have it but to get it to me quickly.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good in general, but for me (older adult), nothing works nearly as well as healthy eating and coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Proactive 3-step kit for 2 years now; and it&#x27;s one of the only things that really works for me consistently and effectively.  </li>
            <li>Overall love results and will buy again.  </li>
            <li>i first start it</li>
            <li>My acne has really cleared up!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
            <li>im about to buy from this seller for the first time.</li>
            <li>Just apply it in the mornings and at night &amp; your skin will be amazingly smooth &amp; clear.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure results vary on different skin types.</li>
            <li>Try Aveeno Daily Moisturizer spf 30 or Neutrogena Healthy Defense spf 30 or 45.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan&#x27;s Regimen from acne dot org is okay, except for the fact his daily moisturizer lacks an spf, and except for the fact some people prefer a lotion benzoyl peroxide treatment at night instead of a gel.  </li>
            <li>Once the Proactiv dries it&#x27;s pretty stable, but I still wouldn&#x27;t rest my head on a prized pillow case while using it.</li>
            <li>(Step 3) is soft, smooth and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad someone sells it individually.</li>
            <li>you can get the cleanser for a fraction of the price with clean and clear at any supermarket</li>
            <li>For sure, we don&#x27;t have to pay too much or get it regularly.</li>
            <li>my skin gets fairly oily, so this light lotion is all the facial moisturizer i ever need (besides a little SPF from time to time).</li>
            <li>really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li>That said, their lotion is pretty much irreplaceable, since it has the medication in a lotion form, which is exceedingly rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works to clear up the slightest breakout quickly.</li>
            <li>but it certainly works for me and can not do without it.</li>
            <li>We bought this through a vendor on Amazon&#x27;s website, the price was much cheaper than what is available at the local malls and   </li>
            <li>See a real Dr for real treatment.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so much clearer and softer now.  </li>
            <li>...not a paid spokesperson, or some flaky-fake person; and Proactiv really does work.  </li>
            <li>really sting at first),i</li>
            <li>stuff really helps keep my acne away..</li>
            <li>this is the only proactiv product i use and it keeps my skin blemish free.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful about this repairing lotion after reading alot of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, this product did not work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and non greasy.</li>
            <li>You can get it on ebay much cheaper than Proactiv is on Amazon or ebay.  </li>
            <li>Have not had a real zit or pimple for two years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>It works better than I could have expected.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>the price is really affordable</li>
            <li>It works really well with my skin and acne.</li>
            <li>fast dhipping.</li>
            <li>I used Proactiv religiously for years, but honestly, didn&#x27;t see that big of an improvement.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it works very quickly to stop a break out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so magical that once I put it on, the pimples went down alot</li>
            <li>They do NOT address the new fragrance!  </li>
            <li>Easily bleaches out towels even after carefully washing hands.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more Proactive in the future</li>
            <li>I highly recommend switching to AcneFree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and this really helps my skin heal.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I use my normal face wash daily, and my normal face lotion the rest of the month, but when my skin needs a little more acne control, this does the trick.</li>
            <li>Yet, keep a clean face, and don&#x27;t over due it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it from Clear Sink Source</li>
            <li>having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 47 years old and still break out</li>
            <li>Oh, and becareful near your PJ shirts and sheats.</li>
            <li>I order what I need and as I need it from Amazon and it works out cheaper than buying direct from Proactiv.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 20 years old</li>
            <li>I was like wow</li>
            <li>Not only does it reverse break-outs in progress, but it really does seem to substantially accelerate healing.  </li>
            <li>I only use the lotion because that&#x27;s all you really need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps one day when the Acnefree lotion or the Klear Action lotion are sold separately, it will be cheaper than this stuff, but until then, Proactiv is the cheapest 2.5% benzoyl peroxide lotion on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Proactiv&#x27;s website even addresses the issue, saying it&#x27;s \\&quot;better\\&quot; than the old stuff, and is \\&quot;micronized\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult with no acne</li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and have problems from time to time with redness and breakouts on my nose.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so it does cause redness, itchiness, and sensitivity to sun; but it&#x27;s the only acne formula I&#x27;ve tried that really works for me.</li>
            <li>This product has always worked well for me; with this purchase, it was not obvious that this particular bottle was a month away from its expiration date.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well for first few days</li>
            <li>I on the other hand with 45 yo skin LOVE what it does for my complexion and as long as you make it your daily skin care regimen</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use all over your face on a daily basis without being overly drying.</li>
            <li>Not entirely sure why they say it&#x27;s the original formula when it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>I like this repairing lotion, but I ended up buying a similar product of a different brand that had a high benzoyl peroxide content.  </li>
            <li>I have CLEAR skin for the FIRST time in my life by completely transforming my diet and using the coconut oil for the past year.  </li>
            <li>I bought white towels and that fixed the problem.  </li>
            <li>There are cheaper, natural skin solutions, such as rosehip oil, honey, and tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>It might seem pricey but compared to buying the whole kit (or the headaches and time spent trying to get Proactiv to sell you an individual piece without getting you onto a recurring mail order shipment)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t not dry out my skin and all but eliminates acne.</li>
            <li>Although it did not clear my face up completely it helped a lot, I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong, very irritating fragrance that made me break out.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I decided to buy this after reading so many good positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, this type of product works fine after the expiration date, and it was cheaper!</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> fast shipping and good product.</li>
            <li> it is very creamy and smooth and smells good.</li>
            <li> It has a very smooth application and absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived in time and was fine except it had an expiration date in 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> You feel the change in your face quickly!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use for daily control of acne.  </li>
            <li> Virgin coconut oil applied to face and body lightly once or twice a day is all I need for my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I stay blemish free.</li>
            <li> - it literally lays on top of your skin instead of being absorbed into</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve found Acne dot org&#x27;s 8oz bottle of \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; which is 2.5% BP; it&#x27;s the cheapest lotion/gel available these days.</li>
            <li> Great product, will definitely buy again and reccommend to any one who is looking for such a product good job seller.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and it is very effective.</li>
            <li> When I first started using proactive it worked really well, but over time is no longer effective.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product which helps keep your skin clear.</li>
            <li> Believe me, this lotion works good only if you spot treat with clearasil after you use it.</li>
            <li> Good product that actually works,</li>
            <li> And didn&#x27;t have to pay full price like on the proactiv site..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free and comes in an easy to use large bottle.</li>
            <li> this seller was quick.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Ships quickly..</li>
            <li> So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product to clear skin without completely drying and flaking skin around blemish.  </li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years, but stopped getting it from proactive sites because this is the main product I love.  </li>
            <li> Received item quickly and it was as described.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive or dry skin, you&#x27;d be wise to top with a noncomedogenic lotion like CeraVe at night, since this is not moisturizing like the AcneFree lotion was.</li>
            <li> Think positive and get out and enjoy life.  </li>
            <li> and it really works!!  </li>
            <li> They just ship you a new formula instead of original!</li>
            <li> It is a great preventative acne lotion for everyday application.  </li>
            <li> Proactiv is the only product that has ever cleared my skin, and I think the lotion is the most important component of the \\&quot;system\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
            <li> a month right around my \\&quot;time of the month\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> When I need more I can always count on Amazin to not only have it but to get it to me quickly.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good in general, but for me (older adult), nothing works nearly as well as healthy eating and coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Proactive 3-step kit for 2 years now; and it&#x27;s one of the only things that really works for me consistently and effectively.  </li>
            <li> Overall love results and will buy again.  </li>
            <li> i first start it</li>
            <li> My acne has really cleared up!</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
            <li> im about to buy from this seller for the first time.</li>
            <li> Just apply it in the mornings and at night &amp; your skin will be amazingly smooth &amp; clear.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure results vary on different skin types.</li>
            <li> Try Aveeno Daily Moisturizer spf 30 or Neutrogena Healthy Defense spf 30 or 45.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan&#x27;s Regimen from acne dot org is okay, except for the fact his daily moisturizer lacks an spf, and except for the fact some people prefer a lotion benzoyl peroxide treatment at night instead of a gel.  </li>
            <li> Once the Proactiv dries it&#x27;s pretty stable, but I still wouldn&#x27;t rest my head on a prized pillow case while using it.</li>
            <li> (Step 3) is soft, smooth and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad someone sells it individually.</li>
            <li> you can get the cleanser for a fraction of the price with clean and clear at any supermarket</li>
            <li> For sure, we don&#x27;t have to pay too much or get it regularly.</li>
            <li> my skin gets fairly oily, so this light lotion is all the facial moisturizer i ever need (besides a little SPF from time to time).</li>
            <li> really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li> That said, their lotion is pretty much irreplaceable, since it has the medication in a lotion form, which is exceedingly rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works to clear up the slightest breakout quickly.</li>
            <li> but it certainly works for me and can not do without it.</li>
            <li> We bought this through a vendor on Amazon&#x27;s website, the price was much cheaper than what is available at the local malls and   </li>
            <li> See a real Dr for real treatment.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so much clearer and softer now.  </li>
            <li> ...not a paid spokesperson, or some flaky-fake person; and Proactiv really does work.  </li>
            <li> really sting at first),i</li>
            <li> stuff really helps keep my acne away..</li>
            <li> this is the only proactiv product i use and it keeps my skin blemish free.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful about this repairing lotion after reading alot of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, this product did not work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and non greasy.</li>
            <li> You can get it on ebay much cheaper than Proactiv is on Amazon or ebay.  </li>
            <li> Have not had a real zit or pimple for two years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> It works better than I could have expected.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> the price is really affordable</li>
            <li> It works really well with my skin and acne.</li>
            <li> fast dhipping.</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv religiously for years, but honestly, didn&#x27;t see that big of an improvement.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it works very quickly to stop a break out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so magical that once I put it on, the pimples went down alot</li>
            <li> They do NOT address the new fragrance!  </li>
            <li> Easily bleaches out towels even after carefully washing hands.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more Proactive in the future</li>
            <li> I highly recommend switching to AcneFree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and this really helps my skin heal.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I use my normal face wash daily, and my normal face lotion the rest of the month, but when my skin needs a little more acne control, this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Yet, keep a clean face, and don&#x27;t over due it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it from Clear Sink Source</li>
            <li> having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 years old and still break out</li>
            <li> Oh, and becareful near your PJ shirts and sheats.</li>
            <li> I order what I need and as I need it from Amazon and it works out cheaper than buying direct from Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old</li>
            <li> I was like wow</li>
            <li> Not only does it reverse break-outs in progress, but it really does seem to substantially accelerate healing.  </li>
            <li> I only use the lotion because that&#x27;s all you really need.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps one day when the Acnefree lotion or the Klear Action lotion are sold separately, it will be cheaper than this stuff, but until then, Proactiv is the cheapest 2.5% benzoyl peroxide lotion on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Proactiv&#x27;s website even addresses the issue, saying it&#x27;s \\&quot;better\\&quot; than the old stuff, and is \\&quot;micronized\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult with no acne</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and have problems from time to time with redness and breakouts on my nose.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so it does cause redness, itchiness, and sensitivity to sun; but it&#x27;s the only acne formula I&#x27;ve tried that really works for me.</li>
            <li> This product has always worked well for me; with this purchase, it was not obvious that this particular bottle was a month away from its expiration date.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well for first few days</li>
            <li> I on the other hand with 45 yo skin LOVE what it does for my complexion and as long as you make it your daily skin care regimen</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use all over your face on a daily basis without being overly drying.</li>
            <li> Not entirely sure why they say it&#x27;s the original formula when it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I like this repairing lotion, but I ended up buying a similar product of a different brand that had a high benzoyl peroxide content.  </li>
            <li> I have CLEAR skin for the FIRST time in my life by completely transforming my diet and using the coconut oil for the past year.  </li>
            <li> I bought white towels and that fixed the problem.  </li>
            <li> There are cheaper, natural skin solutions, such as rosehip oil, honey, and tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> It might seem pricey but compared to buying the whole kit (or the headaches and time spent trying to get Proactiv to sell you an individual piece without getting you onto a recurring mail order shipment)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t not dry out my skin and all but eliminates acne.</li>
            <li> Although it did not clear my face up completely it helped a lot, I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong, very irritating fragrance that made me break out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne.</li>
            <li> Now my face is clear and I only have a few scar spots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with adult acne.</li>
            <li> And this stuff I always ran out of long before anything else in the kit.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that your skin drys out (even though I usually have really oily skin) after using it for a while,</li>
            <li> I use it routinely in the area I tend to have issues and only when needed on other parts of my face.</li>
            <li> It dry my face but not at all the pimples.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired prescription strength meds before, but proactiv is the only thing that has cleared up my skin and kept it clear.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I use for my trouble acne spots.  </li>
            <li> but the cleanser (step 1) always dried out my face and left a sunburn type look to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> ( my husband said that may be little bad before it gets better</li>
            <li> Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that there was no shipping number for me to track the order.   </li>
            <li> Why bother with the whole Proactiv system; it&#x27;s absurdly overpriced.  </li>
            <li> It took two days for it to go down.</li>
            <li> If you talk to any dermatologist worth his or her salt, they&#x27;ll tell you there&#x27;s no point in washing with a benzoyl peroxide cleanser, because when you rinse it off, you rinse off the expensive medicine too!  </li>
            <li> just had some black head around my nose and few in my chin</li>
            <li> I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAKOUT,</li>
            <li> It is a little drying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they have changed the formulation or if my skin has become immune to the active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> But I must use everyday, if I miss a day my skin starts to break out.  </li>
            <li> ,then few pimples (monthly thing).   </li>
            <li> I found that if I used it like a mask every night, within three days my skin was dried out and flaking off.  </li>
            <li> My daughter using this everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought the Proactiv Repairing Lotion to replace another product I&#x27;d been using for a long time with poor results.  </li>
            <li> And it works without peeling all of the skin off my face, or without making my entire face red and ugly.  </li>
            <li> New formula does not work for me, so this is useless!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a few of the knock-off, drugstore brands, and they don&#x27;t compare!</li>
            <li> It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin.</li>
            <li> This is not ORIGINAL Proactiv Solution!!</li>
            <li> Too bad, old product worked so well for me.</li>
            <li> I have them all over my  face and no makeup can hide them even a lil bit, i am ashamed to go outside  ,is itchy and painful.</li>
            <li> when i go off the product sometimes ill have a breakout and as soon as i apply the lotion any redness goes away within a few days.</li>
            <li> It always got worse when eating sugar and being stressed out.  </li>
            <li> Only reason for the 4 stars is that it bleaches my towels which is annoying, even if I wash my hands after application.</li>
            <li> , in fact it made the problem worse.</li>
            <li> i needed a benzoil peroxide treatment in replacement for my expensive prescription.</li>
            <li> 3/22/12 AcneFree&#x27;s lotion is difficult to find in stores and on ebay</li>
            <li> Tried the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; version of the product and it was useless for me.  </li>
            <li> but this is just getting worse and worse and the itching is horrible even if i quit using it</li>
            <li> ( So sad i cannot believe i spend almost 20 $ on this lotion that transformed me in a monster :((.</li>
            <li> I had bad skin ALL my life.  </li>
            <li> I have a really bad break out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bad, but I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to get rid of the acne scaring and to my suprise, Proactive acutally works!</li>
            <li> is horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> not for me . benzoil allergic.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use for daily control of acne.  However, if you are still getting cysts, you need to talk to your dermatologist &amp; get an antibiotic</li>
            <li> I stopped using this and tried an OTC acne treatment and it just didn&#x27;t work,  I should have known, if it works, don&#x27;t stop using it!  I&#x27;m 47 years old and still break out and this is the ONLY skin care product that clears up my skin.  I use the mask for any pop ups and it clears it up, almost overnight.  I don&#x27;t use the cleanser or toner, I used a Neutrogena scrub cleanser and Oil of Olay moisturizer.  I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Proactiv is the only product that has ever cleared my skin, and I think the lotion is the most important component of the \\&quot;system\\&quot;. (I only use the cleanser and lotion.) It&#x27;s gentle enough to use all over your face on a daily basis without being overly drying. It is bleaching, however, so you may find you have to use all white towels and pillowcases.</li>
            <li> This is the best way to buy the lotion.  I&#x27;ve been using P.A. for 10years and I still have ance.  There is no way to cure ance. There is tons of treatments out there and this is a good one.  See a real Dr for real treatment.  Yet, keep a clean face, and don&#x27;t over due it.  Try destressing and relaxing to music.  Stress causes almost all skin problems. Think positive and get out and enjoy life.  There are tons of people with ance in this world!  Believe me, this lotion works good only if you spot treat with clearasil after you use it. :) Oh, and becareful near your PJ shirts and sheats. This stuff will bleach the color on them.</li>
            <li> Proactiv helps reduce the spots on my face. I use it twice a day after cleansing, toning my face. Then I finish off with a night cream or day cream accordingly. I think some people find it drying but it certainly works for me and can not do without it. It was given to me as a gift from a friend. I shopped around looking for it after I have used up the tube. I order what I need and as I need it from Amazon and it works out cheaper than buying direct from Proactiv.</li>
            <li> My skin acts up once a month, and I use this as my daily face lotion to control it. I use my normal face wash daily, and my normal face lotion the rest of the month, but when my skin needs a little more acne control, this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Easily bleaches out towels even after carefully washing hands.</li>
            <li> this seller was quick. my only complaint is that there was no shipping number for me to track the order.   the product itself is good. i needed a benzoil peroxide treatment in replacement for my expensive prescription. works well, has 2.5% bp which is as effective as the 5-10% they sell at drugstores. it is very creamy and smooth and smells good. i will be buying again..</li>
            <li> Works pretty good in general, but for me (older adult), nothing works nearly as well as healthy eating and coconut oil.  I had bad skin ALL my life.  It always got worse when eating sugar and being stressed out.  Healthy food means fruits and vegetables and NOT eating processed junk. (Hint:  a granola bar is NOT a healhy food, its processed!) Virgin coconut oil applied to face and body lightly once or twice a day is all I need for my skin.  (Found at health food stores, research it!)  I have CLEAR skin for the FIRST time in my life by completely transforming my diet and using the coconut oil for the past year.  The diet made the most difference (give it three months), not just for my skin or my weight but for my life.</li>
            <li> It works n shipping is on time</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> delivery is ontime but the parcel is too big for my order, so when i opened the box, all my stuff was scattered all over the box w/o any protection. good luck that i did not order anything that can be broke inside. the lotion is good and the expiration date is right. i love the price that i paid for and happy to save money this way..i&#x27;ll order w/amazon again. thank you.</li>
            <li> WHEN EVER I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAKOUT, THIS LOTION WORKS GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is so much clearer and softer now.  But I must use everyday, if I miss a day my skin starts to break out.  Overall love results and will buy again.  You can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with adult acne. This is the only thing I have found that actually works for me! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it works very quickly to stop a break out. I use it routinely in the area I tend to have issues and only when needed on other parts of my face. I haven&#x27;t had to deal with a break out since I&#x27;ve started using this product. I love it!</li>
            <li> ...not a paid spokesperson, or some flaky-fake person; and Proactiv really does work.  And it works without peeling all of the skin off my face, or without making my entire face red and ugly.  I have been using the Proactive 3-step kit for 2 years now; and it&#x27;s one of the only things that really works for me consistently and effectively.  I&#x27;m a fan!  :)</li>
            <li> STEP 3 IS A MIRRACLEEEEEE</li>
            <li> best moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used! my skin gets fairly oily, so this light lotion is all the facial moisturizer i ever need (besides a little SPF from time to time). Personally, it works best when i use it at night, my skin always look clearer in the morning. SIDENOTE: i&#x27;ve tried a few of the knock-off, drugstore brands, and they don&#x27;t compare!</li>
            <li> This product is great! I ordered it from Clear Sink Source and I received my package with in 3 days</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this after reading so many good positive reviews.As soon as i received i start using it(it really sting at first),i just had some black head around my nose and few in my chin ,then few pimples (monthly thing).   I am 24 i never ever had so many pimples on my face as i have now after 3 days of using this cream is horrible they just come out more then i have yesterday or the day i first start it( my husband said that may be little bad before it gets better but this is just getting worse and worse and the itching is horrible even if i quit using it,I wish i can just get my money back and never hear about this name ,brand again.It dry my face but not at all the pimples.I have them all over my  face and no makeup can hide them even a lil bit, i am ashamed to go outside  ,is itchy and painful.:( So sad i cannot believe i spend almost 20 $ on this lotion that transformed me in a monster :((. Have appointment for dermatologist Monday and i hope they can &#x27;&#x27;fix&#x27;&#x27; my face somehow...I will update this after i c the dr.</li>
            <li> I dont use all the steps in the procactiv line  Everytime I get a pimple I just apply this lotion and it really works!!  I swear by it and my skin is so sensitive1</li>
            <li> This is the only proactive product I use. Dove soap and this afterwards twice a day and I stay blemish free.</li>
            <li> This product works great! My acne has really cleared up! I will definitely be buying more Proactive in the future</li>
            <li> This is a product that is remarkable...I&#x27;ve referred several of my friends to use this line of cosmetics...works well and the shipping options make the use very handy. Even my husband is using this repairing lotion-who knew!!!</li>
            <li> This product was shipped super fast, and came in perfect condition! i will definitely buy from this person again! thanks!</li>
            <li> When I first started using proactive it worked really well, but over time is no longer effective.  I&#x27;m not sure if they have changed the formulation or if my skin has become immune to the active ingredient.  Either way I can no longer endorse this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old I&#x27;ve always had acne since I became a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really helps keep my acne away..&lt;br /&gt;It works!!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it Tuesday was at my house by Friday..&lt;br /&gt;Ships quickly..</li>
            <li> I ordered it and then it was there like the next day almost. I was like wow its here already.</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost 5 years.</li>
            <li> Not only does it reverse break-outs in progress, but it really does seem to substantially accelerate healing.  It will bleach your clothing and bedsheets, though, so watch out for that!</li>
            <li> Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Do use all three components of the set if you can. Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased as a gift for my son. He needed something to help manage his acne and found Proactive to be most effective. We bought this through a vendor on Amazon&#x27;s website, the price was much cheaper than what is available at the local malls and   it arrived in a timely manner. A good purchase at an   affordable price ($12.00) plus shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> this is the only proactiv product i use and it keeps my skin blemish free. when i go off the product sometimes ill have a breakout and as soon as i apply the lotion any redness goes away within a few days. you can get the cleanser for a fraction of the price with clean and clear at any supermarket and i found that the toner stains my clothes and fabrics orange.     im about to buy from this seller for the first time.</li>
            <li> We got what we asked for, and received it when we were told. Perfection. This seller is amazing. Not only that: this stuff works. Just apply it in the mornings and at night &amp; your skin will be amazingly smooth &amp; clear.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful about this repairing lotion after reading alot of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, this product did not work. It had made my face become oily and broke out with pimples after only one use. I am in my 40&#x27;s and I was looking for a lotion that would help replenish my skin and make it more even toned.&lt;br /&gt;That did not happen. I will keep looking for a lotion that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You, Amazon and The Body Place</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years... works well and isn&#x27;t oil based so your skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teenager and just started having acne for over a year now. It&#x27;s not as bad, but I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to get rid of the acne scaring and to my suprise, Proactive acutally works! I only use the lotion because that&#x27;s all you really need. I use a gental foaming Neutrogena wash and just apply the lotion after.     I&#x27;ve only used it for about 2 weeks and the acne scars have visibally reduced and my breakouts have reduced as well! Now my face is clear and I only have a few scar spots on my cheeks. The only down side is that your skin drys out (even though I usually have really oily skin) after using it for a while, so I alternate using Proactive with a Neutrogena moistureizing lotion.     Good product that actually works, but I&#x27;m sure results vary on different skin types. And it smells like baby powder!</li>
            <li> My daughter had some pimples on her forehead.  After using Proactive just a couple of nights the pimples started disappearing.  She kept using nightly until they had totally disappeared, about 4 nights.</li>
            <li> Great product to clear skin without completely drying and flaking skin around blemish.  I would definitely recommend this product to others .</li>
            <li> This product is great for keeping my skin looking smooth.  Great product for skin maintenance.  Proactiv is always a good choice.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and this really helps my skin heal. It&#x27;s gentle and non greasy. Used this for years.</li>
            <li> My children do not like this Pro Activ skin system ...I on the other hand with 45 yo skin LOVE what it does for my complexion and as long as you make it your daily skin care regimen I can guarantee, you will love it too.</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv religiously for years, but honestly, didn&#x27;t see that big of an improvement.  And this stuff I always ran out of long before anything else in the kit.  It&#x27;s nice I could find more available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Came on time, and works great...I use this product all the time..And didn&#x27;t have to pay full price like on the proactiv site..</li>
            <li> This product has always worked well for me; with this purchase, it was not obvious that this particular bottle was a month away from its expiration date.  Didn&#x27;t notice that untiI I took it out of the box and the expiration date was plastered all over it.  Fortunately, this type of product works fine after the expiration date, and it was cheaper!</li>
            <li> If you talk to any dermatologist worth his or her salt, they&#x27;ll tell you there&#x27;s no point in washing with a benzoyl peroxide cleanser, because when you rinse it off, you rinse off the expensive medicine too!  Why bother with the whole Proactiv system; it&#x27;s absurdly overpriced.  That said, their lotion is pretty much irreplaceable, since it has the medication in a lotion form, which is exceedingly rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use Purpose or Cetaphil cleanser with Proactiv&#x27;s lotion AT NIGHT.  In the morning, use the same cleanser, but you&#x27;ll need to use a moisturizer/sunscreen combo to prevent skin cancer, so you cannot use this stuff!  Try Aveeno Daily Moisturizer spf 30 or Neutrogena Healthy Defense spf 30 or 45. Both are very good (and noncomedogenic) and recommended by many dermatologists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be SURE you never use a moisturizer or a suncreen (either separately or as a combo) that has zinc oxide - zinc oxide turns your skin white because it is a \\&quot;physical\\&quot; blocker - it literally lays on top of your skin instead of being absorbed into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan&#x27;s Regimen from acne dot org is okay, except for the fact his daily moisturizer lacks an spf, and except for the fact some people prefer a lotion benzoyl peroxide treatment at night instead of a gel.  Amazon has a 2oz bottle for $9, which is cheaper than you can get it on ebay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps one day when the Acnefree lotion or the Klear Action lotion are sold separately, it will be cheaper than this stuff, but until then, Proactiv is the cheapest 2.5% benzoyl peroxide lotion on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 8/26/10  I purchased a bottle of the \\&quot;New\\&quot; proactiv lotion two weeks ago.  It has a very strong, very irritating fragrance that made me break out.  Proactiv&#x27;s website even addresses the issue, saying it&#x27;s \\&quot;better\\&quot; than the old stuff, and is \\&quot;micronized\\&quot;.  They do NOT address the new fragrance!  I have since switched to Acnefree&#x27;s \\&quot;repair lotion\\&quot;, which is 3.7% benzoyl peroxide.  It is slightly gritty, but fragrancefree, and time-released.  You can get it on ebay much cheaper than Proactiv is on Amazon or ebay.  I highly recommend switching to AcneFree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 5/15/11 Still going strong! The only evidence of my \\&quot;acne\\&quot; is one or two tiny pin-sized whiteheads a month right around my \\&quot;time of the month\\&quot;. Still using AcneFree at night but I&#x27;m also using ProActiv&#x27;s mask treatment once/week, definitely helps with the blackheads. Have not had a real zit or pimple for two years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 3/22/12 AcneFree&#x27;s lotion is difficult to find in stores and on ebay so I&#x27;ve found Acne dot org&#x27;s 8oz bottle of \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; which is 2.5% BP; it&#x27;s the cheapest lotion/gel available these days. Order from here or Dan&#x27;s website. It&#x27;s fragrance free and comes in an easy to use large bottle. If you have very sensitive or dry skin, you&#x27;d be wise to top with a noncomedogenic lotion like CeraVe at night, since this is not moisturizing like the AcneFree lotion was. I&#x27;m still only getting one or two tiny pin-sized whiteheads a month before my \\&quot;time of the month\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I like this repairing lotion, but I ended up buying a similar product of a different brand that had a high benzoyl peroxide content.  Keep in mind this will stain your towels and clothes, but that&#x27;s the case with all acne products of this nature.  I bought white towels and that fixed the problem.  Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> I bought the Proactiv Repairing Lotion to replace another product I&#x27;d been using for a long time with poor results.  The Proactiv lotion blew me away!  It works better than I could have expected.  A couple of things to note about it: 1. You might not need to use it every day.  I put it on my forehead every night, but I use it more like an on the spot treatment for the rest of my face.  I found that if I used it like a mask every night, within three days my skin was dried out and flaking off.  I&#x27;ve had excellent results using it as described above. 2. The lotion has a bleaching effect on fabric.  When you&#x27;re done applying it, wash your hands with soap.  Do not just wipe your hands off on a towel or it&#x27;ll take the color out of it.  Also, be mindful of the pillow case you use if you put it on at night.  Once the Proactiv dries it&#x27;s pretty stable, but I still wouldn&#x27;t rest my head on a prized pillow case while using it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. Amazing product which helps keep your skin clear. It is a little drying but it&#x27;s worth it to keep my skin clear. Only reason for the 4 stars is that it bleaches my towels which is annoying, even if I wash my hands after application.</li>
            <li> I love this Proactiv lotion.  It is a great preventative acne lotion for everyday application.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and it is very effective.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have ever used I have a really bad break out and all I have to do is to apply it on and in 3 days it is cleared up so cheap for a very good fix I have told all of my friends and they love proactive repairing lotion and the price is really affordable</li>
            <li> It works really well with my skin and acne. It&#x27;s so magical that once I put it on, the pimples went down alot</li>
            <li> Works great for my skin always has</li>
            <li> fast shipping and good product.</li>
            <li> Not entirely sure why they say it&#x27;s the original formula when it&#x27;s not. I did research and specifically bought this, though it wasn&#x27;t the most cost effective, because I thought it was the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;And it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> After using this product I will not go without it. Amazing. Doesn&#x27;t not dry out my skin and all but eliminates acne.</li>
            <li> Review update    It worked very well for first few days but then it did not do anything.</li>
            <li> Great product, will definitely buy again and reccommend to any one who is looking for such a product good job seller.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this! I used it for a couple weeks and it did nothing to help my skin, in fact it made the problem worse. My boyfriend also tried it and after one use his face was swollen, red, and itchy. It took two days for it to go down.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in time and was fine except it had an expiration date in 2 months.  This is too soon for this kind of product.</li>
            <li> For sure, we don&#x27;t have to pay too much or get it regularly. But we need that. My daughter using this everyday.</li>
            <li> The Proactiv Repair Lotion is amazing! It works to clear up the slightest breakout quickly. A little goes a long way too. I&#x27;m a forever customer!</li>
            <li> The proactiv products are overpriced and undersized. There are cheaper, natural skin solutions, such as rosehip oil, honey, and tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Used it for 2 years.</li>
            <li> works great for my husband without over drying! great price... beats buying it at the mall! fast dhipping. would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Although it did not clear my face up completely it helped a lot, I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> As descibed.  Shipped as indicated</li>
            <li> Work perfect! No need for the Washer and the Toner! Repairing Lotion does the job well! You feel the change in your face quickly!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years, but stopped getting it from proactive sites because this is the main product I love.  Get it, it smooths out the skin overnight, every night, it is great.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I use for my trouble acne spots.  It has a very smooth application and absorbs into the skin quickly.  I&#x27;ve tired prescription strength meds before, but proactiv is the only thing that has cleared up my skin and kept it clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult with no acne and I swear by this Repair Lotion by Proactive.  Nice bright complexion.</li>
            <li> Used the original repairing lotion for years as a stand-alone acne treatment with great results.  Tried the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; version of the product and it was useless for me.  Too bad, old product worked so well for me.</li>
            <li> Packed well.  Pleased</li>
            <li> Received item quickly and it was as described.</li>
            <li> all the benefits of using proactiv without having to sign up to 289472984 weeks of commitment. works well. smells okay.</li>
            <li> This is a product I try to keep on hand for my several grandchildren. I have given them several of this product. When I need more I can always count on Amazin to not only have it but to get it to me quickly.</li>
            <li> I was paying $50 a month for the 3 step kit and ended up throwing out or giving away Steps 1 and 2. The toner (step 2) is ok  but the cleanser (step 1) always dried out my face and left a sunburn type look to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This Lotion (Step 3) is soft, smooth and non-irritating.  I&#x27;m so glad someone sells it individually. It might seem pricey but compared to buying the whole kit (or the headaches and time spent trying to get Proactiv to sell you an individual piece without getting you onto a recurring mail order shipment) it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product.  I am 64 years old and have problems from time to time with redness and breakouts on my nose.  I just put this on for a couple of days, and it clears up.  This is not a product just for teens . . . it works wonders!</li>
            <li> This is not ORIGINAL Proactiv Solution!! They just ship you a new formula instead of original! New formula does not work for me, so this is useless!</li>
            <li> I started using this product in 2006 when I was 49.  I was using the three step process but found that the repairing solution was the reason my skin improved.  I have sensitive skin so it does cause redness, itchiness, and sensitivity to sun; but it&#x27;s the only acne formula I&#x27;ve tried that really works for me.</li>
