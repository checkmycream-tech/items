            <li>great product, works quickly.</li>
            <li>Great Price, product and quick shipping</li>
            <li>I found colorless Iodine to have more of an effective.</li>
            <li>This is been a bit more effective for me.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, and dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Now they are nice and strong.  </li>
            <li>I am sure instructions are a very important thing to know.</li>
            <li>I still have two more bottles in reserve &amp; plan to continue the program.  </li>
            <li>At any rate, I would buy this again, though I sincerely hope I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li>and I was glad they did.</li>
            <li>need more time to evaluate effectiveness&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had problem nails for many years..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this stuff is available over the counter!</li>
            <li>I will be sure to update this when I have used it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it will take a while (maybe more than two weeks) to see the results though.  </li>
            <li>Be sure and use as directed or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and for me this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li>My toenails grew back and were in perfect shape in time for summer.</li>
            <li>glad I found it cheaper here.</li>
            <li>and my toenails are returning to their healthy color.</li>
            <li>I was quite concerned because most of my family members have been battling nail fungus for decades.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a bottle of tea tree oil, and it works better than this one.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>really sure it was going to do anything for me.</li>
            <li>However, it after a month I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s a bit better.</li>
            <li>There was a blank spot on the box that would have been perfect for the sticker.</li>
            <li>Lets give it more time.</li>
            <li>Try something better.</li>
            <li>It took forever but the my nail is about 95% better.</li>
            <li>He said he is excited he can wear flip flops again and will use and recommend to others!</li>
            <li>It is relatively easy to use; just coat the problem</li>
            <li>Its easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>it goes on clear and dries super fast so that awesome!</li>
            <li>It actually kind of smells like coconut which I really like.</li>
            <li>I really saw amazing results when I started using in twice a day--once in the morning and once at night.</li>
            <li>As of today, my nail is fungus free.</li>
            <li>Transaction was great, but not sure if the product is that effective.</li>
            <li>I am super happy that its finally going away.</li>
            <li>How excited can we get about toenail fungus products?</li>
            <li>; applicator is user friendly.</li>
            <li>but this is actually almost as effective as the prescription brand (PGULA solution) that I have but WAY cheaper!</li>
            <li>I saw some results at first so ordered three more bottles.</li>
            <li>This was the most effective of several products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Time is the true test here.</li>
            <li>so I cannot give my full review</li>
            <li>So far so good still using it, haven&#x27;t been as consistent as I need to be though.</li>
            <li>I had some mild fungus for quite a while under my pinky toenail and</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this product on a couple of toe nails that were mildly infected.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and fast results</li>
            <li>The easy to use application was greatly appreciated.  </li>
            <li>I can see healthy nail near the cuticle.</li>
            <li>- The nail is completely clear and healthy.</li>
            <li>A nurse told me that as you get older, most people get fungus in the toe nails and can&#x27;t do much about it.  </li>
            <li>im trying it right now</li>
            <li>I put it on all of my toenails right after my shower.</li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>Works right from the start.  </li>
            <li>I imagine that you&#x27;d see results much more quickly and satisfyingly on a smaller nail or on fingernails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first bottle of product, with three more in reserve, so I&#x27;m prepared to continue doing the treatments for the foreseeable future.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I am definitely not ashamed of showing my toes anymore :)</li>
            <li>It really has done wonders for my embarrassing, flaky toenails!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Another product I used was much better (although the infection came back after a pedicure).</li>
            <li>She asked me if I had left a review and wanted to make sure to let people know that this product works.</li>
            <li>After a month, my toe nails are even more infected and turned very yellow.</li>
            <li>I tested it on a fungus-free nail first</li>
            <li>I will continue use for several more months, before offering an opinion.</li>
            <li>In fact I was so pleased I tried the same thing on my &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; toenail which has been damaged for some time.  </li>
            <li>the only thing ok about</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other OTC treatments, and have found the Omega Labs the most effective.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell and stronger than other OTC &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The pills were effective at curing my smaller toenail problem, but I had no luck on the pills getting my large toenail to come clear.  </li>
            <li>so we will wait and hope for some positive results</li>
            <li>As you probably know, it takes a long time until the darkened nail material grows out, along with your nail (often six months or more) &amp; you may need to use two bottles to do that.</li>
            <li>I pretty much tried everything and nothing got rid of the fungus on my toe nails.</li>
            <li>I used this product regularly for about a month and did not find it incredibly successful (though to be fair, I have heard from my doc that to really battle a fungal infection you have to use a product regularly for at least 9 months (the time it takes for a nail to fully grow out).  </li>
            <li>I has a slight flowery scent which is nice as it drys instead of a chemically smell like others.</li>
            <li>The results: both my large toe nails have improved, but are by no means \\&quot;normal\\&quot; at this point.  </li>
            <li>This product really works it just takes time.</li>
            <li>the shipping is really fast.  </li>
            <li>This does nothing for me,save your money and buy something much better..........been using it for quite some time now and no signs of nothing...........................................................................................................................................................................</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to do much</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something for my toenails and this stuff really seems to be working for me</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li>He was really embarrassed to purchase</li>
            <li>and I was very embarrassed about my toe.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Applying this for over a month did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>just need to keep putting 2x if you really want it gone</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really know.</li>
            <li>I guess it does not amount to much, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It is also a good idea to continue using the stuff at least a couple times per week after the fungus is gone, to protect from re-occurrence.</li>
            <li>I have nail fungus in both large toes, one more severe than the other.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, I plan to purchase another bottle (I still have over a half bottle left after a month of use).  </li>
            <li>Supplier put two stickers on top of each other so could not read &amp;#34;Stop use and consult doctor if.&amp;#34;  Thus, I  could not read it.  </li>
            <li>but I have tried other things with better results.</li>
            <li>I notice a tremendous difference on week two and just put in an order for my second bottle!</li>
            <li>First bottle must have lasted nearly a year while eliminating all signs of fungus within a few months and continued promoting healthy nail growth.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who has a nail fungus problem.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who has a nail fungus problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t had to clear the debris much at all</li>
            <li>and now my nail is growing normal without any fungus.</li>
            <li>One pedicurist said it looked like I had damaged the matrix of the nail and that it would never look normal.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my nail after about a week, but expect it will take another bottle of treatment until it&#x27;s fully normal.</li>
            <li>Good ad, but poor work.</li>
            <li>I clipped my two affected toenails down SO far, I thought I would never be able to wear sandals again.</li>
            <li>so I try not to, but life happens) it will dry with a sort of white tint, but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li>I used it and followed instructions and the nail started to grow normally and clear!</li>
            <li>TNTR means &amp;#34;too new to rate&amp;#34; This product will require time to prove its effectivenss on the fungus</li>
            <li>so I think the new nail is growing fungus</li>
            <li>My wife has very sensitive skin (even on her feet) and this product did not cause any problems (given that it would touch the skin surrounding the nails).</li>
            <li>The thing I love the most about this is that it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that the nail underneath was clear and healthy-looking.  </li>
            <li>She used one bottle and her nails were completely clear.</li>
            <li>My nail is beginning to grow out clear.</li>
            <li>but it does clear the nails</li>
            <li>I do have to warn those with sensitive skin it can irritate your skin</li>
            <li>It appears to be working, but one bottle won&#x27;t do much if you apply it daily.  </li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t worked</li>
            <li>I alternate this with straight tea-tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came 1 month from being out of date  old.</li>
            <li>and now that is going away slowly but surely</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like too much is if I put it on and happen to get my hands wet within the first 5-10 minutes (which sort of defeats the purpose</li>
            <li>There is an obvious curve of boundary between old and new nail.  </li>
            <li>About a year ago I noticed that one of my toe nails had a large white patch and that the portion of the nail that was white was no longer attached to the nail bed.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a few days and can already tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young and I caught a fungus since I was a young teen.</li>
            <li>Have been using about a month and as yet the fungus is not gone on my big toenail..still hoping it will clear it up</li>
            <li>and I am starting to get clear nails growing in.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to testify of its effectiveness in whole.</li>
            <li>I would first say to cut and file your nails down as far as you can possibly file them in order to reap all of the benefits of this product.</li>
            <li>the pink color is back thanks omega labs.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;ve only rated this product three stars because it&#x27;s simply too early to judge</li>
            <li>Used for about a month so far, although I forgot it when leaving the house for several days in the middle.</li>
            <li>But no long term improvement whatsoever.</li>
            <li>My doctor tells me that topical nail fungus medications (such as this) can take as long as TWO YEARS to accomplish a complete cure.  </li>

            <li> - The nail is completely clear and healthy.</li>
            <li> A nurse told me that as you get older, most people get fungus in the toe nails and can&#x27;t do much about it.  </li>
            <li> im trying it right now</li>
            <li> I put it on all of my toenails right after my shower.</li>
            <li> Priced right.</li>
            <li> Works right from the start.  </li>
            <li> I imagine that you&#x27;d see results much more quickly and satisfyingly on a smaller nail or on fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first bottle of product, with three more in reserve, so I&#x27;m prepared to continue doing the treatments for the foreseeable future.  </li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I am definitely not ashamed of showing my toes anymore :)</li>
            <li> It really has done wonders for my embarrassing, flaky toenails!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Another product I used was much better (although the infection came back after a pedicure).</li>
            <li> She asked me if I had left a review and wanted to make sure to let people know that this product works.</li>
            <li> After a month, my toe nails are even more infected and turned very yellow.</li>
            <li> I tested it on a fungus-free nail first</li>
            <li> I will continue use for several more months, before offering an opinion.</li>
            <li> In fact I was so pleased I tried the same thing on my &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; toenail which has been damaged for some time.  </li>
            <li> the only thing ok about</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other OTC treatments, and have found the Omega Labs the most effective.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell and stronger than other OTC &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The pills were effective at curing my smaller toenail problem, but I had no luck on the pills getting my large toenail to come clear.  </li>
            <li> so we will wait and hope for some positive results</li>
            <li> As you probably know, it takes a long time until the darkened nail material grows out, along with your nail (often six months or more) &amp; you may need to use two bottles to do that.</li>
            <li> I pretty much tried everything and nothing got rid of the fungus on my toe nails.</li>
            <li> I used this product regularly for about a month and did not find it incredibly successful (though to be fair, I have heard from my doc that to really battle a fungal infection you have to use a product regularly for at least 9 months (the time it takes for a nail to fully grow out).  </li>
            <li> I has a slight flowery scent which is nice as it drys instead of a chemically smell like others.</li>
            <li> The results: both my large toe nails have improved, but are by no means \\&quot;normal\\&quot; at this point.  </li>
            <li> This product really works it just takes time.</li>
            <li> the shipping is really fast.  </li>
            <li> This does nothing for me,save your money and buy something much better..........been using it for quite some time now and no signs of nothing...........................................................................................................................................................................</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something for my toenails and this stuff really seems to be working for me</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> He was really embarrassed to purchase</li>
            <li> and I was very embarrassed about my toe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Applying this for over a month did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> just need to keep putting 2x if you really want it gone</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really know.</li>
            <li> I guess it does not amount to much, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is also a good idea to continue using the stuff at least a couple times per week after the fungus is gone, to protect from re-occurrence.</li>
            <li> I have nail fungus in both large toes, one more severe than the other.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, I plan to purchase another bottle (I still have over a half bottle left after a month of use).  </li>
            <li> Supplier put two stickers on top of each other so could not read &amp;#34;Stop use and consult doctor if.&amp;#34;  Thus, I  could not read it.  </li>
            <li> but I have tried other things with better results.</li>
            <li> I notice a tremendous difference on week two and just put in an order for my second bottle!</li>
            <li> First bottle must have lasted nearly a year while eliminating all signs of fungus within a few months and continued promoting healthy nail growth.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who has a nail fungus problem.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who has a nail fungus problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t had to clear the debris much at all</li>
            <li> and now my nail is growing normal without any fungus.</li>
            <li> One pedicurist said it looked like I had damaged the matrix of the nail and that it would never look normal.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my nail after about a week, but expect it will take another bottle of treatment until it&#x27;s fully normal.</li>
            <li> Good ad, but poor work.</li>
            <li> I clipped my two affected toenails down SO far, I thought I would never be able to wear sandals again.</li>
            <li> so I try not to, but life happens) it will dry with a sort of white tint, but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li> I used it and followed instructions and the nail started to grow normally and clear!</li>
            <li> TNTR means &amp;#34;too new to rate&amp;#34; This product will require time to prove its effectivenss on the fungus</li>
            <li> so I think the new nail is growing fungus</li>
            <li> My wife has very sensitive skin (even on her feet) and this product did not cause any problems (given that it would touch the skin surrounding the nails).</li>
            <li> The thing I love the most about this is that it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that the nail underneath was clear and healthy-looking.  </li>
            <li> She used one bottle and her nails were completely clear.</li>
            <li> My nail is beginning to grow out clear.</li>
            <li> but it does clear the nails</li>
            <li> I do have to warn those with sensitive skin it can irritate your skin</li>
            <li> It appears to be working, but one bottle won&#x27;t do much if you apply it daily.  </li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t worked</li>
            <li> I alternate this with straight tea-tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came 1 month from being out of date  old.</li>
            <li> and now that is going away slowly but surely</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like too much is if I put it on and happen to get my hands wet within the first 5-10 minutes (which sort of defeats the purpose</li>
            <li> There is an obvious curve of boundary between old and new nail.  </li>
            <li> About a year ago I noticed that one of my toe nails had a large white patch and that the portion of the nail that was white was no longer attached to the nail bed.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days and can already tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young and I caught a fungus since I was a young teen.</li>
            <li> Have been using about a month and as yet the fungus is not gone on my big toenail..still hoping it will clear it up</li>
            <li> and I am starting to get clear nails growing in.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to testify of its effectiveness in whole.</li>
            <li> I would first say to cut and file your nails down as far as you can possibly file them in order to reap all of the benefits of this product.</li>
            <li> the pink color is back thanks omega labs.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I&#x27;ve only rated this product three stars because it&#x27;s simply too early to judge</li>
            <li> Used for about a month so far, although I forgot it when leaving the house for several days in the middle.</li>
            <li> But no long term improvement whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My doctor tells me that topical nail fungus medications (such as this) can take as long as TWO YEARS to accomplish a complete cure.  </li>
            <li> use as directed on toe nails regularly and it will clear up nails.. tried other things</li>
            <li> My opinion on the situation at this point is that it took a long time for the fungus to develop, so it&#x27;s going to take a similar period of time for it to go away.  </li>
            <li> Did not use it long enough to prove the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> In the morning my nails look a little worse, but better after showering and at bed...</li>
            <li> It has only been used for 4 weeks, possibly some improvement, but not certain.  </li>
            <li> - 1/9/14 - I have now used this product every day for the past four months, following the label instructions to the letter, and have used all of two bottles so far.  </li>
            <li> My two big toes had turned dark on the outside and had lots of keratin debris.  </li>
            <li> I know its a long process</li>
            <li> But though this takes a long time to make a visible improvement, it DOES work.  </li>
            <li> My toe nail cleared up within a matter of months (it takes a long time for fungus to go away).  </li>
            <li> This  product  did not clear up my fungus</li>
            <li> directly with the bottle &amp; allow a few minutes to dry once per day.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time but this product works well.</li>
            <li> after I shower in the morning I let the nail dry for about 10 min, then apply the treatment.  </li>
            <li> My husband has been trying different products for years with no success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been treating both nails according to the product instructions for a little over three weeks as of this writing, and so far the perceptible results are only a very slight improvement in both nails.  </li>
            <li> The directions are pretty vague, but I used it daily.</li>
            <li> even though what I had took off half of my big toe nail.</li>
            <li> Within 4 weeks or so (applying it on top of nail polish because my toes looked so bad) I decided to take the polish off because it was chipping off anyway.</li>
            <li> It works, although u may need more than one bottle, depending on how bad fungus is.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost 2 months, and I have seen absolutely no results.  </li>
            <li> The nails are getting much less dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased it on Amazon after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for the past 2 years, this is the only product that works.</li>
            <li> Upon the research there was nothing saying about the active ingredient in this product - Undecylenic acid, which I used before</li>
            <li> Im a man with thick, coarse nails</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell like a lot of other products.</li>
            <li> It is as if it is just slightly scented warranted.  </li>
            <li> Although it did slightly improve the look of my infected nail, it didn&#x27;t come close to working as advertized.</li>
            <li> I can say that the discoloring lightened in less than 24 hours, not drastically, but some counts.</li>
            <li> gave 4 stars cuz I hope it doesn&#x27;t take that long and does seem to be slow working but working none the less!</li>
            <li> I have used other products in the past and never had a problem.  </li>
            <li> So, I still use it hoping it will help a little.</li>
            <li> smells a little chemically</li>
            <li> Toe nail fungus is tough and I&#x27;ve used several products.</li>
            <li> However, this seems to have taken away my problem with just a few uses.</li>
            <li> separating from the nail bed and even turning green at times.  </li>
            <li> Used it over a 3 months period and only kept the infection from getting worse.  </li>
            <li> I used these drops for a few weeks, maybe four (?)</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just dried debris from applying at night Esp since I can kinda pick it away.</li>
            <li> Waste of money - no results.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> So, basically that was the waste of the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and have seen do change.</li>
            <li> I had fake nails for a while, and needed to clean up a fungus from the fake nails (tips).  </li>
            <li> a few applications a day took care of it in under a week!</li>
            <li> If you have a small amount of fungus on your toe</li>
            <li> but it still grew back weirdly.  </li>
            <li> Several products I have tried over the years have reduced the disturbing appearance and reduced the discomfort of nail fungus, but this is not one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a regimen of 1-3 times per day, usually 1-2 times per day during the week, then 2-3 times weekends.</li>
            <li> Used for months, not sure if it worked.</li>
            <li> I mean black and hard and curled.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first but after 2 weeks I saw results.</li>
            <li> It´s not quick, non of this products are, since  nail fungus are really  tough.</li>
            <li> hard to tell...  </li>
            <li> It is hard to tell the end result as this could take up to six months.  </li>
            <li> I use this every night like it says, and it has been at least 5 weeks, and nothing.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product, other than the annoying  price change from $4.00 to $6.00</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that has serious nail fungus problems like my self.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately another ineffective product and waste of time.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for some people, but in my case it just made things worse.</li>
            <li> and now I have a completely different issue to deal with now- and ugly toe!</li>
            <li> very weak (thin layer then break).</li>
            <li> I got a nail fungus on 5 of my fingernails from wearing fake nails.  </li>
            <li> There are no ingredients listed on the bottle which makes me skeptical.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me,  actually make it worst.</li>
            <li> The podiatrist I went to said it was a fungus, removed the nail and sold me some expensive fungus product</li>
            <li> Toenail fungus infections are notoriously difficult to eliminate.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> ( I know sounds random).</li>
            <li> The nail was thick and crusty and sometimes painful.</li>
            <li> After trekking for 5 days in Peru my nails where in bad shape, this product Save My Nails&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> He said he could see results in a week and his toe nail was BAD.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see that this stuff does not work for me after I read all the reviews.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer did not have the info on their website so I needed to go to dermatologist to get prescription which took 9 days to get over the horrible rash.  </li>
            <li> becuase they need to use this product real bad</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product really works it just takes time. However, you must use it every day to get the desired result. I plan on ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband.  The easy to use application was greatly appreciated.  It seems to be solving his problem.</li>
            <li> Im a man with thick, coarse nails and Ive tried everything . My nails were noticeably whiter in just three days. Can&#x27;t say enough about this.......the ONLY one that works!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used it on daily basis for several weeks my toe nails cleared up ad the pink color is back thanks omega labs.</li>
            <li> I bought this product back in may 2013, and I had try everything before this product. I read all the reviews for this product and I thought I would give it a try and now my nail is growing normal without any fungus. I would recommend this product to anyone that has serious nail fungus problems like my self.</li>
            <li> Product caused a severe allergic reaction, i.e. blistering over 20% of each foot when only applied to one toe.  I have used other products in the past and never had a problem.  Supplier put two stickers on top of each other so could not read &amp;#34;Stop use and consult doctor if.&amp;#34;  Thus, I  could not read it.  The manufacturer did not have the info on their website so I needed to go to dermatologist to get prescription which took 9 days to get over the horrible rash.  Beware.</li>
            <li> It is working great !</li>
            <li> hard to tell...  I was taking several products including oral vitamin products to help with the toe fungus issue? Did this product help?  Don&#x27;t know? Did it hurt? not at all... all I know is ... the fungus is gone and I would probably get this again if I had the problem again</li>
            <li> A nurse told me that as you get older, most people get fungus in the toe nails and can&#x27;t do much about it.  So, I still use it hoping it will help a little.</li>
            <li> Just received second bottle. First bottle must have lasted nearly a year while eliminating all signs of fungus within a few months and continued promoting healthy nail growth.</li>
            <li> Does not work, try &amp;#34;Mycocide&amp;#34; , I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s currently a topical product on the market that permanently kills toenail fungus. Mycocide comes the closest to keeping the nail presentable and hold the fungus at a minimum if used according to directions.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a couple of weeks there was no difference at all. I know its a long process but I have tried other things with better results. So I don&#x27;t think it works.</li>
            <li> I have nail fungus in both large toes, one more severe than the other.  I&#x27;ve been treating both nails according to the product instructions for a little over three weeks as of this writing, and so far the perceptible results are only a very slight improvement in both nails.  My opinion on the situation at this point is that it took a long time for the fungus to develop, so it&#x27;s going to take a similar period of time for it to go away.  I&#x27;m still on the first bottle of product, with three more in reserve, so I&#x27;m prepared to continue doing the treatments for the foreseeable future.  At some future date, I will update this review to relate what my results with this product are at that time.  In the meantime, I&#x27;ve only rated this product three stars because it&#x27;s simply too early to judge it&#x27;s effectiveness yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 1/9/14 - I have now used this product every day for the past four months, following the label instructions to the letter, and have used all of two bottles so far.  The results: both my large toe nails have improved, but are by no means \\&quot;normal\\&quot; at this point.  I still have two more bottles in reserve &amp; plan to continue the program.  My doctor tells me that topical nail fungus medications (such as this) can take as long as TWO YEARS to accomplish a complete cure.  A complicating factor is that I&#x27;m semi-diabetic &amp; that may be slowing the rate of my healing, but my doctor couldn&#x27;t confirm if that was actually the case.  I&#x27;m still going to keep my rating for this product at three stars for now, &amp; when I have finished using the two bottles I still have in reserve, I will do a final review update.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my big toe discoloration for a while and now that is going away slowly but surely and nothing worked for me before</li>
            <li> So far so good still using it, haven&#x27;t been as consistent as I need to be though.</li>
            <li> the shipping is really fast.  im trying it right now but i will review it after the third week too .now it is a good produvt</li>
            <li> I was prescribed Lamisil and gave that a shot, despite the potential hazards to my liver.  The pills were effective at curing my smaller toenail problem, but I had no luck on the pills getting my large toenail to come clear.  But though this takes a long time to make a visible improvement, it DOES work.  I imagine that you&#x27;d see results much more quickly and satisfyingly on a smaller nail or on fingernails.  At any rate, I would buy this again, though I sincerely hope I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> This was the most effective of several products I have tried. It is relatively easy to use; just coat the problem nail(s) directly with the bottle &amp; allow a few minutes to dry once per day. As you probably know, it takes a long time until the darkened nail material grows out, along with your nail (often six months or more) &amp; you may need to use two bottles to do that. It is also a good idea to continue using the stuff at least a couple times per week after the fungus is gone, to protect from re-occurrence.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I&#x27;m young and I caught a fungus since I was a young teen. I pretty much tried everything and nothing got rid of the fungus on my toe nails. I started using this because a lady at a nail salon recommended it to me and I was glad they did. I used it and followed instructions and the nail started to grow normally and clear! I am super happy that its finally going away. The thing I love the most about this is that it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it. It actually kind of smells like coconut which I really like. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who has a nail fungus problem.  I am definitely not ashamed of showing my toes anymore :)</li>
            <li> It looked like it was working 1-2 weeks in, but it&#x27;s 5 months later, and my big toe still looks like.... something that no one will ever see again. The directions are pretty vague, but I used it daily. Sometimes, 2x daily... just in case.</li>
            <li> Antifungal medications take time to cure infection&lt;br /&gt;Will need more time to evaluate effectiveness&lt;br /&gt;Received product as advertised&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply</li>
            <li> How excited can we get about toenail fungus products? However, this seems to have taken away my problem with just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have had problem nails for many years..separating from the nail bed and even turning green at times.  I have had the best results with this product and my nails are reattaching. I reordered more!</li>
            <li> After trekking for 5 days in Peru my nails where in bad shape, this product Save My Nails&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> Did nothing to help. I found colorless Iodine to have more of an effective. Might work for some but not for me.</li>
            <li> TNTR means &amp;#34;too new to rate&amp;#34; This product will require time to prove its effectivenss on the fungus so we will wait and hope for some positive results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this stuff is available over the counter! It really has done wonders for my embarrassing, flaky toenails! I put it on all of my toenails right after my shower. Within 4 weeks or so (applying it on top of nail polish because my toes looked so bad) I decided to take the polish off because it was chipping off anyway. I was amazed that the nail underneath was clear and healthy-looking.  This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This does nothing for me,save your money and buy something much better..........been using it for quite some time now and no signs of nothing...........................................................................................................................................................................</li>
            <li> What can I say, this worked.  I had some mild fungus for quite a while under my pinky toenail and a few applications a day took care of it in under a week!</li>
            <li> This  product  did not clear up my fungus, I am still look some else for help my toe fungus help.</li>
            <li> I have had fungus on the nail of my big left toe for a year and tried several products. This is the only one that has worked. I really saw amazing results when I started using in twice a day--once in the morning and once at night.</li>
            <li> My husband has been trying different products for years with no success. He swears by this! He&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy :-)</li>
            <li> This product does its job! My wife has very sensitive skin (even on her feet) and this product did not cause any problems (given that it would touch the skin surrounding the nails). She used one bottle and her nails were completely clear. Before using this treatment, her nails were stained for using nail polish and this product actually got rid of the stains. No side effects whatsoever! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost 2 months, and I have seen absolutely no results.  It is as if it is just slightly scented warranted.  I would definitely not recommend.</li>
            <li> I am using this now twice a day.  I will be sure to update this when I have used it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 months later:  Did not work.</li>
            <li> Not enough time has transpired to determine how well the treatment is working.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and stronger than other OTC &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; applicator is user friendly. Time is the true test here. If it works I&#x27;ll add to my review saying how good it is.</li>
            <li> I have never found a product to treat my toe nail fungus.  I was vigilant, using this product every day as directed for months but I did not notice any improvement.</li>
            <li> Used it over a 3 months period and only kept the infection from getting worse.  Another product I used was much better (although the infection came back after a pedicure).</li>
            <li> great product, works quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent...great results, it will take a while (maybe more than two weeks) to see the results though.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and her nail got well after using this product.  She asked me if I had left a review and wanted to make sure to let people know that this product works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now and already bought my second bottle for when i run out. It works great and I am seeing results. Cant wait to have this problem taken care of and without having to see a doctor. Will update with photos when results are in.</li>
            <li> Was ordered when I ran out of what I had even though what I had took off half of my big toe nail. I am using what I received from my doctor and have put Omega on hold.</li>
            <li> all this is a good product and it  works so good i am trying to get the ladies to use this product in the nail shop becuase they need to use this product real bad</li>
            <li> It is hard to tell the end result as this could take up to six months.  In the short time I have used the product it seems to be showing a decline in the fungus.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product. I had my toenails done and got a fungus. I have been using this product every day. My nail is beginning to grow out clear. I recommend it highly. Be sure and use as directed or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product on a couple of toe nails that were mildly infected. After a month, my toe nails are even more infected and turned very yellow. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Maybe it works for some people, but in my case it just made things worse.</li>
            <li> Have been using about a month and as yet the fungus is not gone on my big toenail..still hoping it will clear it up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product off and on. I must say I don&#x27;t use it regularly, but it does help. I&#x27;ve tried many and for me this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Sure beats the laser treatment which is over 1,000 dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to be frank with you.... the only thing grosser than toenail fungus was my obsession with getting rid of mine.  I clipped my two affected toenails down SO far, I thought I would never be able to wear sandals again. I used these drops for a few weeks, maybe four (?)and it was gone.  My toenails grew back and were in perfect shape in time for summer.</li>
            <li> Worked good.  Took out the infection and fungus.</li>
            <li> use as directed on toe nails regularly and it will clear up nails.. tried other things but this is the best in my book. would recommend  this to anyone.</li>
            <li> this thing did not work</li>
            <li> If you have a small amount of fungus on your toe I do not recommend buying this. It kills the nail and the skin under the nail making the entire nail completely white. I tested it on a fungus-free nail first and now I have a completely different issue to deal with now- and ugly toe! This product may do its job by killing the fungus but it does not make your nail look any better, if anything worse!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be working for me.  I got a nail fungus on 5 of my fingernails from wearing fake nails.  I&#x27;m making an appointment to see a dermatologist.  From what the reviews say, this will work for some nail fungi but not all.  It was low in cost so I thought I would give it a go.</li>
            <li> I went through 2 bottles over the course of about 5 months. Although it did slightly improve the look of my infected nail, it didn&#x27;t come close to working as advertized. I would not recommend this product based on my person experience.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item before from a salon and wanted to try it again.  Transaction was great, but not sure if the product is that effective.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Cleared up my issue within two weeks!</li>
            <li> Treatment consists of application for up to a year.  It has only been used for 4 weeks, possibly some improvement, but not certain.  I will continue use for several more months, before offering an opinion.</li>
            <li> There is no smell, which is great, but I cant tell what it&#x27;s doing. This could be water for all I know. I use this every night like it says, and it has been at least 5 weeks, and nothing. There are no ingredients listed on the bottle which makes me skeptical.</li>
            <li> This product shipped in no time at all and works in clearing up nail discoloration. If you&#x27;re suffering from nail fungus I would first say to cut and file your nails down as far as you can possibly file them in order to reap all of the benefits of this product. I notice a tremendous difference on week two and just put in an order for my second bottle! I would definitely recommend this product, other than the annoying  price change from $4.00 to $6.00</li>
            <li> Great Price, product and quick shipping</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Great stuff for you toes</li>
            <li> I think it work&#x27;s . The smell from my nails went away but that was about it .</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> When I got toe fungus my pedicurist sold me this for $10, glad I found it cheaper here. It works, although u may need more than one bottle, depending on how bad fungus is.</li>
            <li> I got the product March 6th, 2014. I&#x27;ve been applying it once a day since receiving it.  My nails are clearing up.  My two big toes had turned dark on the outside and had lots of keratin debris.  They were even lifting a bit.  I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t had to clear the debris much at all and my toenails are returning to their healthy color.</li>
            <li> works great! I can see the difference!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me,  actually make it worst. I tried it for about two months.</li>
            <li> was satisfied with the product and it worked well !</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. I used it twice a day for weeks. Oh well, on to the next thing.</li>
            <li> It work for me ! 2 of my hand nails used to grow very weak (thin layer then break). Now they are nice and strong.  Thank you omega !</li>
            <li> It says to use twice a day, but I used this once a week and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my life would get to the point that I&#x27;d ever by raving about a fungus product but c&#x27;est la vie.  About a year ago I noticed that one of my toe nails had a large white patch and that the portion of the nail that was white was no longer attached to the nail bed.  I was quite concerned because most of my family members have been battling nail fungus for decades.  I went to a pedicurist and she recommended this product.  I have to say I was very pleased.  I followed her instructions which were after showering to put a drop of alcohol under the nail and then follow that up with a drop or two of the Omega.  My toe nail cleared up within a matter of months (it takes a long time for fungus to go away).  In fact I was so pleased I tried the same thing on my &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; toenail which has been damaged for some time.  One pedicurist said it looked like I had damaged the matrix of the nail and that it would never look normal.  The podiatrist I went to said it was a fungus, removed the nail and sold me some expensive fungus product but it still grew back weirdly.  So just for the heck of it I tried the Omega product and, while not yet perfect, the look of my &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; nail is much improved and I&#x27;m going to continue to to use the product.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something for my toenails and this stuff really seems to be working for me smells a little chemically but it is what it is so no biggie it goes on clear and dries super fast so that awesome! I noticed results immediately. I highly reccomend this product! A-</li>
            <li> Toenail fungus infections are notoriously difficult to eliminate.  Several products I have tried over the years have reduced the disturbing appearance and reduced the discomfort of nail fungus, but this is not one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced.  There is an obvious curve of boundary between old and new nail.  Now, when will somebody come up with a fungicide for the sinus cavities?</li>
            <li> Sorry, it doesn&#x27;t work for me. I ordered a bottle of tea tree oil, and it works better than this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month now and I am starting to get clear nails growing in.  I love the smell.  I do have to warn those with sensitive skin it can irritate your skin so user beware.  If you do I just wipe off the liquid if it gets on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some issues on the nail which I must have gotten from the gym. I applied this twice a day and after a week I noticed a big difference in the nail. So yes, it worked for me. I has a slight flowery scent which is nice as it drys instead of a chemically smell like others.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after looking online A LOT, and wasn´t really sure it was going to do anything for me. But it does. It´s not quick, non of this products are, since  nail fungus are really  tough. But I had fungus on 4 of my toe nails and now I only have them in 2. So I think it works, it´s not a miracle, obviously, but it does the job..</li>
            <li> It appears to be working, but one bottle won&#x27;t do much if you apply it daily.  This should probably be packaged in sets of two or bigger bottles!  Very, very tiny.  However, it after a month I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s a bit better.</li>
            <li> takes dedication to remember to do this twice a day but it actually does kill the fungus on, under, around your toes and toenails.  I have noticed that ANY fungus killer that actually works weakens the nails so the fungus part actually flakes off but this is actually almost as effective as the prescription brand (PGULA solution) that I have but WAY cheaper!</li>
            <li> I saw some results at first so ordered three more bottles. But no long term improvement whatsoever. Unfortunately another ineffective product and waste of time.</li>
            <li> thank you. excellent product</li>
            <li> I just got the product and cannot tell whether it works or not because it is too soon to tell. The problem I had with the product is that they put a bar code sticker over all the instruction. There was a blank spot on the box that would have been perfect for the sticker. I am sure instructions are a very important thing to know.</li>
            <li> I got this for my brother in law. He was really embarrassed to purchase so I got for him in his Easter basket ( I know sounds random). He said he could see results in a week and his toe nail was BAD. I mean black and hard and curled. He said he is excited he can wear flip flops again and will use and recommend to others! A+ on shipping and price.</li>
            <li> Been using twice daily before and after sleep (after AM shower), and seems to be working. Used for about a month so far, although I forgot it when leaving the house for several days in the middle. In the morning my nails look a little worse, but better after showering and at bed...I think it&#x27;s just dried debris from applying at night Esp since I can kinda pick it away. Mist of the fungus appears to be towards the end of the nail so I think the new nail is growing fungus free.&lt;br /&gt;Says you can use with or without polish but ice only done without since it isn&#x27;t quite flip flop weather.&lt;br /&gt;Directions say to stop use after 12 weeks ... gave 4 stars cuz I hope it doesn&#x27;t take that long and does seem to be slow working but working none the less!</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t worked</li>
            <li> I just started using it a couple of weeks ago. I just started my 2nd of four bottles. Lets give it more time.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first but after 2 weeks I saw results. You must follow instructions including brushing your nails with soap and water in the AM.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with Funga Soap (also sold on Amazon) and they seem to be working well together.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to testify of its effectiveness in whole. I can say that the discoloring lightened in less than 24 hours, not drastically, but some counts. It has a pleasant smell, and dries fairly quickly. The only thing I don&#x27;t like too much is if I put it on and happen to get my hands wet within the first 5-10 minutes (which sort of defeats the purpose so I try not to, but life happens) it will dry with a sort of white tint, but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other OTC treatments, and have found the Omega Labs the most effective.  I purchased it on Amazon after reading other reviews. I&#x27;ve been on a regimen of 1-3 times per day, usually 1-2 times per day during the week, then 2-3 times weekends. -  for about a month.  There has been quite a bit of improvement, but, as anyone with a toe fungus issue knows, this is a slooow process. after I shower in the morning I let the nail dry for about 10 min, then apply the treatment.  I wait to put on my socks last, and then reapply before bed at night.  I noticed a difference in my nail after about a week, but expect it will take another bottle of treatment until it&#x27;s fully normal. The smell is pleasant, I plan to purchase another bottle (I still have over a half bottle left after a month of use).  I cannot believe I&#x27;m writing about toe fungus.  I&#x27;m officially my mother.</li>
            <li> Waste of money - no results.</li>
            <li> I got a pedicure at a nail shop 12 years ago and when I took the polish off,I had nail fungus. It never improved over the years and I was very embarrassed about my toe. The nail was thick and crusty and sometimes painful. I ordered this product in December 2013. I used it faithfully and within 2 weeks I started to see improvement. Understand that you have to let the nail grow out. As of today, my nail is fungus free. I cut off the last part this morning. I am so grateful that I found this product and that it was so affordable!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for the past 2 years, this is the only product that works. Super easy to use and fast results</li>
            <li> Did not work properly or at all to help alleviate my big toe nail fungus problem!!!</li>
            <li> this does not work beware i useed this for my son and got no result the only thing ok about it is the price and i see why</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see that this stuff does not work for me after I read all the reviews. Try something better.</li>
            <li> I have the type that grows under the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying this for over a month did absolutely nothing. I cleaned the area and used it generously.</li>
            <li> have to wait to see if my nails will grow back correct&lt;br /&gt;slow process so I cannot give my full review&lt;br /&gt;nails look cleaner white getting there.............</li>
            <li> This is the best product out there!!!</li>
            <li> WE USED IT AS PER DIRRECTIONS AND AFTER 3 WEEKS NAILS STARTED HEALING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS&lt;br /&gt;THATS ALL&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE IT</li>
            <li> works well - takes time</li>
            <li> Awesome  Get the  best  when u have tried the rest.IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> I had fake nails for a while, and needed to clean up a fungus from the fake nails (tips).  My nails&lt;br /&gt;have grown out and the fungus is gone.  Priced right.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who has a nail fungus problem.</li>
            <li> Used for months, not sure if it worked. Toe nail fungus is tough and I&#x27;ve used several products. Going back to tea tree oil and vinegar soakings.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cure but it does clear the nails</li>
            <li> My troublesome feet are showing an impressive improvement. The nails are getting much less dry.</li>
            <li> bought it for hubby with fungus on his big toe! works! just need to keep putting 2x if you really want it gone but in our case, we don&#x27;t put it regularly (still works).. you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my uncle, but he hasn&#x27;t tried it so I don&#x27;t really know.</li>
            <li> I only had to put this on my toe for a couple nights and it all cleared up. I would recommend. It.</li>
            <li> Did not use it long enough to prove the effectiveness. I guess it does not amount to much, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. Waste of money. I used it for some time and did not see any improvement in my condition</li>
            <li> we did not care for this product it did not do anything for us</li>
            <li> Good ad, but poor work. Upon the research there was nothing saying about the active ingredient in this product - Undecylenic acid, which I used before and it didn&#x27;t work out. So, basically that was the waste of the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried and used it for 3 or 4 weeks, didn&#x27;t see any improvement within that time frame.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working. I know that getting rid of this stuff can take several months. I can see healthy nail near the cuticle. Its easy to use. I alternate this with straight tea-tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;09/2013 - This is now several months later and I can confirm that this indeed works. It took forever but the my nail is about 95% better. As the nail grows out and I cut the affected area, it will be a 100%. Recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Would give 5 stars if it worked faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;03/2014 - The nail is completely clear and healthy. It took a very long time but this product works well. You just have to be patient and keep doing it.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to be working.  I have been using it for a few weeks now and have seen do change.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have only been using it for a few days and can already tell a huge difference. Also it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell like a lot of other products.</li>
            <li> Came 1 month from being out of date  old.</li>
            <li> Gimmick does not work</li>
            <li> I used this product regularly for about a month and did not find it incredibly successful (though to be fair, I have heard from my doc that to really battle a fungal infection you have to use a product regularly for at least 9 months (the time it takes for a nail to fully grow out).  I currently soak my toe each night in a diluted apple cider vinegar solution and then add a drop off tea tree oil (under the nail if possible).  This is been a bit more effective for me.</li>
            <li> Works right from the start.  I have tried everything and Omega Labs product is work for me.  Give it a try.</li>
    </ol>
