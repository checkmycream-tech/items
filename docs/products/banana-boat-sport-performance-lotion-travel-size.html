            <li>Perfect little tubes.</li>
            <li>i bought these for the welcome bag for my wedding guest when i got married in keywest , florida , this brand is great for florida sun and the size are not as small</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Everyone was thrilled to have the smaller size to put in their cars, or purses to have handy when they go out with Grandchildren and decide to do something in the sun.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size for travel, but the sun was hidden by rain clouds on our wedding day!</li>
            <li>Nice and small... great product.</li>
            <li>cheap and suitable for short time use.</li>
            <li>The 30spf is great too, many small tubes are much lower SPF</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size for a purse, diaper bag, to leave in the car (if its not super hot), to leave in a drawer near the door etc.</li>
            <li>Great individual small size that I was looking for, but kind of pricey.</li>
            <li>The little tube was used as part of a favor for a wedding -- everyone loved it.</li>
            <li>I have switched to using only sunscreens with titanium dioxide as they are better for the skin.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed and as advertized.</li>
            <li>Maybe go through a different seller to make sure you get the quantity you&#x27;re supposed to get.</li>
            <li>Everyone was very thankful to have this in the Colorado sunshine!</li>
            <li>good to have available; wish there was a little larger sized&lt;br</li>
            <li>Guests appreciated the sun.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t cover much but serves its purpose.</li>
            <li>Package arrived fast and well protected.</li>
            <li>I thought it worked really well.</li>
            <li>Nice product in a convenient size for that small storage space.</li>
            <li>Buy a box of these and place a tube in every bag, every place that you might store sunscreen, and you will never have to waste time looking for sunscreen any more.</li>
            <li>We used them in tote bags filled with other beach-related items as party favors for a wedding shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sunscreen, I mean really, what more to say.</li>
            <li>Great size and useful as opposed to some other wedding favors that are useless.</li>
            <li>Its good to carry around, but a little bit too small.</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen, not too thick, not too thin.</li>
            <li>For comparison, I did this exact same bike ride the previous two years (same route, same clothing, same time of year)</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s sunscreen, I mean really, what more to say.</li>
            <li> Great size and useful as opposed to some other wedding favors that are useless.</li>
            <li> Its good to carry around, but a little bit too small.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen, not too thick, not too thin.</li>
            <li> For comparison, I did this exact same bike ride the previous two years (same route, same clothing, same time of year)</li>
            <li> I much prefer buying a bunch of these small ones instead of a few big ones and feel like I&#x27;m wasting it.</li>
            <li> Units were a bit smaller than anticipated but other than that, all was as I expected.</li>
            <li> They are terrific little tubes and don&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  </li>
            <li> I put these little tubes in goodie bags for a beach weekend and they were a big hit!  </li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> I found no issues with them and have been using these for the last few months now.</li>
            <li> We bought these to take on vacation with us due to airline policies.  </li>
            <li> every other sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I did a seven-day bike ride earlier this month, during which I was outdoors from sunrise until late afternoon.</li>
            <li> Like that it is in a little travel sized tube.</li>
            <li> not sure if there were any other choices</li>
            <li> 3: fill nooks and crannies of carry on travel ziplock toiletry bag with these little guys&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 4</li>
            <li> The chemicals in this are just too harsh.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of returning the 14 I have to get a box of 24 in return.  </li>
            <li> small one, and comfort for traveling, not to oil</li>
            <li> Small and portable.</li>
            <li> well done but too small.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a small gift I was doing for Bunko night.  </li>
            <li> I found this online and the price was less expensive than what I saw in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I did not want to have to spend money on check luggage and didn&#x27;t want to pay the ridiculous amount of money they would have charged for sunscreen on the boat, so this is the way I decided to go.</li>

            <li> perfect for the overseas wedding as gifts for guests welcome bags</li>
            <li> Just as described, perfect for a beach themed favor.</li>
            <li> Bought these as part of our wedding for our guest welcome bags.  Perfect size for travel, but the sun was hidden by rain clouds on our wedding day!</li>
            <li> I ordered 24 pcs but 23 pcs in the box. what happened ?</li>
            <li> Perfect little size to throw in your purse or car for emergencies. I put them in gift bags for guests visiting an event.</li>
            <li> These were the perfect size just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Nice product in a convenient size for that small storage space.</li>
            <li> Works as promoted. Perfect size for a purse.</li>
            <li> This sunblock works okay for the arms and legs, but when I put it on my face it burns. I did not realize that the sunscreen was causing the severe redness and burning on my face until I stopped using it (I was using this sunscreen a lot in the summer while I was running and biking). I thought I may have a food allergy as I had not had a reaction like this before to sunscreens, but my face is fine since I stopped using this (and all sunscreens with Avobenzine). The chemicals in this are just too harsh. I have switched to using only sunscreens with titanium dioxide as they are better for the skin.</li>
            <li> We bought these to take on vacation with us due to airline policies.  They are terrific little tubes and don&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  They worked fine.  I will probably put some of these in the car for when we are out and about.</li>
            <li> I put these little tubes in goodie bags for a beach weekend and they were a big hit!  Great size!</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.  We got them for wedding gift baskets and they were the perfect size for one person for 2 days.</li>
            <li> I bought 100 of these for wedding favors for a beach wedding. Great size and useful as opposed to some other wedding favors that are useless.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a travel size sunblock to give to our wedding guests at the hotels to put in the welcome bags and there wasn&#x27;t enough at the pharmacies to purchase.  I found this online and the price was less expensive than what I saw in the stores.  These will definitely go great with our welcome packages.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.  Thank you very much!!</li>
            <li> Does the job. No greasy feel. Small and portable. Great summer gift or have a supply in your purse for months to come. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to put in my welcome bags for my destination wedding. I was very pleased with the product.  It was exactly what I needed and as advertized. Amazing, amazing product. The tubes were so cute, I was very excited about it.</li>

            <li> Great product and for a great price</li>
            <li> Never get caught again without sunscreen.Box of 24. Put in cars, backpacks etc. Hand one to someone who forgot.</li>
            <li> I ordered a pack of 24 and only received 14.  I don&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of returning the 14 I have to get a box of 24 in return.  I bought these for my hotel gift bags for my wedding guests.  Maybe go through a different seller to make sure you get the quantity you&#x27;re supposed to get.</li>
            <li> We got these samples for our Destination Florida wedding favors. They were a big hit and we took the leftovers with us on our honeymoon cruise. One tube each gave good coverage, and no sunburns!</li>
            <li> Good size for wedding hotel bags for a beach wedding.  Good product at an affordable price. Guests were pleased to find tubes of this sunscreen in their hotel bags.</li>
            <li> Units were a bit smaller than anticipated but other than that, all was as I expected. We used them in tote bags filled with other beach-related items as party favors for a wedding shower.</li>
            <li> Gave them to our Women&#x27;s Ministries group and they loved it.</li>
            <li> It worked well for our wedding welcome bags. It was a great product and It worked well for what we needed it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the gift baskets.</li>
            <li> These were in hotel packages and at the wedding site.  Guests appreciated the sun. Block as it was a beautiful early summer day on the maine coast.  We liked the size and price of these, along with the security of a brand we were familiar with.</li>
            <li> These were bought for welcome bags for my daughters wedding.  Great size and a nice gift for a cruise wedding/vacation.</li>
            <li> Great deal, great lotion.  Perfect size to carry around.  With it being a screw top, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it opening in your bag!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these for a MOPS end of the year gift and everyone has loved it, a great reminder to use sunscreen on the adults &amp; kids! They are the perfect size for a purse, diaper bag, to leave in the car (if its not super hot), to leave in a drawer near the door etc. I love that it comes in these travel sizes. I found no issues with them and have been using these for the last few months now.</li>
            <li> Great individual small size that I was looking for, but kind of pricey.</li>
            <li> The perfect size for traveling! Provided these to business clients for a golf outing and they were perfect for their golf bags.</li>
            <li> Like that it is in a little travel sized tube. Works well, smells good, and was delivered quickly as promised.</li>
            <li> I buy this in quantity for a youth shelter and the kids like it a lot!  The tubes fit nicely into their backpack pockets - vary handy to locate in a hurry.  They are always asking for more, so I assume that it does the job.</li>
            <li> well done but too small.</li>
            <li> i bought these for the welcome bag for my wedding guest when i got married in keywest , florida , this brand is great for florida sun and the size are not as small you think you can use them plenty of times i still have plenty left over for personal use</li>
            <li> Perfect little tubes. Gave to out of town guests for florida wedding and kept leftovers all over the place &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Bought these to add to my gift bags for my wedding in Palm Springs.  It was sunny so guests were glad to have them.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. It&#x27;s sunscreen, I mean really, what more to say. It&#x27;s greasy and leaves you sticky, just line every other sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. But it comes in 1oz tubes perfect for backpackers</li>
            <li> cheap and suitable for short time use.</li>
            <li> Perfect size to give fellow cruisers in a goodie bag!</li>
            <li> Love the size. Fits anywhere. I am including them in &amp;#34;emergency kits&amp;#34; for my wedding party, since we are having an august wedding and I am concerned about burns. The 30spf is great too, many small tubes are much lower SPF</li>
            <li> perfect sunscreen we have ordered this multiple times</li>
            <li> Ever wasting time to find the sunscreen in the house? This is the solution. Buy a box of these and place a tube in every bag, every place that you might store sunscreen, and you will never have to waste time looking for sunscreen any more.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for arms using.</li>

            <li> These are perfect for my welcome bags for my wedding! It won&#x27;t cover much but serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> We give these away as promos in our beach town  I love these</li>

            <li> good to have available; wish there was a little larger sized&lt;br /&gt;before i ordered it. not sure if there were any other choices</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen, not too thick, not too thin. I have these stashed everywhere: at daycare, in my purse, diaper bags, the car, the house. I much prefer buying a bunch of these small ones instead of a few big ones and feel like I&#x27;m wasting it.</li>
            <li> As part of a beach theme- The little tube was used as part of a favor for a wedding -- everyone loved it.</li>
            <li> My friends are like the lotion</li>
            <li> Banana Boat Performance Sunblock Lotion was perfect for our daughter to give wedding guests as a thank you for attending the wedding.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a small gift I was doing for Bunko night.  Everyone was thrilled to have the smaller size to put in their cars, or purses to have handy when they go out with Grandchildren and decide to do something in the sun.  I may order another package to have on hand at the house for summer guests.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for beach wedding welcome bags!  Perfect size and great price.</li>

            <li> We put these in our gift bags for a beach wedding. Everyone loved them. It&#x27;s good sunscreen, convenient travel size.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re having our wedding on the beach and wanted to give these out as favors for our guests. They&#x27;re the perfect size for this purpose and for flying home to wherever our guests are from!</li>
            <li> Step 1: Purchase the big box of 1oz-ers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: book trip to beach destination (ex: Costa Rica)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: fill nooks and crannies of carry on travel ziplock toiletry bag with these little guys&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 4: Whip out at beach cabana you rented and apply before heading to the beach. Tuck into swimsuit top to look cool en route to beach. Whip out again while on beach for reapplication (good observation - that was 3-4 steps in one)</li>
            <li> We had an outdoor wedding in South Florida.  Most of our guests came from the Northeast. They were delighted to find a tube of sunscreen in the gift bags we made for our guests.</li>
            <li> Awesome buy, used them in our wedding bags!</li>
            <li> I did a seven-day bike ride earlier this month, during which I was outdoors from sunrise until late afternoon. I went through an entire 1-oz tube of Banana Boat sunscreen each day of the ride. I applied a generous amount of sunscreen six times per day (beginning of ride, two rest stops, lunch, two more rest stops). And I still burned! And I&#x27;m brown, so it&#x27;s not as if I burn easily. I don&#x27;t. For comparison, I did this exact same bike ride the previous two years (same route, same clothing, same time of year) and I didn&#x27;t burn at all -- but I used Coppertone sunscreen rather than Banana Boat. Lesson learned! I&#x27;m never using Banana Boat again.</li>
            <li> Gave these out with gift bags I made up for a wedding in the mountains.  Everyone was very thankful to have this in the Colorado sunshine!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re giving our guests welcome bags to our destination wedding in the Philippines.  It came on time and was what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Its good to carry around, but a little bit too small. Its nice if you want always to have a sunblock at hand.</li>
            <li> These are the best giveaway for outdoor festivals. Everyone wanted one!</li>
            <li> i ordered these for welcome baskets at my destination wedding. it was perfect. thank you.  looked great in each basket.</li>
            <li> We are adding these to our Welcome Baskets for a summer wedding.  They are the right price range and appropriate size!</li>
            <li> Great travel size sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Using this product for destination wedding. Nice and small... great product.</li>
            <li> Great choice for my welcome bags for the beach!! Size is perfect. Package arrived fast and well protected. I would order again.</li>
            <li> I used these mini sunscreens for my wedding welcome bags. I thought it worked really well. Great find, would use again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this bulk package of sunscreen for a short trip cruise I was taking. I did not want to have to spend money on check luggage and didn&#x27;t want to pay the ridiculous amount of money they would have charged for sunscreen on the boat, so this is the way I decided to go. These containers are the perfect size and one ounce of sunscreen lasts longer than I thought! I will buy these again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed at a really great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using these in my wedding guest Welcome Bags and they couldn&#x27;t be more perfect!!</li>
