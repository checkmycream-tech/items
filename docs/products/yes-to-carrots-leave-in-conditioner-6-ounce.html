            <li>This has a good amount of oils in it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s formulated to give good conditioning results for all hair types, as well the conditioner.  </li>

            <li>I have been very pleased with all the &amp;#34;yes to carrots&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li>I also love the scent!</li>
            <li>All the tangles just glide out, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth and my hair feels great after.</li>
            <li>This product is a really nice way to treat your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of Yes To products, and have liked most of them.</li>
            <li>This leave in conditioner is super moisturizing, smells good, and its not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li>I think we&#x27;re still more a fan of the heavier conditioner</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I love this product line.</li>
            <li>and it went on a smooth as butter!</li>
            <li>I used a generous amount as I wanted to make sure my hair was coated.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for in a product?</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>To brand for a number of reasons-the most important being safe ingredients, no paragons, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this leave-in product as her daily hair product, and the results are incredible.</li>
            <li>Once was hair was completely dry,I looked in the mirror and it LOOKED great.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, easy to use, not greasy, gets the tangles out and makes her hair softer.  </li>
            <li>There is no residue, which sometimes happens with leave in products, and it can be layered easily with oils.</li>
            <li>I did not notice a scent, which is fine by me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So all in all, it made my hair look great, but it left my hair feeling undesireable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think people realize that it is absorbed through your skin and enters your bloodstream as if you ate it!</li>
            <li>This particular product is not my favorite, though.</li>
            <li>It was really deceptive because here I was, sporting great hair in the mirror, until I actually TOUCHED it!</li>
            <li>But after the next wash it feels super soft, healthy and nice</li>
            <li>This product I could tell from her review has a lot of rich oils in it and is formulated better to meet the needs of hair that requires more oil and moisture (typically African-American hair).  </li>
            <li>I also had tried their other products as well before such as their hand lotion (great stuff!)</li>
            <li>Shampoo and regular rinse out conditioner from the Yes to Carrots line, which I liked the rinse out conditioner (though it didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair as much as I would like it to, but</li>
            <li>I am giving this a \\&quot;3\\&quot; because the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>and this works pretty well.</li>
            <li>ordered two more from amazon recently.</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency and it plays well with other products.</li>
            <li>Major bonus: the ingredients aren&#x27;t toxic, so I feel comfortable using it on a child.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few companies whose products are SAFE!</li>
            <li>Its amazing how many ingredients are put into hair, body, and beauty products that are toxic or questionable.</li>
            <li>I use this on my 3 year old&#x27;s super long, fine hair and it has transformed our bath time routine.</li>
            <li>It really softens her hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of leave in conditioners for my thinning, but really curly hair.</li>
            <li>so this says a lot because I am familiar with a TON of various conditioners&#x27; fragrances.</li>
            <li>curly, kinky, frizzy combo) as my hair requires rich oils for proper moisturizing and this product did the job well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I let her hair air dry overnight and cannot believe how soft and smooth it is in the morning.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and leaves my hair really soft and tamed looking when I let it air dry.</li>
            <li>I have curly and very thin hair and this product works great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very economical -- takes only a tiny amount.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>but after I completely use it, I doubt I will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to buy the regular conditioner/shampoo to see if I like them as much.</li>
            <li>Common sense tells me that a leave-in condtioner is better for your hair, as opposed to what you put on your hair and then rinse out.  </li>
            <li>; makes my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty heavy and leaves my hair more matted down than light and fluffy as I think the description claims.</li>
            <li>Those of you who like to straighten your hair will like the keratin in this conditioner that leaves your hair soft and straight after using a flat iron.</li>
            <li>What used to be a battle of the wills that ended in tears, just trying to comb out her hair after a bath is now a sweet moment between Mommy and her little girl.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s 3B hair is a blend of my fine Norwegian type combined with my husband&#x27;s tightly ringleted African-American curl.</li>
            <li>Sensitive for my dry scalp and very moisturizing and also not too greasy</li>
            <li>It may be a little more price-wise than other leave-ins</li>
            <li>For us it is a pretty average product.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly African American hair.</li>

            <li> White ladies can&#x27;t help commenting on her Shirley Temple type curls, and savvier African American women are curious to know what product I&#x27;m using on my daughter&#x27;s hair (they know curls like that</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft but not weighed down.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until it began to DRY that the problem started for me.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair and after repeated blow drying and curlings, my hair can feel dry.</li>
            <li> A young lady who appeared to have a european caucasin background complained that the product was too greasy for her hair</li>
            <li> I have 4b natural thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Tried with anti-frizz serum.  Not particularly moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It felt rough and dry and somewhat crunchy.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry hair that is curly</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking wet all day.</li>
            <li> I put about a quarter-size amount of it in her wet hair, running it through with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I put this on my wet (relaxed shoulder length) hair</li>
            <li> only use it at night or days where I&#x27;m just going to have my hair up because it makes my hair dry kinda poofy and feels a little greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> I think the directions say to use a quarter size amount and spread through your hair, but that&#x27;s a small amount that would hardly cover much of my hair.</li>
            <li> I will say that it doesn&#x27;t always play well with other products so just be on the lookout for that.</li>
            <li> self-you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I was not thrilled with the scent of this product either and will probably go back to using John Masters leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> The main reason that I like this leave-in conditioner is that it is made with no harmful or questionable ingredients.</li>
            <li> I tried a little, tried a lot, tried everything in between and it just didn&#x27;t seem to work at all as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a leave-in conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but this is working for me.</li>
            <li> I have unruly, thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, wavy and a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li> For my hair this product was absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is a really nice way to treat your hair and scalp. Sensitive for my dry scalp and very moisturizing and also not too greasy so it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking wet all day.</li>
            <li> For my hair this product was absolutely useless. I tried a little, tried a lot, tried everything in between and it just didn&#x27;t seem to work at all as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product is ok. For once, I would like a product to accomplish its purpose as what it is  listed on the bottle. I do like that it has keratin and I use it about three -four times a week. I have 4b natural thick coarse hair. I am not a fan. It&#x27;s ok but after I completely use it, I doubt I will purchase again. I did not buy from this seller, I got it at target.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 3 year old&#x27;s super long, fine hair and it has transformed our bath time routine. What used to be a battle of the wills that ended in tears, just trying to comb out her hair after a bath is now a sweet moment between Mommy and her little girl. I put about a quarter-size amount of it in her wet hair, running it through with my fingers. I let it sit for a minute then run a brush through. All the tangles just glide out, it&#x27;s amazing. I let her hair air dry overnight and cannot believe how soft and smooth it is in the morning. It looks and feels so healthy and styles beautifully. I can see how some would be adverse to the smell, but thankfully no one in our home minds it, in fact we quite like it!</li>
            <li> Tried with anti-frizz serum.  Not particularly moisturizing.  I prefer Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Milk and won&#x27;t buy either product again.  I like Yes to Carrots conditioner, shampoo and the yes to tomatoes skin care products.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, easy to use, not greasy, gets the tangles out and makes her hair softer.  She is already looking to make a 2nd order for these</li>
            <li> I like this product for my frizzy/tangled/dry curly hair. I love the shampoo/conditioner as well and the anti-frizz serum works great good. Good purchase! I will buy these products again.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s 3B hair is a blend of my fine Norwegian type combined with my husband&#x27;s tightly ringleted African-American curl. We&#x27;ve been using this leave-in product as her daily hair product, and the results are incredible. White ladies can&#x27;t help commenting on her Shirley Temple type curls, and savvier African American women are curious to know what product I&#x27;m using on my daughter&#x27;s hair (they know curls like that don&#x27;t just happen without some help!). Major bonus: the ingredients aren&#x27;t toxic, so I feel comfortable using it on a child.</li>
            <li> LOOOOVVVVEEEE this stuff for my hair. Smells great</li>
            <li> this product is perfect to just put in at the end of the shower with no worries about rinsing.  Great product</li>
            <li> Softens and shines.  It&#x27;s very economical -- takes only a tiny amount.  I have been very pleased with all the &amp;#34;yes to carrots&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly African American hair. I love this conditioner for my hair. I wanted something that would give my hair what it needed without it being too greasy. This has a good amount of oils in it but it doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling. It goes on really smooth and my hair feels great after. I will say that it doesn&#x27;t always play well with other products so just be on the lookout for that. When that happens, i find that if i put this in, give my hair about thirty minutes to absorb it, I don&#x27;t have any issues after that. I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency and it plays well with other products. There is no residue, which sometimes happens with leave in products, and it can be layered easily with oils. My daughter has very dry hair that is curly and this works pretty well. I think we&#x27;re still more a fan of the heavier conditioner but this does let her get some second and third day hair anyway. For us it is a pretty average product.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I love this product line. This particular product is not my favorite, though. I will say it smells heavenly. I&#x27;m a bit of a product junkie so this says a lot because I am familiar with a TON of various conditioners&#x27; fragrances. I put this on my wet (relaxed shoulder length) hair and it went on a smooth as butter! I used a generous amount as I wanted to make sure my hair was coated. It wasn&#x27;t until it began to DRY that the problem started for me.Once was hair was completely dry,I looked in the mirror and it LOOKED great. My hair was shiny and my curls defined...I just didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair FEEL. It felt rough and dry and somewhat crunchy. It was really deceptive because here I was, sporting great hair in the mirror, until I actually TOUCHED it! So all in all, it made my hair look great, but it left my hair feeling undesireable. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I use this product about 1-2 times a week depending on the condition of my hair.  This leave in conditioner is super moisturizing, smells good, and its not tested on animals.  What more could you ask for in a product?</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I bought it from target last september and it just finished. I use it on my daughters hair great conditioner. It really softens her hair. Smells great .I ordered two more from amazon recently. Will Defitnetly recommend for lil cuties</li>
            <li> The main reason that I like this leave-in conditioner is that it is made with no harmful or questionable ingredients. Its amazing how many ingredients are put into hair, body, and beauty products that are toxic or questionable. I don&#x27;t think people realize that it is absorbed through your skin and enters your bloodstream as if you ate it! This is one of the few companies whose products are SAFE! It may be a little more price-wise than other leave-ins but it makes up for it self-you only need a small amount. Thank you YesTo!</li>
            <li> Feels like lotion for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it at night or days where I&#x27;m just going to have my hair up because it makes my hair dry kinda poofy and feels a little greasy and heavy. But after the next wash it feels super soft, healthy and nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d recommend it as like a night-repair conditioner.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I love this conditioner. It makes my hair feel softer and shinier every time. I have unruly, thick, wavy hair and I struggle to tame it; this stuff really makes it look nicer. I also love the scent! I&#x27;m hoping to buy the regular conditioner/shampoo to see if I like them as much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of Yes To products, and have liked most of them. This leave-in conditioner is no exception. I have highlighted hair and after repeated blow drying and curlings, my hair can feel dry. I like the Yes To brand for a number of reasons-the most important being safe ingredients, no paragons, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use a quarter-sized amount. I have shoulder length hair and used a dime sized amount, which seemed plenty. My hair feels soft but not weighed down. Some people commented on the scent--I did not notice a scent, which is fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product. It&#x27;s hard to find a leave-in conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but this is working for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It is light weight and leaves my hair really soft and tamed looking when I let it air dry. My hair is thick, wavy and a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li> Common sense tells me that a leave-in condtioner is better for your hair, as opposed to what you put on your hair and then rinse out.  &amp;#34;Yes to&amp;#34; makes my hair so soft.  I hope they never discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing and perfect! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have curly and very thin hair and this product works great.  I&#x27;m sad I can&#x27;t find in on Amazon anymore.</li>
            <li> I would rate this product as \\&quot;OK\\&quot; It seems to remove the tangles but it&#x27;s pretty heavy and leaves my hair more matted down than light and fluffy as I think the description claims. I think the directions say to use a quarter size amount and spread through your hair, but that&#x27;s a small amount that would hardly cover much of my hair. I was not thrilled with the scent of this product either and will probably go back to using John Masters leave in conditioner. I am giving this a \\&quot;3\\&quot; because the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and also looked up reviews on youtube to see what others thought of this Yes To Carrots Leave-In Conditioner.  A young lady who appeared to have a european caucasin background complained that the product was too greasy for her hair and I instantly understood why.  This product I could tell from her review has a lot of rich oils in it and is formulated better to meet the needs of hair that requires more oil and moisture (typically African-American hair).  I also had tried their other products as well before such as their hand lotion (great stuff!) Shampoo and regular rinse out conditioner from the Yes to Carrots line, which I liked the rinse out conditioner (though it didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair as much as I would like it to, but it&#x27;s formulated to give good conditioning results for all hair types, as well the conditioner.  However this leave in conditioner has sealed the deal for me on using their products for my hair (I have african-american hair....curly, kinky, frizzy combo) as my hair requires rich oils for proper moisturizing and this product did the job well. It also smells really good.  So it&#x27;s being added to my favorites list for hair products.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of leave in conditioners for my thinning, but really curly hair. This one is the best, although it does not have the best smell. Those of you who like to straighten your hair will like the keratin in this conditioner that leaves your hair soft and straight after using a flat iron. Would recommend it.</li>
