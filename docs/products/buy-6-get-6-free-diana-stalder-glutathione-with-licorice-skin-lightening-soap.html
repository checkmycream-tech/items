    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I bought this product because of the wonderful reviews on skin lightening.  </li>
            <li>Soap gives a smoother tone to skin so that was great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good..</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 2 months now, and I have seen great results.</li>
            <li>If it continues to fade as it has been, it will be great.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t happy with results</li>
            <li>Has great smell, havent noticed any changes after using for months.</li>
            <li>it is great and</li>
            <li>Likas made my skin more greesy, arggg!!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled!  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because I am also using some great creams and lotions afterwards, so I am sure that also attributed to the great results.</li>
            <li>I just ordered more,,,I want to keep my bright glowing skin</li>
            <li>Smells good to.</li>
            <li>Now , someone recommended me the Koji see, which one is good.</li>
            <li>Maybe good for someone else.</li>
            <li>Good Luck</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>My skin really is nice now.  </li>
            <li>I love these bars smell wonderful and leave you feeling fresh</li>
            <li>but I wish it would work faster and more effectively on my scars.</li>
            <li>My skin complexion is much better, my acne scars have been lighter and lighter and if I get a pimple, it goes away faster than before.</li>
            <li>and I get better and faster results with Kojic acid soap in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this soap.</li>
            <li>I hope this helped. :)</li>
            <li>i consider myself caramel :) however i thought this product would&#x27;ve toned my skin out</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s only gave my face that flawless color and dryness!!  </li>
            <li>I am still using this soap, and learning more about it, from what I have read</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>and I ABSOLUTELY love it.</li>
            <li>This soap gives a nice clean feel.</li>
            <li>I was using PCA pigment bar which does a great job of eliminating skin discolorations, but it makes my skin oilier than it normally is</li>
            <li>I will do another review once I&#x27;ve tried it, so far not too happy.</li>
            <li>The soap is fine though.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m light skin border line brown</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for almost two weeks now and can I just RAVE about how FABULOUS this product is?</li>
            <li>but it really did not!!!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not recommending this item that much!!!</li>
            <li>Very good for dark spots</li>
            <li>but i got significantly darker over the 19yrs of life</li>
            <li>The advertised product showed an original packaging (it had a picture of a woman&#x27;s face).</li>
            <li>Doesnt do anything but clean.</li>
            <li>I just felt clean with the soap.</li>
            <li>I have since moved onto to more natural/organic products, and am very cautious about what I put on &amp; in my body.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product to anyone with oily or mild acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I like to see results quickly</li>
            <li>This is a great product and much cheaper than the others on the market claiming to do the same thing.      </li>
            <li>Maybe this product will work better on normal skin.</li>
            <li>this soap is very effective for discolouration of the skin i highly recommend this soap i use it on a regular bases it works</li>
            <li>I look more like my old self</li>
            <li>I literally watched the hyperpigmented areas fade, right before (</li>
            <li>right away- caused dryness.</li>
            <li>It may be a better product for persons with normal to very oily skin on their bodies and no sensitivities.</li>
            <li>very good product ,you have to use sunscreen though which i am not good at</li>
            <li>I am slowly starting to see some improvements, but what I love about this soap is that it does keep my skin smooth and really keeps the oil off my face.</li>
            <li>I use this soap all the time, but usually with the Whitening Cream to get rid of my hyper pigmentation and it works great.</li>
            <li>Pretty scent, no stinging!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>She has many of the same skin issues as I do</li>
            <li>You do feel a tingling sensation at first.</li>
            <li>but overall i was satisfied</li>
            <li>Amazingly removes dead skin right away.</li>
            <li>I got it for my son, who wants acne scars to fade.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any skin whitening</li>
            <li>This product controlled the oil of my skin very well.</li>
            <li>But this product controls my oily skin really well.</li>
            <li>Very misleading.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always notice the changes in myself as much</li>
            <li>Did not see much of a change in lightness</li>
            <li>The product works very well.</li>
            <li>It works very well,especially when showing consistency.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me and have been using for a while now.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if this stuff really works or not.</li>
            <li>So my face looks more natural and younger.  </li>
            <li>For me i think i over did it because i wanted to get fast results which i&#x27;m sure other people can relate to.</li>
            <li>But the reason why I love this product is because my skin is extremely oily.</li>
            <li>Upon application the feeling of the lather was totally different from the original.</li>
            <li>when used properly you do see a difference, this is my first whitening soap and so far am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>it smells better than the papaya kojic soap and is less drying.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product after viewing a Youtube post by a woman who uses the products and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>honestly, i couldn&#x27;t tell any difference especially alone, not using any other bleaching products</li>
            <li>It helps a little, just okay.</li>
            <li>I have used an entire bar and it SEEMS to be lightening my skin tone, so its worth a shot if you ask me</li>
            <li>PART OF MAINTAINING YOU&#x27;RE NEW SKIN COMPLETION IS CONTINUED USE OF SUNSCREEN even after you&#x27;re done using this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely hate that about my skin because the more oily ur skin is, the more breakouts you are going to get, as well as large pores.</li>
            <li>I just just it would clear up my exzema, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 19yrs old</li>
            <li>i did some research and concluded that i needed STRONGER SPF AND UVA/UVB PROTECTION (didnt realize that my current sunscreen didn&#x27;t have it) because i had over use the product so much that it made my SKIN UNPROTECTED AND SENSITIVE TO DIRECT SUNLIGHT.</li>
            <li>I am accustomed to  using natural products that cater to persons with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It made my skins soft, and did see to help with spots though.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time people.</li>
            <li>I was only able to use it a few times before I had to quit.</li>
            <li>Mild changes to the dark area of my neck.</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t very compatible with my skin in the long run.</li>
            <li>...f.y.i i&#x27;m not dark skin</li>
            <li>Melts fast, keep in dry area after use.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing but dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>No other cream or soap ever did that for me.</li>
            <li>I was frustrated looking at my pictures from my teen years wondering where my beautiful complexion had gone.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that gets me about this is that I cannot leave it too long on my face because it stings &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;&#x27; so I just leave it on for about 3-4 minutes or until it REALLY starts to feel like it is burning.</li>
            <li>Soft, supple and the brown spots have faded, not gone, but then I have only been using the soap for about a month.  </li>
            <li>The soaps is fine just that it&#x27;s very small.</li>
            <li>I cant really review thsi product because I did not use it long enough or properly to see the results.</li>
            <li>I am an african american woman who was born one color but after years of laying and playing in the sun seemed to have developed a permanent tan.  </li>
            <li>Initally it appeared that this product was beginning to lighten certain dark areas</li>
            <li>I&#x60;ve had these dark acne mark scars for almost 3 years now and it really began to take a toll on my inner confidence.</li>

            <li> The soaps is fine just that it&#x27;s very small.</li>
            <li> I cant really review thsi product because I did not use it long enough or properly to see the results.</li>
            <li> I am an african american woman who was born one color but after years of laying and playing in the sun seemed to have developed a permanent tan.  </li>
            <li> Initally it appeared that this product was beginning to lighten certain dark areas</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve had these dark acne mark scars for almost 3 years now and it really began to take a toll on my inner confidence.</li>
            <li> It made my skin worse and now I have more dark spots on my face as a result of the increased acne breakout.  </li>
            <li> In general i believe that products works on some and not on other because we are all different.</li>
            <li> I did not use it long enough however to see any lightening effect.</li>
            <li> the soap didn&#x27;t last very long, about 2 weeks, maybe it needs to be used for a longer time</li>
            <li> because it does dry the rest of my skin out, but that is ok,I just use a different soap for the skin on my body when I shower.</li>
            <li> it keeps the oil and pimples away and as long as it does</li>
            <li> it just takes a long time but long</li>
            <li> If you leave the lather on your face for too long it will Burn.  </li>
            <li> I alternate it with African black soap and dudu osun or sometimes l&#x27;oreal go 360 anti breakout.</li>
            <li> So all i can say is that this product works for me and i would recommend it to other people with similar complexions.</li>
            <li> I tried a few much more expensive products and gels</li>
            <li> but before long my skin became very, very dry.</li>
            <li> I usually cover my myself in natural shea butter after each use to replenish the moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li> and it totally prevents me from getting dark even when I go in the sun</li>
            <li> it does sort of lighten the skin since i&#x27;ve only little results</li>
            <li> and it kinda gets expensive but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The bar was really small barely lasted 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> So now I have very less breakouts, and my pores look alot smaller as well.</li>
            <li> My skin felt parched and tight and I ended up with additional acne on my chest as a result of my skin being TOO dry.</li>
            <li> I have severe hyperpigmentation due to acne breakouts and thought this product would help.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why im going to include characteristics that i think will cause variation between other users.</li>
            <li> I also can use just a moisturizer now, no more heavy make up is necessary.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product being repackaged to look like the real one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap with hope of some of my dark spots will go,  its been now one month and no progress,,</li>
            <li> As a result of over using this product i got FRECKLES!!!!!i think this is an important comment to make because previous reviews didn&#x27;t mentioned the adverse affect of getting freckles.i was really frustrated because i did use sunscreen spf 55</li>

            <li> I had very dark knees from being in the sun a lot</li>
            <li> It is harsh but not as harsh as the Papaya Kojic Acid soap.  </li>
            <li> After the first fews day it will start to break the face out and make it very uncomfortable</li>
            <li> This is a waste of time and money.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love this product! I got it for my son, who wants acne scars to fade. I literally watched the hyperpigmented areas fade, right before (our) eyes- no kidding! We lathered, used a q-tip, spot-tested, and got results within that evening. I used it on my face and got a bunch of compliments on my skin the next day! I made a mistake using it again right away- caused dryness. Pretty scent, no stinging!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Use to lighten up elbows, knees, toes, etc. Didn&#x27;t see any change. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap with the hopes it would lighten some skin discolorations on my face. I am slowly starting to see some improvements, but what I love about this soap is that it does keep my skin smooth and really keeps the oil off my face. My face gets embarassingly shiny because I have oily skin. I was using PCA pigment bar which does a great job of eliminating skin discolorations, but it makes my skin oilier than it normally is so I had to look for something else. I am hoping this soap will do the trick, but if not, I will continue to use it just b/c it keeps the oil and pimples away and as long as it does that I will not need to use a skin lightener because I won&#x27;t have the scarring from the ance breakouts. I come home at the end of the day without needing to wipe the oil off my face and I wake up in the morning without the greasy skin.     I can only use it on my face though because it does dry the rest of my skin out, but that is ok,I just use a different soap for the skin on my body when I shower. I do recommend this product to anyone with oily or mild acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 2 months now, and I have seen great results. My skin complexion is much better, my acne scars have been lighter and lighter and if I get a pimple, it goes away faster than before. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This soap gives a nice clean feel. Smells good to. I like it. I did not use it long enough however to see any lightening effect. I used it less than two weeks. I like to see results quickly and I get better and faster results with Kojic acid soap in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap. I am on my second one now. I didn&#x27;t really see any skin whitening but I did see the scars on my skin getting lighter. But the reason why I love this product is because my skin is extremely oily. I absolutely hate that about my skin because the more oily ur skin is, the more breakouts you are going to get, as well as large pores. This product controlled the oil of my skin very well. No other cream or soap ever did that for me. Likas made my skin more greesy, arggg!!...Likas was a hugeeee disapointment. But this product controls my oily skin really well. So now I have very less breakouts, and my pores look alot smaller as well. I hope I can use this for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the wonderful reviews on skin lightening.  I have severe hyperpigmentation due to acne breakouts and thought this product would help. It made my skin worse and now I have more dark spots on my face as a result of the increased acne breakout.  Maybe this product will work better on normal skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the soap to try after reading about it in a beauty blog.  My skin really is nice now.  Soft, supple and the brown spots have faded, not gone, but then I have only been using the soap for about a month.  If it continues to fade as it has been, it will be great.  I also can use just a moisturizer now, no more heavy make up is necessary. So my face looks more natural and younger.  I gave it 4 stars because I am also using some great creams and lotions afterwards, so I am sure that also attributed to the great results.</li>
            <li> Product made my skin look white, ewwwwww. I like my caramel tone. I just just it would clear up my exzema, but it didn&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t like that. I stopped use.</li>
            <li> I just got this soap in the mail today. The box looks nothing viewed in the image. Very misleading. The box is really small and slightly damaged. The soap is fine though. I will do another review once I&#x27;ve tried it, so far not too happy.</li>
            <li> It helps a little, just okay. Now , someone recommended me the Koji see, which one is good.</li>
            <li> I am an african american woman who was born one color but after years of laying and playing in the sun seemed to have developed a permanent tan.  I was frustrated looking at my pictures from my teen years wondering where my beautiful complexion had gone.  I tried a few much more expensive products and gels but they didn&#x27;t do anything to help me return to my orginal color.  I tried this soap and poof after two weeks people were telling me I looked paler and saying that I didn&#x27;t look tan like I usually do in the summer.  I am thrilled!  I don&#x27;t always notice the changes in myself as much but I have to say that I can see a difference.  My skin is definately lighter.  I look more like my old self and I am over the moon.  This is a great product and much cheaper than the others on the market claiming to do the same thing.      Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
            <li> In general i believe that products works on some and not on other because we are all different. That&#x27;s why im going to include characteristics that i think will cause variation between other users.I&#x27;m 19yrs old and i use to be asian white but i got significantly darker over the 19yrs of life and i want to get back to my former complexion. So all i can say is that this product works for me and i would recommend it to other people with similar complexions. i would like to stress the IMPORTANCE OF USING SUNSCREEN. PART OF MAINTAINING YOU&#x27;RE NEW SKIN COMPLETION IS CONTINUED USE OF SUNSCREEN even after you&#x27;re done using this product. For me i think i over did it because i wanted to get fast results which i&#x27;m sure other people can relate to. As a result of over using this product i got FRECKLES!!!!!i think this is an important comment to make because previous reviews didn&#x27;t mentioned the adverse affect of getting freckles.i was really frustrated because i did use sunscreen spf 55 but i still got freckles. After getting 3freckles i did some research and concluded that i needed STRONGER SPF AND UVA/UVB PROTECTION (didnt realize that my current sunscreen didn&#x27;t have it) because i had over use the product so much that it made my SKIN UNPROTECTED AND SENSITIVE TO DIRECT SUNLIGHT. I hope this helped. :)</li>
            <li> Did not see much of a change in lightness the soap didn&#x27;t last very long, about 2 weeks, maybe it needs to be used for a longer time but unfortunately it was done! Soap gives a smoother tone to skin so that was great!</li>
            <li> Initally it appeared that this product was beginning to lighten certain dark areas but before long my skin became very, very dry. I was using the product only at night so it wasn&#x27;t as though I was overusing it. It just wasn&#x27;t very compatible with my skin in the long run.</li>
            <li> I like the  scent and I cut it into small pieces so it will last. If you&#x27;re not used to it, it will burn your skin. Amazingly removes dead skin right away.</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to  using natural products that cater to persons with sensitive skin. I ordered this product after viewing a Youtube post by a woman who uses the products and highly recommended it. She has many of the same skin issues as I do so I gave it a try. I was only able to use it a few times before I had to quit. My skin felt parched and tight and I ended up with additional acne on my chest as a result of my skin being TOO dry. It may be a better product for persons with normal to very oily skin on their bodies and no sensitivities.</li>
            <li> The advertised product showed an original packaging (it had a picture of a woman&#x27;s face). The product delivered did not have a face on the box and smelled different. Upon application the feeling of the lather was totally different from the original. This is a fake product being repackaged to look like the real one. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing now. I had very dark knees from being in the sun a lot and now i see it fading. I will definitely order again soon.</li>
            <li> The product works very well. I saw the change immediately when continuously using it. It works very well,especially when showing consistency.</li>
            <li> I have since moved onto to more natural/organic products, and am very cautious about what I put on &amp; in my body. It made my skins soft, and did see to help with spots though.</li>
            <li> Definitely saw results on knuckles after 3 weeks. You do feel a tingling sensation at first. Melts fast, keep in dry area after use.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t happy with results</li>
            <li> i hate this and didnt worked for me</li>
            <li> it smells better than the papaya kojic soap and is less drying. it does sort of lighten the skin since i&#x27;ve only little results</li>
            <li> Very good for dark spots</li>
            <li> The soaps is fine just that it&#x27;s very small. I alternate it with African black soap and dudu osun or sometimes l&#x27;oreal go 360 anti breakout.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping for it to brighten my skin tone and it works it just takes a long time but long as you keep scrubbing and using it it works well at a moderate rate.</li>
            <li> I use this soap all the time, but usually with the Whitening Cream to get rid of my hyper pigmentation and it works great. The only thing is, I have to use a lot of cream and it kinda gets expensive but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing but dry out my skin. The bar was really small barely lasted 2 weeks. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible i did not see any results i&#x27;m african american....black indian decent...f.y.i i&#x27;m not dark skin i&#x27;m light skin border line brown i consider myself caramel :) however i thought this product would&#x27;ve toned my skin out but it really did not!!! &amp; on top of that is broke my skin out horrible.. Please do not waste your money...</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap with hope of some of my dark spots will go,  its been now one month and no progress,,, it&#x27;s only gave my face that flawless color and dryness!!  so I&#x27;m not recommending this item that much!!!</li>
            <li> Has great smell, havent noticed any changes after using for months. Maybe good for someone else. My skintone is yellowish</li>
            <li> this soap is very effective for discolouration of the skin i highly recommend this soap i use it on a regular bases it works</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that has/is working on my discoloration.  I have sensitive skin and I use this on my face and body.  It is harsh but not as harsh as the Papaya Kojic Acid soap.  I usually cover my myself in natural shea butter after each use to replenish the moisture in my skin. It works but I wish it would work faster and more effectively on my scars.</li>
            <li> After the first fews day it will start to break the face out and make it very uncomfortable but i see my skin getting a little bit lighter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good.. My skin look a bit lighter and glowing .. I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliment since I&#x27;ve been using it and it totally prevents me from getting dark even when I go in the sun</li>
            <li> very good product ,you have to use sunscreen though which i am not good at but overall i was satisfied</li>
            <li> Doesnt do anything but clean. If you leave the lather on your face for too long it will Burn.  Do not buy this if you are brown and trying to even your tone. This is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I am still using this soap, and learning more about it, from what I have read it is great and when used properly you do see a difference, this is my first whitening soap and so far am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just felt clean with the soap. Mild changes to the dark area of my neck.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me and have been using for a while now.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money. It does not do as it promises. Do not waste your time people. I beg you.</li>
            <li> Okay. I&#x27;ve had this product for almost two weeks now and can I just RAVE about how FABULOUS this product is? I&#x60;ve had these dark acne mark scars for almost 3 years now and it really began to take a toll on my inner confidence. But now that I&#x60;ve used this product I see myself needing less and less makeup and I ABSOLUTELY love it. The only thing that gets me about this is that I cannot leave it too long on my face because it stings &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;&#x27; so I just leave it on for about 3-4 minutes or until it REALLY starts to feel like it is burning. Other than that, I loooove this product and would reccommend it to just about any/everyone!</li>
            <li> I have used an entire bar and it SEEMS to be lightening my skin tone, so its worth a shot if you ask me</li>
            <li> I love these bars smell wonderful and leave you feeling fresh</li>
            <li> I just ordered more,,,I want to keep my bright glowing skin and this is how you do it from the outside.</li>
            <li> Definitely lightened up my skin. My freckles lightened up. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if this stuff really works or not. honestly, i couldn&#x27;t tell any difference especially alone, not using any other bleaching products</li>
            <li> I cant really review thsi product because I did not use it long enough or properly to see the results. But the few times I used the product, I did not have a rash or drying of the skin. Good Luck</li>
