            <li>We love this stuff, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure most people like the pump top</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and i absolutely love this shampoo and body wash.</li>
            <li>grandkids love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and it doesn&#x27;t sting their eyes.  </li>
            <li>Tip: I bought Earth&#x27;s Best Organic Soothing Bubble Bath Lavender  to make a bubble bath then use California Baby Calming Shampoo and Bodywash on a wash cloth to make it last longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pump head ensures that I dont accidently use more than I</li>
            <li>love it, the scent, the quality and no problems with tears</li>
            <li>At first my wife thought this was a good idea.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy on the eyes and smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Loves this JUST for her hair, the scent was too strong and caused her face to break out</li>
            <li>but my husband hates it and says it is too strong.</li>
            <li>Its strong, almost medicinal.  </li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo/soap I use on my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin because it&#x27;s made with the best, most natural ingredients and made by a great company.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product we use on our child - smells great, doesn&#x27;t burn eyes and it&#x27;s safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My baby has extra sensitive skin and this product is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells good, not too strong but enough to give them the fresh out of the tub smell&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle on her skin :)</li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I prefer the old squeeze top bottle</li>
            <li>Best part is a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Our first 19oz bottle lasted 6 mo for our baby.</li>
            <li>It works, smells good, and removes even the grossest dirt and stains (messy artist in this house) from my kid&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>best kids bodywash, very delicate and soft sent</li>
            <li>My wife recieved a bottle for a baby shower when she was pregnant with our 3 year old.</li>
            <li>I used half the bottle on myself until I got sick of it and switched to a new scent - it is now my dog&#x27;s shampoo - and let me say it makes my yorkies coat smell great and look great too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and comes from a company I trust.</li>
            <li>I really like the pump</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very drying.</li>
            <li>I started getting really sensitive skin when I had my first child</li>
            <li>Well, this shampoo&#x27;s scent is not subtle.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been recommending this baby wash for years now and give a bottle to ever new mom</li>
            <li>I love that this company does its part to limit chemicals or artificial ingredients, but I don&#x27;t love the smell.  </li>
            <li>The scent is not overwhelming, quite the contrary to most baby products out there.</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin kids never have an issue with this product.  </li>
            <li>keeps it soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by how this smelled.</li>
            <li>ended up going back to Mustela and will now try another no-sulfate product along with conditioner a few times a week and see if that restores her hair back to how it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;Not pleased.</li>
            <li>We were outside many times; I was always bitten up, but my little guy was bite-free!!</li>
            <li>My wife and I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old and this is the only bath product we have ever used for them.</li>
            <li>The only down side is the cost, but overall, I feel it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>but this is super thick and oily...</li>

            <li> Of course now that we use it for everyone it doesn&#x27;t last QUITE as long as it did for one tiny human.</li>
            <li> Soothing shampoo with a subtle aroma would calm our baby.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to find an alternative to Mustela, because it&#x27;s so expensive (not that this is much cheaper, but it was on sale when I got it)</li>
            <li> it goes a LONG way, like 6-8 months with 2 kids getting bathed 3x a week.</li>
            <li> cures cradle cap, helps heal diaper rash, dry cheeks, clears up congested skin and blackheads, the list goes on.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d spend a few extra dollar and not bath my son with chemicals, and unregulated fragrances.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> when compared to other products, but lasts and lasts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;In 3 and a half years and 2 kids, we have gone through 1.5 bottles.</li>
            <li> I have had a maid come to my house a few times, and whatever she uses on the floor smells like this.</li>
            <li> small bottle, but lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I am generally very sceptical of &amp;#34;granola&amp;#34; type products, and I gave my wife some grief for wanting to keep and use this.</li>
            <li> bottle is tough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Price - Expensive</li>
            <li> an addition is that the lavender scent repels nasty little bugs!</li>
            <li> Making it very difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema really bad.</li>
            <li> Our baby hated it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product for children, youth and adults.  Safe to use and effective.</li>
            <li> I got a sample size container at babyearth.com and I loved it so I now order it in bulk. This is the only shampoo/soap I use on my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin because it&#x27;s made with the best, most natural ingredients and made by a great company. The scent is not overwhelming, quite the contrary to most baby products out there. More expensive than the leading brand but I&#x27;d spend a few extra dollar and not bath my son with chemicals, and unregulated fragrances.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been recommending this baby wash for years now and give a bottle to ever new mom I know! It smells amazing, is calming for all skin, cures cradle cap, helps heal diaper rash, dry cheeks, clears up congested skin and blackheads, the list goes on. I started getting really sensitive skin when I had my first child and now this is one of the only washes I can use. It washes off mascara to boot! All ages in our house use this, infant, toddler and adults! Best part is a little goes a long way. Our first 19oz bottle lasted 6 mo for our baby. Of course now that we use it for everyone it doesn&#x27;t last QUITE as long as it did for one tiny human. Completely love this wash!</li>
            <li> I love that this company does its part to limit chemicals or artificial ingredients, but I don&#x27;t love the smell.  Next time I will not buy this scent.</li>
            <li> I love California baby but this is super thick and oily... Making it very difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.  My baby has extra sensitive skin and this product is wonderful.  Never any irritation on skin or eyes.</li>
            <li> best kids bodywash, very delicate and soft sent</li>
            <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s gentle and smells great.</li>
            <li> I used half the bottle on myself until I got sick of it and switched to a new scent - it is now my dog&#x27;s shampoo - and let me say it makes my yorkies coat smell great and look great too! Gentle on her skin :)</li>
            <li> I love it for the reasons stated by many others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But an addition is that the lavender scent repels nasty little bugs! We were outside many times; I was always bitten up, but my little guy was bite-free!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for all three of my babies when they were newborns to toddlers. It smells delicious and relaxes baby for nighttime. It&#x27;s gentle and comes from a company I trust.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Smells good and is sage for my baby. I really like the pump</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin kids never have an issue with this product.  It smells nice but not overpowering.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> love this bodywash/shampoo. great on my daughters skin. no irritation. keeps it soft and moisturized. smells great too</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells divine!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Have been using for child for 3+ years. Happy camper here.</li>
            <li> Loves this JUST for her hair, the scent was too strong and caused her face to break out so she had to go back to Johnson &amp; Johnson</li>
            <li> My son has eczema really bad. I can&#x27;t say that this cleared it up but I did like that it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;harm&amp;#34; his skin either. No parabens or hash chemicals. Love the smell but my husband hates it and says it is too strong. I am a big essential oil person though!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product we use on our child - smells great, doesn&#x27;t burn eyes and it&#x27;s safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I prefer the old squeeze top bottle but I&#x27;m sure most people like the pump top</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It smells great and is very gentle on my baby&#x27;s skin.  The only down side is the cost, but overall, I feel it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I use it regularly for my kids</li>
            <li> good value size, excellent for babies hair and body, gentle not irritating to skin</li>
            <li> small bottle, but lasts forever. i have 2 kids and i absolutely love this shampoo and body wash. it&#x27;s easy on the eyes and smells lovely. it goes a LONG way, like 6-8 months with 2 kids getting bathed 3x a week.</li>
            <li> At first my wife thought this was a good idea.  Soothing shampoo with a subtle aroma would calm our baby.  Well, this shampoo&#x27;s scent is not subtle.  Its strong, almost medicinal.  Our baby hated it.  We ended up going back to Aveeno and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> Use this in our pool shower....grandkids love it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to find an alternative to Mustela, because it&#x27;s so expensive (not that this is much cheaper, but it was on sale when I got it) and I wanted to see if my daughter&#x27;s hair would be softer if I used something else. I was really surprised by how this smelled. I have had a maid come to my house a few times, and whatever she uses on the floor smells like this. It&#x27;s also very drying. Even to my hands when I shampoo my daughter&#x27;s hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going back to Mustela and will now try another no-sulfate product along with conditioner a few times a week and see if that restores her hair back to how it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;Not pleased.</li>
            <li> I have used this on both my kids.  I love the way it smells and it doesn&#x27;t sting their eyes.  It has a good score on EWG also.</li>
            <li> This is my go to for baths. Tip: I bought Earth&#x27;s Best Organic Soothing Bubble Bath Lavender  to make a bubble bath then use California Baby Calming Shampoo and Bodywash on a wash cloth to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> Smelly great, cleans great!</li>
            <li> After my kid started getting rashes and irritation from J&amp;J body wash, I made the switch. I have nothing but positives to say about California Baby&#x27;s Calming body wash. It works, smells good, and removes even the grossest dirt and stains (messy artist in this house) from my kid&#x27;s skin. I&#x27;ve even used it for myself. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old and this is the only bath product we have ever used for them. My wife recieved a bottle for a baby shower when she was pregnant with our 3 year old. I am generally very sceptical of &amp;#34;granola&amp;#34; type products, and I gave my wife some grief for wanting to keep and use this. She prevailed and we started using it with our son and havent looked back.&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;In 3 and a half years and 2 kids, we have gone through 1.5 bottles. This stuff may be a bit pricey but it lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;The pump head ensures that I dont accidently use more than I need.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, not too strong but enough to give them the fresh out of the tub smell&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is tough. As you can imagine it goes through a fair bit of abuse being dropped and played with, but we havent had any problems with it breaking.&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Price - Expensive when compared to other products, but lasts and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;It will make you feel a bit on the &amp;#34;granola&amp;#34; side</li>
            <li> we keep going back to this.  love it, the scent, the quality and no problems with tears</li>
