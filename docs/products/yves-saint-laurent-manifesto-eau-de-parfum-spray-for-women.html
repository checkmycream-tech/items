            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>Very romantic scent that reminds me of  love.</li>

            <li> Very romantic scent that reminds me of  love. Feminine  feel makes you feel  like  making  love on a cold rainy morning.</li>
            <li> I tried it at Belk&#x27;s it was awesome and lasted all day but this one is so light I have to constantly reapply the fragrance. It wasn&#x27;t worth the price I paid for it.</li>

            <li> I LOVE it.  It is a wonderful scent far beyond my expectations.  The company, eDiscountPermumes, is a pleasure to do business with - the perfume was as described and arrived several days earlier than predicted.  I look forward to doing business with them again.</li>
            <li> ITS OKAY FOR A DAY PERFUME.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and I get numerous compliments ...people always want to know what perfume I&#x27;m wearing!</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it, a very soft powdery smell, that&#x27;s last long and doesn&#x27;t smell like an old lady</li>

            <li> Love the smell, my husband loves it, strangers love it (I know cuz I asked) and it lasts all day</li>
            <li> I had smelled this fragrance in one of those magazine inserts and really liked it.  I used it as soon as it arrived and WOW - I simply love the way it smells - I constantly get asked - &amp;#34;WHAT ARE YOU WEARING - IT SMELLS SOOOOO GOOD!&amp;#34;  Nice - right?  Well if you gals want to get noticed - I highly recommend you purchase this new fragrance!</li>
            <li> Smells very good.&lt;br /&gt;Not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;Purchase for my daughter who is very particular.&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume as it is not overpowering and smells divine.  It has great sillage and longevity.  I think I found my new signature pefume</li>
            <li> This perfume smells good. My wife loves it and she&#x27;s way into expensive perfume. It lasted pretty well in the 100+ degree hit in Vegas and it stays on all day where we live know. She loves it and I love the smell. Good stuff and value for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I believe any fragrance is a truly individual preference--I might like one and someone else may hate it.  So, I hesitate to recommend something that I love, but here goes.  I found this &amp;#34;Parfum&amp;#34; on one of those magazine strips and initially wasn&#x27;t excited about the fragrance.  But as I continued leafing through the magazine, I kept coming back to that strip and smelling it again and again.  I tore the page out and put it on my home office desk to see if I would continue to like the smell.  I did!  I ordered the small bottle as it is somewhat expensive and because I have, in the past, grown tired of one or another.  I love this perfume and have not grown tired of it.  I hope to receive the larger, spray bottle for a present. . .maybe soon?</li>
