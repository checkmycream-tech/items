            <li>I am happy with the results I have seen so far.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This anti-aging cream feels great and makes my face supple and soft.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is a scent free product.</li>
            <li>I think my face is nice and fresh in the morning after using this.</li>
            <li>Ok I am so excited.</li>
            <li>I love how rich and creamy it feels going on my skin.</li>
            <li>Jar makes for easy, even application of just the amount you want.</li>
            <li>(I break out easily if products have fragrance</li>
            <li>The jar makes it so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It works great for fine lines underneath my eye and also keeps my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Also, I see that my pores are getting smaller and my skin looks beautiful</li>
            <li>It softens my fine.</li>
            <li>While many brands add an SPF at a nominal level in their moisturizer, many dermatologists recommend use of one with a broader spectrum and higher SPF number to clients with a disposition to or experience with skin cancer.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, is a fine night cream.</li>
            <li>Using this cream also took away my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Skin is softer, but haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer goes on smoothly and very quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 50 and wanted to minimize my fine lines.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a very mild smell and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>but the cream is very mild and seems to be multi functional like exfoliating and treating...not just a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is helping with fine lines and is brightening up my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am beginning to see a difference with fine lines.</li>
            <li>I am in my 50s and have even begun to see a difference for the fine lines around my eyes and lips.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m noticing a reduction in my fine lines.</li>
            <li>My fine lines are reduced, and my skin stays supple and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal fan for life!</li>
            <li>I started using this twice a day - once in the morning, once at night - and my most stubborn spots are fading quick after just one week.</li>
            <li>Need a bit of time to combat the fine lines, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Abby nice to have your amazing products back.</li>
            <li>I already exfoliate every weekend with a microdermabrasion machine, so I can&#x27;t say that I noticed a huge difference, but</li>

            <li>This is the second product from this company that I have used and I continue to be impressed with the high quality of these products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying new cremes; I have more in my vanity cabinet than I care to count!  </li>
            <li>this product is a wonderful new addition to my daily skin care routine!</li>
            <li>It is so rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>I am not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy when I find a face cream that moisturizes my skin all day long.  </li>

            <li>It is rich and creamy and has so many great skin care ingredients, licorice, vit c and e, green tea, rosehip oil, and glycolic acid.</li>
            <li>I love the new packaging and although I didn&#x27;t mind the pump bottle, I was excited to see it in a jar now!  </li>
            <li>The aha face lotion feels great on my skin and has already worked to keep my dry skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I love face creams and try a different kind every time I run out.  </li>
            <li>My makeup looks more natural and doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product and so far I have not been impressed.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to apply and absorbed rapidly..</li>
            <li>the cream is not at all special.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and it feels fresh all day.</li>
            <li>loving this lotion so far.</li>
            <li>I think with any product with these ingredients, it takes a while to see the full benefits.</li>
            <li>I ordered the full line of products (the vitamin C serum, the eye cream, and the face cream).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not yet received this, but I anticipate that it will be both thoughtful and useful.</li>
            <li>The consistency is a bit thick, but it is perfect for my skin!</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer is a must in my daily makeup routine: it needs to be moisturizing but not too greasy, and this one does just that</li>
            <li>Not using it as a true wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok... can&#x27;t really say I see a difference.</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD!GREAT PRODUCT WILL DEFINATELY BUY AGAIN!THANKS:-)</li>
            <li>Not a bad combo of ingredients, but spoiled ingredients like rotten food.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and not greasy - just the right amount of moisturizer I need.</li>
            <li>The eye cream was filled the right amount, I think.  </li>
            <li>Really though, not only can I see a difference in my fine lines but my skin is clearing up!!!</li>
            <li>Love this new moisturizer!</li>
            <li>This product left my skin feeling moisturized, have a nice light feel, not oily or slimy.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery but</li>
            <li>The pump broke rather quickly though.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I&#x27;m aging gracefully like my mother ...</li>
            <li>She loves the price and the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and I use it morning and night.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a super healer.</li>
            <li>but the smell goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>This rich moisturizer is non-greasy and lightweight, yet effective in terms of hydration and overall enhancement of one&#x27;s skin elasticity and appearance.  </li>
            <li>It is a gift for my fair red haired daughter, I chose it because it was safe for sensitive skin, I have not heard from her</li>
            <li>I tend to favorite lightweight because I have normal to combination skin.</li>
            <li>Recently purchased this cream and find it offers just what I have been looking for--excellent texture, good moisturizing, without the stickiness or oily feel of so many products.  </li>
            <li>I exchanged the product right away, and the replacement was 80% full.  </li>
            <li>and I can really see the difference in the fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>While the deep wrinkles are still there they are not as so much better and the fine lines are not seen.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any miracle in the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, I was not expecting any either.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell if this item is good.i never had pores on my face  before,that wasn&#x27;t my issue.this product gave me huge pores</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for making such a great product.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients in this product - it&#x27;s clear from the label that most are naturally derived, and beneficial for the skin.</li>
            <li>Well worth trying.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft, refreshed and so silky smooth!</li>
            <li>but so far I love it...</li>
            <li>So, I thought the 10 glycolic acid face cream was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels more hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li>Also thrilled that this company actually cares about their customers.</li>
            <li>I had tried serums with success since they are not oil based.  </li>
            <li>what I have noticed is that my skin looks and feels freshly exfoliated each and every day since using this line of products.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I love the texture of the cream and it makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a week and am pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is natural and 100% vegan.</li>
            <li>So far, I am satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to try this product during a promotional period, and I have been pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>I am loving my results after a short period of time.</li>
            <li>The container is nice because you can use the entire product without wasting any.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin look young and healthy.</li>
            <li>At first it will stay on the surface of the skin, but quickly gets absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Also the vitamin c serum is superior to any other serums I have tried.</li>
            <li>As with the other product, the packaging is just so gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>This cream just feels so rich and creamy, and the skin on my face is so much softer, even radiant.</li>
            <li>i am enjoying this product very much specially working outside in this weather</li>
            <li>you know how it is you try and try to find the right products for your face</li>
            <li>no squirting everywhere when pumping out product, and it puts out just the right amount of product for you.</li>
            <li>the price is right an</li>
            <li>but this is the right level of moisture for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no scent at all, which I love, the scented moisturizers usually make me feel nauseous so this is a nice change.&lt;br /&gt;The jar it comes in</li>
            <li>I love that it has such a range of super ingredients...</li>
            <li>I really like the sleek and cool packaging and jar.</li>
            <li>, I am so worried about some of my face, I need something really powerful and this appears to be the one, time will tell, and the delivery was very fast, thanks!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works well with my busy life style.  </li>
            <li>As someone with sensitive skin, I&#x27;m very aware of scented products and there is no artificial scent to worry about here!</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because it is a good moisturizer and has not ended up in the black hole of potions I have.  </li>
            <li>so I was surprised when it ran out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and easy - highly recommend.</li>
            <li>At long last, I have found a moisturizer that is perfect for my maturing, sensitive, combination skin for use both at night and during the day.  </li>
            <li>And better than that, I love how rejuvenated my skin feels after using it only a little more than a month.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a luxury moisturizer at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as many other products do, and leaves it feeling silky and smooth but not greasy</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft, and it diminishes the appearance of my fine lines.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I tried their other products.  </li>
            <li>It has a little scent to it which I cannot explain but nothing overpowering and the consistency feels good on my face.</li>
            <li>As a new Mommy I was so excited.</li>
            <li>my face is sensitive so that is important to me.</li>
            <li>so I applied this on his face, at first he did not want it, but after the first time he has been using it as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to more products in the future.</li>
            <li>I love this product and so does my younger girlfriend!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m dissatisfied with this moisturizer exactly</li>
            <li>I have used this moisturizing cream every morning for the past week and experienced very favorable results.  </li>
            <li>At first I used a lot</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have very different skin types and both were able to use it.</li>
            <li>This aha face moisturier was the the first Toulon product I had tried.  </li>
            <li>When I wrote my first review I got an email from the company then a phone call apologizing for the problem.</li>
            <li>My skin is baby smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Love the texture, and I can actually feel the glycolic acid working!  </li>
            <li>says that if it works so well for a guy then it should work even better for a female..</li>
            <li>Light, not heavy.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed when I got the package is it is not NSF certified or USDA Organic Certified ingredients.</li>
            <li>I first bought the Vitamin C serum and had been using that for a while before I ordered this face cream.</li>
            <li>Starting to notice some smoothing and better tone.</li>
            <li>This product really amazes me!</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more Anti-Wrinkle face moisturizer as soon as it is back in stock.</li>
            <li>Hydrates really well as well!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but my skin is clear, smooth and is no longer blotchy.</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>So two thumbs up, and thanks!</li>
            <li>I use twice daily since I am layering it on top of blemish products (salicylic, benzoyl)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, has little to no scent and works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It feels soft and rich and creamy on my skin.</li>
            <li>As someone in my early 40s and in the hot Texas sun often, I jumped at the chance to get this product with a special promotion.  </li>
            <li>Good for younger people who are starting anti-aging prevention measures.</li>
            <li>This is pleasant smelling, and  long lasting.</li>
            <li>I think all the people who put positive reviews, were paid to do so.</li>
            <li>at first i guess i was applying too much of the moisturizing cream</li>
            <li>I hope it works long term. :)</li>
            <li>think the Glycolic acid cream is a very good product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I used those Clean and Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets and face powder which of course clogged my pores</li>
            <li>The first time, it worked fine, but the pump wouldn&#x27;t squirt anything out the second time around.</li>
            <li>It is amazing that I can use it twice a day without any issues of burning or irritating like I have experienced with other Glycolic acid treatments.</li>
            <li>It is amazing that I can use it twice a day with out any issues of burning or irritating like I have experienced with other glycolic acid treatments.</li>
            <li>I have shelves full of creams that I have tried and not liked, but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li>the packing is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this product, and I absolutely love it, after only about a week of using it!</li>
            <li>The cream is full of ingredients that are great for my skin glycolic acid and other alpha hydroxy acids, licorice root, vitamin c and green tea.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to see the quantity of the product, it will go a long way!!</li>
            <li>face is looking much softer and smoother, so much so that my girlfriend wants me to buy her this products that i&#x27;m using</li>
            <li>You dont need to use your fingers to take the product out because it has pump and you can take as much product as you need.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin very radiant and glowing.</li>
            <li>I have to really massage it in there</li>
            <li>Very soothing, moisturizing face cream.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind or even notice the smell much</li>
            <li>So I haven&#x27;t used moisturizer on my face much.  </li>
            <li>Toulon&#x27;s hyaluronic acid serum with vitamin c and aloe had helped the health of my skin so much, I decided to try the Anti-Wrinkle face cream.  </li>
            <li>It gives my face the moisture needed but absolutely without the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It leaves you a softness sensation and you really notice your skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>It covers really well, with no burning or anything.</li>
            <li>yuck.my skin feels very</li>
            <li>I paid $11.95 for my cream.but watch how much the price is increasing</li>
            <li>Very responsive.</li>
            <li>Really like using this cream.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing</li>
            <li>Thanks, Rebecca.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Margaret</li>
            <li>I got more than I expected with this product inside of a week.</li>
            <li>In about 2-3 weeks I noticed my skin had really cleared up, and I did not get the perverbial &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34; chin and cheek cysts.</li>
            <li>It has taken my wrinkles away and also has made my skin feel so much smoother.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin very radiant and glowing.</li>
            <li>Works fast and the effect lasts.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer really makes my skin softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>Recommend any type of skin for this winter season very</li>
            <li>It really helps moisturize and fight against the winter weather.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of this moisturizer</li>
            <li>My skin feels tighter and really well hydrated.</li>
            <li>I really like this face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really like the this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really like this face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer really makes my skin softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>My makeup goes on smoother, not just around my eyes but on my whole face.</li>
            <li>I did rate this as four stars, because it is a touch oily for my taste, but it isn&#x27;t so much that I would not use the product.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy a luxurious moisturizer that deeply hydrates my skin.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is not thin and watery but luscious.  </li>
            <li>Really did not see any results.</li>
            <li>I am nearing 50, so I need something that works very well.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every product under the sun, from over counter, to expensive products at department stores, to prescription creams from my dermotologist, and this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a good cream, but lets face it there is no magic in any jar!  </li>
            <li>I love how thick and rich this moisturizer is.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid is supposed to be great for your skin but only if you use it long enough to see the benefits.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic change in my skin, the scent and consistency of the product are great.</li>
            <li>I have had bad reaction to others but this is perfect and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough yet to know if it is effective.</li>
            <li>I had the pleasure of trying this product at a free event at a Local New York Clinic.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth not greasy and makes my skin feel like silk all day long.</li>
            <li>I have dark age spots covering most of my face</li>
            <li>This is going back to amazon immediately for a full refund.</li>
            <li>As with any face cream product, it takes awhile to see what the true results of use are for any given individual.  </li>
            <li>pretty high!&lt;br /&gt;It means that this intensive cream may renew skin, minimize breaking out, minimize fine lines, pores, some dark spots on the face and prevent aging process.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using products with glycolic acid for years, but this one has brought my skin to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li>I am blemish free and finally found a moisturizer that I can use to moisturize my acne prone, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It is one great product I feel and look at least 5 years younger.</li>
            <li>I feel as if I finally have the soft smooth skin I always wanted.</li>
            <li>As I am getting older here.</li>
            <li>After trying a lot of different aha moisturizers, I finally found one I love.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it if you are looking for anti aging moisturize.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re prone to break outs, I highly suggest using this product.</li>
            <li>Again I have to rate this high</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so I know that it is exfoliating my skin and allowing the list of high quality ingredients to absorb into the layers of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this line&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for an all natural cream to help with wrinkles (I&#x27;ve got that big crease between my eyebrows and my &amp;#34;laugh line&amp;#34; are nothing to laugh at!)  </li>
            <li>have searched  and gone through a number of moisturizers in my time, and this is by far one of my favorites!!</li>
            <li>My daughter has oily skin and it really helped to clear her skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li>I am 41 years old and thanks to these products</li>
            <li>and so far it has not broken me out.  </li>
            <li>it has a nice thick consistency but its not greasy</li>
            <li>Rich and creamy, yet light and subtle.</li>
            <li>Way better creams for far less money</li>
            <li>Smooth skin,absorbs easily, and non irritating</li>
            <li>In fact, the two products provide such a smooth base for my cosmetics that I have been able to eliminate a popular brand primer from my skin care regiment.  </li>
            <li>Uscented, which is important to me because I have asthma and other allergies.</li>
            <li>I got the email about the new packaging and a coupon.</li>
            <li>Often times new products will break me out and this did not.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for Toulon to release their healing body lotion on Amazon in the new jar.  </li>
            <li>Only a dollop the size of three pin-heads came out each time, and because of this, I wasn&#x27;t able to fully apply it even once with the minimal amount of substance I had on my hands.</li>
            <li>Not only is the cream light yet moisturizing as it goes on and not only do I use it at nighttime</li>
            <li>I was very surprised how well it worked on my blemishes.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive aging skin that is still acne prone, and I also have some scarring.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and just a small bit goes all the way!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and just a small bit goes all the way!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>but you only need a dab to cover your whole face and neck!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells OK but has a hydroxy acid and those usually have a distinctive smell.  </li>
            <li>and I do see SOME fine lines less, but not like I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Feels so soft!</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Extra bonus, it is not greasy or shiny, so it wears really well under makeup!</li>
            <li>It has made my acne nearly disappear!</li>
            <li>Moisturizer!!I have been using it every night for 2 weeks and my skin is really soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>I have been using it every night for 2 weeks and my skin is really soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always cautious about trying new products because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>As a guy, I haven&#x27;t used many moisturizers but when I&#x27;ve tried others it usually makes my face feel far too greasy.</li>
            <li>A lot of small cream containers seem to empty so quickly, so it&#x27;s great that this product has a silky glide that seems to cover your entire face in no time.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone that needs a lightweight moisturizer and wants to look younger fast!</li>
            <li>since I have reached &#x27;over the hill&#x27; age I been really searching for new products with that specific benefit.</li>
            <li>My crows feet around my eyes are less visible and the moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The face cream lasted less than a month and that was using it only at night most of the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for little over a week now can tell a big difference in the softness of my skin on my face and seems to be more radiant...</li>
            <li>I like this cream, but it forms little balls of white on my face when used on top of serums.  </li>
            <li>but this product is helping my skin clear WHILE keeping wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li>This product not only moisturized my skin, but REALLY helped clear my acne.</li>
            <li>It claims to clear acne along with help with wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I am seeing a clear and even tone skin.</li>
            <li>makes my skin so supple and soft</li>
            <li>And it hasn’t affected my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Have been using for several weeks now and really like the results.</li>
            <li>My skin went from dead crocodile to smooth and supple in seconds.</li>
            <li>While the moisturizer feels soft, it&#x27;s too early to tell if I will notice any difference.</li>
            <li>Completely upset.</li>
            <li>They fixed the pump problem and put it in a jar.</li>
            <li>this cream keeps my skin completely</li>
            <li>but I really think that my skin looks smoother and younger.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive and whatever moisturizer I have used has led to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about breakouts and had no experience with glycolic acid (remember I have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s always been a battle between having clear skin or soft skin.</li>
            <li>so I will have to extract it the old fashioned way using gravity.  </li>
            <li>there are companies out there who still out out quality products and actually have real customer service.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I use it daily under my foundation and it keeps my skin moist without being greasy...and that is really saying something when you have combination skin.</li>
            <li>For all of my adult life, I&#x27;ve had oily skin on my face.</li>
            <li>I was always self conscious about my face getting greasy.</li>
            <li>For reference, I am 33 and have sensitive, combination, and acne prone</li>
            <li>(adult cyctic) skin.</li>
            <li>and I prefer Toulon over everything I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I actually paid real money for this product and it does nothing, nada..not a damn thing.</li>
            <li>My husband even noticed a change in my face as far as it clearing up and me looking for &amp;#34;energized,&amp;#34; as he said.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel  completely revitalized</li>
            <li>That is better at least.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no reactions to this cream.</li>
            <li>This face cream has made such a difference to the appearance of my face and really all over.  </li>
            <li>It is lush and healing.  </li>
            <li>My skin is brighter and old acne scars are lessening.  </li>
            <li>After considerable research decided to try the effects of Glycolic and Alpha Hydroxy acid, it is without retinol.</li>
            <li>I have mature, combination skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin is now soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have a dewy smooth look after applying my foundation instead of a dry patchwork with makeup stuck to the dry spots.</li>
            <li>This face cream is really rich but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when you put it on.</li>
            <li>However, since I have been using it for only 1 month, it is really hard to give it a very accurate review.  </li>
            <li>I have found a very small amount of this cream goes a LONG way, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I am a new Mom and just dont have enough time to be digging out product.</li>
            <li>My new routine is tea tree oil cleansing pads from Trader Joe&#x27;s followed by this and maybe some benzoyl peroxide if I&#x27;m starting to break out.</li>
            <li>Finally I have clear AND soft skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day and not only does it clear out my wrinkles for the day, my oily skin problem is nearly gone.</li>
            <li>But, after consistent use, I have seen a major difference and not a single dry patch!</li>
            <li>It glides on easily, no burning sensation like I have experienced with other glycolic and alpha hydroxy acid products and within just a few days have noticed a difference in my skin texture and glow.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s something no other product has done for me.</li>
            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve been getting fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve been noticing the skin around my eyes isn&#x27;t as smooth as it used to be.</li>
            <li>My skin already feels tighter and my pores are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>This seems particularly noticeable when I&#x27;m using a loose powder.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have to be very careful with what I use on my face, and this cream manages to be both highly nourishing and soothing without leaving me feeling greasy</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have always had a hard time finding the right moisturizer that won&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very concerned with what goes on the skin in terms of chemicals - and this product doesn&#x27;t have any of those &amp;#34;scary&amp;#34; ingredients that other products have.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the skin, but I find it leaves my skin a little greasy</li>
            <li>It does not dry out so fast like other products.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry environment and have started to use this twice a day:  </li>
            <li>It does improve the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; of my skin but can&#x27;t say much about the long term benefits as I haven&#x27;t used it that long.</li>
            <li>I guess the glycolic acid gets rid of the dead and dried out skin cells, then moisturizes the healthy skin.</li>
            <li>This product does not dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>When I use this during the day and I get hot, it can feel a little tacky.</li>
            <li>Test out small amount first!</li>
            <li>I had some dry patches near my nose from winter dryness and this cleared them up in days!</li>
            <li>I have been using this moisturizer nightly for a few weeks now, and it seems to be working really well!</li>
            <li>Mine is dry and this product left it feeling very soft without feeling sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ve noticed is that the scrubs I use to clear up my blemishes tends to dry my skin out, a lot.</li>
            <li>My skin gets really dry and extremely sensitive on winter.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone with dry skin looking for a product to keep your face soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels fuller, and certain lines around my mouth and eyes are definitely getting less noticeable.</li>
            <li>In the past few months, I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions and this is definitely the one I&#x27;ll stick with.</li>
            <li>I can tell too that this jar will last a long time because you don&#x27;t need to use much of it at a time like you do with other stuff.</li>
            <li>I have very dry sensitive skin, and this moisturizer not only had my face feeling hydrated</li>
            <li>I never ever write reviews (good or bad)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this cream and can already see changes in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  </li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this at a promotional price</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> It needs to be used alone, tho, and I use more than one thing on my face during my skin regimen.  </li>

            <li> I think my face is nice and fresh in the morning after using this.</li>
            <li> Ok I am so excited.</li>
            <li> I love how rich and creamy it feels going on my skin.</li>
            <li> Jar makes for easy, even application of just the amount you want.</li>
            <li> (I break out easily if products have fragrance</li>
            <li> The jar makes it so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It works great for fine lines underneath my eye and also keeps my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Also, I see that my pores are getting smaller and my skin looks beautiful</li>
            <li> It softens my fine.</li>
            <li> While many brands add an SPF at a nominal level in their moisturizer, many dermatologists recommend use of one with a broader spectrum and higher SPF number to clients with a disposition to or experience with skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, is a fine night cream.</li>
            <li> Using this cream also took away my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Skin is softer, but haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer goes on smoothly and very quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 50 and wanted to minimize my fine lines.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a very mild smell and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> but the cream is very mild and seems to be multi functional like exfoliating and treating...not just a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is helping with fine lines and is brightening up my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am beginning to see a difference with fine lines.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50s and have even begun to see a difference for the fine lines around my eyes and lips.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m noticing a reduction in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> My fine lines are reduced, and my skin stays supple and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal fan for life!</li>
            <li> I started using this twice a day - once in the morning, once at night - and my most stubborn spots are fading quick after just one week.</li>
            <li> Need a bit of time to combat the fine lines, but so far so good.</li>

            <li> This is the second product from this company that I have used and I continue to be impressed with the high quality of these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying new cremes; I have more in my vanity cabinet than I care to count!  </li>
            <li> this product is a wonderful new addition to my daily skin care routine!</li>
            <li> It is so rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> and I was so excited.  </li>
            <li> I am not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> and I am so happy when I find a face cream that moisturizes my skin all day long.  </li>
            <li> Excited to see the results with continued use.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with heavier creams making my face break out in the past, and this seems to be the perfect amount of moisture.</li>
            <li> Would get a higher star rating if it smelled better</li>

            <li> It is rich and creamy and has so many great skin care ingredients, licorice, vit c and e, green tea, rosehip oil, and glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> I love the new packaging and although I didn&#x27;t mind the pump bottle, I was excited to see it in a jar now!  </li>
            <li> The aha face lotion feels great on my skin and has already worked to keep my dry skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I love face creams and try a different kind every time I run out.  </li>
            <li> My makeup looks more natural and doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and so far I have not been impressed.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to apply and absorbed rapidly..</li>
            <li> the cream is not at all special.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and it feels fresh all day.</li>
            <li> loving this lotion so far.</li>
            <li> I think with any product with these ingredients, it takes a while to see the full benefits.</li>
            <li> I ordered the full line of products (the vitamin C serum, the eye cream, and the face cream).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not yet received this, but I anticipate that it will be both thoughtful and useful.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a bit thick, but it is perfect for my skin!</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer is a must in my daily makeup routine: it needs to be moisturizing but not too greasy, and this one does just that</li>
            <li> Not using it as a true wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok... can&#x27;t really say I see a difference.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD!GREAT PRODUCT WILL DEFINATELY BUY AGAIN!THANKS:-)</li>
            <li> Not a bad combo of ingredients, but spoiled ingredients like rotten food.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and not greasy - just the right amount of moisturizer I need.</li>
            <li> The eye cream was filled the right amount, I think.  </li>
            <li> Really though, not only can I see a difference in my fine lines but my skin is clearing up!!!</li>
            <li> Love this new moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This product left my skin feeling moisturized, have a nice light feel, not oily or slimy.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery but</li>
            <li> The pump broke rather quickly though.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I&#x27;m aging gracefully like my mother ...</li>
            <li> She loves the price and the quick shipping.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and I use it morning and night.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a super healer.</li>
            <li> but the smell goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> This rich moisturizer is non-greasy and lightweight, yet effective in terms of hydration and overall enhancement of one&#x27;s skin elasticity and appearance.  </li>
            <li> It is a gift for my fair red haired daughter, I chose it because it was safe for sensitive skin, I have not heard from her</li>
            <li> I tend to favorite lightweight because I have normal to combination skin.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this cream and find it offers just what I have been looking for--excellent texture, good moisturizing, without the stickiness or oily feel of so many products.  </li>
            <li> I exchanged the product right away, and the replacement was 80% full.  </li>
            <li> and I can really see the difference in the fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li> While the deep wrinkles are still there they are not as so much better and the fine lines are not seen.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any miracle in the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, I was not expecting any either.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell if this item is good.i never had pores on my face  before,that wasn&#x27;t my issue.this product gave me huge pores</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for making such a great product.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this product - it&#x27;s clear from the label that most are naturally derived, and beneficial for the skin.</li>
            <li> Well worth trying.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft, refreshed and so silky smooth!</li>
            <li> but so far I love it...</li>
            <li> So, I thought the 10 glycolic acid face cream was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels more hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li> Also thrilled that this company actually cares about their customers.</li>
            <li> I had tried serums with success since they are not oil based.  </li>
            <li> what I have noticed is that my skin looks and feels freshly exfoliated each and every day since using this line of products.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the cream and it makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a week and am pleased so far.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is natural and 100% vegan.</li>
            <li> So far, I am satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product during a promotional period, and I have been pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I am loving my results after a short period of time.</li>
            <li> The container is nice because you can use the entire product without wasting any.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin look young and healthy.</li>
            <li> At first it will stay on the surface of the skin, but quickly gets absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Also the vitamin c serum is superior to any other serums I have tried.</li>
            <li> As with the other product, the packaging is just so gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> This cream just feels so rich and creamy, and the skin on my face is so much softer, even radiant.</li>
            <li> i am enjoying this product very much specially working outside in this weather</li>
            <li> you know how it is you try and try to find the right products for your face</li>
            <li> no squirting everywhere when pumping out product, and it puts out just the right amount of product for you.</li>
            <li> the price is right an</li>
            <li> but this is the right level of moisture for it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no scent at all, which I love, the scented moisturizers usually make me feel nauseous so this is a nice change.&lt;br /&gt;The jar it comes in</li>
            <li> I love that it has such a range of super ingredients...</li>
            <li> I really like the sleek and cool packaging and jar.</li>
            <li> , I am so worried about some of my face, I need something really powerful and this appears to be the one, time will tell, and the delivery was very fast, thanks!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well with my busy life style.  </li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive skin, I&#x27;m very aware of scented products and there is no artificial scent to worry about here!</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because it is a good moisturizer and has not ended up in the black hole of potions I have.  </li>
            <li> so I was surprised when it ran out very quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and easy - highly recommend.</li>
            <li> At long last, I have found a moisturizer that is perfect for my maturing, sensitive, combination skin for use both at night and during the day.  </li>
            <li> And better than that, I love how rejuvenated my skin feels after using it only a little more than a month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a luxury moisturizer at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as many other products do, and leaves it feeling silky and smooth but not greasy</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft, and it diminishes the appearance of my fine lines.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I tried their other products.  </li>
            <li> It has a little scent to it which I cannot explain but nothing overpowering and the consistency feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> As a new Mommy I was so excited.</li>
            <li> my face is sensitive so that is important to me.</li>
            <li> so I applied this on his face, at first he did not want it, but after the first time he has been using it as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to more products in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this product and so does my younger girlfriend!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m dissatisfied with this moisturizer exactly</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizing cream every morning for the past week and experienced very favorable results.  </li>
            <li> At first I used a lot</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have very different skin types and both were able to use it.</li>
            <li> This aha face moisturier was the the first Toulon product I had tried.  </li>
            <li> When I wrote my first review I got an email from the company then a phone call apologizing for the problem.</li>
            <li> My skin is baby smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Love the texture, and I can actually feel the glycolic acid working!  </li>
            <li> says that if it works so well for a guy then it should work even better for a female..</li>
            <li> Light, not heavy.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed when I got the package is it is not NSF certified or USDA Organic Certified ingredients.</li>
            <li> I first bought the Vitamin C serum and had been using that for a while before I ordered this face cream.</li>
            <li> Starting to notice some smoothing and better tone.</li>
            <li> This product really amazes me!</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more Anti-Wrinkle face moisturizer as soon as it is back in stock.</li>
            <li> Hydrates really well as well!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> but my skin is clear, smooth and is no longer blotchy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> So two thumbs up, and thanks!</li>
            <li> I use twice daily since I am layering it on top of blemish products (salicylic, benzoyl)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, has little to no scent and works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It feels soft and rich and creamy on my skin.</li>
            <li> As someone in my early 40s and in the hot Texas sun often, I jumped at the chance to get this product with a special promotion.  </li>
            <li> Good for younger people who are starting anti-aging prevention measures.</li>
            <li> This is pleasant smelling, and  long lasting.</li>
            <li> I think all the people who put positive reviews, were paid to do so.</li>
            <li> at first i guess i was applying too much of the moisturizing cream</li>
            <li> I hope it works long term. :)</li>
            <li> think the Glycolic acid cream is a very good product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used those Clean and Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets and face powder which of course clogged my pores</li>
            <li> The first time, it worked fine, but the pump wouldn&#x27;t squirt anything out the second time around.</li>
            <li> It is amazing that I can use it twice a day without any issues of burning or irritating like I have experienced with other Glycolic acid treatments.</li>
            <li> It is amazing that I can use it twice a day with out any issues of burning or irritating like I have experienced with other glycolic acid treatments.</li>
            <li> I have shelves full of creams that I have tried and not liked, but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> the packing is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this product, and I absolutely love it, after only about a week of using it!</li>
            <li> The cream is full of ingredients that are great for my skin glycolic acid and other alpha hydroxy acids, licorice root, vitamin c and green tea.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to see the quantity of the product, it will go a long way!!</li>
            <li> face is looking much softer and smoother, so much so that my girlfriend wants me to buy her this products that i&#x27;m using</li>
            <li> You dont need to use your fingers to take the product out because it has pump and you can take as much product as you need.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin very radiant and glowing.</li>
            <li> I have to really massage it in there</li>
            <li> Very soothing, moisturizing face cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind or even notice the smell much</li>
            <li> So I haven&#x27;t used moisturizer on my face much.  </li>
            <li> Toulon&#x27;s hyaluronic acid serum with vitamin c and aloe had helped the health of my skin so much, I decided to try the Anti-Wrinkle face cream.  </li>
            <li> It gives my face the moisture needed but absolutely without the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It leaves you a softness sensation and you really notice your skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> It covers really well, with no burning or anything.</li>
            <li> yuck.my skin feels very</li>
            <li> I paid $11.95 for my cream.but watch how much the price is increasing</li>
            <li> Very responsive.</li>
            <li> Really like using this cream.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Thanks, Rebecca.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Margaret</li>
            <li> I got more than I expected with this product inside of a week.</li>
            <li> In about 2-3 weeks I noticed my skin had really cleared up, and I did not get the perverbial &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34; chin and cheek cysts.</li>
            <li> It has taken my wrinkles away and also has made my skin feel so much smoother.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin very radiant and glowing.</li>
            <li> Works fast and the effect lasts.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer really makes my skin softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Recommend any type of skin for this winter season very</li>
            <li> It really helps moisturize and fight against the winter weather.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this moisturizer</li>
            <li> My skin feels tighter and really well hydrated.</li>
            <li> I really like this face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like the this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like this face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer really makes my skin softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> My makeup goes on smoother, not just around my eyes but on my whole face.</li>
            <li> I did rate this as four stars, because it is a touch oily for my taste, but it isn&#x27;t so much that I would not use the product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy a luxurious moisturizer that deeply hydrates my skin.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is not thin and watery but luscious.  </li>
            <li> Really did not see any results.</li>
            <li> I am nearing 50, so I need something that works very well.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every product under the sun, from over counter, to expensive products at department stores, to prescription creams from my dermotologist, and this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good cream, but lets face it there is no magic in any jar!  </li>
            <li> I love how thick and rich this moisturizer is.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid is supposed to be great for your skin but only if you use it long enough to see the benefits.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic change in my skin, the scent and consistency of the product are great.</li>
            <li> I have had bad reaction to others but this is perfect and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough yet to know if it is effective.</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure of trying this product at a free event at a Local New York Clinic.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth not greasy and makes my skin feel like silk all day long.</li>
            <li> I have dark age spots covering most of my face</li>
            <li> This is going back to amazon immediately for a full refund.</li>
            <li> As with any face cream product, it takes awhile to see what the true results of use are for any given individual.  </li>
            <li> pretty high!&lt;br /&gt;It means that this intensive cream may renew skin, minimize breaking out, minimize fine lines, pores, some dark spots on the face and prevent aging process.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using products with glycolic acid for years, but this one has brought my skin to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li> I am blemish free and finally found a moisturizer that I can use to moisturize my acne prone, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It is one great product I feel and look at least 5 years younger.</li>
            <li> I feel as if I finally have the soft smooth skin I always wanted.</li>
            <li> As I am getting older here.</li>
            <li> After trying a lot of different aha moisturizers, I finally found one I love.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it if you are looking for anti aging moisturize.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re prone to break outs, I highly suggest using this product.</li>
            <li> Again I have to rate this high</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so I know that it is exfoliating my skin and allowing the list of high quality ingredients to absorb into the layers of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this line&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an all natural cream to help with wrinkles (I&#x27;ve got that big crease between my eyebrows and my &amp;#34;laugh line&amp;#34; are nothing to laugh at!)  </li>
            <li> have searched  and gone through a number of moisturizers in my time, and this is by far one of my favorites!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has oily skin and it really helped to clear her skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li> I am 41 years old and thanks to these products</li>
            <li> and so far it has not broken me out.  </li>
            <li> it has a nice thick consistency but its not greasy</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy, yet light and subtle.</li>
            <li> Way better creams for far less money</li>
            <li> Smooth skin,absorbs easily, and non irritating</li>
            <li> In fact, the two products provide such a smooth base for my cosmetics that I have been able to eliminate a popular brand primer from my skin care regiment.  </li>
            <li> Uscented, which is important to me because I have asthma and other allergies.</li>
            <li> I got the email about the new packaging and a coupon.</li>
            <li> Often times new products will break me out and this did not.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for Toulon to release their healing body lotion on Amazon in the new jar.  </li>
            <li> Only a dollop the size of three pin-heads came out each time, and because of this, I wasn&#x27;t able to fully apply it even once with the minimal amount of substance I had on my hands.</li>
            <li> Not only is the cream light yet moisturizing as it goes on and not only do I use it at nighttime</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how well it worked on my blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive aging skin that is still acne prone, and I also have some scarring.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and just a small bit goes all the way!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and just a small bit goes all the way!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> but you only need a dab to cover your whole face and neck!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells OK but has a hydroxy acid and those usually have a distinctive smell.  </li>
            <li> and I do see SOME fine lines less, but not like I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Feels so soft!</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Extra bonus, it is not greasy or shiny, so it wears really well under makeup!</li>
            <li> It has made my acne nearly disappear!</li>
            <li> Moisturizer!!I have been using it every night for 2 weeks and my skin is really soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I have been using it every night for 2 weeks and my skin is really soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always cautious about trying new products because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> As a guy, I haven&#x27;t used many moisturizers but when I&#x27;ve tried others it usually makes my face feel far too greasy.</li>
            <li> A lot of small cream containers seem to empty so quickly, so it&#x27;s great that this product has a silky glide that seems to cover your entire face in no time.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone that needs a lightweight moisturizer and wants to look younger fast!</li>
            <li> since I have reached &#x27;over the hill&#x27; age I been really searching for new products with that specific benefit.</li>
            <li> My crows feet around my eyes are less visible and the moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The face cream lasted less than a month and that was using it only at night most of the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for little over a week now can tell a big difference in the softness of my skin on my face and seems to be more radiant...</li>
            <li> I like this cream, but it forms little balls of white on my face when used on top of serums.  </li>
            <li> but this product is helping my skin clear WHILE keeping wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> This product not only moisturized my skin, but REALLY helped clear my acne.</li>
            <li> It claims to clear acne along with help with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I am seeing a clear and even tone skin.</li>
            <li> makes my skin so supple and soft</li>
            <li> And it hasn’t affected my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using for several weeks now and really like the results.</li>
            <li> My skin went from dead crocodile to smooth and supple in seconds.</li>
            <li> While the moisturizer feels soft, it&#x27;s too early to tell if I will notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Completely upset.</li>
            <li> They fixed the pump problem and put it in a jar.</li>
            <li> this cream keeps my skin completely</li>
            <li> but I really think that my skin looks smoother and younger.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive and whatever moisturizer I have used has led to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about breakouts and had no experience with glycolic acid (remember I have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s always been a battle between having clear skin or soft skin.</li>
            <li> so I will have to extract it the old fashioned way using gravity.  </li>
            <li> there are companies out there who still out out quality products and actually have real customer service.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I use it daily under my foundation and it keeps my skin moist without being greasy...and that is really saying something when you have combination skin.</li>
            <li> For all of my adult life, I&#x27;ve had oily skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I was always self conscious about my face getting greasy.</li>
            <li> For reference, I am 33 and have sensitive, combination, and acne prone</li>
            <li> (adult cyctic) skin.</li>
            <li> and I prefer Toulon over everything I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I actually paid real money for this product and it does nothing, nada..not a damn thing.</li>
            <li> My husband even noticed a change in my face as far as it clearing up and me looking for &amp;#34;energized,&amp;#34; as he said.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel  completely revitalized</li>
            <li> That is better at least.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no reactions to this cream.</li>
            <li> This face cream has made such a difference to the appearance of my face and really all over.  </li>
            <li> It is lush and healing.  </li>
            <li> My skin is brighter and old acne scars are lessening.  </li>
            <li> After considerable research decided to try the effects of Glycolic and Alpha Hydroxy acid, it is without retinol.</li>
            <li> I have mature, combination skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin is now soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have a dewy smooth look after applying my foundation instead of a dry patchwork with makeup stuck to the dry spots.</li>
            <li> This face cream is really rich but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when you put it on.</li>
            <li> However, since I have been using it for only 1 month, it is really hard to give it a very accurate review.  </li>
            <li> I have found a very small amount of this cream goes a LONG way, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I am a new Mom and just dont have enough time to be digging out product.</li>
            <li> My new routine is tea tree oil cleansing pads from Trader Joe&#x27;s followed by this and maybe some benzoyl peroxide if I&#x27;m starting to break out.</li>
            <li> Finally I have clear AND soft skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day and not only does it clear out my wrinkles for the day, my oily skin problem is nearly gone.</li>
            <li> But, after consistent use, I have seen a major difference and not a single dry patch!</li>
            <li> It glides on easily, no burning sensation like I have experienced with other glycolic and alpha hydroxy acid products and within just a few days have noticed a difference in my skin texture and glow.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s something no other product has done for me.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been getting fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been noticing the skin around my eyes isn&#x27;t as smooth as it used to be.</li>
            <li> My skin already feels tighter and my pores are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> This seems particularly noticeable when I&#x27;m using a loose powder.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have to be very careful with what I use on my face, and this cream manages to be both highly nourishing and soothing without leaving me feeling greasy</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have always had a hard time finding the right moisturizer that won&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very concerned with what goes on the skin in terms of chemicals - and this product doesn&#x27;t have any of those &amp;#34;scary&amp;#34; ingredients that other products have.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the skin, but I find it leaves my skin a little greasy</li>
            <li> It does not dry out so fast like other products.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry environment and have started to use this twice a day:  </li>
            <li> It does improve the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; of my skin but can&#x27;t say much about the long term benefits as I haven&#x27;t used it that long.</li>
            <li> I guess the glycolic acid gets rid of the dead and dried out skin cells, then moisturizes the healthy skin.</li>
            <li> This product does not dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> When I use this during the day and I get hot, it can feel a little tacky.</li>
            <li> Test out small amount first!</li>
            <li> I had some dry patches near my nose from winter dryness and this cleared them up in days!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer nightly for a few weeks now, and it seems to be working really well!</li>
            <li> Mine is dry and this product left it feeling very soft without feeling sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve noticed is that the scrubs I use to clear up my blemishes tends to dry my skin out, a lot.</li>
            <li> My skin gets really dry and extremely sensitive on winter.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with dry skin looking for a product to keep your face soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels fuller, and certain lines around my mouth and eyes are definitely getting less noticeable.</li>
            <li> In the past few months, I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions and this is definitely the one I&#x27;ll stick with.</li>
            <li> I can tell too that this jar will last a long time because you don&#x27;t need to use much of it at a time like you do with other stuff.</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin, and this moisturizer not only had my face feeling hydrated</li>
            <li> I never ever write reviews (good or bad)</li>
            <li> It is so thick, so you can tell right away</li>
            <li> It is a cream of thick consistency but absorbs right away leaving my skin hydrated and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This also does not burn like other glycolic acid products I have used - and it goes on &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; but not heavy, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this stuff really helps.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture of this product and you only need to use a small amount to cover your face.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 because it doesn&#x27;t last long enough as there isn&#x27;t a lot in the jar.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone skin (at 30, which is lame) and the Toulon has not only helped my skin clear up, but it looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I have used these products for a while now and so far I have not been let down.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my freckles are a little lighter and the fine wrinkles around my eyes are a little less visible.</li>
            <li> and I was actually starting to get dry spots.  </li>
            <li> that dry out my skin and need the extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I have not been using it long enough to know long term effects</li>
            <li> It also contains Vitamins C&amp;E, Rosehip oil, green tea, alpha hydroxyl, grapeseed oil and CoQ10, all vital nutrients for your face.</li>
            <li> and this product seems keep me hydrated all night long.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results of these products.  </li>
            <li> Alpha Hydroxy acid provide an exfoliating action and thus gets rids of dead skin and give skin a glow.</li>
            <li> Incredibly small amount, bottle looks normal size but lasted me less than a week only putting on my facial area.  </li>
            <li> With regular use I am experiencing dramatic improvements to my face with ridding my skin of break outs and giving my face an overall glow that this winter I started using it on my elbows, hands, feet around my nails, and really any place where I need some TLC to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Other creams have left my skin blotchy by the end of the day, but this product does not.  </li>
            <li> My face feels softer and I will definitely continue to use this product along with my other skin care items.</li>
            <li> It feels very different from my other brands because my face feels like there is a protective shield of moisture.</li>
            <li> Then the dry scaly skin traps oil and dirt in my pores and makes me break out again.</li>
            <li> It has helped with the dry areas and wrinkles on my face.  </li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as it used to.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Exfoliating is removing the dry skin cells.</li>
            <li> Then the foundation makes the skin dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> and I get dry patches in the winter.</li>
            <li> Bought this for red spots because alpha hydroxyl acid is supposed to work for acne that is not quite active but still leaves marks.</li>
            <li> It is non irritating  and very gentle to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I get deep, dark circles under my eyes, and this combination is helping to minimize that problem area for me.</li>
            <li> This cream will go a long way!!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll be switching back to my previous one once this ones</li>
            <li> I am a big skin care user for the means of prior excessive sun exposure and fear of premature aging</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried tend to be one extreme or the other - either too thin and not effective, or too cloying</li>
            <li> The pores around my nose appear a little smaller.</li>
            <li> I only have this product for a few days</li>
            <li> I expected there to be some stinging feeling because of the salicylic acid</li>
            <li> : it sinks in to skin</li>
            <li> I never really saw the point of it.</li>
            <li> I got it a few weeks ago and use it daily.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Oh and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is a game changer and highly recommended to anyone looking for smoother skin</li>
            <li> The pump- this is mentioned in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I am extremely upset.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I will be buying this again due to my problem.</li>
            <li> The creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past are always either too greasy or not creamy enough</li>
            <li> Truly what the other reviews say...</li>
            <li> Unlike some other glycolic creams I&#x27;ve used before, this one did not burn or sting at all, but</li>
            <li> use a small amount mixed with my foundation in the morning , then the 20% glycolic acid pads and this cream at night.</li>
            <li> like I usual get when using a facial  moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> A very small amount goes a long way, so I feel like it is going to last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I would have to re-apply my other moisturizers during the day.</li>
            <li> I also have had NO problems with clogged pores as I have had with other heavier moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I am always wary of big promises when it comes from beauty and skin care products, but so far this moisturizer has worked well.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredient of this product is Glycolic Acid</li>
            <li> I have uneven blotchy skin, rosacea and dry flaky skin</li>
            <li> I have tried others but they are too harsh and dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint with this</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are smoother, dark spots are lighter and my pores aren&#x27;t clogged like they used to be.</li>
            <li> but I just stuck a q tip in there and stored upside down.</li>
            <li> I have other creams, but this is the one I prefer to use!</li>
            <li> 1st of all when I saw the ingredients and other specification &amp;#34; Rosehip Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Antioxidants like Coenzyme Q10, Green Tea, &amp; Vitamin E + C, Lactic Acid, AHA, Alpha Lipoic Acid.</li>
            <li> A very small amount (not enough to cover your face) comes out with one pump, so I used 2 pumps every night.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount to get its beneficial effects.</li>
            <li> It is a multipurpose cream with Alpha Hydroxy Acid, Vitamin C and green tea among other things.</li>
            <li> need only a very small amount, arrived less than a week after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for less then a week</li>
            <li> The results for my face were less dramatic but clearly visible.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight smell but this does go away after applying to the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Softening, yet I can feel the slight tightening after use.</li>
            <li> and this has helped it less visible.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve switched to another product that is less oily.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical to try skincare products because of my weird skin, but I was lucky enough to snag this at a promotional rate!</li>
            <li> It works as well as the uber expensive creams, but doesn&#x27;t have the high price tag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong but doesn&#x27;t have any other fragrance.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I have tried others but they are too harsh and dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using this moisturizer twice daily I noticed softer and smoother skin without any burning, irritating, or other reactions.</li>
            <li> no more dry flaky, blotchy skin!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t always work quite well and it clumps a little upon each use.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about alpha hydroxy acids in my face cream...</li>
            <li> A little greasy.  </li>
            <li> A little goes along way.  </li>
            <li> The fine lines at the base of my eye are visibly softened.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this product, and it ships right to your door!</li>
            <li> My skin is hydrated and nourished but also gets the dead skin cells off</li>
            <li> Just try it for a few days.</li>
            <li> and it is wonderful........not greasy or heavy at all</li>
            <li> I had a few sun spots that aren&#x27;t noticeable</li>
            <li> the cream helped my dried out skin get hydrated and cleared up the blemishes I had.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks before writing a review.</li>
            <li> It is greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this cream for a few weeks before I gave my review.</li>
            <li> My wife has bought this cream a few times now.</li>
            <li> Application lasts for a few days.</li>
            <li> It seems to hydrate my skin well, without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months</li>
            <li> After just a few days of using it I could feel the difference and see the difference.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy but still moisturizes my skin.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C and green tea act as antioxidant and protects the skin.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the smell</li>
            <li> It smelled bad and I didn&#x27;t notice any moisturizing effect right away that you expect from a face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it ran out so quickly</li>
            <li> Especially during these cold winter months when my skin gets so dry !</li>
            <li> so it is difficult to tell all the potential benefits that it may have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second night applying the product and unfortunately the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I like this product not sure if it works</li>
            <li> I usually use this at night</li>
            <li> And an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable...</li>
            <li> I use it everyday as part of my routine!</li>
            <li> usually don’t bother with writing product reviews.</li>
            <li> Just a little frustrating.</li>
            <li> With how cold it has been here, I thought maybe it wasn&#x27;t enough to keep my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The thickness- even though it hasn&#x27;t broken me out, it feels veryyyy heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> so if you don&#x27;t like thick face cream you may not like it or just may want to use it at night.  </li>
            <li> It is not too thick and is not sticky or greasy.  </li>
            <li> The cream has a thick luxurious feel and glides on leaving my face feel well moisturized.</li>
            <li> I can also tell already that the lines on my face are less pronounced----yes!!!</li>
            <li> I am afraid it will loose its potency.</li>
            <li> I hate that I am 30 years old with acne...</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is very thick and comes out of the pump very thick.</li>
            <li> It is very thick</li>
            <li> After months of use, I noticed clearer skin with decreased hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> It is also not great under makeup.</li>
            <li> I opened my container confused because I knew I shouldn&#x27;t be out of this product already...</li>
            <li> Made my acne worse</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet noticed a softening of lines and wrinkles yet but the appearance of my pores has dramatically decreased.</li>
            <li> It is to thick and to difficult to apply evenly on skin.</li>
            <li> I was afraid a cream, would be too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed the jar is about 40% empty.  </li>
            <li> I lasted about 10 minutes before I had to wash my face again because the small was so atrocious.</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have any irritating fragrances!</li>
            <li> I put it on with the  eye cream (which I had tested on the back of my hand and which was terrible too).</li>
            <li> that is not that greasy because I hate heavy greasy creams for my face besides</li>
            <li> I almost feel guilty about it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Disappointment..</li>
            <li> DIDNT DO WHAT IT SAID  COLD CREAM WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAMETHING .</li>
            <li> It kinda stinks</li>
            <li> U can&#x27;t go wrong with this product and price!</li>
            <li> but when a powder doesn&#x27;t blend it looks bad.  </li>
            <li> This cream made my skin break out really bad.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base for underneath my make up</li>
            <li> dispenser very difficult!</li>
            <li> but I had a very bad reaction.  </li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t horrible and does not stop me from using the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Keeps away my horrible acne as well.</li>
            <li> The lotion has a bit of a smell, but it&#x27;s not too bad!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Oh my goodness!! All I can say is this Alpha Hydroxy Acid; Glycolic Acid Cream  makes my skin so supple and soft and I just love the way my face feels!! I&#x27;m just so happy ..you know how it is you try and try to find the right products for your face and it&#x27;s just a hit or miss!! I can honestly tell you that this is a huge hit!! I love love love this product!! What does it do well it moisturizes my skin so well.  Before I tried this product I was dealing with a lot of dryness and I was actually starting to get dry spots.  Speed forward one month of using these products and dryness and spots all gone.  I will be a forever customer...so thankful!! :)</li>
            <li> I was not sure at first but the more I use this product the happier I am with it.  Well worth trying.</li>
            <li> The best glycolic acid cream. In the past, I have tried others but they are too harsh and dry out my skin. I wind up needing to buy a separate moisturizer to use with the glycolic acid moisturizer. This product is both a awesome moisturizer and an exfoliating treatment in one. My skin is hydrated and nourished but also gets the dead skin cells off so the antioxidants can get into my skin. It is fragrant free and feels great on my face. It softens my fine. I have been using it with the company&#x27;s vitamin c serum and am getting great results.</li>
            <li> At long last, I have found a moisturizer that is perfect for my maturing, sensitive, combination skin for use both at night and during the day.  This rich moisturizer is non-greasy and lightweight, yet effective in terms of hydration and overall enhancement of one&#x27;s skin elasticity and appearance.  I have paired it with the Toulon Vitamin C Serum and with regular use have had great results.  In fact, the two products provide such a smooth base for my cosmetics that I have been able to eliminate a popular brand primer from my skin care regiment.  The product also permits one to use a sunscreen or sunblock with an SPF of their own choosing.  While many brands add an SPF at a nominal level in their moisturizer, many dermatologists recommend use of one with a broader spectrum and higher SPF number to clients with a disposition to or experience with skin cancer.  The combination of alpha hydroxy and glycolic acids with organics at this affordable price makes researched-based skin care within the reach of more women.  Thank you, Toulon!</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using this moisturizer twice daily I noticed softer and smoother skin without any burning, irritating, or other reactions. After months of use, I noticed clearer skin with decreased hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> Excellent, individualized customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Love the eBook!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. .I&#x27;m a guy in my 40 &#x27;s and this is working great and feels good. .doesn&#x27;t leave me face greasy either!  Improving my skin overall.</li>
            <li> I use this religiously!!! Makes my face feeel so smooth and silky! It doesn&#x27;t have an over powering smell like a lot of these products do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for little over a week now can tell a big difference in the softness of my skin on my face and seems to be more radiant... I love it ......</li>
            <li> My skin gets really dry and extremely sensitive on winter. This product left my skin feeling moisturized, have a nice light feel, not oily or slimy. I always try to take this with me to reapply because feels and works so good! I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have any irritating fragrances! I highly recommend this product makes my skin feel great. Worth it.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery but the cream is not at all special. Drug store quality.</li>
            <li> This product was on a list of “must-haves” that I came across. It has no odor, it’s not greasy and it moisturizes well throughout the night. And it hasn’t affected my sensitive skin. Thank you, glycolic acid! I will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have had some time to test this product out and it really does a great job in moisturizing my face. I have very dry sensitive skin, and this moisturizer not only had my face feeling hydrated but it also has anti aging properties too. I am a big fan of skin care products containing anti aging properties in it, since I have reached &#x27;over the hill&#x27; age I been really searching for new products with that specific benefit. I didn&#x27;t break out from this either which is another reason I liked it my face is sensitive so that is important to me. It has comes in a nice sleek packaging, the pump works great no squirting everywhere when pumping out product, and it puts out just the right amount of product for you.It has a little scent to it which I cannot explain but nothing overpowering and the consistency feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> 1st of all when I saw the ingredients and other specification &amp;#34; Rosehip Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Antioxidants like Coenzyme Q10, Green Tea, &amp; Vitamin E + C, Lactic Acid, AHA, Alpha Lipoic Acid. ★Paraben Free, Gluten Free, Cruelty Free, Fragrance Free and Made in the USA&amp;#34; I was so amazed to see. It is so rich in great ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This is 2-in-1 anti aging and moisturizer at the same time. I used it and still using it twice a day. It works great for fine lines underneath my eye and also keeps my skin smooth and soft. It is so rich and creamy. I love its effect on my face.&lt;br /&gt;would highly recommend it if you are looking for anti aging moisturize. You can apply this in the morning before makeup and then at night after removing makeup and washing face. It does work and show the difference in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also the packing is pretty decent. You dont need to use your fingers to take the product out because it has pump and you can take as much product as you need.</li>
            <li> make my skin feel very smooth, and reduce a fine line. Just try it for a few days. I will keep up with it.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a moisturizer and I am so happy I came across this one. It goes on smooth and it feels fresh all day. I really like the effects that I am seeing after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> Product is great. While the deep wrinkles are still there they are not as so much better and the fine lines are not seen. I would buy this product  again.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin very radiant and glowing. Very easy to use and just a small bit goes all the way!</li>
            <li> This anti aging face moisturizer is wonderful! I have used this for a week and noticed a difference on my skin. My skin feels firmer, softer the wrinkles are not as deep.  The moisturizer absorbs into the skin and does not leave a greasy residue. My husband is also aging around his face so I applied this on his face, at first he did not want it, but after the first time he has been using it as well. He loves the fact that it does not leave that greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I only have this product for a few days and I already like it. It works great with the vitamin C serum as well. The products from this company are high quality and feel great on my face. They make my makeup look better too! I&#x27;m looking forward to more products in the future.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any miracle in the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, I was not expecting any either. Anyway, is a fine night cream.</li>
            <li> Wow! I love this product and so does my younger girlfriend! Fantastic results!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer! It leaves my skin feeling soft, refreshed and so silky smooth! It also contains Vitamins C&amp;E, Rosehip oil, green tea, alpha hydroxyl, grapeseed oil and CoQ10, all vital nutrients for your face. It&#x27;s lightweight, has little to no scent and works great on my sensitive skin. Makes a great stocking stuffer for friends!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for less then a week but so far I love it...it is very light and smooth and virtually scentless...I use it as a base for underneath my make up and it is wonderful........not greasy or heavy at all</li>
            <li> Have been using for several weeks now and really like the results.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m dissatisfied with this moisturizer exactly but I&#x27;ll be switching back to my previous one once this ones up.&lt;br /&gt;Like: The ingredients are great and exactly what I&#x27;m looking for and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Unclear about the wrinkle performance so far.&lt;br /&gt;Dislike: The pump- this is mentioned in other reviews. Doesn&#x27;t always work quite well and it clumps a little upon each use. The thickness- even though it hasn&#x27;t broken me out, it feels veryyyy heavy on my skin. I have to really massage it in there otherwise it will sit in streaks. The feels-like-a-mask-for-too-long factor is a big draw back for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizing cream every morning for the past week and experienced very favorable results.  Using this product has made my face feel smooth and refreshed throughout each day.  This is the second product from this company that I have used and I continue to be impressed with the high quality of these products.</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure of trying this product at a free event at a Local New York Clinic. I was frankly amazed at the immediate improvement in my skin condition. I tried it on my elbows, a chronic problem area for me, and the results were immediate. My skin went from dead crocodile to smooth and supple in seconds. The results for my face were less dramatic but clearly visible. It&#x27;s a must have for your daily routine.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion -  a little goes a long way.  With how cold it has been here, I thought maybe it wasn&#x27;t enough to keep my skin moisturized.  It has been great.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Very soothing, moisturizing face cream. Jar makes for easy, even application of just the amount you want. This is a pleasant smelling non greasy product that I am using every day. I can feel the dryness and tightness of my skin going away upon application. It is non irritating  and very gentle to my face and neck. I received it as a promotion and would order again!</li>
            <li> This cream will go a long way!!  At first I used a lot and I had so much left over but you only need a dab to cover your whole face and neck!  I highly recommend this moisturizer.  I have been using it for a few weeks now, and I have not broken out and my skin looks radiant.  This cream has wonderful ingredients that moisturize my face and make it look fabulous!  I received this through a promotion and with my review, I can honestly say that this product will make you happy!  This is a wonderful moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I gave this cream 4 stars for two reasons only. When I use this during the day and I get hot, it can feel a little tacky. It is also not great under makeup. To combat that, I have started to use this just at night. Aside from that, the cream feels great on your skin. There is no odor that you can sometimes get when using anti aging products. This is pleasant smelling, and  long lasting. When I apply at night, my skin still feels hydrated and smooth in the morning. It does contain Glycolic acid, so there is a bit of a tingle when you apply. This cream is rich and goes on quite smoothly. It pairs perfectly with the Vitamin C serum which is also made by Toulon. I am very happy having made this a part of my skin care routine. I was able to order this during a promotion, which just sweetened the deal.</li>
            <li> loving this lotion so far. I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning and before I go to sleep. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as many other products do, and leaves it feeling silky and smooth but not greasy</li>
            <li> You have to expereince this to believe it.  I have some scarring on my skin.  I had read about glycolic acid as a great way to renew the skin and soften surface scarring.  Well I have had this scar for years and it is deeper than a surface scar.  But I thought that I would give this glycolic acic 10% a try.  I have been using the vit c for face from from this company and loved that one.  So, I thought the 10 glycolic acid face cream was worth a try.  I have used it day and night and it is making a difference.  My scar is actually fading.  It didn&#x27;t happen overnight and I can still see the scar but it is SO much better than it was before.  I will definitely recommend this and buy another bottle and keep using it.</li>
            <li> dispenser very difficult!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream just a short while ago so it is difficult to tell all the potential benefits that it may have. The moisturizer is very thick and comes out of the pump very thick. It does have a slight smell but this does go away after applying to the skin. It applies to the skin well and there is no greasy feel after. I let it sit and then apply my makeup. I know that I should use it at night for the best results but I don&#x27;t like to put anything on my skin at night. I have noticed that my freckles are a little lighter and the fine wrinkles around my eyes are a little less visible. The pores around my nose appear a little smaller. I think with any product with these ingredients, it takes a while to see the full benefits. Also, once you stop using it, the benefits goes away. I think that I will continue to use this product because I do like the way that my skin feels. I did purchase this during a promotion. Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid is supposed to be great for your skin but only if you use it long enough to see the benefits. Again, I like this product. I gave it a 4 because it doesn&#x27;t last long enough as there isn&#x27;t a lot in the jar. It does come with a 60 day guarantee and information about aging skin.</li>
            <li> Very happy first time user!  Seemed to see improvement in my skin in three days.  Easy to use and works well with my busy life style.  Moisturizing remains with me throughout day with only one application daily.  Eager to see effect as I use regularly over time.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift for the holidays.  The aha face lotion feels great on my skin and has already worked to keep my dry skin hydrated.  It is great to know that I am exfoliating and treating while I moisturize.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  Since using it, my skin looks healthy and bright. My daughter and I have very different skin types and both were able to use it. Mine is dry and this product left it feeling very soft without feeling sticky or greasy. My daughter has oily skin and it really helped to clear her skin without drying it out. It&#x27;s great that it works on all different types of skin. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how it continues to improve my skin, especially my fine lines and wrinkles. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again once it runs out!</li>
            <li> Incredibly small amount, bottle looks normal size but lasted me less than a week only putting on my facial area.  Way better creams for far less money</li>
            <li> This face cream is great.  It arrived very quickly and the packaging and container are very nice.  I love face creams and try a different kind every time I run out.  I think I may have to stick with this one though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this cream with a discount to try it and review it and I was so excited.  It is very thick so if you don&#x27;t like thick face cream you may not like it or just may want to use it at night.  I use it morning and night but am considering just using it at night because I want to use a face cream with sunscreen.  That is my only complaint with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells OK but has a hydroxy acid and those usually have a distinctive smell.  It&#x27;s not strong but doesn&#x27;t have any other fragrance.  I don&#x27;t mind or even notice the smell much but that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this cream for one day I had 3 people comment on my skin.  There was a noticeable difference.  My skin feels more hydrated and soft.  My makeup looks more natural and doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of my skin.  I only wear a powder but when a powder doesn&#x27;t blend it looks bad.  I&#x27;ve noticed my coloring in my skin start to even out.  I had a few sun spots that aren&#x27;t noticeable anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this and will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and so far I have not been impressed. It&#x27;s my second night applying the product and unfortunately the pump doesn&#x27;t work. While the moisturizer feels soft, it&#x27;s too early to tell if I will notice any difference. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it since the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This aha face moisturier was the the first Toulon product I had tried.  I loved it so much that I tried their other products.  The cream is full of ingredients that are great for my skin glycolic acid and other alpha hydroxy acids, licorice root, vitamin c and green tea.  Just a fabulous cream that I use each day to help my skin stay healthy and hydrated.  Will keep using it!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer.  I use it in the mornings and in the evenings. I have noticed a difference in the smoothness of my face after a couple of weeks of use.  The texture is nice as well.  It is not too thick and is not sticky or greasy.  I am not a huge fan of the smell but it isn&#x27;t horrible and does not stop me from using the moisturizer. Once I am through with the container that I was able to get during a promotional period I will purchase more.</li>
            <li> GREAT product. I&#x27;m always trying new cremes; I have more in my vanity cabinet than I care to count!  This one is smooth, light, and works well as a moisturizer for my skin type. Very pleased with the quality and I love the packaging.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a couple of weeks now and will say that I absolutely love it.  I have gotten several comments how great my skin looks.  I can personally see and feel the difference myself.  This cream is fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am always wary of big promises when it comes from beauty and skin care products, but so far this moisturizer has worked well.  My skin looks smoother after one week of once-a-day use.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> Ok I love this lotion. My skin is radiant!!! Keeps away my horrible acne as well. The customer service is amazing as well. I use their vitamin c serum too. Why the 3 stars??? I have had this product for about 2 weeks I use only at night and the pump broke. I am extremely upset. I opened my container confused because I knew I shouldn&#x27;t be out of this product already...there is a lot of product in the container. Now I have to use a q tip to get the product out of the container. Completely upset. I am a new Mom and just dont have enough time to be digging out product. Just a little frustrating. I do love this cream though. Now because I have to open it up I am afraid it will loose its potency. Uugghh just my.luck to get a faulty package.I don&#x27;t know if I will be buying this again due to my problem. I love the cream though so I am torn. The cream does keep my acne at bay my wrinkles have started to disappear but I can&#x27;t use it properly now. So upset. Ok I am so excited. They fixed the pump problem and put it in a jar. I am thrilled!!! When I wrote my first review I got an email from the company then a phone call apologizing for the problem. Abby then sent me a free vitamin c serum and another face cream. As a new Mommy I was so excited. She told me that they were fixing the problem and would contact me again. I knew the pump would break but I just stuck a q tip in there and stored upside down. I ran out two weeks ago. I got the email about the new packaging and a coupon. This company goes out of its way for superior customer service. Now the cream I love love love this cream. My skin stays clear polished glowing and beautiful. This is the best cream on the market. The unique mixture of ingredients is a win win!!! I am so happy to have my face cream back. As I am writing this I am stalking my mailman lol. I also suffer from acne this cream keeps my skin completely acne free. That&#x27;s something no other product has done for me. Yay I am ecstatic that this wonderful cream isfinding its way back to my lotion and potion cabinet. I am so picky about my skin creams. I have tried so many. THIS ONE WORKS AND DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO!! Come on mailman uugghh I want my skin cream!!  So happy that this wonderful miracle cream is back on the market. Using this cream also took away my fine lines. I do use peels but with this cream two times a day my skin was just radiant. I bought another cream well I guess I will give it to a friend Because my miracle cream is on its way!! Abby nice to have your amazing products back. Also the vitamin c serum is superior to any other serums I have tried. I use their vitamin c serum before my cream at night. Oh and a little goes a long way. I am 41 years old and thanks to these products I honestly don&#x27;t look 30. I erased sun damage and scars from picking at acne. Dont forget to do your neck!! You don&#x27;t want a beautiful face and an old looking neck Lol. Yay I am so thrilled. Also thrilled that this company actually cares about their customers. I am a loyal fan for life!</li>
            <li> I am a big skin care user for the means of prior excessive sun exposure and fear of premature aging and I often splurge on my skincare- I love this cream- it is super hydrating and has really effective ingredients- the customer service is also amazing-I had a great experience and will continue to be a customer. Often times new products will break me out and this did not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I tried this product I use it twice a day. I love how rich and creamy it feels going on my skin. And better than that, I love how rejuvenated my skin feels after using it only a little more than a month. I&#x27;m at the age that I worry about wrinles but I really think that my skin looks smoother and younger. What at great product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive and whatever moisturizer I have used has led to breakouts.  So I haven&#x27;t used moisturizer on my face much.  Everything caused some acne flare up.  I had tried serums with success since they are not oil based.  Toulon&#x27;s hyaluronic acid serum with vitamin c and aloe had helped the health of my skin so much, I decided to try the Anti-Wrinkle face cream.  I was worried about breakouts and had no experience with glycolic acid (remember I have sensitive skin).  I was a fan from the beginning.  The cream did not irritate my skin at all.  It actually soothed it.  The oppossite... and instead of leading to clogged pores and acne break outs the cream helped my dried out skin get hydrated and cleared up the blemishes I had.  I am blemish free and finally found a moisturizer that I can use to moisturize my acne prone, sensitive skin.  I could not be happier and will continue to use this product.  I love the new packaging and although I didn&#x27;t mind the pump bottle, I was excited to see it in a jar now!  It is a beautiful product, and I just bought another bottle for my mom for mothers day.  She&#x27;ll love it it!</li>
            <li> Many great reviews but I had a very bad reaction.  Skin burns/ tenderness/ peeling, etc.  Test out small amount first!</li>
            <li> Great product, great company! Charlee Barton</li>
            <li> As a guy, I haven&#x27;t used many moisturizers but when I&#x27;ve tried others it usually makes my face feel far too greasy. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and could not feel better about it. It gives my face the moisture needed but absolutely without the greasy feeling. Receiving this at a promotional discount was just icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> I like this product not sure if it works but my face feels smoother-So I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I have dark age spots covering most of my face and i noticed that on the second day of using the mosturizer it is  beginning to get lighter and my face is smother. I am amazed at what this product can do. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered the full line of products (the vitamin C serum, the eye cream, and the face cream).  I use all three products morning and night.  I already exfoliate every weekend with a microdermabrasion machine, so I can&#x27;t say that I noticed a huge difference, but what I have noticed is that my skin looks and feels freshly exfoliated each and every day since using this line of products.  My skin looks and feels smooth and is glowing.  I will definitely be reordering this entire line and will be a life-long customer!</li>
            <li> Love it. The creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past are always either too greasy or not creamy enough and I have to use a lot. Toulon is just perfect for my skin</li>
            <li> This face cream is really rich but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when you put it on. I expected there to be some stinging feeling because of the salicylic acid but there wasn&#x27;t any at all--it feels great.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried this product.  My pores are shrinking, and I haven&#x27;t had any blemishes.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Finally!  I have suffered from acne for years. And it&#x27;s always been a battle between having clear skin or soft skin. What I&#x27;ve noticed is that the scrubs I use to clear up my blemishes tends to dry my skin out, a lot. Then the dry scaly skin traps oil and dirt in my pores and makes me break out again. And most moisturizers just clog my pores and again, I break out. Luckinly a friend told me about this glycolic acid cream. I was skeptical at first, but this stuff really helps. I guess the glycolic acid gets rid of the dead and dried out skin cells, then moisturizes the healthy skin. I love it. Finally I have clear AND soft skin. Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream I have ever found. Truly what the other reviews say... You will notice a difference and I like that it has no smell, and feels like a much more expensive cream, might....</li>
            <li> I like this Glycolid Acid cream. It doesn&#x27;t makes your skin feels burning as others Glycolid Acid products. Feels no greasy, wich is good for my oily skin. It leaves you a softness sensation and you really notice your skin moisturized. My only complain is that the pump of my bottle does&#x27;nt Works well and i have to push several times to get the products.</li>
            <li> I never ever write reviews (good or bad) but I had to write this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the product and liked it.  The pump broke rather quickly though.  I contacted the company and the gave me some suggestions.  It still didn&#x27;t work.  I figured, oh well I liked the cream so I will have to extract it the old fashioned way using gravity.  To my surprise the company replaced the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its nice to know there are companies out there who still out out quality products and actually have real customer service.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this product, and I absolutely love it, after only about a week of using it! It is so thick, so you can tell right away it&#x27;s quality. It covers really well, with no burning or anything. I have sensitive skin so I was concerned about anything with &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; in it&#x27;s label, but it&#x27;s nothing but soothing. I can tell too that this jar will last a long time because you don&#x27;t need to use much of it at a time like you do with other stuff. I can also tell already that the lines on my face are less pronounced----yes!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about a week and love it as a night cream.  It goes on smooth and feels creamy on my skin.  I have very dry skin and this product seems keep me hydrated all night long.  Would recommend to anyone with dry skin looking for a product to keep your face soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Great product - noticed results within days of using this. I had some dry patches near my nose from winter dryness and this cleared them up in days! THANKS!!!!</li>
            <li> Great texture and truly seems to smooth the skin as it heals</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell if this item is good.i never had pores on my face  before,that wasn&#x27;t my issue.this product gave me huge pores yuck.my skin feels very soft.but I paid $11.95 for my cream.but watch how much the price is increasing wow.I&#x27;m mixed race and this product tan my skin a-lot I only use this cream at night.this product will tan your skin so ladies make sure you wear a good SPF sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love doesn&#x27;t begin to explain it.  This is the second Toulon product I&#x27;ve tried and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint either.  As with the other product, the packaging is just so gorgeous.  Unlike some other glycolic creams I&#x27;ve used before, this one did not burn or sting at all, but yet I still felt it was working.  As someone in my early 40s and in the hot Texas sun often, I jumped at the chance to get this product with a special promotion.  I am not disappointed at all. It is smooth, non-greasy and I can already see a noticeable difference in my skin quality, tightness and brightness.  My skin is baby smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have seen visible results in just under a month.  My crows feet around my eyes are less visible and the moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks before writing a review. This has been my experience with the product...Skin is softer, but haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li> Very light on the skin and fragrance free. I noticed improvement on my skin within a week. Would recommend and definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love how thick and rich this moisturizer is. It gives  me an instant glow  each time I use it. I have seen improvement in the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> i had troubles in the beginning but the company was amazing by calling me personally and making the situation better than i ever could expect , i love the product and will continue  using ..</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream. My face is softer already in just a week.</li>
            <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed this face moisturizer.  My skin stays hydrated and looks great.  I will continue to use it.  My boyfriend even made a comment about how my skin was glowing since I started using the product!</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer!  I&#x27;m always cautious about trying new products because I have sensitive skin.  This moisturizer is wonderful!  I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks and have been impressed.  The smooth and creamy formula seeps into my skin.  Once on, it feels light weight.  It has helped with the dry areas and wrinkles on my face.  Thank you Toulon!</li>
            <li> Love this new moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This stuff is like gold in a bottle! Really though, not only can I see a difference in my fine lines but my skin is clearing up!!! I hate that I am 30 years old with acne...but this product is helping my skin clear WHILE keeping wrinkles at bay. I only wish this came in a larger jar. The cream has a thick luxurious feel and glides on leaving my face feel well moisturized. I apply this before bed, and wake up to radiant skin. I am so thankful this came to me during a promotion! You have a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Love the texture, and I can actually feel the glycolic acid working!  I haven&#x27;t seen improvement yet, but haven&#x27;t used it all.  I definitely do not like the tub that is unhygienic  I use this dayy and night along with the antiaging vitamin c serum, especial use it when I use the dermaroller!</li>
            <li> Excellent! Love this face cream-- spreads so nicely! My skin feels soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin after using this cream for a month. It is greasy and heavy. It soaks in ok. But I want purchase again.. Disappointment..</li>
            <li> I do like this TOULON brand. I have used these products for a while now and so far I have not been let down. I have tried everything from them and I am enjoying them all. My face looks good! Rejuvenates well.</li>
            <li> Love this product , i use it along with the Vitamin C Serum,  at first i guess i was applying too much of the moisturizing cream cause  it would make my face a bit shiny, but after adjusting the amount i use its now wonderful, i&#x27;m even able to use it during the daytime with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;my face is looking much softer and smoother, so much so that my girlfriend wants me to buy her this products that i&#x27;m using .She says that if it works so well for a guy then it should work even better for a female.. lol.&lt;br /&gt; So yes ive ordered her a set along withe the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> i like this line of skincare. I used the eye cream and it was light and nice. I used this one once and did not experience any irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome.  Love all the products.  My skin is so smooth.  Getting Better Every Day. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the cream and it makes my skin feel so soft.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as it used to.  I really like the sleek and cool packaging and jar.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days and I can swear I see a difference, I am so worried about some of my face, I need something really powerful and this appears to be the one, time will tell, and the delivery was very fast, thanks!</li>
            <li> Very responsive. Item delivered exactly as promised and product is excellent! Uscented, which is important to me because I have asthma and other allergies. I love it!</li>
            <li> Smells like burnt sugar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a week and am pleased so far.  While I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic change in my skin, the scent and consistency of the product are great. As someone with sensitive skin, I&#x27;m very aware of scented products and there is no artificial scent to worry about here!</li>
            <li> Fantastic face moisturizer.  I use this as a night cream and a day cream.  It has so many ingredients that are great for my skin like grapeseed oil and rosehip oil, but I love the mild glycolic acid.  The glycolic acid face cream exfoliates &amp; moisturizes while keeping my skin acne free.  It is great to not worry about any blemishes popping up and fight wrinkles all at he same time.</li>
            <li> This is a good cream, but lets face it there is no magic in any jar!  Dose a nice job hydrating and I do see SOME fine lines less, but not like I wanted.  I was hoping for the blotches to go away more than the wrinkles. This is not the case.  I gave 4 stars because it is a good moisturizer and has not ended up in the black hole of potions I have.  I do use this twice daily.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin. This very good. I only use at night</li>
            <li> This cream made my skin break out really bad.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer goes on smoothly and very quickly absorbs. I immediately see an improved facial texture and firmness. I&#x27;m also using it with the eye renewal therapy, and love the way they work together. I get deep, dark circles under my eyes, and this combination is helping to minimize that problem area for me. The fine lines at the base of my eye are visibly softened.</li>
            <li> A product that reached all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Really like using this cream. Pleasant scent and goes on very smoothly. Light, not heavy. I have other creams, but this is the one I prefer to use!</li>
            <li> It is a gift for my fair red haired daughter, I chose it because it was safe for sensitive skin, I have not heard from her how well it works,</li>
            <li> This is the best find ever.  Helps with all kinds of skin issues.</li>
            <li> My family walked away from the manufactured products life 2 years ago.  Since then what I can not make at home, I search out an an organic product.  I was delighted to be given a opportunity to get this face moisturizer through a promotion and to give my opinion of this product.  As you may guess my biggest draw was that it is &amp;#34;Paraben-Free, Gluten-Free, Cruelty-Free, &amp; Fragrance-Free&amp;#34;...so I knew it was safe.  Not to mention all the lovely oils in the ingredient list.  I was even more delighted when applying the cream.  It goes on smooth and does not feel greasy at all.  It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel soft and supple. I have dry skin and I am so happy when I find a face cream that moisturizes my skin all day long.  Other creams have left my skin blotchy by the end of the day, but this product does not.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very moisturizing</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic!  Not too heavy but perfect as a night moisturizer!  Wake up to refreshed looking and softer skin!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer; it goes on smooth and is non-greasy. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for red spots because alpha hydroxyl acid is supposed to work for acne that is not quite active but still leaves marks. I&#x27;ve tried benzoyl peroxide, Neosporin, and Vaseline for this, but nothing worked. I started using this twice a day - once in the morning, once at night - and my most stubborn spots are fading quick after just one week. This product is great for my oily skin, and I do not need to use a moisturizer when using this. The rest of my skin is glowing. I never feel greasy. My new routine is tea tree oil cleansing pads from Trader Joe&#x27;s followed by this and maybe some benzoyl peroxide if I&#x27;m starting to break out.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this cream for a few weeks before I gave my review. I use this along with the 20% glycolic acid pads, I can say that using both of them has improved the texture of my skin, pores are smaller and my skin feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;I use a small amount mixed with my foundation in the morning , then the 20% glycolic acid pads and this cream at night. I&#x27;ll keep using them and hopefully will continue to see improvement. If you have oily skin then I would recommend using it only at night.&lt;br /&gt;I think the Glycolic acid cream is a very good product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Fantastic feel!! I am so thankful I was able to try this moisturizer out! I now have the Vitamin C serum as well as this moisturizer. My face feels luxurious before I go to bed. I was able to try both of the products with the use of a coupon.&lt;br /&gt;When I wake up,  my face looks plump and healthy!! I love the combo.&lt;br /&gt;I have searched  and gone through a number of moisturizers in my time, and this is by far one of my favorites!!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels great.  It has evened the discoloration on my skin .  It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product! My mother likes it, too</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It makes my skin feel heavenly. I use it daily under my foundation and it keeps my skin moist without being greasy...and that is really saying something when you have combination skin. It does improve the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; of my skin but can&#x27;t say much about the long term benefits as I haven&#x27;t used it that long. It makes my skin feel so soft, and it diminishes the appearance of my fine lines. I have found a very small amount of this cream goes a LONG way, which is nice. A lot of small cream containers seem to empty so quickly, so it&#x27;s great that this product has a silky glide that seems to cover your entire face in no time. One caution is to make sure to use sun screen with this product as it can make your skin more susceptible to the sun. I saw this was offered for a promotion and I jumped at the opportunity!</li>
            <li> Just received this face cream and am very pleased with how wonderful it makes my skin feel. I&#x27;m also impressed with Toulon&#x27;s pride in their product as evidenced by the excellent set of instructions sent in email and the promise of an additional gift coming my way. I&#x27;ve not yet received this, but I anticipate that it will be both thoughtful and useful. Thanks, Rebecca.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Margaret</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and not greasy - just the right amount of moisturizer I need.</li>
            <li> Creamy &amp; easily absorbed, this cream tightens the skin in a lovely way. I live in a dry environment and have started to use this twice a day:  my skin feels great!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  No breakout like I usual get when using a facial  moisturizer.  Smooth skin,absorbs easily, and non irritating</li>
            <li> I got more than I expected with this product inside of a week. I purchased it for it&#x27;s anti-aging qualities. I&#x27;m now 50 and wanted to minimize my fine lines. Luckily, I&#x27;m aging gracefully like my mother ... lol For all of my adult life, I&#x27;ve had oily skin on my face. I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day and not only does it clear out my wrinkles for the day, my oily skin problem is nearly gone. I was always self conscious about my face getting greasy. I used those Clean and Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets and face powder which of course clogged my pores but I had no choice. Now I powder my nose at lunch and that&#x27;s about it. This product is a God send!</li>
            <li> This cream is great. It is creamy and feels great on my skin. My skin is feeling softer and firmer and I notice the wrinkles on my face are not as deep as they were before.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever put on my face. and doesnt irritate my skin.  I have had bad reaction to others but this is perfect and does exactly what it says. Its a miracle in a jar!!!!</li>
            <li> DIDNT DO WHAT IT SAID  COLD CREAM WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAMETHING . VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Feels so soft! My skin feels so hydrated. I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple days but I&#x27;m hoping it evens out my skin tone over time as well! Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. I usually use this at night and I wake up with the softest skin!  I have not been using it long enough to know long term effects but I love how my skin feels  and it does not irritate my skin (I break out easily if products have fragrance and this does not) so I am very pleased with it. Natural ingredients + good price + better skin &#x3D; happy customer!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Made my acne worse</li>
            <li> Despite the smell, which isn&#x27;t  that bad...it&#x27;s made with plants and oils so it smells like it. I love how it makes my skin feel. My face feels softer and rejuvenated. It&#x27;s  more hydated, and brightens it up.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture of this product and you only need to use a small amount to cover your face. My face definitely is akot ssmoother since using this moisturizer</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome! For reference, I am 33 and have sensitive, combination, and acne prone (adult cyctic) skin. This product not only moisturized my skin, but REALLY helped clear my acne. In about 2-3 weeks I noticed my skin had really cleared up, and I did not get the perverbial &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34; chin and cheek cysts. I was very pleasantly surprised! Extra bonus, it is not greasy or shiny, so it wears really well under makeup! I&#x27;ve used every product under the sun, from over counter, to expensive products at department stores, to prescription creams from my dermotologist, and this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used on my skin. If you&#x27;re thinking about trying it, do it! You will not be disappointed with this product, and it ships right to your door!</li>
            <li> Cream was effective and I enjoyed using it. I am running out so I need to order more. Tried another brand before this and I prefer Toulon over everything I have tried so far. I am so glad that I found this on Amazon. I love amazon prime too.. easier than going to the store to look for it.</li>
            <li> Always seemed to get acne and blackheads on my nose no matter what I did or tried.  I did some research and found out that Glycolic Acid would help and this took care of the problem. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using products with glycolic acid for years, but this one has brought my skin to a whole new level.  My skin is glowing!  And an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! In the past few months, I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions and this is definitely the one I&#x27;ll stick with. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin (at 30, which is lame) and the Toulon has not only helped my skin clear up, but it looks much healthier. It leaves my skin smooth and glowing, without being shiny or greasy. And no breakouts!</li>
            <li> My wife has bought this cream a few times now. She loves the price and the quick shipping. It works as well as the uber expensive creams, but doesn&#x27;t have the high price tag. The ingredients are what won her over just to give it a try and she has been repurchasing it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Ever since I got this I use it every day. My regiment now is I get my bath at night time and then use this afterward. It is one great product I feel and look at least 5 years younger. People keep complementing me on how it look. It has taken my wrinkles away and also has made my skin feel so much smoother. Thanks so much for making such a great product.</li>
            <li> I have shelves full of creams that I have tried and not liked, but this product is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for less than 2 weeks. I haven&#x27;t yet noticed a softening of lines and wrinkles yet but the appearance of my pores has dramatically decreased. I am in my mid-forties and have lost elasticity in my skin. My skin already feels tighter and my pores are barely noticeable. I can&#x27;t wait to see the changes yet to come with continued use!</li>
            <li> I was stealing it from my girlfriend until she caught me. Now I have to buy it for myself. I still like it.</li>
            <li> Nope, nope, nope. I think all the people who put positive reviews, were paid to do so. I actually paid real money for this product and it does nothing, nada..not a damn thing. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the month I used it.</li>
            <li> Makes my face smell like pancakes, which I am not opposed to. Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough yet to know if it is effective.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone. My face feels softer, more hydrating And just perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used to date.&lt;br /&gt;I am already seeing a change to my skin’s texture and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week. I feel as if I finally have the soft smooth skin I always wanted. If you&#x27;re prone to break outs, I highly suggest using this product. It has made my acne nearly disappear! This product is a game changer and highly recommended to anyone looking for smoother skin&lt;br /&gt;-Kiana</li>
            <li> i am enjoying this product very much specially working outside in this weather helps my skin to be moisturize all day. I definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend as a gift for her. After a week, my friend called me and she said she happy with this product and it works for her. So I tell her where to get it and she will start using it again to help her maintain her skin care.</li>
            <li> Great face cream! I can already tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Smells like packaging Peanuts.  Yuck</li>
            <li> Awesome moisturizer!! I have very sensitive skin and have always had a hard time finding the right moisturizer that won&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily. The consistency is a bit thick, but it is perfect for my skin! It goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling and looking great! I am always skeptical to try skincare products because of my weird skin, but I was lucky enough to snag this at a promotional rate! I was very excited to see the quantity of the product, it will go a long way!!</li>
            <li> Softening, yet I can feel the slight tightening after use. Must be working!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a week now. I like that it has a very mild smell and goes on smooth. It&#x27;s a good size bottle and the cream is not oily. I think my face is nice and fresh in the morning after using this. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it as I&#x27;ve been very happy so far.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin very radiant and glowing. Very easy to use and just a small bit goes all the way! no greasy residue, feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Again I have to rate this high the price is right an it has reduced the pores on my face an I am glowing.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I received this product about 10 days ago. TEN DAYS! I never would have thought it could work the way it did for my face! It claims to clear acne along with help with wrinkles. I&#x27;ve seen it do both! This is a product I plan on using from now on. The lotion has a bit of a smell, but it&#x27;s not too bad!! My husband even noticed a change in my face as far as it clearing up and me looking for &amp;#34;energized,&amp;#34; as he said. Great product!! I received this product at a discount for my honest review!!</li>
            <li> I bought this face moisturizer because it came up on my &#x27;recommended for you&#x27; feed and had great reviews at a great price. With a 60 day money back guarantee advertised, how could I lose? I lost. First thing I noticed when I got the package is it is not NSF certified or USDA Organic Certified ingredients. The ingredient list has some organic items, but again not certified ANYWHERE on the package or container. I opened the productand tested on the inside of my arm for about 8 hours. It smelled bad and I didn&#x27;t notice any moisturizing effect right away that you expect from a face moisturizer. Decided to try it with the eye cream before bed. I put it on with the  eye cream (which I had tested on the back of my hand and which was terrible too). I lasted about 10 minutes before I had to wash my face again because the small was so atrocious. Not a bad combo of ingredients, but spoiled ingredients like rotten food. This is going back to amazon immediately for a full refund. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Goes on smooth not greasy and makes my skin feel like silk all day long.</li>
            <li> So happy I continued to try the TOULON Skincare line.  This moisturizer works.  It feels great on my skin and goes on smoothly.  It absorbs quickly and I use it morning and night.  Hydrates my skin.  I was a little worried about alpha hydroxy acids in my face cream...but the cream is very mild and seems to be multi functional like exfoliating and treating...not just a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works fast and the effect lasts. If you want to maintain your youthfull look, try this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. Lately I&#x27;ve been getting fine wrinkles. and this has helped it less visible. Made my skin more youthful. I recommend w</li>
            <li> I love this product. Just ordered another one.</li>
            <li> I first bought the Vitamin C serum and had been using that for a while before I ordered this face cream. A very small amount (not enough to cover your face) comes out with one pump, so I used 2 pumps every night. The bottle is bigger than the one the vitamin C serum comes in so I was surprised when it ran out very quickly. I was using the serum before I got this, sometime around December, and I am still using the serum and its February. The face cream lasted less than a month and that was using it only at night most of the time. I was disappointed that it ran out so quickly and I did not notice any results. I am 35 and only have a few wrinkles on my forehead and one noticeable age spot, both of which remain unchanged, so I can&#x27;t recommend either product, really.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and exfliator</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the face moisturizer for a week now and my skin is loving it! My skin is smoother and softer. I was very surprised how well it worked on my blemishes. This is definitely one that I will repurchase. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the feel. Starting to notice some smoothing and better tone.</li>
            <li> Save your money please don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping. This product really amazes me! It makes my skin feel  completely revitalized I will definitely be telling my friends about this one ! I got it from the Amazon reviewer and  I&#x27;m hooked on this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a really good price. I recieved a discount through Amazon review trader. Product has a nice texture, doesn&#x27;t feel oily. Smells great. Makes my skin feel smooth. An ample amount for the price!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product yet. I&#x27;m just disappointed the jar is about 40% empty.  The eye cream was filled the right amount, I think.  I exchanged the product right away, and the replacement was 80% full.  That is better at least.</li>
            <li> I really do love this face moisturizer. I love the way it makes my face feel plus it&#x27;s rich and creamy texture! It has so many great skin care ingredients and I really love that it has Glycolic Acid 10 and Jojoba. This moisturizer really makes my skin softer and smoother. It is amazing that I can use it twice a day without any issues of burning or irritating like I have experienced with other Glycolic acid treatments. I will continue using this amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> As I am getting older here. I am now noticing some lines around my eyes and my mouth. There are areas when my skin seems a tad darker too. Age spots my mother calls them. Since I began using this cream my face feels smoother, my husband told me that my face looks brighter, and my teen age daughter told me that I looked younger. So I&#x27;ll take that as this product is indeed working for me. I like how it does not have a greasy texture and a pleasant scent. I have sensitive skin and have had no reactions to this cream. I am happy with the results I have seen so far.</li>
            <li> I totally love how it makes my skin look. Is one of the best products i have try. I think i look younger also thanks you so much for the great servives and communication seller.</li>
            <li> I have only use this twice and I can see a difference! I think this will be great used over time and it will make my skin look better.  I have acne prone and so far it has not broken me out.  I hope it works long term. :)</li>
            <li> I love this cream it smell awesome and it leave my skin feeling super silky and nice. I t is very easy to blend and I love that is not that greasy because I hate heavy greasy creams for my face besides rosehip oil is awesome for the skin I have feel a lot of improve in my dry skin, I really love it</li>
            <li> The active ingredient of this product is Glycolic Acid 10%.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty high!&lt;br /&gt;It means that this intensive cream may renew skin, minimize breaking out, minimize fine lines, pores, some dark spots on the face and prevent aging process. I&#x27;m trying on my face and love this feeling. Recommend any type of skin for this winter season very much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t forget to apply SPF(sunscreen) every morning.</li>
            <li> Excellent packaging ! This cream really works !!! I&#x27;ve used it and totally am happy with it. I would highly recommend it. Especially during these cold winter months when my skin gets so dry ! It really helps moisturize and fight against the winter weather. Excellent  product !</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this moisturizer it has a nice thick consistency but its not greasy and i really cant tell that it has any scent which is great, its also full of great ingredients that are great for your skin i would recommend this product. I recieved this product for review purposes and these are my honest and true opinions</li>
            <li> Great aha face cream! This glycolic acid lotion has improved my skin&#x27;s complexion, reduced blemishes, and made my pores look smaller. My skin feels tighter and really well hydrated. This product does not dry out or irritate my skin. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Like this product! This alpha hydroxy acid serum, great for my wrinkles. My hubby is using this too, we all satisfied with this product. Need a bit of time to combat the fine lines, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer because it&#x27;s lightweight. I tend to favorite lightweight because I have normal to combination skin. Therefore this moisturizer works well on my skin. I use it for to make sure I don&#x27;t get wrinkles and I think it does the job.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer is a must in my daily makeup routine: it needs to be moisturizing but not too greasy, and this one does just that: it sinks in to skin very nicely leaving my skin feel nice and soft and smooth and in no time I can apply my make up! I really like this face moisturizer. It is rich and creamy and has so many great skin care ingredients, licorice, vit c and e, green tea, rosehip oil, and glycolic acid. I would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Loving this face Moisturizer!!I have been using it every night for 2 weeks and my skin is really soft and hydrated! It glides onto my skin smooth, no fumes under my eyes.It is sent free and I can apply my make up over it. I am very impressed with this Alpha Hydroxy Acid. my face feels and looks so hydrated and has a healthy glow to it. Love the packaging, size and shape of this it fits nicely into my cosmetic bag. this product is a wonderful new addition to my daily skin care routine! I will recomed to to friends!</li>
            <li> This creamy anti aging face moisturizer is awesome.  It glides on easily, no burning sensation like I have experienced with other glycolic and alpha hydroxy acid products and within just a few days have noticed a difference in my skin texture and glow.  I really feel like I am getting the best for my skin with the combination of high quality ingredients ALL IN ONE BOTTLE!  I even had a co worker say I looked more rested(we work 12 hour night shifts) and my skin has a &amp;#34;youthful glow&amp;#34;.  Excited to see the results with continued use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer nightly for a few weeks now, and it seems to be working really well! It is lightweight and absorbs quickly. I have had problems with heavier creams making my face break out in the past, and this seems to be the perfect amount of moisture. I have noticed the fine lines around my eyes diminishing and my sun spots are not as noticeable! I would definitely recommend this to anyone that needs a lightweight moisturizer and wants to look younger fast!</li>
            <li> love the glycolic acid cream.  It is helping with fine lines and is brightening up my skin.  I love that it is natural and 100% vegan.</li>
            <li> This anti aging face cream has been perfect for my skin.  It is light weight and makes my skin feel fantastic.  It is perfect for the summer!  I do use an SPF when using the glycolic acid.  The jar makes it so easy to apply.  I am really happy that the product is back in stock and I can order more.</li>
            <li> I was panicking when I saw that the glycolic acid 10% moisturizer was out of stock on Amazon.  This face cream has made such a difference to the appearance of my face and really all over.  With regular use I am experiencing dramatic improvements to my face with ridding my skin of break outs and giving my face an overall glow that this winter I started using it on my elbows, hands, feet around my nails, and really any place where I need some TLC to my skin.  My skin just loves the cream.  It is lush and healing.  It is the best moisturizer.  Can&#x27;t wait for Toulon to release their healing body lotion on Amazon in the new jar.  Will be ordering more Anti-Wrinkle face moisturizer as soon as it is back in stock.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product. I have sensitive skin and have to be very careful with what I use on my face, and this cream manages to be both highly nourishing and soothing without leaving me feeling greasy - I can put it on in the morning and it feels great and I don&#x27;t have to worry about being shiny by the afternoon. Most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried tend to be one extreme or the other - either too thin and not effective, or too cloying and I can only use them at night - this one strikes the perfect balance. I will definitely reorder. Shipping was fast and easy - highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy, yet light and subtle. Using day and night. Not sticky or oily. It&#x27;s a big jar that will last awhile. really enjoying this product!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about a week and what a difference! Plumper looking skin with a glow. Hydrates really well as well!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with the moisturizer.  Absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product...it has only been a week but I like the feel of it and I notice that when I wake up my skin looks and feels great! I plan to keep using it to see what happens but I would say so far so great!</li>
            <li> This aha lotion feels so great all over my body not just on my face.  I also use it on my hands and chest.  It exfoliates my skin giving me a wonderful glow.  Perfect in the in the winter months.  I love that it has such a range of super ingredients...that way I can get everything I want in one bottle...saves me money.  I especially like the licorice root to help against hyper pigmentation.  Great choice.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Product goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t require a lot. There is a lite smell but it doesn&#x27;t last long. I like the fact that this product contains a lot of natural ingredients that are good for my skin. My face feels softer and I will definitely continue to use this product along with my other skin care items.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan ofglycolic acid 10 cream.I have tried many skin products and this product does a great job of exfoliating my skin and giving my skin a glow. I am beginning to see a difference with fine lines. It makes my face feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> So far, I am satisfied with this product.  However, since I have been using it for only 1 month, it is really hard to give it a very accurate review.  As with any face cream product, it takes awhile to see what the true results of use are for any given individual.  This face cream does soak in very easily and does not leave an oily residue, which I like.  I am not fond of the smell, however.</li>
            <li> This product has been incredible for my skin.  I have suffered with many skin challenges.  I have uneven blotchy skin, rosacea and dry flaky skin This is a super healer. It has helped to alleviate all of these issues for me.  I never thought that my skin would look so even and so smooth.  I used to be very embarrassed but after using glycolic acid cream twice a day on my face I am seeing great improvement and even feel like my skin is brighter and appears plumped and healthy. Unbelievable...no more dry flaky, blotchy skin!! My skin is brighter and old acne scars are lessening.  I am in my 50s and have even begun to see a difference for the fine lines around my eyes and lips.  I have been using it twice a day as my moisturizer but knowing that it is an AHA treatment.  I have had no issues with irritation.  It is 10% glycolic acid but it is buffered.  It feels soft and rich and creamy on my skin. I really like the this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like this face moisturizer.  It is rich and creamy and has so many great skin care ingredients, licorice, vit c and e, green tea, rosehip oil, and glycolic acid. This moisturizer really makes my skin softer and smoother.  It is amazing that I can use it twice a day with out any issues of burning or irritating like I have experienced with other glycolic acid treatments. Great exfoliator that leaves my skin refreshed and supple.  Have been putting it on in the morning and the night and will continue with the routine.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been noticing the skin around my eyes isn&#x27;t as smooth as it used to be. This seems particularly noticeable when I&#x27;m using a loose powder. I was given the opportunity to try this product during a promotional period, and I have been pleased with it so far. A very small amount goes a long way, so I feel like it is going to last quite a while. Using it twice a day with a serum as the label suggests, I have noticed a difference. My makeup goes on smoother, not just around my eyes but on my whole face. I did rate this as four stars, because it is a touch oily for my taste, but it isn&#x27;t so much that I would not use the product. I do have to give it some time to fully absorb in the mornings before I put on makeup.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy a luxurious moisturizer that deeply hydrates my skin.  This anti-aging cream feels great and makes my face supple and soft.  I like that it is not thin and watery but luscious.  Will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> It is to thick and to difficult to apply evenly on skin. Really did not see any results.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff. Easy to apply, very light and light scented. Recommended to apply in the morning.</li>
            <li> Not using it as a true wrinkle cream. Have sun damaged skin on arms and head, and seems to be smoothing and moisturizing. Application lasts for a few days. Exfoliating is removing the dry skin cells. After considerable research decided to try the effects of Glycolic and Alpha Hydroxy acid, it is without retinol. And no complaints after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with it. I was afraid a cream, would be too heavy for me. It seems to hydrate my skin well, without feeling heavy. When I wake up in the morning, my skin looks refreshed and I&#x27;m noticing a reduction in my fine lines. It helps to plump up the skin, and hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> Smooth as silk! Love this anti-wrinkle face moisturizer! It feels very different from my other brands because my face feels like there is a protective shield of moisture. The jojoba oil and glycolic acid truly make a perfect marriage of ingredients. It does not dry out so fast like other products. I would have to re-apply my other moisturizers during the day. Thank you for formulating such a superb face cream!</li>
            <li> Great glycolic acid cream.  It is 10 percent glycolic acid so I know that it is exfoliating my skin and allowing the list of high quality ingredients to absorb into the layers of my skin.  Really happy about the rosehip oil and grapeseed oil.  The aha lotion does not irritate my skin at all.  Great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product ! It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I love that it is a scent free product.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this cream and find it offers just what I have been looking for--excellent texture, good moisturizing, without the stickiness or oily feel of so many products.  I will definitely add this to my &amp;#34;beauty regimen&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> love it still trying to see if anything changes in my face but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> This face cream is great as a moisturizer.  My skin glows when I use it and it makes my skin feel and look great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok... can&#x27;t really say I see a difference.If anything My skin might be a bit softer? I will use it up but probably order something different next time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months and I can really see the difference in the fine lines on my face.  I use it everyday as part of my routine!</li>
            <li> I attempted to use the product twice. The first time, it worked fine, but the pump wouldn&#x27;t squirt anything out the second time around. Only a dollop the size of three pin-heads came out each time, and because of this, I wasn&#x27;t able to fully apply it even once with the minimal amount of substance I had on my hands. I&#x27;m just about to return this product in hopes of finding something with a cleaner application.</li>
            <li> The pump broke Not even after a week of use</li>
            <li> Works great!&lt;br /&gt;I usually don’t bother with writing product reviews. I never really saw the point of it. But I’m so impressed with this anti-wrinkle moisturizer, I feel I have to share this find with everyone. I have been using it every night for 2 weeks and my skin is really soft and hydrated! Now, I’m in my sixties, so I don’t expect miracles with regards to my wrinkles, but I can already see a difference. My skin looks and feels fuller, and certain lines around my mouth and eyes are definitely getting less noticeable. I’d say I look 5 years younger. Can’t wait to see what happens in the next two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;-Janet</li>
            <li> I love this product! Not only is the cream light yet moisturizing as it goes on and not only do I use it at nighttime but my skin is clear, smooth and is no longer blotchy. The best part of this cream was when I tried it on my stretch marks and it&#x27;s actually working to minimize them!! Just incredible! U can&#x27;t go wrong with this product and price! I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Loved this product. It has an alpha hydroxy acid that was compatible with my skin, making it look smoother and healthier .in tone and texture. It&#x27;s a luxury moisturizer at a very reasonable price. You only need a very small amount to get its beneficial effects. Would I recommend it? Absolutely!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is pretty amazing! I am loving my results after a short period of time. I already use the vitamin c serum of this brand which I love, so when  I was able to grab this for a promotional price I jumped on it. The two products together are amazing! There is a definite difference in my skin. My fine lines are reduced, and my skin stays supple and moisturized all day. I love when a product works. I do not expect a face lift in a jar, but I do expect for a product to deliver what it says it will. So two thumbs up, and thanks!</li>
            <li> I love that this is a moisturizer, anti-aging cream, and acne treatment all in one. After just a few days of using it I could feel the difference and see the difference. My wrinkles are smoother, dark spots are lighter and my pores aren&#x27;t clogged like they used to be. It has reduced the size and color of the bags under my eyes from being so tired.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on so smoothly without any greasy feeling and does not feel oily on the skin at all, it is really a refreshing feel. It is so light that it can be used in the morning under make up and at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;There is no scent at all, which I love, the scented moisturizers usually make me feel nauseous so this is a nice change.&lt;br /&gt;The jar it comes in is really a nice size to fit in any make-up bag or over-night bag for when you go on vacations.&lt;br /&gt;I was asked to review this item but all opinions about it are my own.</li>
            <li> Really like this cream absorb nicely on the face.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT FACE CREAM!!!REALLY WORKS GREAT IN REDUCING LINES AND WRINKLES ON YOUR FACE ALSO FIRMS FACE VERY GOOD!GREAT PRODUCT WILL DEFINATELY BUY AGAIN!THANKS:-)</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I am nearing 50, so I need something that works very well. Using this product, I look years younger.</li>
            <li> Finally found this!  I&#x27;ve been searching for an all natural cream to help with wrinkles (I&#x27;ve got that big crease between my eyebrows and my &amp;#34;laugh line&amp;#34; are nothing to laugh at!)  I love this cream and can already see changes in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  I&#x27;ve been using it nightly.  It&#x27;s very light on your skin, not greasy at all.  The container is nice because you can use the entire product without wasting any.  I was able to purchase this at a promotional price and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> Both product are good but after using it, the desired effects are not visible. One does tighten the skin and says it can be used under foundation but after awhile, it becomes flaky. Then the foundation makes the skin dry. I might buy this product again but I think I could buy an over the counter product with the same results.</li>
            <li> I like this cream, but it forms little balls of white on my face when used on top of serums.  Since I use two serums a day on my face, this isn&#x27;t great for me, but as a moisturizer/exfoliant, I think it is good.  It needs to be used alone, tho, and I use more than one thing on my face during my skin regimen.  Good for younger people who are starting anti-aging prevention measures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just using for a.couples.days. it feels good, it&#x27;s easy to apply and absorbed rapidly.. Also, I see that my pores are getting smaller and my skin looks beautiful</li>
            <li> A little greasy.  Didn&#x27;t absorb well for me.  I have mature, combination skin.</li>
            <li> Nice glycolic acid cream.  It is very gentle on the skin, but I find it leaves my skin a little greasy so I&#x27;ve switched to another product that is less oily.</li>
            <li> It kinda stinks but the smell goes away quickly. need only a very small amount, arrived less than a week after I ordered it. People are noticing my skin is looking brighter already. Would get a higher star rating if it smelled better</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive aging skin that is still acne prone, and I also have some scarring.  I have been using this product for about a month and I really like it. It is not too heavy but still moisturizes my skin.  It also appears to be helping my pores looks smaller!  The customer service for this product has been wonderful.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this product - it&#x27;s clear from the label that most are naturally derived, and beneficial for the skin. I&#x27;m very concerned with what goes on the skin in terms of chemicals - and this product doesn&#x27;t have any of those &amp;#34;scary&amp;#34; ingredients that other products have. This also does not burn like other glycolic acid products I have used - and it goes on &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; but not heavy, if that makes sense.  At first it will stay on the surface of the skin, but quickly gets absorbed.  I use twice daily since I am layering it on top of blemish products (salicylic, benzoyl) that dry out my skin and need the extra moisture. I definitely have acne-prone skin but this is the right level of moisture for it. Customer service is also amazing from this company - they respond to emails even on the weekend!</li>
            <li> I use the Toulon eye cream as well, this is an amazing line of&lt;br /&gt;beauty treatments.  My skin feels amazing, brighter and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results of these products.  I will&lt;br /&gt;keep you posted on my progress.  I highly recommend this line&lt;br /&gt;for anyone trying to prolong the aging process.  Reviewed for amztrader.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizer for my morning routine and I saw this cream. I looked and the ingredients and like it. It is a multipurpose cream with Alpha Hydroxy Acid, Vitamin C and green tea among other things. It is paraben free and fragrance free. Alpha Hydroxy acid provide an exfoliating action and thus gets rids of dead skin and give skin a glow. Vitamin C and green tea act as antioxidant and protects the skin. It is a cream of thick consistency but absorbs right away leaving my skin hydrated and moisturized. The make up goes on smooth after putting this on. I am seeing a clear and even tone skin. Excellent product for the money and come with 60 days money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> After trying a lot of different aha moisturizers, I finally found one I love. I have dry skin and I get dry patches in the winter. I&#x27;ve been using this glycolic acid moisturizer for about 3 weeks and my skin is now soft and hydrated. I have a dewy smooth look after applying my foundation instead of a dry patchwork with makeup stuck to the dry spots. But, after consistent use, I have seen a major difference and not a single dry patch! I also have had NO problems with clogged pores as I have had with other heavier moisturizers. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Works great. A little goes along way.  I have sensative skin and have had no problems.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this anti-wrinkle face moisturizer. It has a really smooth, silky texture that feels great on my skin. And even better it has no scent. It makes my skin look young and healthy. I don’t know what alpha hydroxy acid is, but I’m loving the results.</li>
            <li> I am almost 50 years old, and I LOVE this cream!!! I got it a few weeks ago and use it daily. This cream just feels so rich and creamy, and the skin on my face is so much softer, even radiant. I even have friends asking what is different about me. I almost feel guilty about it.&lt;br /&gt;I think the big difference with this moisturizer is the 10 percent glycolic acid. I guess it&#x27;s supposed to work as an exfoliant while it moisturizes. Whatever it&#x27;s doing, it&#x27;s working for me. I would recommend this product to anyone!.</li>
            <li> The best glycolic acid cream. I have tried others but they are too harsh and dry out my skin. This product is both a great moisturizer and  exfoliating treatment.</li>
