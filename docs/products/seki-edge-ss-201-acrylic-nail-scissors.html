            <li>Best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Works perfect!  </li>
            <li>These are the best nail scissors ever.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size too.</li>
            <li>Especially good for toenails, though.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I am just inept, but if you have to take a course in how to use a tool to cut your toenails, it&#x27;s probably not the best item for you.  </li>
            <li>For it&#x27;s price range, it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li>The spring functions perfectly.</li>
            <li>Excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li>Very good scissors, and I am something of an affecionado.</li>
            <li>Great scissors, the best I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Exceptional value!</li>
            <li>I believe these scissors will do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>They are great.  </li>
            <li>These are the very best nail scissors for toenails and are especially useful if you have an ingrown tonail.</li>
            <li>I buy lots of them and pay attention to good ones.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>They fit my hand(I am a guy with &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; size hands) perfectly.</li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t the very best, but it&#x27;s also not in the same price range as the very best.</li>
            <li>I think it is more because of the shape of the blade, not for the blade itself, which is great.</li>
            <li>I gave her a huge tip, lol.</li>
            <li>but these cut really nice.  </li>
            <li>I have never purchased this kind of nail scissors before.</li>
            <li>It sure wasn&#x27;t a good investment for me.</li>
            <li>Nice quality and very precise.</li>
            <li>Are also light weight but seem to be good quality.</li>
            <li>They are way easier to hold than the kind you have to put your fingers through, so you have a better grip and aiming ability.  </li>
            <li>A folding handle may be more convenient for travel.</li>
            <li>Love these scissors.  </li>
            <li>and I can now do both hands without struggling as I seem to have much better control with this design.</li>
            <li>of there&#x27;s a better one, I&#x27;d like to know about it.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>These work OK:</li>
            <li>I use them mostly to cut my toenails(which are not made of acrylic material but did break a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; pair of scissors), I also use them on my hands(but</li>
            <li>It cuts much better than a nail clipper.</li>
            <li>Cut cleanly and nicely.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle, so very smooth to use.</li>
            <li>In ending, these are by far the BEST nail scissors I have ever owned, they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Great Quality, good design, easy to use, Sharp scissors.</li>
            <li>She said they are much better than the ones she originally had.</li>
            <li>Well made and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Works easily and cuts evenly...</li>
            <li>Cuts easily</li>
            <li>These cut so easily and are slim/comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>You do not have to apply any force to it and it cuts toe nails easily</li>
            <li>Easy to work with</li>
            <li>but clippers are fine for that job.</li>
            <li>Easy to grasp and does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>Should suffice for light finger nails</li>
            <li>The thoughtfully designed Seki scissors are kinder in every way.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My 89 year old mother had a pair of nail scissors that she loved.</li>
            <li>Try these first!!</li>
            <li>This works great and would highly recommend to others looking for something that really does the job.</li>
            <li>I had two problems of a user friendly nature:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li>For most people with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toe nails which are not thick they should work fine.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them and will be giving more as gifts.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use, much easier than I thought.  </li>
            <li>this product is worth purchasing.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the BS alternatives I tried before this, these are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I bought these to replace my 20 plus year old pair of nail scissors that were not working right any more.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase and will look at the other things by the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li>After several months, I do like them better than I did originally.</li>
            <li>The black handle isn&#x27;t the most aesthetically elegant design</li>
            <li>; 2) they work best on straight thin toenails.  </li>
            <li>fits in your hand and gives good control with little effort required.</li>
            <li>Does a great job with hard nails and acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>This one really works!</li>
            <li>Reviews were pretty swell, so I took a chance.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it, I cut my skin and made a boo-boo.  </li>
            <li>But with the Seki Edge Nail Scissors,  they did exactly what I was hoping.  </li>
            <li>It cuts crisply without any wiggle.</li>
            <li>and I found myself looking for better scissors within the same price</li>
            <li>This a very good product for those who have trouble using regular scissors.</li>
            <li>Good product for small hands.</li>
            <li>The sharp point is perfect for reaching in to pull those fine and tiny little toenails that grow downwards.</li>
            <li>also bought the Seki Edge Ss-202 Professional which are more suitable for thick nails.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp, but very easy for my hands to use.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to use than my clippers</li>
            <li>These nail scissors are very well made.</li>
            <li>Very stressful  </li>
            <li>Even at the very tip, it&#x27;s well aligned and functions correctly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s comfortable and solid.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt these are very well made and much sharper than any I&#x27;ve seen before.  </li>
            <li>Important to note these are much larger than &amp;#34;cuticle&amp;#34; scissors.</li>
            <li>Very recommendable for arthritic hands.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Getting older and fatter does not help when cutting your own toenails, and I&#x27;m glad I found a better alternative to inaccurate short- and long-handled nail scissors and nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>The implement definitely works better than using regular toenail clippers, and better than the long handled toenail scissors I tried.  </li>
            <li>There is a really cool spring mechanism that pops them open after you cut - in the picture</li>
            <li>Nail clippers are not something I think about a lot, but when I lost the good nail scissors I had, I realized how many bad options there are out there.  </li>
            <li>Older people need tools that will allow them to cut without damaging skin.</li>
            <li>They allow me to do a simply thing, quickly and safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Excellent quality &amp; Well made, sharp, work well on tough nails</li>
            <li>highly recommend them &amp; will purchase another pair</li>
            <li>They are so easy to handle while holding a little hand or foot that you feel confident that you wont accidentally cut or pinch something other than a nail.</li>
            <li>This is a very good tool for cutting toenails for those with arthritis.</li>
            <li>Good for hand nails, but not easy to cut toe nails, unless they are very very long.</li>
            <li>It is very sharp and easy to use and works just as I wanted.</li>
            <li>They are fantastic for my toenails, but I also use them to open the blister packaging on CVS&#x27;s generic allergy medicine.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I use them myself, but these are the only scissors that I feel comfortable using to cut a child&#x27;s or infant&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>The scissors are comfortable to hold, easy to use, and I never feel like I am going to break it while applying enough pressure to cut thick nails.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as close nor is it as easy to get in to tight areas as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Best nail cutting scissors ever!  </li>
            <li>I love these have hard nails and</li>
            <li>I prefer them so much over a standard clipper.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use them until I find something better for my thick damaged nails.</li>
            <li>Hey, these things cut the most stubborn, thick, nails known to mankind.</li>
            <li>Their cutting action is more like nibbling away at the nail with the blade, than instead of making a clean cut.  </li>
            <li>Although there is a slight curve to the blades on these scissors, it is not quite enough to easily cut some toenails.  </li>
            <li>In 2013 I bought a pair of &amp;#34;3 Swords&amp;#34; nickel plated steel nail scissors(which are made in Germany), they were supposed to be my main toe-nail scissors with a pair of &amp;#34;Sally Hansen&amp;#34; nail scissors(purchased earlier) as &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>The scissors are very &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34;, and easily cut tough nails.</li>
            <li>I have thick thumbs and this eliminates the ring issue plus the spring action makes it easy to squeeze and snip.</li>
            <li>out of the box) are superior to the scissors mentioned above in cutting performance.</li>
            <li>these scissors easily cut tough nails</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, after repeated, fruitless attempts using other tools, I must highly recommend this Seki Edge scissor.</li>

            <li> The scissors are very &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34;, and easily cut tough nails.</li>
            <li> I have thick thumbs and this eliminates the ring issue plus the spring action makes it easy to squeeze and snip.</li>
            <li> out of the box) are superior to the scissors mentioned above in cutting performance.</li>
            <li> these scissors easily cut tough nails</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, after repeated, fruitless attempts using other tools, I must highly recommend this Seki Edge scissor.</li>
            <li> My daughter, also, feels comfortable cutting baby&#x27;s nails now and has started recommending it to her friends who are also new mothers.</li>
            <li> I have palsy in one hand that makes the use of a clipper difficult, but these scissors are easy for me to use.</li>
            <li> If you have medium size or large hands, these clippers are hard to</li>
            <li> Since I have it handy, I use it for lots of things - cutting open the little packets of Crystal Lite, for instance.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without scissors like this for so long!</li>
            <li> sharp enough, etc.</li>
            <li> I will be buying a second set and putting them away in case item is discontinued down the road.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Sally Hansen&amp;#34; scissors were made in a Middle Eastern country and do cost less</li>
            <li> for tough toenails, but...I don&#x27;t have the control I had with the regular old nail scissors.</li>
            <li> I also jammed them (closed) into the sealing tape on a package to get started tearing it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of nail scissors &amp; clippers for toe nails (especially the thick big toe).  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thin and sharp, with a gently curving, slip-proof micro-serrated blade.</li>
            <li> I have very tough toenails and the normal clippers literally send pains through my feet when the edges suddenly cut through the nail and slam into each other.</li>
            <li> but I have difficulty reaching my toes due to a hip issue and it is my fault that I did not order scissors with a longer handle.</li>
            <li> OMG, these things are sharp.  </li>
            <li> It was sharp out of the box.</li>
            <li> The user has to be VERY careful when using these on thicker or misshapen nails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp so be careful when using it.</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers have mentioned not much of a curve so cutting a curve on a really thick nail will take a couple straight cuts first to thin nail out for the final cut.  </li>
            <li> just as sharp as they said; scissors are a little small for people with big hands</li>
            <li> Scissors are very sharp.</li>
            <li> use.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li> The edges are smoother than with my previous nail scissors.  </li>
            <li> It allows close to the skin precise cutting without causing an unwanted cut where you didn&#x27;t mean to.</li>
            <li> minor negative is that the handles are made of plastic.</li>
            <li> It is a little bulky than need be.  </li>
            <li> When I used to cut my toenails with clippers, my hands had trouble finding the nail edge, and my feet wouldn&#x27;t stay still, which was a problem.  </li>
            <li> I have ingrown toe nails and finding a pair of cutters that don&#x27;t maim me is not easy.  </li>
            <li> And, they are so sharp you can cut a very very small amount off, if need be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other things for cutting toenails, none of which were satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I figure they are supposed to cut thick nails, so a little plastic won&#x27;t hurt them, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to.  </li>
            <li> I have always used the small regular-looking scissors.  </li>
            <li> The handles are too small &amp; provide inadequate leverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your toenails are average to tough, these work.  </li>
            <li> Took me hardly any time at all to cut my nails.  </li>
            <li> is kinda thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just chalking it up to that my nails are too thick.</li>
            <li> If they&#x27;re like bone shards or as thick as a dinner plate use your head.</li>
            <li> I have thick nails with psoriasis under them.  </li>
            <li> This is the 5th product I&#x27;ve tried to trim thick toenails.  </li>
            <li> Even works well on thick toenails.  </li>
            <li> [of course, I&#x27;m assuming that thick toe nails have been filed over (or sanded) beforehand].</li>
            <li> These scissors are not much good for my situation.  </li>
            <li> had my first pedicure a year ago, and I was very disappointed that I did not find it relaxing at all.  </li>
            <li> The tips of the blades are too weak &amp; the blades separate at the tips when cutting, so cutting must be done near the hinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be so dumb and expect this to work.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look it, but they are tough.  </li>
            <li> These scissors on Amazon.com were the closest that I could find to ones that had broken, so I ordered them for my mother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a tool that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune and does what it says, but this one does.</li>
            <li> It was awkward, for both myself and the person doing it -</li>
            <li> she was probably afraid I was going to kick her, as was I.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just finished cutting my toenails with the Seki scissors.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for toe nail cutting.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wanted a quality tool for trimming toenails and this product is too light-weight for the job. Should suffice for light finger nails but clippers are fine for that job.</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to cut my toenails.  The implement definitely works better than using regular toenail clippers, and better than the long handled toenail scissors I tried.  However, these scissors have a couple of drawbacks: 1) they leave a semi-rough edge on the nails, that needs to be filed off; 2) they work best on straight thin toenails.  The user has to be VERY careful when using these on thicker or misshapen nails.  Although there is a slight curve to the blades on these scissors, it is not quite enough to easily cut some toenails.  Their cutting action is more like nibbling away at the nail with the blade, than instead of making a clean cut.  I will continue to use them until I find something better for my thick damaged nails.</li>
            <li> Well made and easy to use.  It is a little bulky than need be.  However, it is probably necessary.  A folding handle may be more convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> Does a great job with hard nails and acrylic nails. Works easily and cuts evenly...this product is worth purchasing.  Exceptional value!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a tool that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune and does what it says, but this one does. Older people need tools that will allow them to cut without damaging skin. This is a very good tool for cutting toenails for those with arthritis. It allows close to the skin precise cutting without causing an unwanted cut where you didn&#x27;t mean to. This works great and would highly recommend to others looking for something that really does the job.</li>
            <li> these scissors easily cut tough nails</li>
            <li> I have bought several pair of these toenail scissors for family and friends but never tried them myself until today.  I am in shock.  Now I see why they wanted them!  They are so easy to use, much easier than I thought.  Just sailed across my toenails and the nail on my big toe is kinda thick but these cut really nice.  Took me hardly any time at all to cut my nails.  I highly recommend them and will be giving more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love these scissors.  I have thick thumbs and this eliminates the ring issue plus the spring action makes it easy to squeeze and snip.</li>
            <li> Best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Easy to grasp and does a fantastic job.  Would have given it 6 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Works perfect!  Cuts easily and I can now do both hands without struggling as I seem to have much better control with this design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other things for cutting toenails, none of which were satisfactory. This one really works! of there&#x27;s a better one, I&#x27;d like to know about it.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail scissors ever.  I even give these out as gifts.  You will never use anything else.  I wish I invented them.</li>
            <li> I have very tough toenails and the normal clippers literally send pains through my feet when the edges suddenly cut through the nail and slam into each other. These are a godsend and I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Best nail cutting scissors ever!  Perfect size too.</li>
            <li> Great Quality, good design, easy to use, Sharp scissors. fits in your hand and gives good control with little effort required.</li>
            <li> Would not go through my toenail or even my fingernails. I&#x27;m just chalking it up to that my nails are too thick.</li>
            <li> If your toenails are average to tough, these work.  If they&#x27;re like bone shards or as thick as a dinner plate use your head. Don&#x27;t be so dumb and expect this to work. Get wire cutters at Home Depot</li>
            <li> Scissors are very sharp. Are also light weight but seem to be good quality. Would have given scissors 5 stars but I have difficulty reaching my toes due to a hip issue and it is my fault that I did not order scissors with a longer handle.</li>
            <li> Cut cleanly and nicely.</li>
            <li> I have thick nails with psoriasis under them.  These scissors are not much good for my situation.  For most people with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toe nails which are not thick they should work fine.  For trimming acrylic nails I believe these scissors will do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the Seki Edge Ss-202 Professional which are more suitable for thick nails.</li>
            <li> Good for hand nails, but not easy to cut toe nails, unless they are very very long. I think it is more because of the shape of the blade, not for the blade itself, which is great.</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of nail scissors &amp; clippers for toe nails (especially the thick big toe).  Nothing I&#x27;ve tried comes close to these.  As some other reviewers have mentioned not much of a curve so cutting a curve on a really thick nail will take a couple straight cuts first to thin nail out for the final cut.  I will be buying a second set and putting them away in case item is discontinued down the road. Try these first!!</li>
            <li> If you have medium size or large hands, these clippers are hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are very sharp. I expect that they will remain so. Good product for small hands.</li>
            <li> These cut so easily and are slim/comfortable to use.  I prefer them so much over a standard clipper.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Cuts the nail rather than clipping it. Much easier to use than my clippers</li>
            <li> My 89 year old mother had a pair of nail scissors that she loved. Unfortunately, they broke after many years. I looked everywhere for another pair of nail scissors like the ones she had, but I couldn&#x27;t find them. These scissors on Amazon.com were the closest that I could find to ones that had broken, so I ordered them for my mother. She LOVES them!!!! She said they are much better than the ones she originally had. She even told me that I should order them for myself, which I intend to do.</li>
            <li> OMG, these things are sharp.  They are fantastic for my toenails, but I also use them to open the blister packaging on CVS&#x27;s generic allergy medicine.  I figure they are supposed to cut thick nails, so a little plastic won&#x27;t hurt them, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to.  I also jammed them (closed) into the sealing tape on a package to get started tearing it.  Since I have it handy, I use it for lots of things - cutting open the little packets of Crystal Lite, for instance.  It seems that I&#x27;m always using it.  Especially good for toenails, though.  There is a really cool spring mechanism that pops them open after you cut - in the picture it looks like a wire on the inside of the handle.  You flip that up toward the point, and it&#x27;s the spring.  I am very happy with this purchase and will look at the other things by the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased this kind of nail scissors before. I have always used the small regular-looking scissors.  Reviews were pretty swell, so I took a chance.  First time I used it, I cut my skin and made a boo-boo.  It doesn&#x27;t get as close nor is it as easy to get in to tight areas as I thought it would be.  Maybe I am just inept, but if you have to take a course in how to use a tool to cut your toenails, it&#x27;s probably not the best item for you.  It sure wasn&#x27;t a good investment for me.</li>
            <li> Nice quality and very precise.</li>
            <li> These nail scissors are very well made. They&#x27;re thin and sharp, with a gently curving, slip-proof micro-serrated blade. Grips instead of finger-holes is the way to go. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without scissors like this for so long!</li>
            <li> Great scissors, the best I have tried.  They are very sharp, but very easy for my hands to use.  I love these.  When I used to cut my toenails with clippers, my hands had trouble finding the nail edge, and my feet wouldn&#x27;t stay still, which was a problem.  But with the Seki Edge Nail Scissors,  they did exactly what I was hoping.  They allow me to do a simply thing, quickly and safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my first pedicure a year ago, and I was very disappointed that I did not find it relaxing at all.  My feet did not want to be touched.  It was awkward, for both myself and the person doing it - she was probably afraid I was going to kick her, as was I.  Very stressful  I gave her a huge tip, lol.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace my 20 plus year old pair of nail scissors that were not working right any more. These work OK: sharp enough, etc. for tough toenails, but...I don&#x27;t have the control I had with the regular old nail scissors. Maybe it just takes practice to get the feel of this style clipper. After several months, I do like them better than I did originally.</li>
            <li> Very good scissors, and I am something of an affecionado. I buy lots of them and pay attention to good ones. This one isn&#x27;t the very best, but it&#x27;s also not in the same price range as the very best. For it&#x27;s price range, it&#x27;s excellent. It cuts crisply without any wiggle. Even at the very tip, it&#x27;s well aligned and functions correctly. It was sharp out of the box. The spring functions perfectly. The black handle isn&#x27;t the most aesthetically elegant design but it&#x27;s comfortable and solid. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Good product.  It&#x27;s very sharp so be careful when using it.</li>
            <li> This is the 5th product I&#x27;ve tried to trim thick toenails.  It is the ONLY one that worked.  I had two problems of a user friendly nature:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The handles are too small &amp; provide inadequate leverage.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The tips of the blades are too weak &amp; the blades separate at the tips when cutting, so cutting must be done near the hinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Nonetheless, after repeated, fruitless attempts using other tools, I must highly recommend this Seki Edge scissor.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality &amp; Well made, sharp, work well on tough nails&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend them &amp; will purchase another pair</li>
            <li> My mom had a pair of these scissors.  They are great.  Found them on Amazon so ordered some for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend and buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt these are very well made and much sharper than any I&#x27;ve seen before.  Even works well on thick toenails.  The shape of the blade isn&#x27;t as curved as some have commented, but I like the design and wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
            <li> and I just bought another set for my daughter. Not only do I use them myself, but these are the only scissors that I feel comfortable using to cut a child&#x27;s or infant&#x27;s nails. They are so easy to handle while holding a little hand or foot that you feel confident that you wont accidentally cut or pinch something other than a nail. The sharp point is perfect for reaching in to pull those fine and tiny little toenails that grow downwards. My daughter, also, feels comfortable cutting baby&#x27;s nails now and has started recommending it to her friends who are also new mothers.</li>
            <li> In 2013 I bought a pair of &amp;#34;3 Swords&amp;#34; nickel plated steel nail scissors(which are made in Germany), they were supposed to be my main toe-nail scissors with a pair of &amp;#34;Sally Hansen&amp;#34; nail scissors(purchased earlier) as &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it is 2014 and I found myself looking for better scissors within the same price range($10-15). The &amp;#34;Sally Hansen&amp;#34; scissors were made in a Middle Eastern country and do cost less but they were not entirely what I wanted(that is why I bought the &amp;#34;3 Swords&amp;#34; scissors - already reviewed both).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these &amp;#34;Seki Edge Acrylic Nail Scissors&amp;#34; and can say that these scissors(new out of the box) are superior to the scissors mentioned above in cutting performance. They fit my hand(I am a guy with &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; size hands) perfectly. I use them mostly to cut my toenails(which are not made of acrylic material but did break a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; pair of scissors), I also use them on my hands(but I prefer &amp;#34;clippers&amp;#34; here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only minor negative is that the handles are made of plastic. Important to note these are much larger than &amp;#34;cuticle&amp;#34; scissors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just finished cutting my toenails with the Seki scissors.  What a difference!  They are way easier to hold than the kind you have to put your fingers through, so you have a better grip and aiming ability.  The edges are smoother than with my previous nail scissors.  Getting older and fatter does not help when cutting your own toenails, and I&#x27;m glad I found a better alternative to inaccurate short- and long-handled nail scissors and nail clippers.  The thoughtfully designed Seki scissors are kinder in every way.</li>
            <li> I love these have hard nails and these work well.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer. It cuts much better than a nail clipper. I have palsy in one hand that makes the use of a clipper difficult, but these scissors are easy for me to use.</li>
            <li> Nail clippers are not something I think about a lot, but when I lost the good nail scissors I had, I realized how many bad options there are out there.  I bought these based on a recommendation just like this and have never looked back.  As nail scissors, they trim with authority and precision through even the thickest nails.  They also fill in nicely as utility scissors in the bathroom vanity for opening packages and cutting bandages.  Compared to the BS alternatives I tried before this, these are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This a very good product for those who have trouble using regular scissors. You do not have to apply any force to it and it cuts toe nails easily [of course, I&#x27;m assuming that thick toe nails have been filed over (or sanded) beforehand]. Very recommendable for arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> This product is as claimed. The scissors are very &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34;, and easily cut tough nails. The scissors are comfortable to hold, easy to use, and I never feel like I am going to break it while applying enough pressure to cut thick nails. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> just as sharp as they said; scissors are a little small for people with big hands</li>
            <li> Did not work on my toenails so sent them back.</li>
            <li> Hey, these things cut the most stubborn, thick, nails known to mankind. And, they are so sharp you can cut a very very small amount off, if need be. You may find though the need to file the nail a bit afterward. In ending, these are by far the BEST nail scissors I have ever owned, they are worth every penny. Easy to handle, so very smooth to use.</li>
            <li> I have ingrown toe nails and finding a pair of cutters that don&#x27;t maim me is not easy.  These are fantastic.  They get into the corners and snap!  They don&#x27;t look it, but they are tough.  I am hording my pair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for toe nail cutting.  It is very sharp and easy to use and works just as I wanted.</li>
            <li> These are the very best nail scissors for toenails and are especially useful if you have an ingrown tonail.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Easy to work with</li>
