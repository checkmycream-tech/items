            <li>The absolute best product! !</li>
            <li>I love this product, I use it once a week and it leaves my hair looking very healthy and vey shinny.</li>
            <li>Then I proceeded to rinse with cool water not washing or conditioning hair and the results were astounding!</li>
            <li>This stuff is like butter, feels so smooth on your hair, and smells really good too.</li>
            <li>Good scent that make me happy, and bring me a soft, bright and smooth hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased one container in J.C. Penney&#x27;s Salon, loved the way it made my damaged hair feel, the healthy way it looked and the wonderful, clean fragrance it left in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>u guys would love it to get it rite now believe me</li>
            <li>but I found that my $8 hair mask works better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment, great conditioner.</li>
            <li>Great product, it really made a difference on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I got it from Salon Supply, and it was the authentic product.</li>
            <li>The only reason its not a 5 is because i need more time to determine if its the best masque yet</li>
            <li>I love using this product and wish I could use it more than just twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;BUY</li>
            <li>Il love it in fact.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff I use it twice a week</li>
            <li>and I love that stuff, which brought me to ordering this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the better ones out there.</li>
            <li>The longer you leave it in the better it works.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;It games and gives shine at the same time.</li>
            <li>and then some:)</li>
            <li>Deep conditioner is excellent for color treated hair.</li>

            <li>I love this mask I have curly hair</li>
            <li>I love this masque .</li>
            <li>Love it .</li>
            <li>I love how this stuff feels when I put it on in the shower.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this stuff....</li>
            <li>I ordered this product with the hopes that I&#x27;d be receiving an authentic product.</li>
            <li>If you purchase this product here on Amazon, be sure the seller is selling an authentic product.</li>
            <li>What could be better?</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;going to buy some more :)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to order this with so many pros&amp;cons to this item.</li>
            <li>It works :)</li>
            <li>This stuff is okay -</li>
            <li>and this seems to make it more frizzy in the end...</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this masque.  </li>
            <li>:) Just a note: leave it in your hair longer than the instructions tell you to.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, my homemade hair mask works a lot better, and is worlds cheaper.</li>
            <li>I just mix 3/4 olive oil and 1/4 lemon juice, and i leave it on for about 30min, and the results are way better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>It has grown and become so healthy.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for two years, but I feel that the one on the Macadamia website works better.</li>
            <li>Is this better than most hair masks?</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I will be able to tell after I use it.</li>
            <li>I love this masque, I love this brand.</li>
            <li>Even after switching to a better shampoo and conditioner, it was not getting better.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner so ordered another..</li>
            <li>Smells phenomenal.</li>
            <li>And like most 30 year olds,  I have bought thousands of products.</li>
            <li>and I have found better masques for under $5.</li>
            <li>All my frizz is gone :)</li>
            <li>I bought this as a recommendation from one my favorite YouTubers (AllThatGlitters21: Elle Fowler).</li>
            <li>It may be because I&#x27;m use to it or it could be a formula change, I do still use it because I absolutely love the smell</li>
            <li>I had good comments at the first use.</li>
            <li>, I even thought there was a pretty good bit in there.</li>
            <li>that being said I needed a deep conditioner to help my locks...and this is amazing!!  </li>
            <li>Totally worth my 20 bucks!!</li>
            <li>This is the best product for dry hair</li>
            <li>and I was able to detangle my hair easy.  </li>
            <li>bought this product as a nice weekly deep conditioner, and it works great for that.</li>
            <li>Really love the tropical scent, makes my hair smell so good, and the scent lingers for a whole day.</li>
            <li>It is amazing and worth every penny</li>
            <li>I literally cannot stop touching my hair, its so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Let me just get right to the point here... if you want your hair to smell and feel amazing all the time then buy this product.</li>
            <li>rinse masque, easy, easy, easy.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, and it lasts all day, and my hair is soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>, feels soft, looks better and it also smells so good.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair soft and smelling good :)  </li>
            <li>Very good at detangling long hair, makes it easy to brush.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft afterwards and The smell is amazing!</li>
            <li>I used it with a combination of the macadamia natural oil leave in cream and this stuff was amazing!</li>
            <li>Used it once so far , hair was smooth light and tamed , smells great .</li>
            <li>Rinse with cool water for better result.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to see results from first use, so I used it over a number of weeks and honestly, I didn&#x27;t see any change whatsoever in my hair.</li>
            <li>But normally I have to use the blow dryer to get good results.</li>
            <li>I got this sample from Birch Box and it is hands down the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and makes my hair silky and soft!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m ready to buy more!</li>
            <li>Love it soo much!!</li>
            <li>When I woke up this morning my hair was so SHINY and SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>What a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>(im a  hispanic female)it has never felt this light.</li>
            <li>I found silicones and &amp;#34;Cetearyl Alcohol&amp;#34;, which is a cheap ingredient that makes hair look like it&#x27;s been hydrated, but in reality is just masking the problem (hair &amp;#34;masque&amp;#34;&#x3D; MASKing the problem).</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>Shipping was free).</li>
            <li>This deep repair masque is great.  </li>
            <li>And it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>My hair is so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I like aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle available in just about any store.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look and feel great instantly upon drying.</li>
            <li>but when you use the product, you will understand what you are actually getting: a great hair product that strengthens and cleanses hair, defrizzes and really fortifies the hairs individually making all of your hair in the best shape.</li>
            <li>it smells nice (though VERY strong) and does condition your hair; however, I don&#x27;t think it is really as deep of a conditioner as I need.</li>
            <li>its worth it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the original macadamia b/c</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>They must take the original product out and just dump some off brand junk in the container.  </li>
            <li>or I&#x27;m pretty sure it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I wake up to soft knot free, healthy looking hair!</li>
            <li>This would be best for the very damaged, very dry hair type.</li>
            <li>i quickly tryed  the hair mask for 7mins and it made my hair so light weight</li>
            <li>This product is great for really dry hair, backed up with the oil.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for dry hair.</li>
            <li>so I use it as my regular conditioner and it leaves my hair super soft and smelling delicious.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special about this hair mask.</li>
            <li>Light fragrance LOVE IT and would highly recommend</li>
            <li>The smell is heavenly, it leaves my hair so soft and smelling so amazing.</li>
            <li>Incredibly nourishing fit the hair.only need to use a small portion.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing, and it completely transforms your hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my color treated hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>people are constantly telling me i smell good, but its the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love it, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this product! :)</li>
            <li>The Deep Repair Masque is a really good quality hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li>great for dry, damaged hair!!  </li>
            <li>After the first time I used it (for way longer than the recommended time), my hair was so soft (which is pretty amazing considering what I had done to it)!</li>
            <li>Actually the entire line is great!</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Ita the best deep deep conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love that it is has natural ingredients, and it makes my hair silky smooth every time I use it.</li>
            <li>:) Highly recommended</li>
            <li>You might be able to fool new buyers but you&#x27;re not fooling me.</li>
            <li>After using this hair masque, my hair looks so healthy and full, feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>I just ran out of my first container of the deep repair masque and it was so good</li>
            <li>It feels like the real thing to me!!</li>
            <li>And that was just the first time using it!</li>
            <li>love the smell and hair was so soft after every used!&lt;br /&gt;i usd mask plus argan oil, it works grest together!</li>
            <li>Love this product hard to find where I stay great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>So far, I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and feels so healthy now.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, but it smells more fruity and not really like a macadamian nut.</li>
            <li>I love this product it has my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I am probably going to be one of the only ones who can honestly say I don&#x27;t like this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I shall resort to making my own at home that actually work.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>however it is worth to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice hair mask, but Aussie 3 Minute Miracle doe the same thing for like 4 dollars.</li>
            <li>It now feels soft and better than when I was in my twenties.</li>
            <li>I leave it in a couple minutes in the shower and after hair is sooo soft and healthy feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week and the I love the results; my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the price tag?</li>
            <li>and I wish it had more naturally ingredients.</li>
            <li>The cost is well worth it</li>
            <li>The smell I expected was some nice clean scent product</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>She was right on the money.</li>
            <li>but this product delivers the right balance of softness and strength.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry hair, color treated hair,  brings back a smooth silky balance.</li>
            <li>I did keep since it&#x27;s such a pretty container for the mixing of my own homemade hair masque.</li>
            <li>Best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li>this is really good for dry hair it really works its starts to show about 2 weeks</li>
            <li>There is plenty of product inside the tub, and you don&#x27;t need very much at all to coat your hair.</li>
            <li>only thing to make sure is that after you put it in, when you go to rinse it out, rinse for a longgggg time.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I just started using it once a week for the last 4 weeks and my hair is more manageable</li>
            <li>Saw results the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time today and as soon as I put it in my hair</li>
            <li>love the macadamia deep repair masque.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works SO well at repairing any damage that my stylist constantly remarks how healthy my hair is.</li>
            <li>I purchase this on a regular basis and use it about once a week to keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ordered this hair masque and noticed the difference in my first use itself.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty goodI</li>
            <li>really earlyand if they definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthier overall :)</li>
            <li>I use this once a week and only keep it on for 10 minutes at the most.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Deep Repair Masque and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this Deep Repair masque!!!</li>
            <li>Overall I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this nonstop for more than 6 months now as a deep conditioner everytime</li>
            <li>the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I have very porous hair, and this help keep it calm.</li>
            <li>This product has absolutely saved my hair!</li>
            <li>i purchased this masque and i waged my hair the next week, I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>(Amazon&#x27;s price is much nicer than Ulta&#x27;s!)</li>
            <li>I have already recommended this product to several friends, and bought one more for myself.</li>
            <li>The first time I ever used this product, I was so taken aback by how creamy it was.</li>
            <li>The lovely, feminine smell lingers throughout the entire next day and my hair has never been better.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but it smelled exactly like it.</li>
            <li>I do have ethnic hair which is more coarse and curly than caucasian locks</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and sometimes it makes my hair feel silky and restores a beautiful pale blonde back to it.</li>
            <li>Soft and shinny!!!!</li>
            <li>Long lasting fragrance in your hair, isn&#x27;t worth all the hype though moisturizing wise.</li>
            <li>So after a month of using the macadamia conditioner and surrendering my love of the flat iron</li>
            <li>Since I decided to go all natural 4 years ago I have learned a lot of ways how to deal with this fragil but unique hair.  </li>
            <li>The size is pretty good fpor the price, considering you&#x27;re only supposed to deep condition once a week</li>
            <li>And I only use this once a week (because i usually only wash my hair once a week) and it helps with keeping my hair smooth, but make sure you leave it in for the right amount of time (7 min)</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft, shiny and silky, it smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t require heat to work.</li>
            <li>It will last you a good two months depending on hair length (mine is  just above shoulder).</li>
            <li>THIS ITEM IS NOT FAKE, I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL THE MACADAMIA NATURAL OIL LOVERS!!!</li>
            <li>I have use different deep hair conditioner before like Neutrogena triple moisture and Dr. Miracle deep conditioner, but Macadamia is by far the best out of the three.</li>
            <li>My hair is so dry from so many time coloring.</li>
            <li>1st use and my hair was super soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of unpredictable when I use it.</li>
            <li>I live this product!!</li>
            <li>I love it, I have very dry hair</li>
            <li>Overall I truly think that this product makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and helps my dead ends.</li>
            <li>This has really worked wonders.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have a combination of straight and wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be alarmed by the amount, because to get all your hair covered doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li>I use this once or twice a week because my hair is really damaged.</li>
            <li>Use a lot of it and let it stay on my hair much longer than it says.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks so much healthier after using this.</li>
            <li>the smell is amazinggg there has been comments about how much is in the container</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>and I have very damamged hair from bleach and heat</li>
            <li>The color and texture are different, and it smells cheap.</li>
            <li>I expected more judging off all the beauty guru reviews.</li>
            <li>Save your money and get the real thing.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really have a scent.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the real product.  </li>
            <li>The shipping of this product was supper fast, I think I got it in about two days after ordering it.</li>
            <li>I recommend using it as much as you want, but not at the roots.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product..</li>
            <li>Fast delievery.</li>
            <li>After one use I felt my hair was already so much softer.</li>
            <li>My jar is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very moistureized.</li>
            <li>and it made it so much softer.</li>
            <li>I knew this would be my go-to product forever when I was able to run a comb through my wet hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;r really do much for my kinky roots between relaxers.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>In doing this I created my own deep conditioner using this Deep repair masque in my mix</li>
            <li>My hair was becoming brittle and way too dry.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s phenomenal, other times not too much.</li>
            <li>from the first use my hair was soft manageable shiny and even helped with humidity!</li>
            <li>What I love about this and the other moroccan mask jar (aqua brown container) is that they dont make the hair sticky or oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I checked out amazon prices first, because if I were to buy this product elsewhere I would have paid well over $30.00 ( I paid a little over $15.00 for this conditioner.</li>
            <li>(I had two random strangers comment how great my hair smelled), and it made my hair shiny and super soft</li>
            <li>I dint hesitate to open the box right then and go take a shower!</li>
            <li>Since I loved the deep conditioner, I also began to use the shampoo as well as the lighter weight daily conditioner, in between weekly deep conditioning.  </li>
            <li>After years, I am able to just let my hair down and go out without styling my hair with an iron.</li>
            <li>I have had many and I mean many conditioners that cost a 1/4 of the cost that left my hair silkier.</li>
            <li>I was less than satisfied.</li>
            <li>After my first use I noticed a big difference on my hair, which I have to admit is pretty damaged.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase this particular product here on Amazon again.</li>
            <li>I was scared to order this because it&#x27;s main ingredients are naturals OILS</li>
            <li>My hair is mainly frizzy and this made a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>I highly  recommend  this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for just about any hair type.</li>
            <li>i HIGHLY reccommened this product.</li>
            <li>price may seem high now</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I use it with two other conditioners mixed, so I don&#x27;t know how it truly works on its own.</li>
            <li>and I just dab a little onto the bottom of my hair where it is the driest and have the most damages.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li>They could easily produce the container and fill it with a foreign substance.</li>
            <li>My hair is soooo much shinier and incredibly soft after using.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>I  had used many products and didn&#x27;t feel very hopeful, but I wet my hair and worked enough mask to coat and infuse it well.</li>
            <li>I could not hardly come it out</li>
            <li>So highly to be recommended whom like to be very young in any ages</li>
            <li>I put my hair through a lot last year with highlights &amp; decided to give my hair a rest, but it still looked dry &amp; not too healthy until using this.</li>
            <li>I get highlights in my hair on a consistent basis, and sometimes that can leave my hair pretty dry / damaged.</li>
            <li>It reduces the frizz when I blow dry my hair, and gives it an overall healthy feel and look.</li>
            <li>This product is my new &amp;#34;hair salon in a jar.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It did not have a new seal.</li>
            <li>but I feel it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>leaves your hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>Hair feels very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and silky:  </li>
            <li>made my hair feel so hydrated and shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>Its not heavy or filmy at all!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I got a compliment today saying how soft my hair is!</li>
            <li>I can tell that this is working, my hair feels so soft after using this!</li>
            <li>This deep repair works when I first used it</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t notice any big difference between this and my regular, everyday good quality conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have mixed curly hair that tends to become frizzy and dry easily.</li>
            <li>At first, it came very dry and didn&#x27;t really look like the product</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel nice and soft and reduces the amount of little frizzies I get from letting my hair air dry.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and a little bit seems to go a long way for my long hair.</li>
            <li>but so far this seems to be doing something positive with my hair so a definite re-buy!</li>
            <li>and i can only imagine i will be back to normal after a few more months, thanks to this masque.</li>
            <li>but this was pure white.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4c hair</li>
            <li>and after I rinsed it out, my hair is soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;ve been using this product and</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft manageable</li>
            <li>so it really does last.</li>
            <li>I like the way it coats the hair and how soft my hair is after use.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair really soft.</li>
            <li>I will give it 5 stars because my hair looks and feels soft and I will buy it again</li>
            <li>IT MAKE MY HAIR SOFT AND SHINE</li>
            <li>My hair are soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have natural AA 4a hair, so this stuff is like moisture gold for me.</li>
            <li>my hair was so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>makes my hair so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>, do not waste your money...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s naturally pearl cream</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel I had it long enough to give a full review on</li>
            <li>, i wasted my money, i prefer use any regular repair masque ship and mayne will work better than this.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>I spent 20$ on this, which I would not have mind if they had delivered the right product.</li>
            <li>My hair was so dry after putting highlights in my hair for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for my sister because it works great on my hair, but this product is fake!</li>
            <li>I loved it but now as a few years have past</li>
            <li>The repair masque does what it says it does, revitalizes your hair, makes it smooth &amp; slick....</li>
            <li>my curls are finally looking a bit normal again.</li>
            <li>I wear 18inch extensions in my hair for months at a time and the ONLY reason my hair continues to look brand new is because of this product.</li>
            <li>It would look dry or gets very frizzy.</li>
            <li>I blow dry it straight, so it takes a lot heat, which in turns damages my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was left incredibly soft, nourished and silky with a natural shine.</li>
            <li>The product she got was white and the real one is a milky yellow...</li>
            <li>It is the real thing and would definitely try it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I have to hide it from my sister as she is obsessed with how soft and nice smelling my hair</li>
            <li>this one was more white than the goldish thick cream i was used to.</li>
            <li>Not as expected, greasy and did not have any positive effect on my hair, been using it for 6 weeks</li>
            <li>I put a small amount on and left it in,  and my hair is soft and 90% frizz free.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky for a couple of days until my next wash.</li>
            <li>Ok but not great.</li>
            <li>Also, do a longer soaking once a week or so for at least half hour with a bag over your head to keep it warm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted, it DID make my hair look semi decent, but only until the next washing, which proved the fact that it wasn&#x27;t actually repairing my hair over time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s downright silky after I first wash it out in the shower, and I&#x27;m considering using it as a daily conditioner because my other ones just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>It lasts long because you only have to use a little bit of it at a time and it leaves your hair feeling fabulous</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to people who have dry hair because of too much coloring especially if their hair was damage due to bleaching.</li>
            <li>I have thick, coarse Asian hair that I color and my 10 years of coloring have finally caught up to me with my most recent highlights.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product I noticed the difference right away, I have long thin, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I have medium to soft texture wavy dry color treated hair.</li>
            <li>; The shipping was incredibly fast, the price was right, and there was absolutely nothing fake about this product!</li>
            <li>This will definitely weigh hair down if you don&#x27;t really need the hydration.  </li>
            <li>The product I just received is pure white not smooth cream</li>
            <li>I searched all over the place looking for other possible deep conditioners that may just be my new holy grail, but found none that were in my budget.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is good especially if you have really bad damage hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Then I proceeded to rinse with cool water not washing or conditioning hair and the results were astounding!</li>
            <li> This stuff is like butter, feels so smooth on your hair, and smells really good too.</li>
            <li> Good scent that make me happy, and bring me a soft, bright and smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased one container in J.C. Penney&#x27;s Salon, loved the way it made my damaged hair feel, the healthy way it looked and the wonderful, clean fragrance it left in my hair.  </li>

            <li> I got it from Salon Supply, and it was the authentic product.</li>
            <li> The only reason its not a 5 is because i need more time to determine if its the best masque yet</li>
            <li> I love using this product and wish I could use it more than just twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;BUY</li>
            <li> Il love it in fact.</li>

            <li> and she&#x27;s very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;It games and gives shine at the same time.</li>

            <li> I love how this stuff feels when I put it on in the shower.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff....</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with the hopes that I&#x27;d be receiving an authentic product.</li>
            <li> If you purchase this product here on Amazon, be sure the seller is selling an authentic product.</li>
            <li> What could be better?</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;going to buy some more :)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to order this with so many pros&amp;cons to this item.</li>
            <li> It works :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay -</li>
            <li> and this seems to make it more frizzy in the end...</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this masque.  </li>
            <li> :) Just a note: leave it in your hair longer than the instructions tell you to.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, my homemade hair mask works a lot better, and is worlds cheaper.</li>
            <li> I just mix 3/4 olive oil and 1/4 lemon juice, and i leave it on for about 30min, and the results are way better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> It has grown and become so healthy.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for two years, but I feel that the one on the Macadamia website works better.</li>
            <li> Is this better than most hair masks?</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I will be able to tell after I use it.</li>
            <li> I love this masque, I love this brand.</li>
            <li> Even after switching to a better shampoo and conditioner, it was not getting better.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner so ordered another..</li>
            <li> Smells phenomenal.</li>
            <li> And like most 30 year olds,  I have bought thousands of products.</li>
            <li> and I have found better masques for under $5.</li>
            <li> All my frizz is gone :)</li>
            <li> I bought this as a recommendation from one my favorite YouTubers (AllThatGlitters21: Elle Fowler).</li>
            <li> It may be because I&#x27;m use to it or it could be a formula change, I do still use it because I absolutely love the smell</li>
            <li> I had good comments at the first use.</li>
            <li> , I even thought there was a pretty good bit in there.</li>
            <li> that being said I needed a deep conditioner to help my locks...and this is amazing!!  </li>
            <li> Totally worth my 20 bucks!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product for dry hair</li>
            <li> and I was able to detangle my hair easy.  </li>
            <li> bought this product as a nice weekly deep conditioner, and it works great for that.</li>
            <li> Really love the tropical scent, makes my hair smell so good, and the scent lingers for a whole day.</li>
            <li> It is amazing and worth every penny</li>
            <li> I literally cannot stop touching my hair, its so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Let me just get right to the point here... if you want your hair to smell and feel amazing all the time then buy this product.</li>
            <li> rinse masque, easy, easy, easy.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, and it lasts all day, and my hair is soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> , feels soft, looks better and it also smells so good.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft and smelling good :)  </li>
            <li> Very good at detangling long hair, makes it easy to brush.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft afterwards and The smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> I used it with a combination of the macadamia natural oil leave in cream and this stuff was amazing!</li>
            <li> Used it once so far , hair was smooth light and tamed , smells great .</li>
            <li> Rinse with cool water for better result.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to see results from first use, so I used it over a number of weeks and honestly, I didn&#x27;t see any change whatsoever in my hair.</li>
            <li> But normally I have to use the blow dryer to get good results.</li>
            <li> I got this sample from Birch Box and it is hands down the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and makes my hair silky and soft!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m ready to buy more!</li>
            <li> Love it soo much!!</li>
            <li> When I woke up this morning my hair was so SHINY and SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> (im a  hispanic female)it has never felt this light.</li>
            <li> I found silicones and &amp;#34;Cetearyl Alcohol&amp;#34;, which is a cheap ingredient that makes hair look like it&#x27;s been hydrated, but in reality is just masking the problem (hair &amp;#34;masque&amp;#34;&#x3D; MASKing the problem).</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> Shipping was free).</li>
            <li> This deep repair masque is great.  </li>
            <li> And it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> My hair is so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I like aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle available in just about any store.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look and feel great instantly upon drying.</li>
            <li> but when you use the product, you will understand what you are actually getting: a great hair product that strengthens and cleanses hair, defrizzes and really fortifies the hairs individually making all of your hair in the best shape.</li>
            <li> it smells nice (though VERY strong) and does condition your hair; however, I don&#x27;t think it is really as deep of a conditioner as I need.</li>
            <li> its worth it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the original macadamia b/c</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> They must take the original product out and just dump some off brand junk in the container.  </li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m pretty sure it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I wake up to soft knot free, healthy looking hair!</li>
            <li> This would be best for the very damaged, very dry hair type.</li>
            <li> i quickly tryed  the hair mask for 7mins and it made my hair so light weight</li>
            <li> This product is great for really dry hair, backed up with the oil.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> so I use it as my regular conditioner and it leaves my hair super soft and smelling delicious.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special about this hair mask.</li>
            <li> Light fragrance LOVE IT and would highly recommend</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly, it leaves my hair so soft and smelling so amazing.</li>
            <li> Incredibly nourishing fit the hair.only need to use a small portion.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing, and it completely transforms your hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my color treated hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> people are constantly telling me i smell good, but its the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love it, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product! :)</li>
            <li> The Deep Repair Masque is a really good quality hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li> great for dry, damaged hair!!  </li>
            <li> After the first time I used it (for way longer than the recommended time), my hair was so soft (which is pretty amazing considering what I had done to it)!</li>
            <li> Actually the entire line is great!</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Ita the best deep deep conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love that it is has natural ingredients, and it makes my hair silky smooth every time I use it.</li>
            <li> :) Highly recommended</li>
            <li> You might be able to fool new buyers but you&#x27;re not fooling me.</li>
            <li> After using this hair masque, my hair looks so healthy and full, feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> I just ran out of my first container of the deep repair masque and it was so good</li>
            <li> It feels like the real thing to me!!</li>
            <li> And that was just the first time using it!</li>
            <li> love the smell and hair was so soft after every used!&lt;br /&gt;i usd mask plus argan oil, it works grest together!</li>
            <li> Love this product hard to find where I stay great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and feels so healthy now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, but it smells more fruity and not really like a macadamian nut.</li>
            <li> I love this product it has my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am probably going to be one of the only ones who can honestly say I don&#x27;t like this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I shall resort to making my own at home that actually work.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> however it is worth to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice hair mask, but Aussie 3 Minute Miracle doe the same thing for like 4 dollars.</li>
            <li> It now feels soft and better than when I was in my twenties.</li>
            <li> I leave it in a couple minutes in the shower and after hair is sooo soft and healthy feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week and the I love the results; my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the price tag?</li>
            <li> and I wish it had more naturally ingredients.</li>
            <li> The cost is well worth it</li>
            <li> The smell I expected was some nice clean scent product</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> She was right on the money.</li>
            <li> but this product delivers the right balance of softness and strength.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry hair, color treated hair,  brings back a smooth silky balance.</li>
            <li> I did keep since it&#x27;s such a pretty container for the mixing of my own homemade hair masque.</li>
            <li> Best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> this is really good for dry hair it really works its starts to show about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> There is plenty of product inside the tub, and you don&#x27;t need very much at all to coat your hair.</li>
            <li> only thing to make sure is that after you put it in, when you go to rinse it out, rinse for a longgggg time.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I just started using it once a week for the last 4 weeks and my hair is more manageable</li>
            <li> Saw results the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today and as soon as I put it in my hair</li>
            <li> love the macadamia deep repair masque.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works SO well at repairing any damage that my stylist constantly remarks how healthy my hair is.</li>
            <li> I purchase this on a regular basis and use it about once a week to keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair masque and noticed the difference in my first use itself.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty goodI</li>
            <li> really earlyand if they definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthier overall :)</li>
            <li> I use this once a week and only keep it on for 10 minutes at the most.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Deep Repair Masque and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this Deep Repair masque!!!</li>
            <li> Overall I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nonstop for more than 6 months now as a deep conditioner everytime</li>
            <li> the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I have very porous hair, and this help keep it calm.</li>
            <li> This product has absolutely saved my hair!</li>
            <li> i purchased this masque and i waged my hair the next week, I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> (Amazon&#x27;s price is much nicer than Ulta&#x27;s!)</li>
            <li> I have already recommended this product to several friends, and bought one more for myself.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever used this product, I was so taken aback by how creamy it was.</li>
            <li> The lovely, feminine smell lingers throughout the entire next day and my hair has never been better.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but it smelled exactly like it.</li>
            <li> I do have ethnic hair which is more coarse and curly than caucasian locks</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and sometimes it makes my hair feel silky and restores a beautiful pale blonde back to it.</li>
            <li> Soft and shinny!!!!</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance in your hair, isn&#x27;t worth all the hype though moisturizing wise.</li>
            <li> So after a month of using the macadamia conditioner and surrendering my love of the flat iron</li>
            <li> Since I decided to go all natural 4 years ago I have learned a lot of ways how to deal with this fragil but unique hair.  </li>
            <li> The size is pretty good fpor the price, considering you&#x27;re only supposed to deep condition once a week</li>
            <li> And I only use this once a week (because i usually only wash my hair once a week) and it helps with keeping my hair smooth, but make sure you leave it in for the right amount of time (7 min)</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft, shiny and silky, it smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t require heat to work.</li>
            <li> It will last you a good two months depending on hair length (mine is  just above shoulder).</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS NOT FAKE, I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL THE MACADAMIA NATURAL OIL LOVERS!!!</li>
            <li> I have use different deep hair conditioner before like Neutrogena triple moisture and Dr. Miracle deep conditioner, but Macadamia is by far the best out of the three.</li>
            <li> My hair is so dry from so many time coloring.</li>
            <li> 1st use and my hair was super soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of unpredictable when I use it.</li>
            <li> I live this product!!</li>
            <li> I love it, I have very dry hair</li>
            <li> Overall I truly think that this product makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and helps my dead ends.</li>
            <li> This has really worked wonders.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have a combination of straight and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed by the amount, because to get all your hair covered doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li> I use this once or twice a week because my hair is really damaged.</li>
            <li> Use a lot of it and let it stay on my hair much longer than it says.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks so much healthier after using this.</li>
            <li> the smell is amazinggg there has been comments about how much is in the container</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> and I have very damamged hair from bleach and heat</li>
            <li> The color and texture are different, and it smells cheap.</li>
            <li> I expected more judging off all the beauty guru reviews.</li>
            <li> Save your money and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really have a scent.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the real product.  </li>
            <li> The shipping of this product was supper fast, I think I got it in about two days after ordering it.</li>
            <li> I recommend using it as much as you want, but not at the roots.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product..</li>
            <li> Fast delievery.</li>
            <li> After one use I felt my hair was already so much softer.</li>
            <li> My jar is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very moistureized.</li>
            <li> and it made it so much softer.</li>
            <li> I knew this would be my go-to product forever when I was able to run a comb through my wet hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;r really do much for my kinky roots between relaxers.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> In doing this I created my own deep conditioner using this Deep repair masque in my mix</li>
            <li> My hair was becoming brittle and way too dry.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s phenomenal, other times not too much.</li>
            <li> from the first use my hair was soft manageable shiny and even helped with humidity!</li>
            <li> What I love about this and the other moroccan mask jar (aqua brown container) is that they dont make the hair sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I checked out amazon prices first, because if I were to buy this product elsewhere I would have paid well over $30.00 ( I paid a little over $15.00 for this conditioner.</li>
            <li> (I had two random strangers comment how great my hair smelled), and it made my hair shiny and super soft</li>
            <li> I dint hesitate to open the box right then and go take a shower!</li>
            <li> Since I loved the deep conditioner, I also began to use the shampoo as well as the lighter weight daily conditioner, in between weekly deep conditioning.  </li>
            <li> After years, I am able to just let my hair down and go out without styling my hair with an iron.</li>
            <li> I have had many and I mean many conditioners that cost a 1/4 of the cost that left my hair silkier.</li>
            <li> I was less than satisfied.</li>
            <li> After my first use I noticed a big difference on my hair, which I have to admit is pretty damaged.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this particular product here on Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I was scared to order this because it&#x27;s main ingredients are naturals OILS</li>
            <li> My hair is mainly frizzy and this made a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> I highly  recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for just about any hair type.</li>
            <li> i HIGHLY reccommened this product.</li>
            <li> price may seem high now</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I use it with two other conditioners mixed, so I don&#x27;t know how it truly works on its own.</li>
            <li> and I just dab a little onto the bottom of my hair where it is the driest and have the most damages.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li> They could easily produce the container and fill it with a foreign substance.</li>
            <li> My hair is soooo much shinier and incredibly soft after using.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> I  had used many products and didn&#x27;t feel very hopeful, but I wet my hair and worked enough mask to coat and infuse it well.</li>
            <li> I could not hardly come it out</li>
            <li> So highly to be recommended whom like to be very young in any ages</li>
            <li> I put my hair through a lot last year with highlights &amp; decided to give my hair a rest, but it still looked dry &amp; not too healthy until using this.</li>
            <li> I get highlights in my hair on a consistent basis, and sometimes that can leave my hair pretty dry / damaged.</li>
            <li> It reduces the frizz when I blow dry my hair, and gives it an overall healthy feel and look.</li>
            <li> This product is my new &amp;#34;hair salon in a jar.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It did not have a new seal.</li>
            <li> but I feel it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> leaves your hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Hair feels very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and silky:  </li>
            <li> made my hair feel so hydrated and shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> Its not heavy or filmy at all!</li>
            <li> /&gt;So worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I got a compliment today saying how soft my hair is!</li>
            <li> I can tell that this is working, my hair feels so soft after using this!</li>
            <li> This deep repair works when I first used it</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t notice any big difference between this and my regular, everyday good quality conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have mixed curly hair that tends to become frizzy and dry easily.</li>
            <li> At first, it came very dry and didn&#x27;t really look like the product</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel nice and soft and reduces the amount of little frizzies I get from letting my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent and a little bit seems to go a long way for my long hair.</li>
            <li> but so far this seems to be doing something positive with my hair so a definite re-buy!</li>
            <li> and i can only imagine i will be back to normal after a few more months, thanks to this masque.</li>
            <li> but this was pure white.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4c hair</li>
            <li> and after I rinsed it out, my hair is soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;ve been using this product and</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft manageable</li>
            <li> so it really does last.</li>
            <li> I like the way it coats the hair and how soft my hair is after use.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I will give it 5 stars because my hair looks and feels soft and I will buy it again</li>
            <li> IT MAKE MY HAIR SOFT AND SHINE</li>
            <li> My hair are soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have natural AA 4a hair, so this stuff is like moisture gold for me.</li>
            <li> my hair was so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> makes my hair so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> , do not waste your money...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s naturally pearl cream</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel I had it long enough to give a full review on</li>
            <li> , i wasted my money, i prefer use any regular repair masque ship and mayne will work better than this.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> I spent 20$ on this, which I would not have mind if they had delivered the right product.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry after putting highlights in my hair for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister because it works great on my hair, but this product is fake!</li>
            <li> I loved it but now as a few years have past</li>
            <li> The repair masque does what it says it does, revitalizes your hair, makes it smooth &amp; slick....</li>
            <li> my curls are finally looking a bit normal again.</li>
            <li> I wear 18inch extensions in my hair for months at a time and the ONLY reason my hair continues to look brand new is because of this product.</li>
            <li> It would look dry or gets very frizzy.</li>
            <li> I blow dry it straight, so it takes a lot heat, which in turns damages my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was left incredibly soft, nourished and silky with a natural shine.</li>
            <li> The product she got was white and the real one is a milky yellow...</li>
            <li> It is the real thing and would definitely try it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I have to hide it from my sister as she is obsessed with how soft and nice smelling my hair</li>
            <li> this one was more white than the goldish thick cream i was used to.</li>
            <li> Not as expected, greasy and did not have any positive effect on my hair, been using it for 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on and left it in,  and my hair is soft and 90% frizz free.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky for a couple of days until my next wash.</li>
            <li> Ok but not great.</li>
            <li> Also, do a longer soaking once a week or so for at least half hour with a bag over your head to keep it warm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted, it DID make my hair look semi decent, but only until the next washing, which proved the fact that it wasn&#x27;t actually repairing my hair over time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s downright silky after I first wash it out in the shower, and I&#x27;m considering using it as a daily conditioner because my other ones just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> It lasts long because you only have to use a little bit of it at a time and it leaves your hair feeling fabulous</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to people who have dry hair because of too much coloring especially if their hair was damage due to bleaching.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse Asian hair that I color and my 10 years of coloring have finally caught up to me with my most recent highlights.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product I noticed the difference right away, I have long thin, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have medium to soft texture wavy dry color treated hair.</li>
            <li> ; The shipping was incredibly fast, the price was right, and there was absolutely nothing fake about this product!</li>
            <li> This will definitely weigh hair down if you don&#x27;t really need the hydration.  </li>
            <li> The product I just received is pure white not smooth cream</li>
            <li> I searched all over the place looking for other possible deep conditioners that may just be my new holy grail, but found none that were in my budget.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is good especially if you have really bad damage hair</li>
            <li> and I can run my fingers through my hair so easily (my hair is down to the middle of my back and is usually always tangled and dry).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much money I&#x27;ve wasted on shampoos and conditioners that have gotten rave reviews by others but have fallen flat with me.</li>
            <li> I shampooed my hair and rung out the excess water, after it was damp I put at my ends and worked my way up, I left it in long enough to wash and shave</li>
            <li> It smells similar, but I&#x27;m not surprised if there&#x27;s no nutrients to actually save/protect hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a deep conditioner that would give my hair CPR; restore shine and make it soft, without weighing it down or making it greasy.</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair every few days and this really helps my hair from getting dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> I am very concerned that the product is not authentic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s real or not.</li>
            <li> the product will last long.</li>
            <li> I have a flat iron</li>
            <li> Highly recommend a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I notice an improvement in the health and shine of my hair, but it does make it more manageable and a little less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair so incredibly soft and moisturized workout being weighing it down or being sticky.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, it dried it out more than before I used it.</li>
            <li> My hair was sooo dry and this product, help to get my hair back!!!</li>
            <li> I have dry long hair, and this definitely made a difference.</li>
            <li> I have dry, long, coarse color-treated hair that has also been permed before.  </li>
            <li> I tried other things like home remedies to moisturize my hair, I do color my hair and in my latter years and found that it harder to keep my hair from being dry brittle and not shiny and definitely not soft after one use of this hair repair my hair is soft, shinny, manageable, shinny, doesn&#x27;t look or feel dry, feels so soft, &amp; it did not weight my hair down.</li>
            <li> After almost a decade of damaging my hair with heat treatments, I was left with very dry, damaged and lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and shiny, maybe even a little healthier looking.</li>
            <li> To conclude, I highly believe that, as others have stated, this product is not authentic.</li>
            <li> So i got curious and decided to try this product on my boyfriend\\&quot;s hair(african american)</li>
            <li> Does it super deep condition and fix everything that&#x27;s wrong with your hair?</li>
            <li> I have long dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> There is only ONE other repair Masque I use</li>
            <li> but there is nothing different about this scent it smells like any other $3 conditioner I have used.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair a lot and my hair is extremely dry</li>
            <li> I done this before bed and didnt not blow dry</li>
            <li> i just have dry hair.</li>
            <li> I also let it air dry the days I do it</li>
            <li> I like this masque for my dry hair</li>
            <li> or whenever my hair feels really dry.</li>
            <li> I tend to have an oily scalp and dry ends.</li>
            <li> I have aging hair and with all the styling tools my hair was dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier for me to blow dry my hair after I use it.</li>
            <li> I used my mix with this conditioner on dry hair and let it sit on my head for 3 hours without any heat.</li>
            <li> It repairs my dry color hair and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> hair is very damaged from going from brunette to blonde in approximately 10 weeks.</li>
            <li> my hair was so dry until i started using this!</li>
            <li> but if you do have oily hair you should only use the product on your ends or on the bottom half</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the flat iron, and I&#x27;m pretty positive somewhere down the line my curls were getting tired of the abuse.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, course, curly hair and this product</li>
            <li> I have naturally very dry, curly hair</li>
            <li> I ordered it because my hair became very dry and damaged from coloring.</li>
            <li> Having now decided to stretch my curls due to my hair getting so long and harder to detangle, I wanted to use a conditioner that would counter act any adverse effects that heat would bring.</li>
            <li> My hair dried up the second day after I used the masque.</li>
            <li> , I went to bed with a wet head as I&#x27;m trying to cut alot of the heat out.</li>
            <li> Not much really.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize hair, but I expected it to make it silkier, shinier.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not (so those of you hoping for a miracle should know that this product is not</li>
            <li> not really the result I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I use it every few days on my hair after I wash and condition it, and it makes SUCH a difference.</li>
            <li> and I used it everyday after about the fourth day I started to see the difference in my edges</li>
            <li> It performed as expected.</li>
            <li> After a few days it went back to</li>
            <li> dried and flat iron</li>
            <li> Plus it looked less dry at my ends.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed because, for all the hype that this product gets, I expected way more out of this</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, long, colour treated and Keratin and this product brings life back to my hair.</li>
            <li> I always leave it in longer than the recommended time and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little  goes a long way...</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li> and I have a lot of split ends due to styling my hair with heat tools.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount,&lt;br /&gt;therefore  </li>
            <li> wash my hair, put the masque on, then continue w/ the other shower/shaving things...</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t think you have to glob on a handful !</li>
            <li> No need to use any other type of conditioner, this stuff is the bees knees.</li>
            <li> Left it rough and dull</li>
            <li> I do not normally have dry hair, but over the past few months I&#x27;ve been dealing with dry and tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Actually worked, made my daughter&#x27;s thin, fragile hair feel thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very dry hair, I&#x27;d say after about 3 days of not washing my hair it will get a little oily.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price it&#x27;s sold in stores but did find it cheaper on amazon</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about buying this Macadamia Deep Repair Masque on Amazon because of all the negative comments about this product being &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the fake rip off or if it was the real thing...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weight your down.</li>
            <li> so it does not weigh down your hair or make it too greasy too soon.</li>
            <li> My hair is almost down to my waist</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use any other hair products ever again!</li>
            <li> Been using it for the past 6 months to keep my dry, damaged, color-treated hair conditioned!</li>
            <li> I like to wash my hair in the sink and leave this stuff on for about half an hour.</li>
            <li> As a black women helped repair the damage from relaxing and coloring.</li>
            <li> Weighs my hair down a little bit</li>
            <li> i recently dyed my hair (box) and they dye dried my healthy hair out like crazy!!!!</li>
            <li> If you leave it in to long it starts to tingle, or at least my scalp did.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless products that promise to condition and help de-frizz difficult hair; this is one of the few conditioners that actually do something with my wavy, thick and very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the amount of product that was in the container.</li>
            <li> In fact I had to use a little styling gel to get some lift.</li>
            <li> One container lasted me a little over two washes.</li>
            <li> The color was white and its consistency is very thick.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dried out and frizzy from coloring, I thought it might be ruined forever.</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference in my hair after just a few uses....</li>
            <li> What a rip off and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I also workout everyday and my hair takes a beating...</li>
            <li> Helped heal my hair in just one use and it continues to make it softer and less frizzy with each use!</li>
            <li> Just put a little and comb it through!</li>
            <li> The one I got was not authentic.</li>
            <li> and  usually leave it in overnight.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dyed about once a month for the past year.</li>
            <li> I usually finish showering then put this on and cover it with a shower cap.</li>
            <li> I only give it four stars because it is expensive</li>
            <li> I usually leave it for like 30min and then rinse it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not cute, after I user this in my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually just put it in at the end of my shower, get out of the shower and get dressed then go to the kitchen sink and rinse it out.</li>
            <li> (ignore the spiky part on the last photo, the cream was set at a weird position) and tried it on my hair this past month</li>
            <li> Two years ago, my hair looked dull, dry and unhealthy.</li>
            <li> I have very dried out hair from over dying it</li>
            <li> And this stuff doesn&#x27;t mess around!!</li>
            <li> thick</li>
            <li> I have waist-length, thick hair</li>
            <li> When I would use other conditioners and masques, it would simply disappear into my hair as if I hadn&#x27;t even used any product and my hair would still be tangled and annoying.</li>
            <li> Now ever since this and cat redken I use it almost EVERYDAY!!</li>
            <li> So I was in need of some serious stuff.</li>
            <li> I used it when I was deployed to AFG and it actually kept my hair from breaking off from the bad water there.</li>
            <li> the only bad thing is is when I got it it was already opened and some of the conditioner went inside the bag.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to use because my hair was such in bad shape before.</li>
            <li> it arruved to me spelled all over not seald bad service they have to give me my money back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this seller just thinks I am stupid or what, but I purchased the Macadamia Deep Repair Masque from them, and I have used the product before.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this works wonders on my hair!</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> though i have thin hair</li>
            <li> My products seal was broken.</li>
            <li> The reason I rated this so poorly is because it&#x27;s overly expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dominican with very thin hair and finding products that work for me is exhausting and expensive</li>
            <li> Packing on the container was questionable.</li>
            <li> Might be a fake.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this masque.</li>
            <li> The one from the store had a faint brown/orange color.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is a bit expensive</li>
            <li> I wish it wasnt so expensive though..</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t know if it&#x27;d make my thin hair greasy, but it didn&#x27;t at all!</li>
            <li> This is a fake product that I bought ...</li>
            <li> I know for a fact this is fake because they wrapped it with a bunch of plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> Fake fake fake fake fake!!!</li>
            <li> and then I rinsed it out with cold water.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible, i used it all and that didnt help me at all</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it u guys would love it to get it rite now believe me u would like it 😊</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this hair mask. I got because of all the reviews but I found that my $8 hair mask works better.</li>
            <li> This has really worked wonders. It smells AMAZING and I like that no heat is needed for it to work. It leaves my hair sooo silky and I can run my fingers through my hair so easily (my hair is down to the middle of my back and is usually always tangled and dry). I have to hide it from my sister as she is obsessed with how soft and nice smelling my hair is after I use it. I always leave it in longer than the recommended time and a little bit goes a long way. You don&#x27;t get a ton in the jar but you don&#x27;t need a lot in your hair. Really satisfied!</li>
            <li> Fake fake fake fake fake!!! I returned the same day i recieved it!! Its suppose to be a orangeish color i recieved a white goopy product!!! Never ever again!</li>
            <li> Because of jlovesmac in YouTube, I bought this product and it&#x27;s work. My hair is so dry from so many time coloring. I had good comments at the first use. Love it. It&#x27;s feel great too . Rinse with cool water for better result.</li>
            <li> This product is great! After my first use I noticed a big difference on my hair, which I have to admit is pretty damaged. I would definitely keep using it and buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this.! Will be re purchasing soon.</li>
            <li> Love this product hard to find where I stay great price and fast shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, great conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for dry hair</li>
            <li> I have a combination of straight and wavy hair. I dye my hair a lot and my hair is extremely dry and I have a lot of split ends due to styling my hair with heat tools. My hair was a frizz ball. So I decided to purchase this product with all the raves about it. So far, I love it. I put it on once a week and I just dab a little onto the bottom of my hair where it is the driest and have the most damages. It made my hair soft and shiny, maybe even a little healthier looking. I highly recommend this product to people who have dry hair because of too much coloring especially if their hair was damage due to bleaching. It&#x27;ll soften up the dryness of your hair.</li>
            <li> I saw a video online that recommended this product so I thought I would try it. I bought this on amazon for about $18.00. When it arrived and I opened it I was a little concerned about the amount of product that was in the container. I felt like it had been used, but I wasn&#x27;t going to send it back on a hunch. Don&#x27;t be alarmed by the amount, because to get all your hair covered doesn&#x27;t take much and I still have a ton left. I can definitely get 3 months use out of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month and have noticed a huge difference. I use this once or twice a week because my hair is really damaged. I will get in the shower and shampoo my hair, then get out and put this in for 30 minutes, then I rinse it out. I don&#x27;t shampoo or condition afterwards. This stuff does just fine, and smells great! For days after the use my hair is silky, and beautiful. Before, when I use products like this they would make my hair oily, instead of silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to make sure is that after you put it in, when you go to rinse it out, rinse for a longgggg time. If you still have product in your hair it makes your hair feel like when you don&#x27;t wash out all your conditioner. Not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now and I love it! I have thick curly hair and this works wonders on my hair!</li>
            <li> Always my favorite!  Will order always!</li>
            <li> leaves your hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Let me just get right to the point here... if you want your hair to smell and feel amazing all the time then buy this product. I have very dry, course, curly hair and this product made my hair feel so hydrated and shiny and soft! love it!!</li>
            <li> Use a lot of it and let it stay on my hair much longer than it says.  Makes it even softer.  I left if on for 4 hours while I was watching tv.. Good product.</li>
            <li> My hair is so smooth and smells so great! i love this product i would repurchase it again! its worth it!</li>
            <li> Great product, it really made a difference on my hair. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I feel like this makes my hair healthier all around</li>
            <li> This product is great! It smells awseome and I felt my hair become smoother while I was still in the shower!! It&#x27;s a great purchase and I&#x27;m definitely getting it again!</li>
            <li> The product was returned.  When it was opened it was obviously an older product, the masque looked visually improper and didn&#x27;t smell like the product I used previously.  I returned it and did not buy another from this company.</li>
            <li> The conditioner masque is not as effective as it claims to be. My hair dried up the second day after I used the masque. Technically a masque should have effect lasting until two washes atleast. Disappointed</li>
            <li> The best mask I ever tried.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much healthier after using this. I put my hair through a lot last year with highlights &amp; decided to give my hair a rest, but it still looked dry &amp; not too healthy until using this. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it. Love!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I read all the reviews and decided to take a chance &amp; buy this product! I tried other things like home remedies to moisturize my hair, I do color my hair and in my latter years and found that it harder to keep my hair from being dry brittle and not shiny and definitely not soft after one use of this hair repair my hair is soft, shinny, manageable, shinny, doesn&#x27;t look or feel dry, feels so soft, &amp; it did not weight my hair down. I just love this! !! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The best buyand this is a really good product</li>
            <li> I am very concerned that the product is not authentic. There is no sealed plastic around the container. They could easily produce the container and fill it with a foreign substance. Packing on the container was questionable.</li>
            <li> I must say I been waiting on this product to arrive for quite sometime now, as soon as it came in I dint hesitate to open the box right then and go take a shower! the smell is amazinggg there has been comments about how much is in the container but, I never had that thought once, I even thought there was a pretty good bit in there.I shampooed my hair and rung out the excess water, after it was damp I put at my ends and worked my way up, I left it in long enough to wash and shave and then I rinsed it out with cold water. I was amazed just while washing out it was so silky already.I done this before bed and didnt not blow dry, I went to bed with a wet head as I&#x27;m trying to cut alot of the heat out.When I woke up this morning my hair was so SHINY and SMOOTH. I will be using this and never plan on stoping, So I recommend this %110 and also a good product to use after the shower while hair is damp is CHI KERATIN! its my holy grail and I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now its made my hair soooooo strong!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is really good. I got it from Salon Supply, and it was the authentic product. It makes my color treated hair nice and soft. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I use it with two other conditioners mixed, so I don&#x27;t know how it truly works on its own. Definitely has improved my hair once I added it to the mix though.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair. I have colored it every 4 weeks for the last 25 years. It would look dry or gets very frizzy. I just started using it once a week for the last 4 weeks and my hair is more manageable, feels soft, looks better and it also smells so good. Saw results the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today and as soon as I put it in my hair I noticed a difference right away. My hair is so soft and feels so healthy now. I absolutely love it, but it smells more fruity and not really like a macadamian nut. I would deffinalty recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great for damaged hair of any texture!</li>
            <li> I love this product it has my hair so soft and manageable. My hair is thick, long, colour treated and Keratin and this product brings life back to my hair. Actually the entire line is great!</li>
            <li> love the macadamia deep repair masque.  it leaves my hair soft and smelling good :)  won&#x27;t strip away hair color.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product.  1st use and my hair was super soft.  A little  goes a long way... So awesome!!  I highly  recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and I was able to detangle my hair easy.  My hair didn&#x27;t behave the same when I blow dried and flat iron my hair and the beautiful smell was gone.  It&#x27;s a great detangler.  Maybe the smell left because i left it in to deep conditioner my hair for about 6 hours and i did go grocery shopping and ran some errands.  who knows.</li>
            <li> this products was recommend by a youtuber. i recently dyed my hair (box) and they dye dried my healthy hair out like crazy!!!! i use this product 2-3 times a week. shampoo then using a generous amount on the ends of my hair i leave in in for about 7-10 minutes. After a trim and using this product i can see a difference. Its been about 1 month and i can only imagine i will be back to normal after a few more months, thanks to this masque. Its not heavy or filmy at all! If it matters to you...it smells wonderful! The only reason its not a 5 is because i need more time to determine if its the best masque yet</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Did nothing  and for the price I paid, I thought it would be a miracle but no, nothing, nada too pricey...</li>
            <li> Excellent Product!!!!</li>
            <li> I get highlights in my hair on a consistent basis, and sometimes that can leave my hair pretty dry / damaged. This stuff works SO well at repairing any damage that my stylist constantly remarks how healthy my hair is. I purchase this on a regular basis and use it about once a week to keep my hair healthy. It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Item is an excellent conditioner! Hair feels very soft. You only need a small amount,&lt;br /&gt;therefore  the product will last long.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and just perfect. It smells wonderful, it makes my hair so smooth, shiny, volumous and just amazing. I love using this product and wish I could use it more than just twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the original macadamia b/c this one was more white than the goldish thick cream i was used to. I have natural 4c hair and this did nothing to soften it like it used too.  Might be a fake. switched deep conditioner to Cantu.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use any other hair products ever again! Love their products! Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t perform miracles! Ok but not great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Been using it for the past 6 months to keep my dry, damaged, color-treated hair conditioned!</li>
            <li> I brought this hair mask (8.5 oz) here on amazon from omani hair solution and it shipped in 4 days. It came from L.A to queens(ny) pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;I dont have damaged hair or colored hair i just have dry hair. i quickly tryed  the hair mask for 7mins and it made my hair so light weight and soft!!&lt;br /&gt;Even though i have thin hair (im a  hispanic female)it has never felt this light. Plus it looked less dry at my ends. So i got curious and decided to try this product on my boyfriend\\&quot;s hair(african american) and maybe i didnt put enough mask on his hair or something because i left it on his hair for 30 mins(br0ke the rules) and it didnt do a thing. No shine ,no softness, it was just his regular hair. In a way thats good cause atleast i have a product that works for me.&lt;br /&gt; Oh and the scent is like a flower scented lotion. I dont mind the smell. Il love it in fact. I will be Buying the intro kit soon too.</li>
            <li> After almost a decade of damaging my hair with heat treatments, I was left with very dry, damaged and lifeless hair. I could never step outside my hair after a shampoo unless I iron out my hair. I ordered this hair masque and noticed the difference in my first use itself. I used my regular shampoo and rinsed it off. Then I applied this masque and left it on for about 10-12 mins. Then I stepped back in to the shower and rinse it off again. My hair was left incredibly soft, nourished and silky with a natural shine. I have been using it for a few weeks now. After years, I am able to just let my hair down and go out without styling my hair with an iron. I am in love with this product. Totally worth my 20 bucks!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff I use it twice a week and I do not leave on for 7 mins cause I do it while I&#x27;m in the shower and I don&#x27;t have 7 mins to just stand around in there so I only it in for the amount of time it take me to wash my body, exfoliate and shave. And it still leaves my hair feeling great. I also let it air dry the days I do it and there is no frizz.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for you hair. I used it when I was deployed to AFG and it actually kept my hair from breaking off from the bad water there. I Recommend it over and over again!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the healing oil and I love that stuff, which brought me to ordering this. I have had many and I mean many conditioners that cost a 1/4 of the cost that left my hair silkier. I def won&#x27;t order this again</li>
            <li> Helped heal my hair in just one use and it continues to make it softer and less frizzy with each use! I will be buying again for sure!!</li>
            <li> Best hair mask ever! This stuff really works. I like to wash my hair in the sink and leave this stuff on for about half an hour. Rinse with cold water and it restores moisture and shine and leaves your hair feeling soft and healthy for days. Holy Grail deep conditioner, will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist.  I purchased one container in J.C. Penney&#x27;s Salon, loved the way it made my damaged hair feel, the healthy way it looked and the wonderful, clean fragrance it left in my hair.  When I ran out of the deep conditioner, I returned to J C Penny salon and they had sold out.  I began ordering it from Amazon and haven&#x27;t looked back since.  Since I loved the deep conditioner, I also began to use the shampoo as well as the lighter weight daily conditioner, in between weekly deep conditioning.  This product is my new &amp;#34;hair salon in a jar.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is very nice conditioner. I use this about once a week for deep conditioning. It&#x27;s one of the better ones out there. The longer you leave it in the better it works. I have medium to soft texture wavy dry color treated hair. I did a lot of research before buying this one.</li>
            <li> great products, great price, great effect and great shipping....So highly to be recommended whom like to be very young in any ages</li>
            <li> My hair was so dried out and frizzy from coloring, I thought it might be ruined forever. I  had used many products and didn&#x27;t feel very hopeful, but I wet my hair and worked enough mask to coat and infuse it well. Not much really. I left it in over night and after I rinsed it out, my hair is soft and shiney. In fact I had to use a little styling gel to get some lift. Wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> The one I got was not authentic. I compared it to one I got from a department store and the color and consistency was totally different. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of hair masque&#x27;s but this one takes the cake! It lasts long because you only have to use a little bit of it at a time and it leaves your hair feeling fabulous and I have very damamged hair from bleach and heat and this helped me w hole lot! A def holy grail!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and she&#x27;s very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;It games and gives shine at the same time.</li>
            <li> This product does wonders! I wear 18inch extensions in my hair for months at a time and the ONLY reason my hair continues to look brand new is because of this product. It is amazing and worth every penny and then some:)</li>
            <li> I bought this product from the seller UglyNBeauty. I already bought it from CVS and bought this one as a gift on Amazon. It is NOT the same product. The color and texture are different, and it smells cheap.</li>
            <li> I have use different deep hair conditioner before like Neutrogena triple moisture and Dr. Miracle deep conditioner, but Macadamia is by far the best out of the three. As a black women helped repair the damage from relaxing and coloring. It left my hair feeling so silk and luxurious.</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance in your hair, isn&#x27;t worth all the hype though moisturizing wise. Not worth the price it&#x27;s sold in stores but did find it cheaper on amazon so yay.</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;ve been using this product and it&#x27;s pretty goodI would definitely recommend this to anyonethis is good especially if you have really bad damage hair my shipping was here really earlyand if they definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> Deep conditioner is excellent for color treated hair. I only use it once every week but it is wonderful when I do. It makes my hair so shiny and bouncy and it smells lovely..Love it soo much!!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this masque. The smell is heavenly, it leaves my hair so soft and smelling so amazing. The delivery was quick and well packaged. Will be purchasing this again once I need it.</li>
            <li> I love this mask I have curly hair so I use it as my regular conditioner and it leaves my hair super soft and smelling delicious.  Highly recommend a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry after putting highlights in my hair for the first time.  I bought regular hair treatment products that have done nothing to improve my hair.  After using this hair masque, my hair looks so healthy and full, feels so soft.  Plus, it smells so good.  I want to use it every day, but it does the job for twice a week usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the flat iron, and I&#x27;m pretty positive somewhere down the line my curls were getting tired of the abuse. My hair was becoming brittle and way too dry. So after a month of using the macadamia conditioner and surrendering my love of the flat iron my curls are finally looking a bit normal again. (Not to mention this stuff smells great too.)</li>
            <li> This is a great product I will keep using this It leaves my hair soft manageable is great everybody should try this</li>
            <li> I love this masque . Doesn&#x27;t weight your down. I think it&#x27;s great for all hair types.smells great too. Love it .</li>
            <li> I love how this stuff feels when I put it on in the shower. Overall I truly think that this product makes a huge difference. My hair feels healthier overall :)</li>
            <li> I looov this mask! Amazing for the price</li>
            <li> I am probably going to be one of the only ones who can honestly say I don&#x27;t like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Before I go into specifics however, I need to say this: I DID double check the ingredients and YES I got the actual thing.&lt;br /&gt;Now that that&#x27;s out of the way, I&#x27;m going to get into why I didn&#x27;t like this product.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very damaged from going from brunette to blonde in approximately 10 weeks. I didn&#x27;t expect to see results from first use, so I used it over a number of weeks and honestly, I didn&#x27;t see any change whatsoever in my hair. I was extremely disappointed because, for all the hype that this product gets, I expected way more out of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it DID make my hair look semi decent, but only until the next washing, which proved the fact that it wasn&#x27;t actually repairing my hair over time.&lt;br /&gt;So, I looked at the ingredients to find the source of the issue, and I found it. I found silicones and &amp;#34;Cetearyl Alcohol&amp;#34;, which is a cheap ingredient that makes hair look like it&#x27;s been hydrated, but in reality is just masking the problem (hair &amp;#34;masque&amp;#34;&#x3D; MASKing the problem). I searched all over the place looking for other possible deep conditioners that may just be my new holy grail, but found none that were in my budget.&lt;br /&gt;So, I shall resort to making my own at home that actually work.</li>
            <li> I expected more judging off all the beauty guru reviews. It does moisturize hair, but I expected it to make it silkier, shinier.</li>
            <li> Will definately buy again!</li>
            <li> I live this product!! Great smell and leave my hair silky smooth!!!</li>
            <li> love love love!!!! give this product a 100% recommendation! my hair was so dry until i started using this! from the first use my hair was soft manageable shiny and even helped with humidity! I will be a lifetime buyer of this product</li>
            <li> I like this masque for my dry hair and I use it once a week or whenever my hair feels really dry. It works awesome but if you do have oily hair you should only use the product on your ends or on the bottom half so it does not weigh down your hair or make it too greasy too soon.</li>
            <li> What I love about this and the other moroccan mask jar (aqua brown container) is that they dont make the hair sticky or oily. My hair feels bouncy and beautiful when i use it :) Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I tend to have an oily scalp and dry ends. I use this once a week and only keep it on for 10 minutes at the most. My hair is so soft afterwards and The smell is amazing! A little bit goes a long way so it really does last. I would recommend buying this!</li>
            <li> THIS IS AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;Its thick&lt;br /&gt;smelllll soooooo goooood&lt;br /&gt;So worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It goes a long way. Good buy yep people</li>
            <li> Not as expected, greasy and did not have any positive effect on my hair, been using it for 6 weeks and I see no change.</li>
            <li> It feels like the real thing to me!!</li>
            <li> Great for dry hair, color treated hair,  brings back a smooth silky balance. Light fragrance LOVE IT and would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff....I can tell the difference in my hair after just a few uses....its smells amazing. people are constantly telling me i smell good, but its the conditioner. Ive also went from washing my hair everyday to only washing it about every 2 days or so just because my hair seems to be so much cleaner after using this. will definitely be using this from now on and will continue to buy from amazon. this stuff sells for $30 at target...so this is hald the price.</li>
            <li> I looovee this product. There is plenty of product inside the tub, and you don&#x27;t need very much at all to coat your hair. I have waist-length, thick hair and you can literally see the difference after you use this. My hair is soooo much shinier and incredibly soft after using. It smells really nice too. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Incredibly nourishing fit the hair.only need to use a small portion.</li>
            <li> I have long dry curly hair. This stuff works. My hair is thick and healthy. I use this instead of a conditioner. I &#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and there&#x27;s no I&#x27;m switching.</li>
            <li> I like the way it coats the hair and how soft my hair is after use.</li>
            <li> I love it, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Very nice mask. My hair is very soft and silky:  moreover, it smells sooo nice!</li>
            <li> This product is not the same as the masque I bought in the store. This is a knock off. Save your money and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with the hopes that I&#x27;d be receiving an authentic product. The product was well packaged and did not have any spillage as some reviewers have stated. The packaging was in great condition. I opened the product and smelled it and it didn&#x27;t really have a scent. The color was white and its consistency is very thick. I had doubts about the authenticity of the product so I also purchased the product from one of my local stores before putting it in my hair. The one that I bought from that store looked and smelled completely different from the one I purchased here on Amazon. The one from the store had a faint brown/orange color. I surmise that color is from the argan oil which is in this mask. I also picked up the the faint argan oil scent, which I love by the way. To conclude, I highly believe that, as others have stated, this product is not authentic. I have thrown the product in the trash; I emptied out the container. I did keep since it&#x27;s such a pretty container for the mixing of my own homemade hair masque. If you purchase this product here on Amazon, be sure the seller is selling an authentic product. I was highly disappointed. I would not purchase this particular product here on Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Not a &amp;#34;magical product&amp;#34; but works as a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> takes the frizz out of my hair</li>
            <li> I love this stuff leaves my hair so soft. I have very dried out hair from over dying it but this stuff works so well. the only bad thing is is when I got it it was already opened and some of the conditioner went inside the bag.</li>
            <li> Best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. Left my hair soft, shiny and silky, it smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t require heat to work. What could be better?</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Deep Repair Masque and I absolutely love it. I use it about twice a week and  usually leave it in overnight. My  hair feels amazing!</li>
            <li> this masque was just what was required it met all my needs and i would happily recommend this item to any of my friends. Thank you for a great item</li>
            <li> great for dry, damaged hair!!  I just love it!  i use this once a week, leave on hair with shower cap for about 1-2 hrs.  My damaged highlighted hair feels so moisturized!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 3wks and only used it twice which I don&#x27;t feel I had it long enough to give a full review on</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;going to buy some more :)&lt;br /&gt;it is a bit expensive however it is worth to use</li>
            <li> This is NOT the real product.  My products seal was broken. They must take the original product out and just dump some off brand junk in the container.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Does it condition? Yes. Does it deep condition? Yeah. Does it super deep condition and fix everything that&#x27;s wrong with your hair? Absolutely not (so those of you hoping for a miracle should know that this product is not your miracle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product as a nice weekly deep conditioner, and it works great for that. It makes my hair feel nice and soft and reduces the amount of little frizzies I get from letting my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister because it works great on my hair, but this product is fake! The product she got was white and the real one is a milky yellow... It smells similar, but I&#x27;m not surprised if there&#x27;s no nutrients to actually save/protect hair.</li>
            <li> I love this Deep Repair masque!!! I&#x27;m a hair product junky and I can honestly say I&#x27;ve tryd plently on hair products. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to order this with so many pros&amp;cons to this item. But, I&#x27;m VERY happy to say I LOVE THIS!! There is only ONE other repair Masque I use and thats CAT made by redken. I can honestly say this stuff is AMAZING! Mind you I have bleach blonde hair that has been bleached for 4 YEARS! So I was in need of some serious stuff. And this stuff doesn&#x27;t mess around!! It truly is AMAZING!! My bleach blonde hair is NO longer fryd. I have a flat iron and I didn&#x27;t want to use because my hair was such in bad shape before. Now ever since this and cat redken I use it almost EVERYDAY!! I&#x27;m so THANKFUL to have found this!!! It does what it says!! It works :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay - it smells nice (though VERY strong) and does condition your hair; however, I don&#x27;t think it is really as deep of a conditioner as I need. I have naturally very dry, curly hair and this seems to make it more frizzy in the end...not really the result I was looking for. My hair is not processed or dyed (just as a disclaimer).</li>
            <li> This product is very good , don&#x27;t get it on your scalp though. Just apply to your hair . Overall I love it</li>
            <li> My hair was sooo dry and this product, help to get my hair back!!! Soft and shinny!!!! I love it!!! And also I use the healing oil!!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. It&#x27;s a nice hair mask, but Aussie 3 Minute Miracle doe the same thing for like 4 dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nonstop for more than 6 months now as a deep conditioner everytime I was my hair. It leaves my hair soft and silky for a couple of days until my next wash. To be honest, I don&#x27;t know if it makes my hair a lot stronger since I do continue to experience hair fall (but that may be because I have a perm and it is constantly color treated), but I suppose it has helped with keeping it manageble. It is definitely a staple product for me!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair really soft. Ita the best deep deep conditioner I have ever used. I wish it wasnt so expensive though..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this masque.  I have aging hair and with all the styling tools my hair was dry and brittle.  I use this twice a week and it has changed the appearance and feel of my hair dramatically.  It now feels soft and better than when I was in my twenties.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dyed about once a month for the past year. I have permed my hair. I curl it, straightened it. You name it, I&#x27;ve done it. So you can imagine how damaged my hair is. This masque has totally rescued my hair. It gives my hair the shine and sleekness back. A lot of people always ask me how I keep my hair so nice. This is my secrete weapon. :) Just a note: leave it in your hair longer than the instructions tell you to. I usually finish showering then put this on and cover it with a shower cap. Wait about 20 minutes (watch t.v.) then rinse off. The results are amazing! :)</li>
            <li> I will give it 5 stars because my hair looks and feels soft and I will buy it again and I would defenetly recommend it. Will buy it again when mine is done</li>
            <li> I tested this product and it does not appear to be the correct item as stated I think it&#x27;s an imposter.</li>
            <li> after about 2weeks of using, my overly heat damaged hair has got its curl pattern back! I&#x27;m dominican with very thin hair and finding products that work for me is exhausting and expensive but so far this seems to be doing something positive with my hair so a definite re-buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this because the smell was out of this world amazing. When I used it on my hair I was less than satisfied. It didn&#x27;t soften my hair at all. I haven&#x27;t bought any since and don&#x27;t plan to.</li>
            <li> fack one guys it must up my hair the reall one not like that same smell but not same product color and texter is deffrent too it arruved to me spelled all over not seald bad service they have to give me my money back i got too for me and friend and same result for both of us dont buy fack</li>
            <li> I really liked the product a lot. I used it with a combination of the macadamia natural oil leave in cream and this stuff was amazing! I got a compliment today saying how soft my hair is! And that was just the first time using it! I highly recommended this product! :)</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it once a week and it leaves my hair looking very healthy and vey shinny. The shipping of this product was supper fast, I think I got it in about two days after ordering it. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I was scared to order this because it&#x27;s main ingredients are naturals OILS and I didn&#x27;t know if it&#x27;d make my thin hair greasy, but it didn&#x27;t at all! I ordered it because my hair became very dry and damaged from coloring. I leave it in a couple minutes in the shower and after hair is sooo soft and healthy feeling afterwards. And it smells great. I love it.</li>
            <li> The reason I rated this so poorly is because it&#x27;s overly expensive for what it is. I have dry long hair, and this definitely made a difference. HOWEVER, my homemade hair mask works a lot better, and is worlds cheaper. I just mix 3/4 olive oil and 1/4 lemon juice, and i leave it on for about 30min, and the results are way better.</li>
            <li> I have mixed curly hair that tends to become frizzy and dry easily. I blow dry it straight, so it takes a lot heat, which in turns damages my hair. I was looking for a deep conditioner that would give my hair CPR; restore shine and make it soft, without weighing it down or making it greasy. This masque is it. I use it once a week and the I love the results; my hair is soft and shiny. I also enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this Product! I was nervous about buying this Macadamia Deep Repair Masque on Amazon because of all the negative comments about this product being &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;. Well, I took a leap of faith and decided to buy the Macadamia repair masque from &amp;#34;myBeautyWarehouse&amp;#34; The shipping was incredibly fast, the price was right, and there was absolutely nothing fake about this product! I&#x27;m so glad that I checked out amazon prices first, because if I were to buy this product elsewhere I would have paid well over $30.00 ( I paid a little over $15.00 for this conditioner. Shipping was free). This Macadamia smells GREAT (I had two random strangers comment how great my hair smelled), and it made my hair shiny and super soft the first time I used it. My mom was so please with the results of my hair that she decided to buy herself some too. I am extremely happy with my purchase - and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> My hair was so damaged from highlighting it I could not hardly come it out now my hair feels so silky.  I LOVE IT. Will buy agin.</li>
            <li> This product is great for really dry hair, backed up with the oil.  I have very porous hair, and this help keep it calm. I recommend using it as much as you want, but not at the roots. Also, do a longer soaking once a week or so for at least half hour with a bag over your head to keep it warm.</li>
            <li> This deep repair masque is great.  I use it once a week because I had a straightener put in my hair and it needs extra moisture.  This product is great because it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t understand how destroyed my hair was... With the use of this and Joico K-Pak my hair is sooooo manageable again. I SWEAR by this product and it smells incredible! -Tina</li>
            <li> Really love the tropical scent, makes my hair smell so good, and the scent lingers for a whole day. Very good at detangling long hair, makes it easy to brush. I&#x27;m not sure if I notice an improvement in the health and shine of my hair, but it does make it more manageable and a little less frizzy.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT! IT MAKE MY HAIR SOFT AND SHINE</li>
            <li> This product has absolutely saved my hair! It has grown and become so healthy. I&#x27;ll always have this on hand!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. My hair are soft and silky. You need to use it after washing you hair with no conditioner. I use it once a week. A+</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product.. its a must have. It smells amazing and helps my dead ends. Love it! d</li>
            <li> Been using this product for two years, but I feel that the one on the Macadamia website works better. This one works well but only if used once a week, otherwise my hair gets greasy. The smell is amazing and sometimes it makes my hair feel silky and restores a beautiful pale blonde back to it. But normally I have to use the blow dryer to get good results. I like it a lot, just not as good as the website. It&#x27;s kind of unpredictable when I use it. Sometimes it&#x27;s phenomenal, other times not too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this seller just thinks I am stupid or what, but I purchased the Macadamia Deep Repair Masque from them, and I have used the product before. What is in this container is NOT THE MACADAMIA DEEP REPAIR MASQUE. What I received is orange....the product is white/cream colored. Nice try. You might be able to fool new buyers but you&#x27;re not fooling me. What a rip off and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Is this better than most hair masks? Yes. Is it worth the price tag? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t amazing by any means. It&#x27;s good, but I need it to be better than good for this price. I feel like I could substitute another conditioner with it. I used it once a week. One container lasted me a little over two washes.</li>
            <li> Used it once so far , hair was smooth light and tamed , smells great . Fast delievery.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless products that promise to condition and help de-frizz difficult hair; this is one of the few conditioners that actually do something with my wavy, thick and very dry hair.  I only give it four stars because it is expensive and I wish it had more naturally ingredients.</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisture for your hair. I have natural AA 4a hair, so this stuff is like moisture gold for me. Great smelling too. Love the ingredients. I also like that even though it&#x27;s a deep conditioner, you do not need to apply heat to it for effectiveness. Highly recommended for just about any hair type.</li>
            <li> The repair masque does what it says it does, revitalizes your hair, makes it smooth &amp; slick....wash my hair, put the masque on, then continue w/ the other shower/shaving things...rinse masque, easy, easy, easy. I do it twice/wk.</li>
            <li> I got this sample from Birch Box and it is hands down the best conditioner I have ever used. My hair is mainly frizzy and this made a noticeable difference.  I put a small amount on and left it in,  and my hair is soft and 90% frizz free.  NOTHING does that.  I&#x27;ll try from this vendor and compare it to the sample I have.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this item and recieved it shortly after ordering. I absolutely LOVE it. It has a pleasant scent and a little bit seems to go a long way for my long hair. After one use I felt my hair was already so much softer. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys taking care of their hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good product! It&#x27;s smells nice and it makes my hair soft and gentle. It&#x27;s easier for me to blow dry my hair after I use it.</li>
            <li> Actually worked, made my daughter&#x27;s thin, fragile hair feel thicker and healthier. Leave it in for several minutes to let it soak in.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product before from Ulta and it had a yellowish tint, but this was pure white.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s real or not. I will be able to tell after I use it.</li>
            <li> I had been trying to find a way to stretch my curls. And by the way my hair is 4a and 3c in some areas. Having Kinky Curly hair has been a delightful journey in understanding and better enjoying who I am. Since I decided to go all natural 4 years ago I have learned a lot of ways how to deal with this fragil but unique hair.  Having now decided to stretch my curls due to my hair getting so long and harder to detangle, I wanted to use a conditioner that would counter act any adverse effects that heat would bring. In doing this I created my own deep conditioner using this Deep repair masque in my mix and you would not believe the strength I got on every strand of hair. I was so amazed and blown away by the power of it. I would defintely recommend this product. I used my mix with this conditioner on dry hair and let it sit on my head for 3 hours without any heat. Then I proceeded to rinse with cool water not washing or conditioning hair and the results were astounding!</li>
            <li> I swear it&#x27;s magic! I fried my hair trying to highlight and multi-task (oops) and this stuff saved the day. I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair, then tried this based on the reviews... Magic! After the first time I used it (for way longer than the recommended time), my hair was so soft (which is pretty amazing considering what I had done to it)! And it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> LOVE this! I can tell that this is working, my hair feels so soft after using this! I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS HAIR MASQUE!!! IT SMELLS WONDERFUL &amp; MOISTURIZES MY HAIR VERY NICELY!!! THIS ITEM IS NOT FAKE, I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL THE MACADAMIA NATURAL OIL LOVERS!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My hair is so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I spent 20$ on this, which I would not have mind if they had delivered the right product. This is a fake product that I bought ... Google images of this product, it is creamy pearl white (a bit tanish). The product I just received is pure white not smooth cream at all it&#x27;s as if they put regular conditioner. The smell I expected was some nice clean scent product but there is nothing different about this scent it smells like any other $3 conditioner I have used. I know for a fact this is fake because they wrapped it with a bunch of plastic wrap. It did not have a new seal.</li>
            <li> This hair masque smells good and feels nice but I don&#x27;t notice any big difference between this and my regular, everyday good quality conditioner. I like aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle available in just about any store.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner that I have ever purchased in my life! I just looked at a picture of my hair from two years ago and I compared it to a picture that I took of myself today, after using this product, and what an amazing difference! Two years ago, my hair looked dull, dry and unhealthy. Today, it looks healthy and beautiful! Give this product a try! You will love it!</li>
            <li> This will definitely weigh hair down if you don&#x27;t really need the hydration.  I don&#x27;t have very dry hair, I&#x27;d say after about 3 days of not washing my hair it will get a little oily.  This would be best for the very damaged, very dry hair type.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the bad reviews. My jar is the real deal. This product is great for dry hair. I only need to condition a couple  of times a week.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Good scent that make me happy, and bring me a soft, bright and smooth hair. I love this masque, I love this brand.</li>
            <li> i purchased this masque and i waged my hair the next week, I LOVE IT. my hair was so soft and manageable. im 16 weeks post and my hair has neve been theis managable. i HIGHLY reccommened this product.</li>
            <li> Great mask for color treated hair.  Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Love the product line, makes my hair feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this masque for a while now it definitely is one of my favorites. I usually leave it for like 30min and then rinse it. It leaves my hair very moistureized. Weighs my hair down a little bit but I don&#x27;t mind because I have wavy hair and gets puffy and this tames it.</li>
            <li> this is really good for dry hair it really works its starts to show about 2 weeks or  so buy it now because you will regret it</li>
            <li> I have dry, long, coarse color-treated hair that has also been permed before.  This stuff 1. smells great and 2. makes my hair so soft and manageable.  It&#x27;s downright silky after I first wash it out in the shower, and I&#x27;m considering using it as a daily conditioner because my other ones just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> I cannot express how wonderful this product is. I do not normally have dry hair, but over the past few months I&#x27;ve been dealing with dry and tangled hair. Even after switching to a better shampoo and conditioner, it was not getting better. This product was recommended on a blog I read, so I decided to give it a try. (Amazon&#x27;s price is much nicer than Ulta&#x27;s!) I am hooked on this product. I use it every few days on my hair after I wash and condition it, and it makes SUCH a difference. The smell is great, and it lasts all day, and my hair is soft and tangle free. It reduces the frizz when I blow dry my hair, and gives it an overall healthy feel and look. I have already recommended this product to several friends, and bought one more for myself. A little goes a long way, so it lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner so ordered another.. When I opened the box it was spilled EVERYWHERE. Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I love it, I have very dry hair and it made it so much softer.</li>
            <li> Best Hair treatment ever... made my hair supper shiny</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look and feel great instantly upon drying. Curls come out more defined and shiny! Smells phenomenal.</li>
            <li> The Deep Repair Masque is a really good quality hair conditioner.  I&#x27;ve used it for over 2 years and this is my 4th order of the product.  It repairs my dry color hair and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> love the smell and hair was so soft after every used!&lt;br /&gt;i usd mask plus argan oil, it works grest together!</li>
            <li> Smells so good and makes my hair silky and soft! I would recommend this for anyone looking for a weekly deep conditioner I just put it on my ends twice weekly!</li>
            <li> This deep repair works when I first used it I thought it was a moisturizing lotion and I used it everyday after about the fourth day I started to see the difference in my edges but it is a conditioner</li>
            <li> Horrible. Did nothing to my hair. Left it rough and dull</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the very best hair product I have ever purchased.  And like most 30 year olds,  I have bought thousands of products. Lol.  This leaves my hair so incredibly soft and moisturized workout being weighing it down or being sticky. Great for AA hair.  You can&#x27;t tell me I&#x27;m not cute, after I user this in my hair. Diva approved product!</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse Asian hair that I color and my 10 years of coloring have finally caught up to me with my most recent highlights. I can&#x27;t tell you how much money I&#x27;ve wasted on shampoos and conditioners that have gotten rave reviews by others but have fallen flat with me. When I would use other conditioners and masques, it would simply disappear into my hair as if I hadn&#x27;t even used any product and my hair would still be tangled and annoying. The first time I ever used this product, I was so taken aback by how creamy it was. It literally coated my hair and the smell is so amazing. I knew this would be my go-to product forever when I was able to run a comb through my wet hair. The lovely, feminine smell lingers throughout the entire next day and my hair has never been better. The cost is well worth it and I will be buying this product again and again.</li>
            <li> This hair masque was good but I feel it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I most likely won&#x27;t be purchasing again because it is expensive and I have found better masques for under $5.</li>
            <li> Horrible, i used it all and that didnt help me at all, i wasted my money, i prefer use any regular repair masque ship and mayne will work better than this.,., do not waste your money...</li>
            <li> And I only use this once a week (because i usually only wash my hair once a week) and it helps with keeping my hair smooth, but make sure you leave it in for the right amount of time (7 min) or I&#x27;m pretty sure it won&#x27;t work. I usually just put it in at the end of my shower, get out of the shower and get dressed then go to the kitchen sink and rinse it out. If you leave it in to long it starts to tingle, or at least my scalp did. It doesn&#x27;r really do much for my kinky roots between relaxers. The size is pretty good fpor the price, considering you&#x27;re only supposed to deep condition once a week It will last you a good two months depending on hair length (mine is  just above shoulder). And a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t think you have to glob on a handful ! Just put a little and comb it through!</li>
            <li> This stuff brought my hair back too life!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, it dried it out more than before I used it. i ordered because ive heard alot of reviews saying how great it was. I don&#x27;t know if it was the fake rip off or if it was the real thing...</li>
            <li> This is the best my hair has felt in years. This stuff smells amazing, and it completely transforms your hair. I literally cannot stop touching my hair, its so silky and smooth. On the packaging it says to leave it in for 5 or so minutes I think, but you should definitely leave it in longer if you can. Run it through the lengths of your hair, tie your hair up and wrap it in a plastic bag and leave it in for 20-45 minutes and the results will thrill you. No need to use any other type of conditioner, this stuff is the bees knees. Definitely buying again.</li>
            <li> Was told by a friend that this is her holy grail, well not mine. It ok!</li>
            <li> The absolute best product! !</li>
            <li> It works really well. All my frizz is gone :)</li>
            <li> Another great product. It performed as expected. Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lil more conditioned feeling hair and it reminded me of a regular conditioner not a deep treatment..would not recommend only because of how expensive it is. I have kinky hair. This product does have a great smell tho.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Try it. Good.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Got it, and waited to review since I&#x27;ve tested it. At first, it came very dry and didn&#x27;t really look like the product but it smelled exactly like it. After a few days it went back to it&#x27;s naturally pearl cream (ignore the spiky part on the last photo, the cream was set at a weird position) and tried it on my hair this past month and it&#x27;s perfect! It is the real thing and would definitely try it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I am blonde and regularly dye my hair...I also workout everyday and my hair takes a beating...that being said I needed a deep conditioner to help my locks...and this is amazing!!  My hair is almost down to my waist and I use this once a week over night for a deep conditioning treatment.  I wake up to soft knot free, healthy looking hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a recommendation from one my favorite YouTubers (AllThatGlitters21: Elle Fowler). She was right on the money. I do have ethnic hair which is more coarse and curly than caucasian locks but this product delivers the right balance of softness and strength.  I have no issues at all with it and the smell is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price may seem high now but when you use the product, you will understand what you are actually getting: a great hair product that strengthens and cleanses hair, defrizzes and really fortifies the hairs individually making all of your hair in the best shape.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product I noticed the difference right away, I have long thin, wavy hair. I loved it but now as a few years have past I don&#x27;t find it does quite the same job as it did before. It may be because I&#x27;m use to it or it could be a formula change, I do still use it because I absolutely love the smell however I will continue to look for that miracle product.</li>
            <li> I just ran out of my first container of the deep repair masque and it was so good, I&#x27;m ready to buy more! This stuff is like butter, feels so smooth on your hair, and smells really good too. I love that it is has natural ingredients, and it makes my hair silky smooth every time I use it. I straighten my hair every few days and this really helps my hair from getting dry and damaged. Would definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
