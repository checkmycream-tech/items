            <li>For my scalp is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the best shampoo out there.</li>

            <li>This shampoo is very good shampoo for my hair</li>
            <li>great product, at a great price!  </li>
            <li>Great product, size and smell.</li>
            <li>They have changed formulas a couple times and I have noticed but not cared too greatly.</li>
            <li>and the shampoo of course is great.  </li>
            <li>Everything was great with my order and met my expectations.</li>
            <li>(do NOT get this stuff in your eyes lol)</li>
            <li>and this is a great deal on the Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li>Oh well, it was great while it lasted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>it has a great scent to it as well.</li>
            <li>However, Virgin Coconut Oil is very effective against dandruff that it works like a miracle but inconvenience in using it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mystery to me that a company would take a perfectly good product and ruin it by changing the formula.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good price here (with the sub &amp; save option)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the product.</li>
            <li>And the price is good for the size they are.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>This product is good.</li>
            <li>Good</li>

            <li>Purchased through subscribe and save, and saved a good amount through Amazon.  </li>

            <li>so it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>arent as good as this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Works great for my hair, been using this for a number of years, will continue to buy for meany more years</li>
            <li>Great value, came with two huge bottles of head and shoulders.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how amazing I feel now.</li>
            <li>reason this H&amp;S is popular is because of marketing</li>
            <li>but it is not that effective.</li>
            <li>I am using Noble shampoo as well as Noble face soap for seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>i am now dandruff free and it feels good.</li>
            <li>By far the best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>cheap and good quality bought this when it cost 2 for 13.97 dollar</li>
            <li>I used to get many compliments on how shiny and silky my hair was.</li>
            <li>The price is unbeatable, and head &amp; shoulders is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>A heck of a better way to shop.  </li>
            <li>We love Head &amp; Shoulders in our house, so I decided to try ordering it through Subscribe &amp; Save.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It works well and it is more affordable than some choices.</li>
            <li>Love the product and this is the way to purchase.  </li>
            <li>I love head and shoulders</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s an even better deal.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, totally recommended.!</li>
            <li>Seems most stores are going to the combination conditioner and shampoo which leaves my hair oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using at the shoulders for a number of years and not having to deal with frills that many shampoos off</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>Love head and shoulders</li>
            <li>so I guess it must do what it promises or she wouldn&#x27;t continue to buy more.</li>
            <li>But, the top of one of the bottles broke, and about 5% of the contents spilled out into the bag it was enclosed in.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will work fine</li>
            <li>If some people like the new formula then fine, but why stop offering the original formula to the people who were loyal to the brand and very happy with it??</li>
            <li>Does what it claims, which is becoming scarcer and scarcer.</li>
            <li>It has been many orders of this item - i enjoy everything about it the smell, after shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a lifelong search to find the perfect shampoo.</li>
            <li>I used H &amp; S shampoo classic clean for many years ( even though I have never had dandruff ) because I loved the way it performed on my hair.</li>
            <li>makes my hear feel thicker and more full, my family has a history of thinning hair and this shampoo has always helped me keep some...</li>
            <li>And all of those years the shampoo didn&#x27;t really have any smell, which I liked.</li>
            <li>Well I enjoy using this shampoo because it helps me with my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li>So I cut back, which seemed to work great for my youthful skin purposes.  </li>
            <li>it is comfortable.</li>
            <li>It ships for free</li>
            <li>This is a great purchase it saves a lot of money compared to buying 2 regular sized bottles at about 9 dollars</li>
            <li>Rinses easily and leaves you feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>It helps to clean the oil from hair efficiently.</li>
            <li>Clean hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair looking clean and lustrous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been relying on Head&amp;Shoulders Clean forever.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s full of chemicals and the company uses animal testing.  </li>
            <li>I found another shampoo that I like better than your new formula but not as well as your original formula.</li>
            <li>If this were the last available shampoo on the planet, I would probably resort to making my own.</li>
            <li>This shampoo keeps your hair not only flake free but it has a nice scent too.</li>
            <li>As always excellent for my male short hair cut.</li>
            <li>I think it leaves a fresh clean smell that never disappointing.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy and delivered right to your door.  </li>
            <li>Huge size and more than enough to hold you over.</li>
            <li>and they indeed confirmed that the formula has changed and the old formula is no longer available.</li>
            <li>With regular use, this stuff keeps my scalp mostly dandruff free.</li>
            <li>When I contacted Amazon&#x27;s customer service about it, they shipped a replacement RIGHT AWAY.  </li>
            <li>It comes right to my home.</li>
            <li>Excllent serivce got product right away</li>
            <li>The classic clean smell is my favorite, just like the old stuff.</li>
            <li>and I was so amazed by how soft and healthy my hair looked it does not have a strong odor like many other dandruff shampoos</li>
            <li>It works great after 2 days of using it, it helps me from shedding so much dandruff and less itchiness.</li>
            <li>I am a notorious flaker but you can bet your bottom dollar that has nothing to do with my thick, beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>If H &amp; S cares to know, sadly I am no longer using your product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21, and now I&#x27;m finally dandruff free!</li>
            <li>Head and shoulders shampoo, came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>At first, I did not care since I was a kid.  </li>
            <li>i dont know the exact word for it...</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I felt the tingle all over my head</li>
            <li>This is the first time anything like this has happened.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li>With this new revision, some kind of fragrance was introduced into the formula which frankly makes it smell like toilet cleaner.</li>
            <li>And fairly good price for such a big bottle.</li>
            <li>This was a positive experience.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp like many shampoos do.</li>
            <li>Another option with less chemicals is Noble shampoo.</li>
            <li>each these bottles are way bigger and last a lot longer very satisfied</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through other anti-dandruff shampoos in the past, but still find that H&amp;S works the best.</li>
            <li>head and shoulders is the only dandruff shampoo our family uses, but I don&#x27;t like the design of the cap which hurt the quick of my right thumb when opening it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>My hair always had body and felt very silky.</li>
            <li>I struggled with dandruff my whole life.</li>
            <li>Keeps the whole families dandruff at bay.  </li>
            <li>Cheap price on a basic.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t require much on your head.</li>
            <li>It really cleans the scalp.</li>
            <li>If you will please offer the old formula I will gladly come back.</li>
            <li>I would have been better off throwing 8 bucks directly into the toilet and flushing it.</li>
            <li>Helps to keep your hair clean and manageable with regular use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and that is super helpful!</li>
            <li>After the first time using this shampoo, I got out of the shower and noticed my hair had a sticky residue near my scalp.</li>
            <li>stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh, and this original formula smells thousands of times better than the apparently-popular Green Apple scent which has infected the shelves at my local Costco.</li>
            <li>I blow dried my hair and for the rest of the day I could my hair was thicker, smoother and even has more volume.</li>
            <li>I have washed my hair twice with regular suave and it&#x27;s getting better each time but still not completely gone.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate dandruff and a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not dogmatic about these things, but I think they could try a bit harder to make an animal and earth friendly product.</li>
            <li>i would recommend this product to anyone else looking for a new shampoo</li>
            <li>I used many other brands that within my budget for regular use and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li>First and last time I order shampoo on the internet.</li>
            <li>this shampoo is way better than the old shampoos  that i had in the past.</li>
            <li>and when I got out of the shower, I saw my scalp was pure white, no redness in sight.</li>
            <li>I use the large bottles to fill a smaller bottom I bought in a store.</li>
            <li>That makes no sense when H &amp; S is now offering many different types of shampoo but no original formula.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of when Coca Cola changed their 100 year old formula.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, one of the bottles had leaked, BUT it&#x27;s packaged in a sealed plastic bag, there was no mess anywhere else</li>
            <li>This review is for head and shoulders classic as a back acne cure.</li>
            <li>I compared the ingredients from the old bottle to the new bottle and they are not the same</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous things for years with minimal success.</li>
            <li>No other shampoo comes close to this shampoo in terms of cleaning hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I know this because I recently found an old bottle from 2006.</li>
            <li>worries though, this product fixed it, and I still only shower a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li>, my hair almost instantly became shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It only took 2 uses to become completely flake-free.</li>
            <li>This has been the only thing I have found to clear back acne.</li>
            <li>I had to wash my hair several times with what was left of my old shampoo bottle just to rinse the smell out.</li>
            <li>Keeps my scalp from itching, and no dry flakes, either.  </li>
            <li>The odd thing is the labels are EXACTLY THE SAME.</li>

            <li> This shampoo works pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li> With this new revision, some kind of fragrance was introduced into the formula which frankly makes it smell like toilet cleaner.</li>
            <li> And fairly good price for such a big bottle.</li>
            <li> This was a positive experience.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp like many shampoos do.</li>
            <li> Another option with less chemicals is Noble shampoo.</li>
            <li> each these bottles are way bigger and last a lot longer very satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through other anti-dandruff shampoos in the past, but still find that H&amp;S works the best.</li>
            <li> head and shoulders is the only dandruff shampoo our family uses, but I don&#x27;t like the design of the cap which hurt the quick of my right thumb when opening it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> My hair always had body and felt very silky.</li>
            <li> I struggled with dandruff my whole life.</li>
            <li> Keeps the whole families dandruff at bay.  </li>
            <li> Cheap price on a basic.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t require much on your head.</li>
            <li> It really cleans the scalp.</li>
            <li> If you will please offer the old formula I will gladly come back.</li>
            <li> I would have been better off throwing 8 bucks directly into the toilet and flushing it.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep your hair clean and manageable with regular use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and that is super helpful!</li>
            <li> After the first time using this shampoo, I got out of the shower and noticed my hair had a sticky residue near my scalp.</li>
            <li> stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh, and this original formula smells thousands of times better than the apparently-popular Green Apple scent which has infected the shelves at my local Costco.</li>
            <li> I blow dried my hair and for the rest of the day I could my hair was thicker, smoother and even has more volume.</li>
            <li> I have washed my hair twice with regular suave and it&#x27;s getting better each time but still not completely gone.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate dandruff and a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not dogmatic about these things, but I think they could try a bit harder to make an animal and earth friendly product.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product to anyone else looking for a new shampoo</li>
            <li> I used many other brands that within my budget for regular use and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> First and last time I order shampoo on the internet.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is way better than the old shampoos  that i had in the past.</li>
            <li> and when I got out of the shower, I saw my scalp was pure white, no redness in sight.</li>
            <li> I use the large bottles to fill a smaller bottom I bought in a store.</li>
            <li> That makes no sense when H &amp; S is now offering many different types of shampoo but no original formula.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of when Coca Cola changed their 100 year old formula.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, one of the bottles had leaked, BUT it&#x27;s packaged in a sealed plastic bag, there was no mess anywhere else</li>
            <li> This review is for head and shoulders classic as a back acne cure.</li>
            <li> I compared the ingredients from the old bottle to the new bottle and they are not the same</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous things for years with minimal success.</li>
            <li> No other shampoo comes close to this shampoo in terms of cleaning hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I know this because I recently found an old bottle from 2006.</li>
            <li> worries though, this product fixed it, and I still only shower a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> , my hair almost instantly became shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It only took 2 uses to become completely flake-free.</li>
            <li> This has been the only thing I have found to clear back acne.</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hair several times with what was left of my old shampoo bottle just to rinse the smell out.</li>
            <li> Keeps my scalp from itching, and no dry flakes, either.  </li>
            <li> The odd thing is the labels are EXACTLY THE SAME.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like showers and hygiene, but it occurred to me that I&#x27;m not as greasy as I used to be, and if I want to maintain healthy, youthful skin, I shouldn&#x27;t dry it out showering every day like I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had dandruff problems until the last few months when I realized that I&#x27;ve gotten old enough to not need to shower every day.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s taking a while for my scalp to adjust (minor itching)</li>
            <li> and my long hair was looking terrible, so I picked up my first ever bottle of H&amp;S Classic Clean shampoo.</li>
            <li> It can make my hair slightly dry</li>
            <li> The difference is that after shampooing with H&amp;S my dandruff becomes flaky and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve continuously used this product for my dry scalp and it works well.</li>
            <li> This version of Head and Shoulders doesn&#x27;t sting your head and I would recommend for anyone who has dry scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not just for dandruff it helps relieve itchy dry scalp as well as dandruff.</li>
            <li> My dandruff was mild to moderate, never anything crazy.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with dandruff since I was roughly 9.  </li>
            <li> I have been applying H&amp;S to a loofah and letting it stay on my back for a few minutes in the shower.</li>
            <li> I think I either got a bad batch or they mysteriously changed formula with the same exact labels.</li>
            <li> Then, I decided to use other dandruff products, but they did not work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure entirely what is going on here.</li>
            <li> I am now in the process of searching and changing my shampoo to an organic on due to my thinning hair which prompted me aggressively to search for remedies and also pushing me to ditch this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Hair stylists over the past several years told me to buy sulfate-free shampoo, and I&#x27;ve tried 4 high-end brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but these tend to leave my scalp itchy, red and almost &amp;#34;spongy&amp;#34; so it scabs</li>
            <li> and I used other shampoos but other shampoos</li>
            <li> Yeah, I noticed when I had flakes on my dark jacket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knocked one star off because I still find it slightly harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> The pyrithione zinc is known for anti bacterial properties as well as clearing away dead skin.</li>
            <li> As a shampoo it does work for seborrheic dermatitis, but I do think it can be harsh on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I will write a review on that after a few weeks with my results.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used H&amp;S in the past, I do believe they&#x27;ve revamped the formula to smell less medicinal</li>
            <li> but, no more dandruff.</li>
            <li> The sad thing is that all the knock offs have followed suit, and now also have a smell distinctly reminiscent of a urinal cake...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still the least harsh out of all the anti-dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve used though.</li>
            <li> I use Virgin Coconut Oil before shampooing but not often because it is to thick and greasy and takes a lot of my time because I have to let it settle in my scalp for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I keep a small container in my toiletry bag and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li> Buy one small container and refill it when needed.  </li>
            <li> After shampooing with Head &amp; shoulders and appling a small dab of Paul Mitch Conditioner all is well.</li>
            <li> One thing I discovered upon my search is that Head and Shoulders contains sulfates which is not good.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is a clumsy and difficult shape to handle.</li>
            <li> But it was so badly packed half the contents of the bottle spilled out while it was being transported in the mail.</li>
            <li> However something is wrong here.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used H &amp; S shampoo classic clean for many years ( even though I have never had dandruff ) because I loved the way it performed on my hair. My hair always had body and felt very silky. I used to get many compliments on how shiny and silky my hair was. I would always tell people that it was the head and shoulders shampoo. A while back all of that stopped. I thought something had changed about my hair. Not so. They have changed the formula. I know this because I recently found an old bottle from 2006. When I used it, EUREKA!!, my hair felt like it used to feel. I compared the ingredients from the old bottle to the new bottle and they are not the same so I called the company and they indeed confirmed that the formula has changed and the old formula is no longer available. What a shame!! It&#x27;s a mystery to me that a company would take a perfectly good product and ruin it by changing the formula. If some people like the new formula then fine, but why stop offering the original formula to the people who were loyal to the brand and very happy with it?? That makes no sense when H &amp; S is now offering many different types of shampoo but no original formula. Reminds me of when Coca Cola changed their 100 year old formula. It was a disaster for them. If H &amp; S cares to know, sadly I am no longer using your product. I found another shampoo that I like better than your new formula but not as well as your original formula. If you will please offer the old formula I will gladly come back.</li>
            <li> I used to use this but I moved away from it for a while. My dandruff got out of control so I went back and it&#x27;s taking a while for my scalp to adjust (minor itching) but, no more dandruff.</li>
            <li> What else do you want me to say? I like H&amp;S, it&#x27;s a good price here (with the sub &amp; save option) and I get it shipped regularly. Nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> I have been using Head and Shoulders for years. And all of those years the shampoo didn&#x27;t really have any smell, which I liked. With this new revision, some kind of fragrance was introduced into the formula which frankly makes it smell like toilet cleaner. The sad thing is that all the knock offs have followed suit, and now also have a smell distinctly reminiscent of a urinal cake... Maybe it is just a man thing though...</li>
            <li> I struggled with dandruff my whole life. I used many other brands that within my budget for regular use and nothing worked. I&#x27;m 21, and now I&#x27;m finally dandruff free!</li>
            <li> I am sure it will work fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the product. Huge size and more than enough to hold you over. Will continue to purchase product</li>
            <li> The price is unbeatable, and head &amp; shoulders is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate dandruff and a sensitive scalp. I&#x27;ve gone through other anti-dandruff shampoos in the past, but still find that H&amp;S works the best. I knocked one star off because I still find it slightly harsh on my hair. It can make my hair slightly dry so I use a leave-in conditioner. It&#x27;s still the least harsh out of all the anti-dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve used though. If you&#x27;ve used H&amp;S in the past, I do believe they&#x27;ve revamped the formula to smell less medicinal (I think it smells like cucumbers).</li>
            <li> Head and shoulders shampoo, came exactly as described. i am now dandruff free and it feels good. also works as regular shampoo</li>
            <li> Well I enjoy using this shampoo because it helps me with my dandruff problem. It works great after 2 days of using it, it helps me from shedding so much dandruff and less itchiness. I wouldn&#x27;t want to replace it. And the price is good for the size they are.</li>
            <li> great product, at a great price!  thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> I had a problem with dandruff since I was roughly 9.  At first, I did not care since I was a kid.  Then, I decided to use other dandruff products, but they did not work.  Ever since I started to use Head and Shoulders, I have not had a problem.  Does what it claims, which is becoming scarcer and scarcer.</li>
            <li> Great product, size and smell.</li>
            <li> makes my hear feel thicker and more full, my family has a history of thinning hair and this shampoo has always helped me keep some... i dont know the exact word for it... volume to my hair</li>
            <li> This product does what it says.  I&#x27;ve never had dandruff problems until the last few months when I realized that I&#x27;ve gotten old enough to not need to shower every day.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like showers and hygiene, but it occurred to me that I&#x27;m not as greasy as I used to be, and if I want to maintain healthy, youthful skin, I shouldn&#x27;t dry it out showering every day like I was a teenager.  So I cut back, which seemed to work great for my youthful skin purposes.  BUT dandruff started to develop.  Yeah, I noticed when I had flakes on my dark jacket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No worries though, this product fixed it, and I still only shower a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> It is a good product. It helps to clean the oil from hair efficiently. And fairly good price for such a big bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure entirely what is going on here. I have been using this shampoo for probably 15 years. They have changed formulas a couple times and I have noticed but not cared too greatly. However something is wrong here. I think I either got a bad batch or they mysteriously changed formula with the same exact labels. I have a big bottle I bought at Sams club and just finished going through it and got around to using this one from amazon. It smells horrible. I had to wash my hair several times with what was left of my old shampoo bottle just to rinse the smell out. The odd thing is the labels are EXACTLY THE SAME. I have a second bottle because it came in a two-pack, I will try that one also and report back.</li>
            <li> A heck of a better way to shop.  I did not have to haul them from the store and I no longers run out.</li>
            <li> This product is good. But it was so badly packed half the contents of the bottle spilled out while it was being transported in the mail. Also, the bottle is a clumsy and difficult shape to handle.</li>
            <li> We love Head &amp; Shoulders in our house, so I decided to try ordering it through Subscribe &amp; Save.  I had concerns about it leaking but thought I&#x27;d try it out.  When it arrived, one of the bottles had leaked, BUT it&#x27;s packaged in a sealed plastic bag, there was no mess anywhere else but in the bag.  When I contacted Amazon&#x27;s customer service about it, they shipped a replacement RIGHT AWAY.  Any worries I had about buying shampoo from Amazon have gone.  I will keep it on my Subscribe &amp; Save list, and I recommend this product (and Amazon&#x27;s customer service) to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head and Shoulders for almost ten years coupled with another anti-dandruff conditioner, I always have a dandruff no matter what. The difference is that after shampooing with H&amp;S my dandruff becomes flaky and dry. Never helped me in those ten years. I am now in the process of searching and changing my shampoo to an organic on due to my thinning hair which prompted me aggressively to search for remedies and also pushing me to ditch this shampoo. One thing I discovered upon my search is that Head and Shoulders contains sulfates which is not good. WHen my dandruff is severe I use Virgin Coconut Oil before shampooing but not often because it is to thick and greasy and takes a lot of my time because I have to let it settle in my scalp for a few minutes. However, Virgin Coconut Oil is very effective against dandruff that it works like a miracle but inconvenience in using it makes me not use it that often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason this H&amp;S is popular is because of marketing but it is not that effective.</li>
            <li> Great value, came with two huge bottles of head and shoulders. Works just like the product sold in stores. Save some cash.</li>
            <li> Keeps the whole families dandruff at bay.  I love it.  The classic clean smell is my favorite, just like the old stuff.</li>
            <li> It has been many orders of this item - i enjoy everything about it the smell, after shower. it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Clean hair. No dandruff. Lots of shine. Bouncin&#x27; and behavin&#x27;. Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh, and this original formula smells thousands of times better than the apparently-popular Green Apple scent which has infected the shelves at my local Costco. If I wanted to smell like a rotting fruit tree, I&#x27;d be wearing Lalique.)</li>
            <li> Got dandruff? Know someone who does? Head and shoulders is always a good choice. It works well and it is more affordable than some choices. Don&#x27;t want to be called snowflake? Order some head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Love the product and this is the way to purchase.  Fast and easy and delivered right to your door.  This is the the way to do your shopping.  and the shampoo of course is great.  But the home delivery is the greatest.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with the product is in the packaging design. Upon removing it from shipping, I noticed that the plastic cap was broken.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it suppose to.</li>
            <li> I love head and shoulders neither I nor my husband have a problem with dandruff but after researching all different kinds of shampoo I kept coming across the head and shoulders. So I gave it a try, my hair almost instantly became shiny and soft. I have color treated hair and I was so amazed by how soft and healthy my hair looked it does not have a strong odor like many other dandruff shampoos so people wont even tell you are using. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp like many shampoos do. I would recommend this product even if you don&#x27;t have dandruff.</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair, been using this for a number of years, will continue to buy for meany more years</li>
            <li> Cheap price on a basic. Arrived undamaged and in factory packaging. I subscribe &amp; save to this item so it&#x27;s an even better deal.</li>
            <li> Repeat customer, the product delivers as advertised</li>
            <li> Excellent product, totally recommended.!</li>
            <li> this shampoo is way better than the old shampoos  that i had in the past. i would recommend this product to anyone else looking for a new shampoo</li>
            <li> Everything was great with my order and met my expectations. I&#x27;ve continuously used this product for my dry scalp and it works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad to use. It does what it says, takes away the dandruff as it should</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Shampoo products over the years and I always come back to head and shoulders. This two in one also helps condition and wash the hair</li>
            <li> I am a notorious flaker but you can bet your bottom dollar that has nothing to do with my thick, beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> I have bought this shampoo several times. Keeps the dandruff away. Doesn&#x27;t require much on your head. Leaves you smelling good.</li>
            <li> This was a positive experience. Product was just as advertised and seller response was prompt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a lifelong search to find the perfect shampoo. Hair stylists over the past several years told me to buy sulfate-free shampoo, and I&#x27;ve tried 4 high-end brands. I&#x27;m not sure why, but these tend to leave my scalp itchy, red and almost &amp;#34;spongy&amp;#34; so it scabs when I scratch.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and my long hair was looking terrible, so I picked up my first ever bottle of H&amp;S Classic Clean shampoo. I can&#x27;t get over how amazing I feel now. The first time I used it, I felt the tingle all over my head (do NOT get this stuff in your eyes lol) and when I got out of the shower, I saw my scalp was pure white, no redness in sight. I blow dried my hair and for the rest of the day I could my hair was thicker, smoother and even has more volume. It only took 2 uses to become completely flake-free.</li>
            <li> Love this, but it is difficult to find.  Seems most stores are going to the combination conditioner and shampoo which leaves my hair oily.</li>
            <li> Purchased through subscribe and save, and saved a good amount through Amazon.  This version of Head and Shoulders doesn&#x27;t sting your head and I would recommend for anyone who has dry scalp.</li>
            <li> This product does the job for me in preventing dandruff and scalp itch.  It is also a good value.  I use the large bottles to fill a smaller bottom I bought in a store.</li>
            <li> For my scalp is an excellent product. Leaves the hair looking clean and lustrous. I&#x27;ve been using at the shoulders for a number of years and not having to deal with frills that many shampoos off</li>
            <li> This review is for head and shoulders classic as a back acne cure. This has been the only thing I have found to clear back acne. I have tried numerous things for years with minimal success. I have been applying H&amp;S to a loofah and letting it stay on my back for a few minutes in the shower. Acne GONE within a week. The pyrithione zinc is known for anti bacterial properties as well as clearing away dead skin. As a shampoo it does work for seborrheic dermatitis, but I do think it can be harsh on the scalp. Another option with less chemicals is Noble shampoo. I am using Noble shampoo as well as Noble face soap for seborrheic dermatitis. I will write a review on that after a few weeks with my results. Bottom line - for back acne this stuff works..</li>
            <li> Item was as described</li>
            <li> What can we say about Head &amp; shoulders shampoo?  It is what it is and works like a charm.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else, or any &amp;#34;lesser brand&amp;#34; for my dear husband!</li>
            <li> Keeps my scalp from itching, and no dry flakes, either.  Glad I tried it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and that is super helpful!</li>
            <li> Same product I would have gotten at the store at the SMS spruce with out the hassle of gong lout.</li>
            <li> I never had any of the issues some of the reviewers had with this shampoo leaving residue on the hair.  This seems like the regular one I used to buy at the drug store so I have no problem with it.</li>
            <li> By far the best shampoo I have ever used. 5 star!! Even if I have short hair, I go with nothing else,</li>
            <li> This shampoo is horrible. If this were the last available shampoo on the planet, I would probably resort to making my own. After the first time using this shampoo, I got out of the shower and noticed my hair had a sticky residue near my scalp. It caused my hair to look greasy and feel sticky and crunchy at the same time. I have washed my hair twice with regular suave and it&#x27;s getting better each time but still not completely gone. I would have been better off throwing 8 bucks directly into the toilet and flushing it. Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> Love head and shoulders and this is a great deal on the Subscribe and Save. I was recently informed that it is no longer being offered on S&amp;S though. Oh well, it was great while it lasted.</li>
            <li> If I stop using it for a couple of months, I get flaky, Head and Shoulders should be a pre-wash treatment if you don&#x27;t like the smell. I think it leaves a fresh clean smell that never disappointing.</li>
            <li> My dandruff was mild to moderate, never anything crazy. I&#x27;ve tried every type of head and shoulders to help and none work. I played around with the amount of product used, the time I left it in, no results. Started using omega 3 and dandruff is gone but it comes back if I forget.</li>
            <li> This shampoo keeps your hair not only flake free but it has a nice scent too. I get this through amazons subscribe and save program. It ships for free and I don&#x27;t have to fight the crowds. It comes right to my home. It costs about the same so it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised</li>

            <li> Excllent serivce got product right away</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom. She&#x27;s been using it for years so I guess it must do what it promises or she wouldn&#x27;t continue to buy more.</li>
            <li> First and last time I order shampoo on the internet. (I&#x27;m a college student outside of his hometown without a car.) It arrived promptly and whatnot. But, the top of one of the bottles broke, and about 5% of the contents spilled out into the bag it was enclosed in. This is the first time anything like this has happened.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best shampoo out there. No other shampoo comes close to this shampoo in terms of cleaning hair and scalp. This shampoo is very good shampoo for my hair and I used other shampoos but other shampoos arent as good as this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works pretty well for me.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s full of chemicals and the company uses animal testing.  Hey, I use it and I&#x27;m not dogmatic about these things, but I think they could try a bit harder to make an animal and earth friendly product.</li>
            <li> head and shoulders is the only dandruff shampoo our family uses, but I don&#x27;t like the design of the cap which hurt the quick of my right thumb when opening it in the shower.  I just thought the company that makes the container should know that.&lt;br /&gt;M.J.Jurista</li>
            <li> As always excellent for my male short hair cut.</li>
            <li> If you like the product, retail stores can&#x27;t compete.  It lasts if you buy quantity.  It&#x27;s a great product.  I keep a small container in my toiletry bag and use it all the time.  I travel a lot,  Buy one small container and refill it when needed.  Sold.</li>
            <li> This is a great purchase it saves a lot of money compared to buying 2 regular sized bottles at about 9 dollars each these bottles are way bigger and last a lot longer very satisfied</li>
            <li> I swim every week day in a public pool which destroyed my ability to style my hair. After shampooing with Head &amp; shoulders and appling a small dab of Paul Mitch Conditioner all is well.</li>
            <li> cheap and good quality bought this when it cost 2 for 13.97 dollar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been relying on Head&amp;Shoulders Clean forever. It is the best shampoo whether you struggle with dandruf or not. It really cleans the scalp.</li>
            <li> With regular use, this stuff keeps my scalp mostly dandruff free. It works well on my beard and eyebrows too.</li>
            <li> if you use head &amp; shoulders then you know it works. This shampoo is not just for dandruff it helps relieve itchy dry scalp as well as dandruff. it has a great scent to it as well.</li>
