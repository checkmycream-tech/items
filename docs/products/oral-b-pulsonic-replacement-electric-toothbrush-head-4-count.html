            <li>Visits to the dentist confirm that my gums and teeth are healthy and getting a good workout.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy them on site, but the pricing on Amazon is good,</li>
            <li>the toothbrush is great for getting teeth clean and keeping plaque off.  </li>
            <li>My dentist always give me good marks for clean teeth!</li>

            <li>So glad you sell them at an amazing price.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare brush feels like it&#x27;s more effective at cleaning below the gums.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>so I was happy they were the right ones.  </li>
            <li>Very quick!</li>
            <li>very good, but it is so powerful you must use a light touch and let the brush do the work</li>
            <li>Perfect, fast and cheap</li>
            <li>They clean well and the gum attachment does a good job of minimizing build up at the gum line.  </li>
            <li>so I get them on here and am able to keep my old toothbrush running great!</li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery!</li>
            <li>So apparently it&#x27;s one of the best brushes around, and</li>
            <li>These fit a wonderfully slender model introduced some years ago--I adore it and pray they never, ever, quit making new brush heads!</li>
            <li>Very smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>Good price quick shipping.</li>
            <li>These heads fit perfect and made it like new again.</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast and these were the perfect ones I needed...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchasing these replacements via the subscription program provides a huge savings over the store price of $29-$28 per package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to find these to replace my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I bought my Oral-B Pulsonic while overseas and love the size and function of it</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how my day was going to start or end unless I found these replacement Pulsonic brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Oral-B Pulsonic for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Will be sure to deal with them again.</li>
            <li>we love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I love the oral b pulsonic.</li>
            <li>Fit the Pulsonic as stated!  </li>
            <li>so I was able to try another option before returning the toothbrush</li>
            <li>so glad I didn&#x27;t have to do that.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than a manual toothbrush, when you use it correctly and not just keep it encased in toothpaste residue like slobs and leave it uncharged, unchanged for a decade.</li>
            <li>Its a brush head that works like it a brush head :)</li>
            <li>But I am glad Amazon hs it.</li>
            <li>I love my Oral B Pulsonic.</li>
            <li>If your considering it, buy one, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Love Oral B Pulsonic</li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush and love Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have both the Sonicare and Oral-B Pulsonic tooth brushes and like the Sonicare much better.</li>
            <li>I was able to save about $10 on each package by buying through amazon and ended up getting two packages.  </li>
            <li>Will know for sure it is working after my</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found them here.</li>
            <li>because this is my favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li>ok I have to put 4 more words.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon sells them and</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>However, Im glad I can go online to purchase and in bundles.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>The size of the toothbrush head is perfect---much better coverage than others.</li>
            <li>, THINK YOU COULD DO A BETTER JOB.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found them.  </li>
            <li>They do not--they don&#x27;t even come close to fitting -- and now I&#x27;m out more than $20 because I opened the package and can&#x27;t return these toothbrush heads that I can&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li>I love my Pulsonic Tooth Brush...</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m glad that I can find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>So pleased to find the brush replacements for my Pulsonic.  </li>
            <li>Was able to use my Pulsonic again and already getting compliments on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Feels like you just went to dentist, I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love my Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush and Amazon</li>
            <li>I was glad to turn to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Will be reordering more.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li>We love the Pulsonic toothbrush.</li>

            <li>Love my tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I love my toothbrush</li>
            <li>I love my electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>but we love the toothbrush so we decided to have them shipped to us.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>This piece of cork filled the space nicely between the brush head and handle and the problem is solved.</li>
            <li>I found this product very compatible and great value.</li>
            <li>And be sure to buy thru amazon and not another.</li>
            <li>I hope manufacturer bundles this in a six pack or more for additional savings.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Patrick : )</li>

            <li>More because I got two replacements.  </li>
            <li>I was really glad to find replacement brushes for my electric toothbrus.</li>
            <li>So glad to find them on amazon.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush that these go to is our favorite of any we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Glad I found these</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I found it online</li>
            <li>I love the brush but</li>
            <li>I love the Pulsonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t have two more days to wait.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush design.</li>
            <li>So glad to find these here, as the stores no longer carry them.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>but I am able to get replacement brushes through Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did it because I do notice a better brush now.</li>
            <li>but we love our Pulsonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>What more can you say.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find these replacement heads in Target, WalMart, CVS, etc., but no longer seem to stock.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for over five years, I haven&#x27;t changed because I haven&#x27;t found anything better in the market.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I love the brush, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Replacement toothbrushes -- what more can be said.</li>
            <li>The oral b brushes for the pulsonic toothbrush are ptitty ok the mouth</li>
            <li>nine more words required five more words required one</li>
            <li>Love my Pulsonic and these replacement heads are a must.  </li>
            <li>I considered the aftermarket replacement heads, but I&#x27;m glad I purchased the ones endorsed by Oral-B.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s not been able to find replacements either.</li>
            <li>order again for sure.</li>
            <li>I have had the Pulsonic for many years now.</li>
            <li>Oral B has many models.</li>
            <li>So far, so good! :-)</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described at a fair price, what more can be said about this item to fill the required number of words.</li>
            <li>They clean our teeth as nicely as the originals did.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of like Goldilocks and the three bears, this one is JUST RIGHT!</li>
            <li>Fast easy and always have what I&#x27;m looking for at  great prices....</li>
            <li>and they were exactly what I needed and at a good price too.  </li>
            <li>Price was pretty fair too.</li>
            <li>I have used it and happy to recommend to new users.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and it was a joy to see that Amazon offers the replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush is still going strong after many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still going strong and I ordered one for the boyfriend as well :)</li>
            <li>Nice to write a &#x27;great product&#x27; review finally.</li>
            <li>These brushes were the right item, they were at a good price with free shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure these heads are fine if you have a Pulsonic toothbrush, but the product description incorrectly states that the brushes work with Oral-B Vitality Sonic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>They had 2 pack fo tooth brush alone, but overall this 4 count head is very good.  </li>
            <li>Hey, these replacement toothbrushes work in the most fantastic of ways.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, DON&#x27;T buy unless its \\&quot;SOLD\\&quot; \\&quot;AND\\&quot; \\&quot;FULFILLED\\&quot; by Amazon, there are many reports about cheap counterfeits here (</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get to wild about tooth brushes, but the Oral-B is great.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad these brushes fit my Pulsonic S 15.523.2.  </li>
            <li>(well, aside from the cheap battery powered ones) to compare to, I love this brush.</li>
            <li>These wear out faster than the free toothbrush the dentist give out and yet cost more than the &amp;#34;Super toothbrush 2000 with color changing flex bristles&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good price.</li>
            <li>Good value and fast service.</li>
            <li>good quality, fast service.</li>
            <li>He is very happy with it, and feels it does as good a job as the Sonicare, for less money, and it&#x27;s a whole lot quieter, too!</li>
            <li>These are just replacements, but this system really does a good job at keeping teeth clean and gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>Easy and reliable</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to keep track of which brush head is yours.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use, and not bulky at all.  </li>
            <li>While i have search for replacements for my Oral B toothbrush, but could not find them, Amazon made it extremely easy to get the product that I needed.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick.   </li>
            <li>Brushes are easy to remove and replace since both my husband and I are using it and</li>
            <li>The brushes arrived in perfect shape much more quickly than expected.  </li>
            <li>Well, it is still going strong and the never opened one</li>
            <li>This vendor had incredible prices and one of the fastest shipment time I have seen in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Or maybe they can provide separate packages for normal heads and precision ones so that people can choose how many they want for each kind.</li>
            <li>This product may be fine but it does not work with Vitality Sonic toothbrushes as described.</li>
            <li>one of the brushes is a fine tip</li>
            <li>Got this because my dental hygenist recommended it to help my gums-I went on a one week trip and just took the brush-the charge held up fine</li>
            <li>You have to have the exact same &amp;#34;Pulsonic&amp;#34; model toothbrush to use them, but from the reviews, it&#x27;s a great toothbrush!</li>
            <li>We received the heads very quickly and they fit the brush with no problem.</li>
            <li>The Pulsonic is a nice middle ground, with me doing a minimalist interpretation of the standard brushing motion and the machine providing supplementary brushes that greatly exceed anything I would be able to do on my own.</li>
            <li>Everything was fine with my order/delivery, with one exception.  </li>
            <li>They work fine.</li>
            <li>This product was fine.</li>
            <li>Worked fine as advertised.</li>
            <li>They work fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine but don&#x27;t need the water pik device that is included.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon for good pricing and reliable quick delivery</li>
            <li>They fit my Oral-B Pulsonic just fine.  </li>
            <li>They fit the toothbrush just fine.  </li>
            <li>Brushes fit fine.</li>
            <li>this toothbrush is way more cost effective than my old sonicare and works just as well.</li>
            <li>Product description was accurate and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Great value for a product I enjoy and use daily.</li>
            <li>this one don&#x27;t fit on my S26 toothbrush, and there is no information available about which model it does fit.</li>
            <li>I got Free shipping for my order.  </li>
            <li>Slim, easy to clean, compact, holds charge well (over a week), fits the hand well.</li>
            <li>The actual toothbrush overall is great and these replacement heads are great as well.</li>
            <li>The replacements I got fit correctly, and change the head out once a month.</li>
            <li>The Amazon description said it would fit my toothbrush and when it arrived the box</li>
            <li>they didn&#x27;t fit my toothbrush holder anyway.</li>
            <li>I also got a 15% discount for using Subscribe &amp; Save, which will send them to me automatically (with free shipping) at the interval I</li>
            <li>they fit the toothbrush as billed.</li>
            <li>The tooth brush head is a MUST have item that fits on my Oral-B Pulsonic handle because it isn&#x27;t available anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I saw these at such a great price that I bought 2 packs.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to return because they don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>We can no longer find these replacement heads locally and I was happy that I could find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>arrived fast , nicely packed what i was looking for to go with my toothbrush.. but prefer the oral b pro over pulsonic</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit snugly to the toothbrush</li>
            <li>For me, it means that there is too much space between the circular top of the handle and the circular bottom of the brush head so that the brush head does not stay on the handle but rather comes off in your mouth, The circular surface at the bottom of the the brush head and the circular surface at the top of the handle should fit snugly so that the brush head locks in place and cannot wiggle free.</li>
            <li>Works great and the package was the same as the days when I could.</li>
            <li>Some fit; some don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This tooth brush is easy to use and my teeth feel as clean when I step  out of the chair after a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Since they&#x27;re manufactured by Oral B, there&#x27;s no question on fit or function.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit our Oral B electric brushes.</li>
            <li>Fit the brushholder like it should and cleans like it should.</li>
            <li>These fit the toothbrush...</li>
            <li>I purchased the oral-b pulsonic electric toothbrush several years ago, and I am happy I can find replacement heads at amazon.</li>
            <li>The type of toothbrush is important.</li>
            <li>They do fit the Oral B pulsonic brush.  </li>
            <li>Mine were good and soft...</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a month so far so good.</li>
            <li>And this one is the most comfortable, with the right sized heads for my mouth.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to brush for the full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Also it is very rare to find this replacement at stores.</li>
            <li>These are the original item by Oral-B and they fit like the original.</li>
            <li>small attachments fit perfect</li>
            <li>This review is not so much about the heads themselves, (any new toothbrush head is always going to feel great), as it is about the ease of finding replacements on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Amazon has provided the usual excellent shipment and handling.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are really feel real clean.</li>
            <li>Was an original product, not a knock off.</li>
            <li>It provide convenience and user friendly features.</li>
            <li>Brushes pull out sooner that with original Oral-B.</li>
            <li>They are exactly the brand you used to be able to get in the store, but</li>
            <li>These hard to find refills fit perfectly on my Pulsonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is nice having new bristles.</li>
            <li>Once I was finally able to contact them, the seller fixed the problem in a timely manner going out of their way to make sure that everything was done correctly.  </li>
            <li>Two packs of Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush Heads are required to keep a couple&#x27;s teeth consistently clean for six months.</li>
            <li>This is not something flowery it smells somewhere between clean and medicinal.</li>
            <li>The pointed head works well to help clean between the brackets on braces.  </li>
            <li>I like the clean feeling this toothbrush leaves my teeth feeling.</li>
            <li>When I use my toothbrush with these my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after use.</li>
            <li>So clean.  </li>
            <li>It has helped me clean up gum issues and I will continue to use this brush until it either dies</li>
            <li>These came quick and work fantastic on the toothbrush</li>
            <li>Though this product itself is amazing, nice firm yet gentle bristles worked amazingly in getting anything</li>
            <li>Excellent brush heads, just hard to find.</li>
            <li>Talk such as that makes the refills a good buy also.</li>
            <li>They are true Oral B replacements and work well.</li>
            <li>I use the pick style every day as well as the full size brush.</li>
            <li>It seems like the pick brush gets beat up before the full brush</li>
            <li>I wish the price was cheaper and they had 4 full sized toothbrush heads</li>
            <li>But after a while I end up with like 3 full replacements</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find them because they don&#x27;t seem to be in my local stores.</li>
            <li>Am i aloud to return them for a full refund?</li>
            <li>but otherwise its not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>Easy shopping for the brush heads on-line &amp; able to purchase enough to last a year or more!!</li>
            <li>Ok, doesn&#x27;t really feel like they&#x27;re able to clean your teeth completely.</li>
            <li>Received product quickly and no issues with anything.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li>These have loosened up too quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was quick and have had no problems with them</li>
            <li>I decided once again to search for replacement brushes one last time, within 30 seconds, amazing available...</li>
            <li>Product was packed well and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in my local stores any more.</li>
            <li>These are durable great quality brush heads that last much longer than any manual toothbrush or electronic toothbrush head</li>
            <li>Quick shipment.</li>
            <li>Shopped around for the most reasonable price and ordered right here on amazon because the price could not be beat.</li>
            <li>Feels much better with the new ones.</li>
            <li>So now my toothbrush is still working as well as it did when I first bought it!</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t use them myself, I order them regularly for my employers, and they love the Pulsonic!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I got exactly what i needed and when i needed it!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>suitable, not same as the original one within electric brush</li>
            <li>The description on Amazon says that it does work, but nowhere on the package does it indicate that it works with Vitality Sonic and the heads are too large to fit on the toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about how these would be, but the quality is great.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really need the little brushes, so it looks like a much better deal, but it was still a good price for the 2 that I wanted</li>
            <li>Thanks again, Amazon, for making products available that we might otherwise never find.</li>
            <li>I found these, they arrived in the mail in one day for free thanks to Amazon Prime, and now I can keep my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They hold up well and are the only kind I would use.</li>
            <li>and my mouth always feels fresh once I use it.  </li>
            <li>Good solid toothbrush that makes me have some real pearly whites.  </li>
            <li>I wish there were as many toothbrush tips as there were toothbrush heads in each package because I use both just as frequently.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the colored bands all that useful, except to keep water from getting under the head a little.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li>Glad I finally found these, and enjoyed the device and finally found the replacement parts, and really glad that I did.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I am convinced that it actually saves me money to own the Pulsonic electronic toothbrush because these heads are so durable and long-lasting, not to mention</li>
            <li>Economical too.</li>
            <li>Apparently there may be an overcharging problem, so it is suggested that every 6 months or so you should just let the battery run down without recharging-in any case I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Very slim, very powerful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many other sonic tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>love that Amazon had my tooth brush heads when no other store out there carries them plus a $3 off coupon - SOLD!</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush as it gets my teeth clean better than many other toothbrushes I have tried.</li>
            <li>Otherwise good value and these heads are becoming hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>This is for the person who is looking for &amp;#34;just the right thing&amp;#34; in this category.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new electric toothbrush--and a brush, I might add, that is my all-time favorite,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just upgrading to the unit these heads fit from an old Sonic Complete whose battery stopped being able to take a charge.</li>
            <li>not sure that&#x27;s a great deal</li>
            <li>She liked it a because it helped keep her braces and teeth extra clean, which is extra important in avoiding cavities while wearing orthodontia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I tried to purchase a new unit and found that they&#x27;ve disappeared from the land of available products.  </li>
            <li>and now I can continue to enjoy my Oral-B with new brushes.</li>
            <li>Searching all over for the right brushes, thank you they are exactly the one I needed.  </li>
            <li>These are high quality, original equipment.</li>
            <li>This vendor provided a couple of sets of four at reasonable price, and provided the sets quickly.</li>
            <li>thanks for your quick delievery</li>
            <li>Very much cheaper than in a store.  </li>
            <li>They are listed for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, my first 2 attempts to review wouldn&#x27;t post, so I decided to go over the edge to see if this one would.</li>
            <li>The brush heads were exactly as described and work for what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li>These sell for much,much more in local drug stores.  </li>
            <li>They appear to be an exact replacement for the originals.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I was glad I purchased the additional brush heads at the same time as the toothbrush as the brush head that came with it wouldn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li>The first time I bought one of their sonic units, I had brushes to spare after the unit died.  </li>
            <li>Other retailers charge quite a bit more for these replacement heads!</li>
            <li>Amazon had it and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly satisfied with my initial purchase of the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;CORRECT &amp; REASONABLY PRICED!</li>
            <li>My husband bought it for me when it first came out.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>These worked well and probably even cleaned my teeth, but the main toothbrush broke after only a year, so I&#x27;m not super impressed.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>Fits and works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>after shopping locally and purchasing replacements,&lt;br /&gt;it is better to save some $$$ and buy at Amazon.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted and</li>
            <li>Is the exact replacement product and appeared at my door promptly.</li>
            <li>I would be happier if I could buy the heads individually as I would like more precision heads.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed for my Pulsonic toothbrush and</li>
            <li>sure enough there they were</li>
            <li>Would gladly pay extra for the convenience.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these, but be sure you have the toothbrush specified.</li>
            <li>i was supposed to rip the top part to get the brush out, but mine was already ripped open for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller that most of the electric toothbrushes so not so bulky.</li>
            <li>Most people will not likely to use it.</li>
            <li>Back again for more.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>The first of these heads pinches my lip every now and then.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I got this toothbrush and use it regularly, my teeth have been super smooth.  </li>
            <li>Evidently this brand of electric toothbrushes isn&#x27;t as popular as other brands.  </li>
            <li>LOVE my pulsonic toothbrush, and the other members in my house quickly discovered it&#x27;s benefits too.  </li>
            <li>Refills are hard to find in stores, so we&#x27;re glad to be able to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Compared to the some of the other electric brushes sold in stores this is far superior when cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>When I finally gave up and came to Amazon I was pleased to not only find them, but also to find them much cheaper!!!</li>
            <li>I mean, they attach to your toothbrush and vibrate and clean your teeth nicely.</li>
            <li>I have order these same heads before and just like the first time, they work and fit like a charm</li>
            <li>the attachment area on the head is too large.</li>
            <li>Work great, the bristles were very hard but after about two weeks of use they have soften up a bit.</li>
            <li>This is a great little toothbrush, and this is the ONLY place to find these brushes!!</li>
            <li>Hard to find but product is good.</li>
            <li>However, for some reason these brush heads are hard to find, so I&#x27;m delighted I can order them.</li>
            <li>I enjoy brushing with my pulsonic toothbrush so much that I find that I actually brush longer.</li>
            <li>What are those?&amp;#34; hahaha</li>
            <li>I have braces so it really gets between the brackets.  </li>
            <li>and i really like it.  </li>
            <li>I like a high gloss polish on my teeth!</li>
            <li>bought the Oral-B (Braun) Pulsonic because its handle was much thinner than the Philips Sonicare product.  </li>
            <li>and it was very well packaged</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really give you an appreciation of the product, as I had to return it.  </li>
            <li>So the lesson is not to buy Oral-B electric brushes because they charge so much for replacements.  </li>
            <li>These only fit the pulsonic toothbrush--not the vitality</li>
            <li>heads themselves work very well cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li>These brushes fit a specific model of Oral-B sonic toothbrush, and are often unavailable in stores.  </li>
            <li>Very satisified with this product</li>
            <li>Found replacements, they were cheaper than I last remember paying for and they fit and function as designed.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic price compared to local retailers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 2+ years and really have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Then I cut a 7/16\\&quot; diameter hole in the center of the 3/4\\&quot; diameter cork piece so as to be able to slide this cork \\&quot;doughnut\\&quot; over the shaft of the handle.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>i learned not to wait until your bristle is worn out too much until it feels like wires.  </li>
            <li>It does not make sense that they should cost so much.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner with these than they do when I use a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But the price is still waaaaaaay too much for what you get.</li>
            <li>I hope they are still available next time</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not too comfortable getting an open package because it has TOOTHBRUSH HEADS!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>We purchased some for the whole family years ago.</li>
            <li>My wife and I really like this toothbrush set.  </li>
            <li>There are generics out there, they just don&#x27;t feel the same, cheap and flimsy, I rather stay with these.</li>
            <li>Cleans my teeth very well.</li>
            <li>They might not be cheap, but is the only one that fits correctly my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>There they were at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and everything functioned well with my equipment as was advertised.</li>
            <li>Considering that these are toothbrush heads, there isn&#x27;t much that can be said for them in a review.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and would definately order these again.</li>
            <li>I was getting pretty irritated about the possibility of having to buy a whole NEW electric toothbrush in order to replace the brush heads.</li>
            <li>and I noticed my gum line is getting a little messed up, my dentist told me not to put pressure when brushing, they do clean but my teeth are more sensitive now then before.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush and replacement heads - it (in my opinion) is far superior in styling &amp; price point to the other manufacturers&#x27; out there!!</li>
            <li>These brush heads are the same as the ones that come with the original toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The price is a little bit higher than those manual brushes, but this cleans your teeth so much better saving you money long-term.</li>
            <li>the prices are better than they were at other retailers.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;d much rather had an extra normal one.&lt;br /&gt;it did fit the brush unit and stays put, so it works.</li>
            <li>and they are a much better price than what I was expecting from looking at the other sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>it makes my mouth feel really clean, i&#x27;ll never go back to manual brushing!</li>
            <li>and nobody really wants to replace the brush with that particular one.</li>
            <li>I love the small size of the toothbrush and the heads are also a nice size (not too small or too large - but just right).  </li>
            <li>This particular Oral B tooth brush works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>is still brand new in the box while oral b has discontinued these brush heads which are the only ones that fit either.  </li>
            <li>My tpothbrush is like new again!</li>
            <li>so we always have a fresh toothbrush as they wear out, and they&#x27;re much cheaper here than at my local store.</li>
            <li>We have an older version of the Oral B pulsonic.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention that most stores have them locked up in a glass cabinet, and I had to wait quite a while for an employee to open it with a key.  </li>
            <li>Happy to receive a difficult to find item at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>These were hard to find, but I am so glad I stopped here!  </li>
            <li>Had looked everywhere for replacement heads for my older Oral-B electric toothbrush, but couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Many years later keep replacing with same Oral B, ...</li>
            <li>teeth were super white though.</li>
            <li>Have been using electrics for a long, long time and have had this one for a little over a year; far and away the best ever.</li>
            <li>As soon as we tried looking online, there they were, at a store we love and trust and they are exactly what we&#x27;ve spent months looking for in the same places we bought our toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>One thing I like particularly is that it comes with a precision tip in addition to a normal brush head.</li>
            <li>so i recommend fitting a number 2-4 pencil in the little opening at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Normally, I just buy a whole new unit when the new model comes out, but I decided to keep this unit and just buy replacement heads.</li>
            <li>and I was happy to discover that they cost less less than stores were asking.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of hard to find</li>
            <li>They are new, so it&#x27;s just like having a new toothbrush whenever I buy the replacements!</li>
            <li>There is not one bad thing to point out and therefore is perfect in every way discernable to the discriminating consumer.</li>
            <li>What I really wish is, that I could use the oral b sonic complete brushes with this brush handle</li>
            <li>Great brushes and Pulsonic wand but one of every four brushes is a useless micro brush that you throw away.</li>
            <li>so I assume that the genuine Oral-B heads are the only ones to buy, I recommend these for the price and availability, it&#x27;s really just easier to buy them here rather than run around hoping that a local store carries them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry to see it go, as I think this is a great toothbrush system.  </li>
            <li>The heads fit perfectly as expected.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t understand why they make different brush heads for each of their sonic toothbrushes or barring that, they would actually be consistent in their brusheads, these really should be softer.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few years now and love the quality of it.  </li>
            <li>I was having trouble finding refills for it and was so glad that Amazon has them.</li>
            <li>By then, even if they still look OK, they have been in the toothpaste, my mouth, and on the counter long enough that they need to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plan on buying a few more to keep on hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a few years now, and am always pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Of course, if you choose, you can certainly change them more often, but it really isn&#x27;t necessary due to the durability of this product.</li>
            <li>other heads work fine.</li>
            <li>New colors should be added especially pink:)</li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush, the brushes just do not last very long.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it is much less bulky and feels more natural in my hand.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and no problems worth crying about.</li>
            <li>The one on the bottom right has just a teeny amount of bristles, and won&#x27;t work for regular brushing.</li>
            <li>I finally found the right ones.</li>
            <li>Ipana \\&quot;Bucky Beaver\\&quot; TV ad style until the new unit shows up, along with one of the packages shown on this page that I ordered with it.</li>
            <li>and I thank you for having them I didn&#x27;t want to go buy a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The item was new, and it works as it is supposed to work.  </li>
            <li>When I received the new one,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>New heads</li>
            <li>oh well, live and learn</li>
            <li>I shudder to think of the piles of brand new precision tip heads in landfills.  </li>
            <li>We always have a new one to change out when needed.</li>
            <li>I used to dread those cleanings and usually a new cavity would be found.</li>
            <li>Appear to be identical to brush supplied with power head when new.</li>
            <li>It keeps my teeth clean with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>We were very surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li>If youa re buying something from AMAZON be aware that the voltage in Europe is different from that in the USA.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 units thinking the first would die in 2yrs like the last one.  </li>
            <li>event have occurred since I made this purchase; first my dental hygenist said is was like night and day, the improvement in my gums, and secondly the toothbrush stopped working after 6 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li>I love the small head on this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think sending it back is any option as the fees are higher then the product price..</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and but could not find locally after making the purchase of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love the fact they come with the small between the teeth brush replacement too</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use the one that is supposed to clean between your teeth as I don&#x27;t have that much space between my teeth so that one is wasted on me.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is narrow and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li>Seems not very common.</li>
            <li>I really hoped for a NIB item, not simply item that looks new.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothbrush, but hard to find these in stores.</li>
            <li>this is the slimmest, most portable sonic brush on the market, hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>The information on the page clearly stated that it works with the Oral B Vitality Sonic.  </li>
            <li>The price on Amazon was the only trustworthy place with a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>So much for corporate diagnostics and sales grids.  </li>
            <li>perhaps too soft for me...</li>
            <li>So far the teeth feel a lot cleaner.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement order and it was to my complete satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>The heads have contoured bristles, which my old ones didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>This should improve the cleaning action for me.</li>
            <li>These are twice as much if purchased at local discount department store or pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>Although they will last much longer, we make it a habit to replace the heads every couple of months.</li>
            <li>These keep me from having to have my dogs&#x27; (toy poodles) teeth professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised to see that the heads aren&#x27;t compatible with my Oral B Pulsonic</li>
            <li>that surprised him, cause he said Pulsonic was released 2010!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I feel like the Oral B heads don&#x27;t need to be replaced as often as my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My family loves the pulsonic toothbrush and the heads last a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li>Initially Oral-B Pulsonic was recommended by my dentist, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I ordered these replacement toothbrush heads and had them in hand 3 days later without having to pay an exorbitant price for fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get these for my old and trusty toothbrush from Target</li>
            <li>It has worked well for me as an adult with braces, batter life on the tooth brush itself</li>
            <li>It comes on a regular schedule and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Good product, but expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually kind of sad because it&#x27;s getting older</li>
            <li>Great service, you can&#x27;t go wrong buying in bulk!</li>
            <li>I love the oral-b pulsonic toothbrush - its small enough to travel with and keeps its charge for over a week and my dentist is always pleasantly surprised about the lack of plaque at each cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These brush heads have a great scrubbing feeling against the teeth, and includes a small brush to get into those hard to reach crevices.</li>
            <li>but I only wish this product were less expensive, thanks Amazon for offering what seems most of the time a better price than the normal big box retailer.</li>
            <li>I do sometimes use the pointy brush if I am feeling extra pious about brushing since it reaches in-between teeth pretty well, as an addition to flossing.</li>
            <li>I married my honey for better or for worse, but sharing a toothbrush is not part of the deal!</li>
            <li>Exactly the brush replacement we needed for a whole lot less money than I would have paid elsewhere!  </li>
            <li>these are a good idea if you have more than one person with the same brush, the heads have different color stripes at the base</li>
            <li>the tiny head has absolutely no utility, and the bristles basically splay quickly.</li>
            <li>As expected high quality replacement heads, have bought them before and the toothbrush continues to work as new!</li>
            <li>product came before expected, and the product was exactly what I ordered and needed.  </li>
            <li>Locally, it is cheaper to buy a new toothbrush instead of replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this type of toothbrush for a couple of years and the only thing I have had to replace is the new toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>I am not certain what many of the reviewers, who gave this product a 1 star rating, meant when they said that the brush head did not fit the handle.</li>
            <li>I would say this is a little pricey at $20, which averages out to about $5 per brush, but it was worth it to have them</li>
            <li>clearly says this refill is made only for one type of ORal B brush -- and that was not mine.</li>
            <li>The brush heads last a pretty long time before starting to look worn out or frayed.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t feel natural to simply stand there while it does the work.</li>
            <li>the savings on future professional dental visits because they work so well.</li>
            <li>Kinda pricey, but the only replacement I&#x27;ve found so far for this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>However, they are so expensive at the drug store, I was thrilled to find them cheaper thru amazon.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t full size, (which I have trouble getting to my back teeth with).</li>
            <li>With the new models out, the replacements are more difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing much to say other than they work as advertised.</li>
            <li>When I was a kid, the only electric toothbrushes I knew about were the cheesy spinning kind that just irritated your gums.</li>
            <li>Also, since the outer edge of the cork \\&quot;doughnut\\&quot; extends slightly beyond the circular edge of the brush head, it forms a nice drip edge that prevents the goop from your mouth running all the way down the handle and down your arm.</li>
            <li>Political skullduggery aside, the Oral-B Brush keeps my teeth as white and clean as nothing else I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>However, as usual, AMAZON delivered real fast and the return was without any problem.</li>
            <li>Previous brushes held their firmness much longer.</li>
            <li>These are kind of difficult to find in a single or multi pack in any type of Target, Walrgreens, CVS or Walmart.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush, but why are the replacement heads so expensive and hard to find?</li>

            <li> Fits my oral-b toothbrush and cleans my teeth effectively.</li>
            <li> The brushes work GREAT and bristles are gentle on the teeth and gums but do a great job</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are perfect for the Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush--just what our dentist recommended for great pearly white teeth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to break her heart, so I just nodded and smiled.    </li>
            <li> so I was thrilled to find these.</li>
            <li> Nice to know I don&#x27;t have to dispose of a perfectly good electric toothbrush because it isn&#x27;t the latest model.</li>
            <li> kind of pricey if you ask me.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are nice quality and all is well with them.</li>
            <li> Nice replacement for Oral-B Pulsonic toothbursh.</li>
            <li> If you own an Oral-B Toothbrush, you must buy this product.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the toothbrush is a nice product (gave it 5 stars).  </li>
            <li> Visits to the dentist confirm that my gums and teeth are healthy and getting a good workout.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy them on site, but the pricing on Amazon is good,</li>
            <li> the toothbrush is great for getting teeth clean and keeping plaque off.  </li>
            <li> My dentist always give me good marks for clean teeth!</li>
            <li> Used many years and very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Glad that I was able to find them here because its a good toothbrush.</li>

            <li> So glad you sell them at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare brush feels like it&#x27;s more effective at cleaning below the gums.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> so I was happy they were the right ones.  </li>
            <li> Very quick!</li>
            <li> very good, but it is so powerful you must use a light touch and let the brush do the work</li>
            <li> Perfect, fast and cheap</li>
            <li> They clean well and the gum attachment does a good job of minimizing build up at the gum line.  </li>
            <li> so I get them on here and am able to keep my old toothbrush running great!</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> So apparently it&#x27;s one of the best brushes around, and</li>
            <li> These fit a wonderfully slender model introduced some years ago--I adore it and pray they never, ever, quit making new brush heads!</li>
            <li> Very smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Good price quick shipping.</li>
            <li> These heads fit perfect and made it like new again.</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast and these were the perfect ones I needed...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchasing these replacements via the subscription program provides a huge savings over the store price of $29-$28 per package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to find these to replace my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I bought my Oral-B Pulsonic while overseas and love the size and function of it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how my day was going to start or end unless I found these replacement Pulsonic brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral-B Pulsonic for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Will be sure to deal with them again.</li>
            <li> we love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>

            <li> Fit the Pulsonic as stated!  </li>
            <li> so I was able to try another option before returning the toothbrush</li>
            <li> so glad I didn&#x27;t have to do that.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely better than a manual toothbrush, when you use it correctly and not just keep it encased in toothpaste residue like slobs and leave it uncharged, unchanged for a decade.</li>
            <li> Its a brush head that works like it a brush head :)</li>
            <li> But I am glad Amazon hs it.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral B Pulsonic.</li>
            <li> If your considering it, buy one, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Love Oral B Pulsonic</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush and love Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have both the Sonicare and Oral-B Pulsonic tooth brushes and like the Sonicare much better.</li>
            <li> I was able to save about $10 on each package by buying through amazon and ended up getting two packages.  </li>
            <li> Will know for sure it is working after my</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found them here.</li>
            <li> because this is my favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li> ok I have to put 4 more words.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Amazon sells them and</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> However, Im glad I can go online to purchase and in bundles.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> The size of the toothbrush head is perfect---much better coverage than others.</li>
            <li> , THINK YOU COULD DO A BETTER JOB.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found them.  </li>
            <li> They do not--they don&#x27;t even come close to fitting -- and now I&#x27;m out more than $20 because I opened the package and can&#x27;t return these toothbrush heads that I can&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li> I love my Pulsonic Tooth Brush...</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m glad that I can find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> So pleased to find the brush replacements for my Pulsonic.  </li>
            <li> Was able to use my Pulsonic again and already getting compliments on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Feels like you just went to dentist, I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush and Amazon</li>
            <li> I was glad to turn to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Will be reordering more.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> We love the Pulsonic toothbrush.</li>

            <li> I love my electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> but we love the toothbrush so we decided to have them shipped to us.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This piece of cork filled the space nicely between the brush head and handle and the problem is solved.</li>
            <li> I found this product very compatible and great value.</li>
            <li> And be sure to buy thru amazon and not another.</li>
            <li> I hope manufacturer bundles this in a six pack or more for additional savings.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Patrick : )</li>

            <li> More because I got two replacements.  </li>
            <li> I was really glad to find replacement brushes for my electric toothbrus.</li>
            <li> So glad to find them on amazon.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush that these go to is our favorite of any we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Glad I found these</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad I found it online</li>
            <li> I love the brush but</li>
            <li> I love the Pulsonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t have two more days to wait.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush design.</li>
            <li> So glad to find these here, as the stores no longer carry them.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> but I am able to get replacement brushes through Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did it because I do notice a better brush now.</li>
            <li> but we love our Pulsonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> What more can you say.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find these replacement heads in Target, WalMart, CVS, etc., but no longer seem to stock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over five years, I haven&#x27;t changed because I haven&#x27;t found anything better in the market.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I love the brush, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Replacement toothbrushes -- what more can be said.</li>
            <li> The oral b brushes for the pulsonic toothbrush are ptitty ok the mouth</li>
            <li> nine more words required five more words required one</li>
            <li> Love my Pulsonic and these replacement heads are a must.  </li>
            <li> I considered the aftermarket replacement heads, but I&#x27;m glad I purchased the ones endorsed by Oral-B.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s not been able to find replacements either.</li>
            <li> order again for sure.</li>
            <li> I have had the Pulsonic for many years now.</li>
            <li> Oral B has many models.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! :-)</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described at a fair price, what more can be said about this item to fill the required number of words.</li>
            <li> They clean our teeth as nicely as the originals did.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of like Goldilocks and the three bears, this one is JUST RIGHT!</li>
            <li> Fast easy and always have what I&#x27;m looking for at  great prices....</li>
            <li> and they were exactly what I needed and at a good price too.  </li>
            <li> Price was pretty fair too.</li>
            <li> I have used it and happy to recommend to new users.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and it was a joy to see that Amazon offers the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is still going strong after many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still going strong and I ordered one for the boyfriend as well :)</li>
            <li> Nice to write a &#x27;great product&#x27; review finally.</li>
            <li> These brushes were the right item, they were at a good price with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these heads are fine if you have a Pulsonic toothbrush, but the product description incorrectly states that the brushes work with Oral-B Vitality Sonic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> They had 2 pack fo tooth brush alone, but overall this 4 count head is very good.  </li>
            <li> Hey, these replacement toothbrushes work in the most fantastic of ways.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, DON&#x27;T buy unless its \\&quot;SOLD\\&quot; \\&quot;AND\\&quot; \\&quot;FULFILLED\\&quot; by Amazon, there are many reports about cheap counterfeits here (</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get to wild about tooth brushes, but the Oral-B is great.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad these brushes fit my Pulsonic S 15.523.2.  </li>
            <li> (well, aside from the cheap battery powered ones) to compare to, I love this brush.</li>
            <li> These wear out faster than the free toothbrush the dentist give out and yet cost more than the &amp;#34;Super toothbrush 2000 with color changing flex bristles&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good price.</li>
            <li> Good value and fast service.</li>
            <li> good quality, fast service.</li>
            <li> He is very happy with it, and feels it does as good a job as the Sonicare, for less money, and it&#x27;s a whole lot quieter, too!</li>
            <li> These are just replacements, but this system really does a good job at keeping teeth clean and gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> Easy and reliable</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to keep track of which brush head is yours.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use, and not bulky at all.  </li>
            <li> While i have search for replacements for my Oral B toothbrush, but could not find them, Amazon made it extremely easy to get the product that I needed.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick.   </li>
            <li> Brushes are easy to remove and replace since both my husband and I are using it and</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived in perfect shape much more quickly than expected.  </li>
            <li> Well, it is still going strong and the never opened one</li>
            <li> This vendor had incredible prices and one of the fastest shipment time I have seen in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe they can provide separate packages for normal heads and precision ones so that people can choose how many they want for each kind.</li>
            <li> This product may be fine but it does not work with Vitality Sonic toothbrushes as described.</li>
            <li> one of the brushes is a fine tip</li>
            <li> Got this because my dental hygenist recommended it to help my gums-I went on a one week trip and just took the brush-the charge held up fine</li>
            <li> You have to have the exact same &amp;#34;Pulsonic&amp;#34; model toothbrush to use them, but from the reviews, it&#x27;s a great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> We received the heads very quickly and they fit the brush with no problem.</li>
            <li> The Pulsonic is a nice middle ground, with me doing a minimalist interpretation of the standard brushing motion and the machine providing supplementary brushes that greatly exceed anything I would be able to do on my own.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine with my order/delivery, with one exception.  </li>
            <li> They work fine.</li>
            <li> This product was fine.</li>
            <li> Worked fine as advertised.</li>
            <li> They work fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine but don&#x27;t need the water pik device that is included.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon for good pricing and reliable quick delivery</li>
            <li> They fit my Oral-B Pulsonic just fine.  </li>
            <li> They fit the toothbrush just fine.  </li>
            <li> Brushes fit fine.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is way more cost effective than my old sonicare and works just as well.</li>
            <li> Product description was accurate and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Great value for a product I enjoy and use daily.</li>
            <li> this one don&#x27;t fit on my S26 toothbrush, and there is no information available about which model it does fit.</li>
            <li> I got Free shipping for my order.  </li>
            <li> Slim, easy to clean, compact, holds charge well (over a week), fits the hand well.</li>
            <li> The actual toothbrush overall is great and these replacement heads are great as well.</li>
            <li> The replacements I got fit correctly, and change the head out once a month.</li>
            <li> The Amazon description said it would fit my toothbrush and when it arrived the box</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t fit my toothbrush holder anyway.</li>
            <li> I also got a 15% discount for using Subscribe &amp; Save, which will send them to me automatically (with free shipping) at the interval I</li>
            <li> they fit the toothbrush as billed.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush head is a MUST have item that fits on my Oral-B Pulsonic handle because it isn&#x27;t available anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I saw these at such a great price that I bought 2 packs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to return because they don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> We can no longer find these replacement heads locally and I was happy that I could find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> arrived fast , nicely packed what i was looking for to go with my toothbrush.. but prefer the oral b pro over pulsonic</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit snugly to the toothbrush</li>
            <li> For me, it means that there is too much space between the circular top of the handle and the circular bottom of the brush head so that the brush head does not stay on the handle but rather comes off in your mouth, The circular surface at the bottom of the the brush head and the circular surface at the top of the handle should fit snugly so that the brush head locks in place and cannot wiggle free.</li>
            <li> Works great and the package was the same as the days when I could.</li>
            <li> Some fit; some don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is easy to use and my teeth feel as clean when I step  out of the chair after a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Since they&#x27;re manufactured by Oral B, there&#x27;s no question on fit or function.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit our Oral B electric brushes.</li>
            <li> Fit the brushholder like it should and cleans like it should.</li>
            <li> These fit the toothbrush...</li>
            <li> I purchased the oral-b pulsonic electric toothbrush several years ago, and I am happy I can find replacement heads at amazon.</li>
            <li> The type of toothbrush is important.</li>
            <li> They do fit the Oral B pulsonic brush.  </li>
            <li> Mine were good and soft...</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month so far so good.</li>
            <li> And this one is the most comfortable, with the right sized heads for my mouth.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to brush for the full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Also it is very rare to find this replacement at stores.</li>
            <li> These are the original item by Oral-B and they fit like the original.</li>
            <li> small attachments fit perfect</li>
            <li> This review is not so much about the heads themselves, (any new toothbrush head is always going to feel great), as it is about the ease of finding replacements on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazon has provided the usual excellent shipment and handling.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are really feel real clean.</li>
            <li> Was an original product, not a knock off.</li>
            <li> It provide convenience and user friendly features.</li>
            <li> Brushes pull out sooner that with original Oral-B.</li>
            <li> They are exactly the brand you used to be able to get in the store, but</li>
            <li> These hard to find refills fit perfectly on my Pulsonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is nice having new bristles.</li>
            <li> Once I was finally able to contact them, the seller fixed the problem in a timely manner going out of their way to make sure that everything was done correctly.  </li>
            <li> Two packs of Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush Heads are required to keep a couple&#x27;s teeth consistently clean for six months.</li>
            <li> This is not something flowery it smells somewhere between clean and medicinal.</li>
            <li> The pointed head works well to help clean between the brackets on braces.  </li>
            <li> I like the clean feeling this toothbrush leaves my teeth feeling.</li>
            <li> When I use my toothbrush with these my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after use.</li>
            <li> So clean.  </li>
            <li> It has helped me clean up gum issues and I will continue to use this brush until it either dies</li>
            <li> These came quick and work fantastic on the toothbrush</li>
            <li> Though this product itself is amazing, nice firm yet gentle bristles worked amazingly in getting anything</li>
            <li> Excellent brush heads, just hard to find.</li>
            <li> Talk such as that makes the refills a good buy also.</li>
            <li> They are true Oral B replacements and work well.</li>
            <li> I use the pick style every day as well as the full size brush.</li>
            <li> It seems like the pick brush gets beat up before the full brush</li>
            <li> I wish the price was cheaper and they had 4 full sized toothbrush heads</li>
            <li> But after a while I end up with like 3 full replacements</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find them because they don&#x27;t seem to be in my local stores.</li>
            <li> Am i aloud to return them for a full refund?</li>
            <li> but otherwise its not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> Easy shopping for the brush heads on-line &amp; able to purchase enough to last a year or more!!</li>
            <li> Ok, doesn&#x27;t really feel like they&#x27;re able to clean your teeth completely.</li>
            <li> Received product quickly and no issues with anything.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> These have loosened up too quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was quick and have had no problems with them</li>
            <li> I decided once again to search for replacement brushes one last time, within 30 seconds, amazing available...</li>
            <li> Product was packed well and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in my local stores any more.</li>
            <li> These are durable great quality brush heads that last much longer than any manual toothbrush or electronic toothbrush head</li>
            <li> Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Shopped around for the most reasonable price and ordered right here on amazon because the price could not be beat.</li>
            <li> Feels much better with the new ones.</li>
            <li> So now my toothbrush is still working as well as it did when I first bought it!</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t use them myself, I order them regularly for my employers, and they love the Pulsonic!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I got exactly what i needed and when i needed it!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> suitable, not same as the original one within electric brush</li>
            <li> The description on Amazon says that it does work, but nowhere on the package does it indicate that it works with Vitality Sonic and the heads are too large to fit on the toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about how these would be, but the quality is great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need the little brushes, so it looks like a much better deal, but it was still a good price for the 2 that I wanted</li>
            <li> Thanks again, Amazon, for making products available that we might otherwise never find.</li>
            <li> I found these, they arrived in the mail in one day for free thanks to Amazon Prime, and now I can keep my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They hold up well and are the only kind I would use.</li>
            <li> and my mouth always feels fresh once I use it.  </li>
            <li> Good solid toothbrush that makes me have some real pearly whites.  </li>
            <li> I wish there were as many toothbrush tips as there were toothbrush heads in each package because I use both just as frequently.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the colored bands all that useful, except to keep water from getting under the head a little.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> Glad I finally found these, and enjoyed the device and finally found the replacement parts, and really glad that I did.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am convinced that it actually saves me money to own the Pulsonic electronic toothbrush because these heads are so durable and long-lasting, not to mention</li>
            <li> Economical too.</li>
            <li> Apparently there may be an overcharging problem, so it is suggested that every 6 months or so you should just let the battery run down without recharging-in any case I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very slim, very powerful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many other sonic tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> love that Amazon had my tooth brush heads when no other store out there carries them plus a $3 off coupon - SOLD!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush as it gets my teeth clean better than many other toothbrushes I have tried.</li>
            <li> Otherwise good value and these heads are becoming hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This is for the person who is looking for &amp;#34;just the right thing&amp;#34; in this category.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new electric toothbrush--and a brush, I might add, that is my all-time favorite,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just upgrading to the unit these heads fit from an old Sonic Complete whose battery stopped being able to take a charge.</li>
            <li> not sure that&#x27;s a great deal</li>
            <li> She liked it a because it helped keep her braces and teeth extra clean, which is extra important in avoiding cavities while wearing orthodontia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I tried to purchase a new unit and found that they&#x27;ve disappeared from the land of available products.  </li>
            <li> and now I can continue to enjoy my Oral-B with new brushes.</li>
            <li> Searching all over for the right brushes, thank you they are exactly the one I needed.  </li>
            <li> These are high quality, original equipment.</li>
            <li> This vendor provided a couple of sets of four at reasonable price, and provided the sets quickly.</li>
            <li> thanks for your quick delievery</li>
            <li> Very much cheaper than in a store.  </li>
            <li> They are listed for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , my first 2 attempts to review wouldn&#x27;t post, so I decided to go over the edge to see if this one would.</li>
            <li> The brush heads were exactly as described and work for what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li> These sell for much,much more in local drug stores.  </li>
            <li> They appear to be an exact replacement for the originals.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I was glad I purchased the additional brush heads at the same time as the toothbrush as the brush head that came with it wouldn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> The first time I bought one of their sonic units, I had brushes to spare after the unit died.  </li>
            <li> Other retailers charge quite a bit more for these replacement heads!</li>
            <li> Amazon had it and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly satisfied with my initial purchase of the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CORRECT &amp; REASONABLY PRICED!</li>
            <li> My husband bought it for me when it first came out.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> These worked well and probably even cleaned my teeth, but the main toothbrush broke after only a year, so I&#x27;m not super impressed.</li>
            <li> thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> Fits and works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> after shopping locally and purchasing replacements,&lt;br /&gt;it is better to save some $$$ and buy at Amazon.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted and</li>
            <li> Is the exact replacement product and appeared at my door promptly.</li>
            <li> I would be happier if I could buy the heads individually as I would like more precision heads.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed for my Pulsonic toothbrush and</li>
            <li> sure enough there they were</li>
            <li> Would gladly pay extra for the convenience.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these, but be sure you have the toothbrush specified.</li>
            <li> i was supposed to rip the top part to get the brush out, but mine was already ripped open for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller that most of the electric toothbrushes so not so bulky.</li>
            <li> Most people will not likely to use it.</li>
            <li> Back again for more.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> The first of these heads pinches my lip every now and then.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I got this toothbrush and use it regularly, my teeth have been super smooth.  </li>
            <li> Evidently this brand of electric toothbrushes isn&#x27;t as popular as other brands.  </li>
            <li> LOVE my pulsonic toothbrush, and the other members in my house quickly discovered it&#x27;s benefits too.  </li>
            <li> Refills are hard to find in stores, so we&#x27;re glad to be able to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Compared to the some of the other electric brushes sold in stores this is far superior when cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> When I finally gave up and came to Amazon I was pleased to not only find them, but also to find them much cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> I mean, they attach to your toothbrush and vibrate and clean your teeth nicely.</li>
            <li> I have order these same heads before and just like the first time, they work and fit like a charm</li>
            <li> the attachment area on the head is too large.</li>
            <li> Work great, the bristles were very hard but after about two weeks of use they have soften up a bit.</li>
            <li> This is a great little toothbrush, and this is the ONLY place to find these brushes!!</li>
            <li> Hard to find but product is good.</li>
            <li> However, for some reason these brush heads are hard to find, so I&#x27;m delighted I can order them.</li>
            <li> I enjoy brushing with my pulsonic toothbrush so much that I find that I actually brush longer.</li>
            <li> What are those?&amp;#34; hahaha</li>
            <li> I have braces so it really gets between the brackets.  </li>
            <li> and i really like it.  </li>
            <li> I like a high gloss polish on my teeth!</li>
            <li> bought the Oral-B (Braun) Pulsonic because its handle was much thinner than the Philips Sonicare product.  </li>
            <li> and it was very well packaged</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really give you an appreciation of the product, as I had to return it.  </li>
            <li> So the lesson is not to buy Oral-B electric brushes because they charge so much for replacements.  </li>
            <li> These only fit the pulsonic toothbrush--not the vitality</li>
            <li> heads themselves work very well cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li> These brushes fit a specific model of Oral-B sonic toothbrush, and are often unavailable in stores.  </li>
            <li> Very satisified with this product</li>
            <li> Found replacements, they were cheaper than I last remember paying for and they fit and function as designed.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic price compared to local retailers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 2+ years and really have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Then I cut a 7/16\\&quot; diameter hole in the center of the 3/4\\&quot; diameter cork piece so as to be able to slide this cork \\&quot;doughnut\\&quot; over the shaft of the handle.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> i learned not to wait until your bristle is worn out too much until it feels like wires.  </li>
            <li> It does not make sense that they should cost so much.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner with these than they do when I use a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But the price is still waaaaaaay too much for what you get.</li>
            <li> I hope they are still available next time</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not too comfortable getting an open package because it has TOOTHBRUSH HEADS!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> We purchased some for the whole family years ago.</li>
            <li> My wife and I really like this toothbrush set.  </li>
            <li> There are generics out there, they just don&#x27;t feel the same, cheap and flimsy, I rather stay with these.</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> They might not be cheap, but is the only one that fits correctly my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> There they were at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and everything functioned well with my equipment as was advertised.</li>
            <li> Considering that these are toothbrush heads, there isn&#x27;t much that can be said for them in a review.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and would definately order these again.</li>
            <li> I was getting pretty irritated about the possibility of having to buy a whole NEW electric toothbrush in order to replace the brush heads.</li>
            <li> and I noticed my gum line is getting a little messed up, my dentist told me not to put pressure when brushing, they do clean but my teeth are more sensitive now then before.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush and replacement heads - it (in my opinion) is far superior in styling &amp; price point to the other manufacturers&#x27; out there!!</li>
            <li> These brush heads are the same as the ones that come with the original toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The price is a little bit higher than those manual brushes, but this cleans your teeth so much better saving you money long-term.</li>
            <li> the prices are better than they were at other retailers.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;d much rather had an extra normal one.&lt;br /&gt;it did fit the brush unit and stays put, so it works.</li>
            <li> and they are a much better price than what I was expecting from looking at the other sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> it makes my mouth feel really clean, i&#x27;ll never go back to manual brushing!</li>
            <li> and nobody really wants to replace the brush with that particular one.</li>
            <li> I love the small size of the toothbrush and the heads are also a nice size (not too small or too large - but just right).  </li>
            <li> This particular Oral B tooth brush works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> is still brand new in the box while oral b has discontinued these brush heads which are the only ones that fit either.  </li>
            <li> My tpothbrush is like new again!</li>
            <li> so we always have a fresh toothbrush as they wear out, and they&#x27;re much cheaper here than at my local store.</li>
            <li> We have an older version of the Oral B pulsonic.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention that most stores have them locked up in a glass cabinet, and I had to wait quite a while for an employee to open it with a key.  </li>
            <li> Happy to receive a difficult to find item at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> These were hard to find, but I am so glad I stopped here!  </li>
            <li> Had looked everywhere for replacement heads for my older Oral-B electric toothbrush, but couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Many years later keep replacing with same Oral B, ...</li>
            <li> teeth were super white though.</li>
            <li> Have been using electrics for a long, long time and have had this one for a little over a year; far and away the best ever.</li>
            <li> As soon as we tried looking online, there they were, at a store we love and trust and they are exactly what we&#x27;ve spent months looking for in the same places we bought our toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> One thing I like particularly is that it comes with a precision tip in addition to a normal brush head.</li>
            <li> so i recommend fitting a number 2-4 pencil in the little opening at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Normally, I just buy a whole new unit when the new model comes out, but I decided to keep this unit and just buy replacement heads.</li>
            <li> and I was happy to discover that they cost less less than stores were asking.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kind of hard to find</li>
            <li> They are new, so it&#x27;s just like having a new toothbrush whenever I buy the replacements!</li>
            <li> There is not one bad thing to point out and therefore is perfect in every way discernable to the discriminating consumer.</li>
            <li> What I really wish is, that I could use the oral b sonic complete brushes with this brush handle</li>
            <li> Great brushes and Pulsonic wand but one of every four brushes is a useless micro brush that you throw away.</li>
            <li> so I assume that the genuine Oral-B heads are the only ones to buy, I recommend these for the price and availability, it&#x27;s really just easier to buy them here rather than run around hoping that a local store carries them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to see it go, as I think this is a great toothbrush system.  </li>
            <li> The heads fit perfectly as expected.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t understand why they make different brush heads for each of their sonic toothbrushes or barring that, they would actually be consistent in their brusheads, these really should be softer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and love the quality of it.  </li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding refills for it and was so glad that Amazon has them.</li>
            <li> By then, even if they still look OK, they have been in the toothpaste, my mouth, and on the counter long enough that they need to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plan on buying a few more to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a few years now, and am always pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Of course, if you choose, you can certainly change them more often, but it really isn&#x27;t necessary due to the durability of this product.</li>
            <li> other heads work fine.</li>
            <li> New colors should be added especially pink:)</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush, the brushes just do not last very long.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it is much less bulky and feels more natural in my hand.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and no problems worth crying about.</li>
            <li> The one on the bottom right has just a teeny amount of bristles, and won&#x27;t work for regular brushing.</li>
            <li> I finally found the right ones.</li>
            <li> Ipana \\&quot;Bucky Beaver\\&quot; TV ad style until the new unit shows up, along with one of the packages shown on this page that I ordered with it.</li>
            <li> and I thank you for having them I didn&#x27;t want to go buy a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The item was new, and it works as it is supposed to work.  </li>
            <li> When I received the new one,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> New heads</li>
            <li> oh well, live and learn</li>
            <li> I shudder to think of the piles of brand new precision tip heads in landfills.  </li>
            <li> We always have a new one to change out when needed.</li>
            <li> I used to dread those cleanings and usually a new cavity would be found.</li>
            <li> Appear to be identical to brush supplied with power head when new.</li>
            <li> It keeps my teeth clean with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> We were very surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li> If youa re buying something from AMAZON be aware that the voltage in Europe is different from that in the USA.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 units thinking the first would die in 2yrs like the last one.  </li>
            <li> event have occurred since I made this purchase; first my dental hygenist said is was like night and day, the improvement in my gums, and secondly the toothbrush stopped working after 6 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li> I love the small head on this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think sending it back is any option as the fees are higher then the product price..</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and but could not find locally after making the purchase of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love the fact they come with the small between the teeth brush replacement too</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the one that is supposed to clean between your teeth as I don&#x27;t have that much space between my teeth so that one is wasted on me.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is narrow and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> Seems not very common.</li>
            <li> I really hoped for a NIB item, not simply item that looks new.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush, but hard to find these in stores.</li>
            <li> this is the slimmest, most portable sonic brush on the market, hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> The information on the page clearly stated that it works with the Oral B Vitality Sonic.  </li>
            <li> The price on Amazon was the only trustworthy place with a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> So much for corporate diagnostics and sales grids.  </li>
            <li> perhaps too soft for me...</li>
            <li> So far the teeth feel a lot cleaner.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement order and it was to my complete satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> The heads have contoured bristles, which my old ones didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> This should improve the cleaning action for me.</li>
            <li> These are twice as much if purchased at local discount department store or pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> Although they will last much longer, we make it a habit to replace the heads every couple of months.</li>
            <li> These keep me from having to have my dogs&#x27; (toy poodles) teeth professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised to see that the heads aren&#x27;t compatible with my Oral B Pulsonic</li>
            <li> that surprised him, cause he said Pulsonic was released 2010!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel like the Oral B heads don&#x27;t need to be replaced as often as my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My family loves the pulsonic toothbrush and the heads last a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li> Initially Oral-B Pulsonic was recommended by my dentist, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement toothbrush heads and had them in hand 3 days later without having to pay an exorbitant price for fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get these for my old and trusty toothbrush from Target</li>
            <li> It has worked well for me as an adult with braces, batter life on the tooth brush itself</li>
            <li> It comes on a regular schedule and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Good product, but expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually kind of sad because it&#x27;s getting older</li>
            <li> Great service, you can&#x27;t go wrong buying in bulk!</li>
            <li> I love the oral-b pulsonic toothbrush - its small enough to travel with and keeps its charge for over a week and my dentist is always pleasantly surprised about the lack of plaque at each cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These brush heads have a great scrubbing feeling against the teeth, and includes a small brush to get into those hard to reach crevices.</li>
            <li> but I only wish this product were less expensive, thanks Amazon for offering what seems most of the time a better price than the normal big box retailer.</li>
            <li> I do sometimes use the pointy brush if I am feeling extra pious about brushing since it reaches in-between teeth pretty well, as an addition to flossing.</li>
            <li> I married my honey for better or for worse, but sharing a toothbrush is not part of the deal!</li>
            <li> Exactly the brush replacement we needed for a whole lot less money than I would have paid elsewhere!  </li>
            <li> these are a good idea if you have more than one person with the same brush, the heads have different color stripes at the base</li>
            <li> the tiny head has absolutely no utility, and the bristles basically splay quickly.</li>
            <li> As expected high quality replacement heads, have bought them before and the toothbrush continues to work as new!</li>
            <li> product came before expected, and the product was exactly what I ordered and needed.  </li>
            <li> Locally, it is cheaper to buy a new toothbrush instead of replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this type of toothbrush for a couple of years and the only thing I have had to replace is the new toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> I am not certain what many of the reviewers, who gave this product a 1 star rating, meant when they said that the brush head did not fit the handle.</li>
            <li> I would say this is a little pricey at $20, which averages out to about $5 per brush, but it was worth it to have them</li>
            <li> clearly says this refill is made only for one type of ORal B brush -- and that was not mine.</li>
            <li> The brush heads last a pretty long time before starting to look worn out or frayed.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t feel natural to simply stand there while it does the work.</li>
            <li> the savings on future professional dental visits because they work so well.</li>
            <li> Kinda pricey, but the only replacement I&#x27;ve found so far for this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> However, they are so expensive at the drug store, I was thrilled to find them cheaper thru amazon.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t full size, (which I have trouble getting to my back teeth with).</li>
            <li> With the new models out, the replacements are more difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing much to say other than they work as advertised.</li>
            <li> When I was a kid, the only electric toothbrushes I knew about were the cheesy spinning kind that just irritated your gums.</li>
            <li> Also, since the outer edge of the cork \\&quot;doughnut\\&quot; extends slightly beyond the circular edge of the brush head, it forms a nice drip edge that prevents the goop from your mouth running all the way down the handle and down your arm.</li>
            <li> Political skullduggery aside, the Oral-B Brush keeps my teeth as white and clean as nothing else I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> However, as usual, AMAZON delivered real fast and the return was without any problem.</li>
            <li> Previous brushes held their firmness much longer.</li>
            <li> These are kind of difficult to find in a single or multi pack in any type of Target, Walrgreens, CVS or Walmart.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush, but why are the replacement heads so expensive and hard to find?</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth with some crowding of my bottom teeth and the small replacement head is perfect for cleaning the tight spaces;just wish  there was a replacement pack with just the small ones.</li>
            <li> these are hard to find heads, but they are the right ones- they work.</li>
            <li> Received the item as pictured,great produce the oral-b brush and now I half 4 new spare brushes.</li>
            <li> I would wish for 3 speeds rather than two and local brush availability (although they last surprisingly long).  </li>
            <li> customer service guy told me there is only one single Pulsonic model sold worldwide, so it can&#x27;t be an issue between different regional products..</li>
            <li> The small brush really cleans by the gums well.</li>
            <li> Plus, this replacement pak comes with the small brush that really gets between your teeth.</li>
            <li> If you have the pulsonic brush, this review will not apply to you as I am sure there is nothing wrong with the product itself, but if you have the Vitality Sonic like myself, do yourself a favor and order the \\&quot;Oral-B Sonic Complete Refill Toothbrush Heads\\&quot; instead as this one will not fit on the Vitality Sonic despite what the description on amazon says.  </li>
            <li> These should hopefully last me quite a long time.</li>
            <li> They actually last a long time.</li>
            <li> Of course, my idea of a long time for a toothbrush to last is a month.</li>
            <li> They last a LONG time too.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but god hard to find and expensive.  </li>
            <li> Small heads are important when you are dealing with small mouths.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these heads as well as the ones with my previous Sonic Complete.  </li>
            <li> The Sonic Complete 4-packs had all four heads as the same everyday brush--why not that option for the model that takes these?</li>
            <li> They actually arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product comes with 3 real replacement heads and one small gum flosser thing (that already comes with the original product) that we don&#x27;t ever use.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit, and were totally useless.</li>
            <li> They fit, they work like they should, they are expensive.</li>
            <li> I have seen an average price of over $25 in the stores, but have found the same on Amazon for around $15 for the same manufacturers brand.  </li>
            <li> but I dropped a star due to the inclusion of the small tooth pick head - I still have the original one not used so this is waste</li>
            <li> The brushes however, while harder than I am used to are color coded so that the head can be switched for multiple people to use.  </li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY BY FAR.</li>
            <li> I bought the toothbrush that these heads replace a few months ago and was pleasantly surprised how affordable the replacement heads were compared to in the stores.</li>
            <li> The problem is that third party brushes don&#x27;t last or work well (read the reviews) AND these brushes use a complex design for connecting that apparently cannot be replicated by the third party providers.  </li>
            <li> I will always order these replacement heads as long as I have my pulsonic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and when I found this and it came sooner than expected, it definitely made my day!</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve found that the bristles start to splay long before the color wears off.  </li>
            <li> Just know that the bristles are Medium, not Soft.</li>
            <li> I waited so long because of the price</li>
            <li> However, for me this was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money unless you like super hard bristles.</li>
            <li> The previous package of brush heads I purchased at a local store were all the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too stiff or too soft.  </li>
            <li> I just hope it will last as long as my other one.</li>
            <li> It is useless to me (and from the other reviews, most other buyers).  </li>
            <li> I also wish they had different brush softness, like hard, medium and soft.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find, because my toothbrush if several years old.</li>
            <li> I searched several places for this item, because I bought the electric toothbrush a few years back...</li>
            <li> I was long overdue to replace the head of the toothbrush and finally broke down and got these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still wish the original tooth brush hadn&#x27;t broken because I&#x27;ve got 2 more heads that I can&#x27;t even use :(</li>
            <li> However, I feel that the round heads do a better job since these heads are hard to get in hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> The thing to remember about brushing with these is what I keep in my head every single time</li>
            <li> I have had a very difficult time finding these in stores, and I love the tooth brush, so I didn&#x27;t want to give it up just because I couldn&#x27;t find the brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I live in Canada and these replacement heads are hard to find</li>
            <li> But why is the fourth one per package that funky little \\&quot;precision head\\</li>
            <li> these are hard and I prefer soft.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but the price for these replacement heads is outrageous.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I get only one precision tip in one package.</li>
            <li> From past experience, the tips lasts only as long as the heads.</li>
            <li> These work exactly as I expected them to.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B unit which uses these refill brushes is an expensive item but, for me, it has been worth every penny it cost.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say here.  </li>
            <li> Was as described and works as expected.</li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> Still, there work as expected, and fits well as you would expect from OEM.</li>
            <li> It fits my brush holder as expected and is Oral B quality of course.</li>
            <li> Wife uses these and was having trouble finding them in local stores.  </li>
            <li> Each head lasts me roughly a month.</li>
            <li> The arrived sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> nothing too fancy, but it&#x27;s what&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> Look carefully at the image before you order though</li>
            <li> These work as expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and on time delivery.</li>
            <li> not much else to say about a toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder to find the replacement brushes anywhere but Amazon.</li>
            <li> work as expected.</li>
            <li> These seem to be harder and harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Had trouble finding this item locally.  </li>
            <li> These are no where to be found in my area (not a large city).</li>
            <li> Make sure to change them if you get sick too</li>
            <li> The brush head is small and thin so it is able to get to the hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> The replacement flossing head is not very useful</li>
            <li> with any other brand</li>
            <li> Rated three stars due to cost.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s money well spent, do yourself a favor and get one !</li>
            <li> However since I don&#x27;t use the precision tip, as that&#x27;s what flossing is for, it increases the cost of the three other heads to $7.12 apiece . . .</li>
            <li> that small brush head for getting in between the teeth is not necessary in my opinion.</li>
            <li> what I expected!</li>
            <li> I am not aware of any other replacement toothbrush heads for this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> But when they say &amp;#34;4 Head Count&amp;#34;; there are 3 regular heads and one small head.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any other compatible replacement brands for the Oral-B Pulsonic</li>
            <li> I have had my toothbrush for several years and was not able to find these heads in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for months in all my local pharmacies, which is where I&#x27;ve purchased them in the past.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Brush is not easily available in local stores, such as CVS, where they still sell the entire set, including the base and the stem, but have discontinued refills, such as Amazon offers.  </li>
            <li> Had such a hard time finding a replacement toothbrush head</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the replacement toothbrush heads in the local stores around my area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a personal hygiene ritual that comes with common sense.</li>
            <li> Or do I really have a wrong Pulsonic?</li>
            <li> I bought it on here because its almost impossible to find any where outside of the web, they work very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oral-B Pulsonic tootbrush as a gift for my husband, since his Sonicare broke down, and I also purchased a set of refill brushes for him.  </li>
            <li> Had cut down gum disease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Pulsonic electric toothbrush for years and it has never let me down.</li>
            <li> I have never even had a bristle come off and get stuck in my teeth as I have with other brands!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is you receive the one little brush head that we never use.</li>
            <li> My dentist noticed that there was less plaque</li>
            <li> so I purchased another one, after all for$50 less a $15 rebate I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  </li>
            <li> They need to sell 4 paks for half the price, and I&#x27;d bump them to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It could be the toothpaste I&#x27;m using, but each brush head lasts about a month and a half before it needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving these 5 stars because I don&#x27;t have a reason to give them less than 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave this a 4 was because the other little brush is a waste.</li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S NOT TRUE.</li>
            <li> It may be a little louder, but I found that with the replacement heads purchased in the stores as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the little precision brush</li>
            <li> Twenty-plus dollars for a little bit of plastic, rubber,</li>
            <li> I do not use the little brush that is supposed to be for cleaning between the teeth.</li>
            <li> But the title is a little misleading.</li>
            <li> I leave my unit at home when I go away because it&#x27;s a little bulky to pack.</li>
            <li> Fits my little Pulsonic toothbrush</li>
            <li> The item I received is not original and did not fit my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but it&#x27;s expensive and I wish I could buy it without the extra pick head</li>
            <li> Although the description says it does, these heads do NOT fit the Vitality Sonic.  </li>
            <li> This tooth brush head will not fit -</li>
            <li> What a waste.  </li>
            <li> DOES NOT FIT ON THE ORAL B PULSONIC BRUSH</li>
            <li> The brushes were not compatible with my electric system and did not fit.  </li>
            <li> I wasted months looking in grocery stores and pharmacies.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does not fit our electric toothbrush units...</li>
            <li> The Braun will go soon and when it does I&#x27;&#x27;ll get the base to fit these</li>
            <li> This one of the few places to find brushes for Oral-B Pulsonic.  </li>
            <li> They did not fit my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Can use but not precisely compatible with oral-B pulsonic.</li>
            <li> This is no great deal unless you subscribe to regular shipments.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT fit the Vitality Sonic.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had mine for a few years now.</li>
            <li> fit my base like a glove</li>
            <li> They did not fit my oral-B.</li>
            <li> I.e. I&#x27;ve had trouble finding the replacement for this brush.</li>
            <li> so what&#x27;s a few days to wait for it in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have replacements to change every few months.</li>
            <li> I would return if it weren&#x27;t so much trouble.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult, nearly impossible, finding replacement toothbrush heads for the Oral-B Pulsonic electric toothbrush in most stores such as CVS.</li>
            <li> These brushes are hard to find, they used to sell them at drug stores and other retailers.  </li>
            <li> Nor are they too small, like the little round ones</li>
            <li> They also last for 3-4 months, which cuts down on needing expensive replacements.</li>
            <li> Too bad the smaller toothbrushes aren&#x27;t included in equal number in the refill package.</li>
            <li> I had for a few years and they seemed hard to find for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> im not able to find replacements...except for here.</li>
            <li> I fail to see the purpose of the fourth minuscule brush.</li>
            <li> Ordered this toothbrush from Walmart last year but was unable to find the replacement brushes this year.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small and fits anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I probably wont use the small headed one though</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the replacement heads aren&#x27;t carried by our local store</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit small</li>
            <li> Unable to find these replacements in a local store.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the pulsonic is not one of Oral B&#x27;s bestsellers.</li>
            <li> i have  a waterpick flosser and won&#x27;t ever use that small brush.</li>
            <li> Actually am not sure they still make it</li>
            <li> I thought all Oral-B tooth brushes were the same size, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d like to see the Pulsonic in a small batter-powered version for travel.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the 4 toothbrushes is that they include a very thin brush that I do not use nor like.</li>
            <li> Other heads I have used are sloppy and do not do a through job.</li>
            <li> These brushes are OEM and work well, but these replacements are very expensive, and they waste the value by providing only three brushes, not four.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy a new different toothbrush, which I hated!</li>
            <li> Others mentioned their bristles were hard.  </li>
            <li> , let the brush do the work, otherwise you will be brushing too hard and hurt the enamel on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding this item in retail stores.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> But it is hard to find in a store.</li>
            <li> , IT IS HARD TO TELL WITH YOUR DESCRIPTION</li>
            <li> They are hard to find in a store.</li>
            <li> Hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> And nowhere in description does it say these brushes are hard.</li>
            <li> These are seemingly hard to find in my area.  </li>
            <li> The heads are getting hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Since my dog doesn&#x27;t use the toothbrush, I&#x27;d have a hard time using all those brush heads.</li>
            <li> Hard to find replacement brushes for Oral B Pulsonic.  </li>
            <li> These can be hard to find sometimes</li>
            <li> Hard to find the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> (For me at least).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for at least five years.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this electronic toothbrush for at least 4 years.</li>
            <li> This item annoys me because you are forced to buy the &amp;#34;precision tip&amp;#34; even if you don&#x27;t want it.  </li>
            <li> I have an old Braun base and these do not fit.  </li>
            <li> Now cleanings are fast and painless (no more horrible scraping with the sharp metal hook!).</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s a tooth brush head</li>
            <li> The brush heads are also less expensive.</li>
            <li> is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> These heads for the pulsonic are less expensive because there&#x27;s no moving parts.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> A little expensive, which is why I gave it four rather than five stars.</li>
            <li> For some reason it is awkward, they don&#x27;t have the variety of bristles the other one had.  </li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are hard to find, but work well !</li>
            <li> It was a trying task to say the very least -- but my life is now fulfilled and I can get on with conquering the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only problem with the refills is the stupid pick thing that you have to buy along with the three heads, and thus the three star review.</li>
            <li> One of the things I hate about traditional electric toothbrushes is the lack of motion on my part.</li>
            <li> My solution was to use my circle punch set and cut a 3/4\\&quot; diameter doughnut shaped, thin, piece of cork from a thin sheet of cork supplied with the circle punch set.</li>
            <li> Sucks it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> The odd number of three Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush Heads and one useless precision head is inconvenient for two people.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, since I expected I would have to replace it--a waste of money and resources.</li>
            <li> Absurdly expensive.</li>
            <li> WHY are these replacement heads so expensive in the US?</li>
            <li> Unable to find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for my expensive toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I now have a toothbrush that is the wrong voltage for Switzerland.</li>
            <li> I received the item however, it is the wrong brush type.</li>
            <li> so ill keep buying them on here.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> The product is wrong.  </li>
            <li> AND SO FOR THE THIR TIME I HAVE ORDERED THE WRONG THING</li>
            <li> Unable to find replacements heads for my families</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever had, sad that it broke.</li>
            <li> The product description on the Amazon page is wrong when it states &amp;#34;Works with:</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find replacement heads and the company and oral-b knows it.</li>
            <li> returned -- wrong brand</li>
            <li> but it was expensive</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;d have a useless Oral-B</li>
            <li> It would be a sad day if I had to get rid of my toothbrush because I couldn&#x27;t find the replacements.</li>
            <li> Now they&#x27;re useless.</li>
            <li> Brush to expensive to toss.</li>
            <li> They are expensive but unable to find alternative.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the cost of a small piece of plastic with bristles!  </li>
            <li> The inside of these things grow mold like crazy.</li>
            <li> Sorry!  </li>
            <li> These things are expensive and I just want the toothbrush, please!</li>
            <li> Replacing the heads can be very expensive in the stores.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s impossible to find the heads otherwise packaged.</li>
            <li> I felt so bad when I got these for my daughter and her husband</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t buy it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> My bad.</li>
            <li> I promise that you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Base still working - hate to pay for another when one I have does the job.  </li>
            <li> Hate stores that sell then do not carry the needed replacements.</li>
            <li> The 2 bristle head is worthless, and will never get used.  </li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d quit with the stupid pick and just include a 4th toothbrush head!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received product quickly and no issues with anything. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Absurdly expensive. After reading reviews of nonbrand decided to go with these because I know they work and won&#x27;t fall apart. They are quality.</li>
            <li> An excellent, cost-effective choice for an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I have used my pulsonic tooth brush for four years. One thing I like particularly is that it comes with a precision tip in addition to a normal brush head. The replacement brushes are as good as the originals. My only complaint is that I get only one precision tip in one package. I wish that they can provide a 2+2 package instead of 3+1. Or maybe they can provide separate packages for normal heads and precision ones so that people can choose how many they want for each kind. Four stars for this reason, otherwise I will rate it five stars.</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to find these to replace my toothbrush.  Can&#x27;t find these in the stores.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> WHY are these replacement heads so expensive in the US? I bought my Oral-B Pulsonic while overseas and love the size and function of it but these brushes are 3 times more expensive here.</li>
            <li> I love the oral-b pulsonic toothbrush - its small enough to travel with and keeps its charge for over a week and my dentist is always pleasantly surprised about the lack of plaque at each cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of 4 replacement heads is good value but I dropped a star due to the inclusion of the small tooth pick head - I still have the original one not used so this is waste and they should offer a pack without this option. Otherwise good value and these heads are becoming hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Very quick! Easy and reliable</li>
            <li> Stores have discontinued the product so had to search out replacement heads.  Expensive toothbrush to not be able to find replacement heads for the handle.</li>
            <li> Hey, these replacement toothbrushes work in the most fantastic of ways. I mean, they attach to your toothbrush and vibrate and clean your teeth nicely. I wasn&#x27;t sure how my day was going to start or end unless I found these replacement Pulsonic brushes. It was a trying task to say the very least -- but my life is now fulfilled and I can get on with conquering the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, my first 2 attempts to review wouldn&#x27;t post, so I decided to go over the edge to see if this one would.</li>
            <li> It is an original brush set, works perfect, I recommend it as being both a great tooth brush and great brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral-B Pulsonic for years and love it.  I have the best check-ups!  However, they are so expensive at the drug store, I was thrilled to find them cheaper thru amazon.</li>
            <li> I felt so bad when I got these for my daughter and her husband said &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve never owned an electric toothbrush. What are those?&amp;#34; hahaha</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this a 4 was because the other little brush is a waste. Just package 4 toothbrush heads and be done with it. It&#x27;s what people want.</li>
            <li> This is the proper refill for my style of toothbrush.  Unable to find anywhere else. I&#x27;m giving 5 stars for doing what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I searched several places for this item, because I bought the electric toothbrush a few years back...im not able to find replacements...except for here.</li>
            <li> Although the description says it does, these heads do NOT fit the Vitality Sonic.  The package specifies that is for the Pulsonic model only.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement purchase for the Oral B Electric Toothbrush I have had for 6+ years that I really liked.  I have been using this one for almost 3 weeks and I do like it.  I just hope it will last as long as my other one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame I have to order these things on line.  Can&#x27;t find them anywhere in stores.  Toothbrush is still going strong after many years.</li>
            <li> Great to have these replacement brushes.  I change my brush every 3 months as recommended by dentists.  I wish they came in packs of four brush heads.</li>
            <li> This vendor had incredible prices and one of the fastest shipment time I have seen in a long time.  Will be sure to deal with them again.</li>
            <li> No one seemed to keep this product on stock. I have a coupon but, is it possible to use coupons with amazon?</li>
            <li> If you have the pulsonic brush, this review will not apply to you as I am sure there is nothing wrong with the product itself, but if you have the Vitality Sonic like myself, do yourself a favor and order the \\&quot;Oral-B Sonic Complete Refill Toothbrush Heads\\&quot; instead as this one will not fit on the Vitality Sonic despite what the description on amazon says.  hopefully they will fix the incorrect description soon  [[ASIN:B0002M5JO8 Oral-B Sonic Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]]</li>
            <li> Fits my oral-b toothbrush and cleans my teeth effectively.</li>
            <li> The brush heads were exactly as described and work for what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking at refills, you already know how well the tooth brush works!</li>
            <li> Buying the refills on amazon is literally 5-6 dollars cheaper than buying it at target and walmart. Why get it there while you can purchase here. This is my 4th purchase of these brush heads. My 2 sisters and I have the pulsonic toothbrush..we love it.</li>
            <li> These sell for much,much more in local drug stores.  An excellent value.  They appear to be an exact replacement for the originals.</li>
            <li> and of course you must have the replacement heads for it. this toothbrush is way more cost effective than my old sonicare and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using the pulsonic toothbrush for about a year.  Compared to the some of the other electric brushes sold in stores this is far superior when cleaning your teeth. I have braces so it really gets between the brackets.  The only issue I find is that the refills are not sold in-stores so you have to search online.</li>
            <li> I shopped around and the deal/price I got from a 3rd party seller on Amazon was the lowest thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush type for a while now and i really like it.  It keeps my teeth clean with minimal effort.  I have not had any cavities.</li>
            <li> This is a great price. I got my order in about two or three days. I got Free shipping for my order.  I only order one package.</li>
            <li> just as described.....</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for my expensive toothbrush.  The price on Amazon was the only trustworthy place with a reasonable price.  Locally, it is cheaper to buy a new toothbrush instead of replacement heads.  These should hopefully last me quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE my pulsonic toothbrush, and the other members in my house quickly discovered it&#x27;s benefits too.  I keep these replacement heads on hand so we always have a fresh toothbrush as they wear out, and they&#x27;re much cheaper here than at my local store.</li>
            <li> Have been using electrics for a long, long time and have had this one for a little over a year; far and away the best ever. Slim, easy to clean, compact, holds charge well (over a week), fits the hand well. I would wish for 3 speeds rather than two and local brush availability (although they last surprisingly long).  Nice to write a &#x27;great product&#x27; review finally.</li>
            <li> These worked great for spares on my Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush</li>
            <li> Bought the toothbrush at cvs and couldn&#x27;t find these ANYWHERE!  So glad you sell them at an amazing price. Quick shipping, no problems whatsoever. Thanks!!!! I&#x27;m gonna order again.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great purchase great price</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly with my oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush</li>
            <li> I love the oral b pulsonic. it makes my mouth feel really clean, i&#x27;ll never go back to manual brushing! these are a good idea if you have more than one person with the same brush, the heads have different color stripes at the base so you can tell who&#x27;s is whose</li>
            <li> This company (DAB) listed this product for $12.13. After I placed my order, they cancelled my order and raised the price. I don&#x27;t plan to re-order.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush and the toothbrush heads.  These are just replacements, but this system really does a good job at keeping teeth clean and gums healthy.  I like the side of the toothbrush heads.  They are a lot like regular toothbrushes size-wise.  The small brush really cleans by the gums well.</li>
            <li> Great service--will order again</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Brush is not easily available in local stores, such as CVS, where they still sell the entire set, including the base and the stem, but have discontinued refills, such as Amazon offers.  So much for corporate diagnostics and sales grids.  Not stocking the Oral-B Brush is similar to the Republican Party blaming the Democratic party for all of the offenses and bullyism that the Republicans commit.    Political skullduggery aside, the Oral-B Brush keeps my teeth as white and clean as nothing else I have used in the past.  Using the brush is an integral part of my teeth cleaning ritual and practice morning, noon, and night.  It also keeps me smiling and out of the dentist&#x27;s chair.  Thank goodness Amazon made the decision to carry it.  For the price and the result, my recommendation is that you start brushing with the Oral-B Brush today.  I promise that you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Brushes!  Brushes!  Brushes!  Fit the Pulsonic as stated!  Others mentioned their bristles were hard.  Mine were good and soft...perhaps too soft for me...I like a high gloss polish on my teeth!</li>
            <li> This product may be fine but it does not work with Vitality Sonic toothbrushes as described. The description on Amazon says that it does work, but nowhere on the package does it indicate that it works with Vitality Sonic and the heads are too large to fit on the toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The information on the page clearly stated that it works with the Oral B Vitality Sonic.  THAT&#x27;S NOT TRUE. This tooth brush head will not fit - the attachment area on the head is too large. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was glad I purchased the additional brush heads at the same time as the toothbrush as the brush head that came with it wouldn&#x27;t stay on so I was able to try another option before returning the toothbrush so glad I didn&#x27;t have to do that.  These brush heads were a lot cheaper than standard retail and I&#x27;m all about saving money whenever and wherever I can. I will definitely replace the brush heads from this vendor when I need to.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pulsonic tooth brush with replacement heads has enhanced the care my teeth receive beyond anything I thought possible. My only regret is I purchase  the Oral-B years ago.</li>
            <li> If youa re buying something from AMAZON be aware that the voltage in Europe is different from that in the USA. I now have a toothbrush that is the wrong voltage for Switzerland.</li>
            <li> Product is great as always.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These work exactly as I expected them to. I like that there is the precision tip included as well. The brush heads last a pretty long time before starting to look worn out or frayed. The actual toothbrush overall is great and these replacement heads are great as well.</li>
            <li> As expected high quality replacement heads, have bought them before and the toothbrush continues to work as new! highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just upgrading to the unit these heads fit from an old Sonic Complete whose battery stopped being able to take a charge. Now I&#x27;m temporarily back to 1950s Ipana \\&quot;Bucky Beaver\\&quot; TV ad style until the new unit shows up, along with one of the packages shown on this page that I ordered with it. But why is the fourth one per package that funky little \\&quot;precision head\\&quot; when we all have these manual \\&quot;outer molar &amp; gap\\&quot; wedge proxy brushes the dentist sometimes even gives us as a freebie? The Sonic Complete 4-packs had all four heads as the same everyday brush--why not that option for the model that takes these?</li>
            <li> I fail to see the purpose of the fourth minuscule brush. I think that is the least useful item in the package and nobody really wants to replace the brush with that particular one. There is floss for that purpose and visits to dental hygienists. It&#x27;s definitely better than a manual toothbrush, when you use it correctly and not just keep it encased in toothpaste residue like slobs and leave it uncharged, unchanged for a decade. People need to understand this is not something they must use intensively three days before their dentist appointment. It&#x27;s a personal hygiene ritual that comes with common sense.</li>
            <li> Its a brush head that works like it a brush head :)&lt;br /&gt;That said, DON&#x27;T buy unless its \\&quot;SOLD\\&quot; \\&quot;AND\\&quot; \\&quot;FULFILLED\\&quot; by Amazon, there are many reports about cheap counterfeits here (even those fulfilled by Amazon).</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B Pulsonic since 2009. I really like this toothbrush as it gets my teeth clean better than many other toothbrushes I have tried. Too bad I can&#x27;t buy it in the stores anymore. But I am glad Amazon hs it.</li>
            <li> I received the item however, it is the wrong brush type. There was no paper work or info with the package that told me how to return/exchange the item. I still need to return the item but I need the correct info on where to return, etc.</li>
            <li> Just what I need for a good price!</li>
            <li> The Oral-B unit which uses these refill brushes is an expensive item but, for me, it has been worth every penny it cost.  My dentist says that if all of his patients cared for their teeth as I do mine, he&#x27;d go broke. Talk such as that makes the refills a good buy also.</li>
            <li> While my pulsonic toothbrush has not yet arrived for me to try these out, what I can say is that I had problems with my order. Once I was finally able to contact them, the seller fixed the problem in a timely manner going out of their way to make sure that everything was done correctly.  The brushes arrived in perfect shape much more quickly than expected.  I would buy from this seller again and give them 5 stars.  Dec update: I wish this came in an actual 4 pack. I can&#x27;t use the one that is supposed to clean between your teeth as I don&#x27;t have that much space between my teeth so that one is wasted on me. I&#x27;d rather they had a pack of brushes and a pack of those so that we could purchase only what we actually need.  The brushes however, while harder than I am used to are color coded so that the head can be switched for multiple people to use.  The thing to remember about brushing with these is what I keep in my head every single time, let the brush do the work, otherwise you will be brushing too hard and hurt the enamel on your teeth.  What I really wish is, that I could use the oral b sonic complete brushes with this brush handle, I don&#x27;t understand why they make different brush heads for each of their sonic toothbrushes or barring that, they would actually be consistent in their brusheads, these really should be softer. 2016 Update.  I don&#x27;t know why the makers of oral B are inconsistent with their sonic brushes.  One type never fits the next version of their electric toothbrush.  The first time I bought one of their sonic units, I had brushes to spare after the unit died.  Now I have the opposite problem.  I bought 2 units thinking the first would die in 2yrs like the last one.  Well, it is still going strong and the never opened one is still brand new in the box while oral b has discontinued these brush heads which are the only ones that fit either.  What a waste.  And why?</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s a tooth brush head what can you say. They work great.</li>
            <li> Brushheads did what they were supposed to do...clean teeth.  No issues with ordering or packaging.</li>
            <li> Fits my Oral-B Pulsonic perfectly! I am very pleased with this toothbrush and the replacement heads cost as compared to newer models price of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Got this Pulsonic toothbrush several months ago and my teeth have never felt or been cleaner.  I had an Oral-B 3d electric toothbrush for years and was starting to have plaque and tartar build up - this knocked it all out. I love the small size of the toothbrush and the heads are also a nice size (not too small or too large - but just right).  My fiancee&#x27; is a dental hygienist and she recommends it as well!  Again - Amazon kicks everyone else&#x27;s butt on pricing.  I highly recommend this toothbrush and replacement heads - it (in my opinion) is far superior in styling &amp; price point to the other manufacturers&#x27; out there!!</li>
            <li> These brushes were the right item, they were at a good price with free shipping. Very much cheaper than in a store.  They hold up well and are the only kind I would use.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find these locally, but Sonicare seems to dominate in the local box stores and pharmacies.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Oral-B (Braun) Pulsonic because its handle was much thinner than the Philips Sonicare product.  The brush heads are also less expensive.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are the same as the ones that come with the original toothbrush. Nothing surprising.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is awesome.  The handle and case are slim so that it does not take up a lot of room.  The slim design makes it easier to hold.  It is also lightweight.  And it was priced well.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get to wild about tooth brushes, but the Oral-B is great.  Even our dental hygienist is impressed with how clean our teeth stay.  My only complaint is you receive the one little brush head that we never use.</li>
            <li> Think &amp;#34;Past Tense&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;As it happened, I purchased these just before my Pulsonic power unit stopped working.  Then I tried to purchase a new unit and found that they&#x27;ve disappeared from the land of available products.  But the silver lining will be revealed If the Pulsonic line is ever resurrected, since I&#x27;ll already have spare brushe heads!</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for over a year, and have been very happy with it.  Replacing the heads can be very expensive in the stores.  I have seen an average price of over $25 in the stores, but have found the same on Amazon for around $15 for the same manufacturers brand.  Best price for these have always been on Amazon...</li>
            <li> I love my Oral B Pulsonic. I&#x27;ve tried many many other sonic tooth brushes. And this one is the most comfortable, with the right sized heads for my mouth. They aren&#x27;t full size, (which I have trouble getting to my back teeth with). Nor are they too small, like the little round ones, it&#x27;s kind of like Goldilocks and the three bears, this one is JUST RIGHT! (For me at least). If your considering it, buy one, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> These were $5 a piece and one brush was $20 at target. Note: one of the brushes is a fine tip</li>
            <li> Other retailers charge quite a bit more for these replacement heads! Amazon subscribe is the best way to go! The toothbrush itself is great -- much better for travel than the sonic care.</li>
            <li> love that Amazon had my tooth brush heads when no other store out there carries them plus a $3 off coupon - SOLD!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I shared an Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush. The odd number of three Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush Heads and one useless precision head is inconvenient for two people. Two packs of Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush Heads are required to keep a couple&#x27;s teeth consistently clean for six months. New colors should be added especially pink:)</li>
            <li> The Oral B Pulsonic toothbrush does a great job cleaning your teeth and it only takes a couple of seconds to change from the regular brush to the precision brush.&lt;br /&gt;The precision brush does an excellent job getting between teeth and at the gum line. My only wish would be that the refills were packaged with 2 of each type of head because I use both for about an equal amount of time each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision brush is the very thing that attracted me to the Oral B brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the excellent price, the best part about buying the replacement brushes from Amazon is that they have color bands on the bottom of the brushes so if you have to share the motor it&#x27;s easy to keep track of which brush head is yours. The previous package of brush heads I purchased at a local store were all the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing these replacements via the subscription program provides a huge savings over the store price of $29-$28 per package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my husband and then we couldn&#x27;t find the refills. Even the store that we bought the toothbrush at didn&#x27;t carry the refills. When I finally gave up and came to Amazon I was pleased to not only find them, but also to find them much cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.  They work with the sonic power handle.  The OraLB Sonic toothbrush was recommended by dentist in hopes of preventing the need for intensive dental work. I willl let you know if we achieve the objective. So far the teeth feel a lot cleaner.</li>
            <li> I got my toothbrush about 5 years ago and I cant find the replacements ,these are the only ones that work for the pulsonic, until I got on here and I thank you for having them I didn&#x27;t want to go buy a new toothbrush. so ill keep buying them on here. thank you thank you!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift aliong with  the tooth brush. I ordered these for replacements for my son who ask fo it.</li>
            <li> Was as described and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  Had a hard time finding this item in retail stores. Amazon had it and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> They had 2 pack fo tooth brush alone, but overall this 4 count head is very good.  I also wish they had different brush softness, like hard, medium and soft.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT FIT ON THE ORAL B PULSONIC BRUSH I PURCHACED THROUGH AMAZON.  WASTE OF MONEY BY FAR.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement order and it was to my complete satisfaction.  I am thoroughly satisfied with my initial purchase of the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> product came before expected, and the product was exactly what I ordered and needed.  These are hard to find, because my toothbrush if several years old.</li>
            <li> This item cost $9.99, about 40 percent of the regular price.  The item was new, and it works as it is supposed to work.  A great buy.</li>
            <li> The sevice on the product was quickas a wink and it was very well packaged - I will be good for another three months.</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly and fit my Oral B Type 3160 perfectly.</li>
            <li> On time perfect. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I received the item in an open package. Yuck. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li> Previous brushes held their firmness much longer. These have loosened up too quickly. Don&#x27;t know if they will last the recommend three months.</li>
            <li> I bought the toothbrush that these heads replace a few months ago and was pleasantly surprised how affordable the replacement heads were compared to in the stores. I like the smaller heads and the included replacement mini brush for between teeth.</li>
            <li> Was as described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and love the quality of it.  Will use for many more years to come!!</li>
            <li> What a deal! Love Oral B Pulsonic and I like to have extras on-hand. Great service, you can&#x27;t go wrong buying in bulk!</li>
            <li> Ordered this toothbrush from Walmart last year but was unable to find the replacement brushes this year. Glad that I was able to find them here because its a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I HAD DIFFICULTY FINDING REPLACEMENT BRUSHES,SO VERY DELIGHTED THEY WERE&lt;br /&gt;CORRECT &amp; REASONABLY PRICED! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I am so glad these brushes fit my Pulsonic S 15.523.2.  They are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  Its easy to use, and not bulky at all.  Makes it easy to brush for the full 2 minutes.  Stays charged for over a week.  So far, so good! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush for over a decade. My husband bought it for me when it first came out. My dentist noticed that there was less plaque and I&#x27;m keeping it that way. I was having trouble finding refills for it and was so glad that Amazon has them. Love the toothbrush and love Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have both the Sonicare and Oral-B Pulsonic tooth brushes and like the Sonicare much better. The Sonicare brush feels like it&#x27;s more effective at cleaning below the gums.  - Mark</li>
            <li> i was looking for replacement brushes without having to spend a fortune and i found a great deal on a necessity. thank you soo much, great value for good stuff</li>
            <li> So, I ended up getting the toothbrush that uses these heads on amazon a while back, but after looking for replacement heads at local stores, came back to amazon to compare prices.  I was able to save about $10 on each package by buying through amazon and ended up getting two packages.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> Works and are cheaper than store bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B electric pulsonic toothbrush for about 5 years.  My local variety stores and pharmacies have quit stocking the replacement heads.  The replacements I got fit correctly, and change the head out once a month.</li>
            <li> Ever since I got this toothbrush and use it regularly, my teeth have been super smooth.  I does a great job with removing the plaque and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it.  It works great and is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really give you an appreciation of the product, as I had to return it.  The brushes were not compatible with my electric system and did not fit.  Sorry!  However, as usual, AMAZON delivered real fast and the return was without any problem.</li>
            <li> These brushes are OEM and work well, but these replacements are very expensive, and they waste the value by providing only three brushes, not four.  Thus the value is LOW.  The problem is that third party brushes don&#x27;t last or work well (read the reviews) AND these brushes use a complex design for connecting that apparently cannot be replicated by the third party providers.  So the lesson is not to buy Oral-B electric brushes because they charge so much for replacements.  Find another brand with lower cost replacements.</li>
            <li> Got this because my dental hygenist recommended it to help my gums-I went on a one week trip and just took the brush-the charge held up fine and my mouth always feels fresh once I use it.  Will know for sure it is working after my next&lt;br /&gt;cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Two event have occurred since I made this purchase; first my dental hygenist said is was like night and day, the improvement in my gums, and secondly the toothbrush stopped working after 6 1/2 months.  I didn&#x27;t know if is was under warranty so I purchased another one, after all for$50 less a $15 rebate I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  When I received the new one,&lt;br /&gt;I saw it has a 2 year warranty so I contact the company and they are sending me another one, which I will keep as a spare.  Apparently there may be an overcharging problem, so it is suggested that every 6 months or so you should just let the battery run down without recharging-in any case I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Glad to still be able to get the replacements at a fair price.</li>
            <li> The heads have contoured bristles, which my old ones didn&#x27;t have. This should improve the cleaning action for me. A great value!</li>
            <li> I found these replacements to be priced great. They are true Oral B replacements and work well. I&#x27;m glad I found them here.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely fabulous! !!! I would recommend this product to anyone who is seeking quality. I will always order these replacement heads as long as I have my pulsonic electric toothbrush. Thanks!</li>
            <li> When the brush on my electric toothbrush began to show wear I was very disappointed, since I expected I would have to replace it--a waste of money and resources. But to my delight, I found these replacement brushes. So now my toothbrush is still working as well as it did when I first bought it! I also like it that the set includes the tiny brush for cleaning between teeth too! I would say this is a little pricey at $20, which averages out to about $5 per brush, but it was worth it to have them so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new electric toothbrush--and a brush, I might add, that is my all-time favorite, especially since it has the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; teeth speed. Thanks again, Amazon, for making products available that we might otherwise never find.</li>
            <li> Good solid toothbrush that makes me have some real pearly whites.  The price is a little bit higher than those manual brushes, but this cleans your teeth so much better saving you money long-term.</li>
            <li> I have been using these heads for months now and I noticed my gum line is getting a little messed up, my dentist told me not to put pressure when brushing, they do clean but my teeth are more sensitive now then before.</li>
            <li> As expected.  Works with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oral-B Pulsonic tootbrush as a gift for my husband, since his Sonicare broke down, and I also purchased a set of refill brushes for him.  So far, so good.  He is very happy with it, and feels it does as good a job as the Sonicare, for less money, and it&#x27;s a whole lot quieter, too!</li>
            <li> because this is my favorite toothbrush. I find that it does an awesome job of cleaning my teeth. I couldn&#x27;t be&lt;br /&gt;happier with any other brand</li>
            <li> This is not something flowery it smells somewhere between clean and medicinal. I like it a lot; did not know where to find it, went on line to Amazon and there it was.</li>
            <li> fits my toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t know what else to say but say it again it fits my toothbrush and i am happy</li>
            <li> They work great but they also rip you off.  $20 for only 3 brush refills? The 4th is a floss brush. 2 stars for value.</li>
            <li> Hard to find but product is good. I think I will have to buy another toothbrush....ok I have to put 4 more words.</li>
            <li> Vert good product for the price.  The troubld is thou, they can only be found on the internet which makes me believe they may soon be discontinued.</li>
            <li> OEM part. Performs as described.&lt;br /&gt;Speedy delivery</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads for Oral B</li>
            <li> I wish there were as many toothbrush tips as there were toothbrush heads in each package because I use both just as frequently.  From past experience, the tips lasts only as long as the heads.</li>
            <li> These brushes are hard to find, they used to sell them at drug stores and other retailers.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon sells them and the prices are better than they were at other retailers.  Evidently this brand of electric toothbrushes isn&#x27;t as popular as other brands.  I hope Amazon continues to sell these.</li>
            <li> Product matched description and works well. I would recommend to anyone trying to buy these now obsolete heads. Very smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Product description was accurate and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> The Amazon description said it would fit my toothbrush and when it arrived the box clearly says this refill is made only for one type of ORal B brush -- and that was not mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile and I love it. It is sad that they discontinued the product in most stores. However, Im glad I can go online to purchase and in bundles.</li>
            <li> These only fit the pulsonic toothbrush--not the vitality sonic as specifically stated in the product description.  The description should be corrected.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my toothbrush and came rather quickly. Had such a hard time finding a replacement toothbrush head and when I found this and it came sooner than expected, it definitely made my day!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product. But it is hard to find in a store. The size of the toothbrush head is perfect---much better coverage than others. Am very happy to have found these are still online---couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere. Other heads I have used are sloppy and do not do a through job.</li>
            <li> Base still working - hate to pay for another when one I have does the job.  Hope they continue to make</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these from Amazon before and they perform perfectly.</li>
            <li> Not what I needed.  they didn&#x27;t fit my toothbrush holder anyway.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described at a fair price, what more can be said about this item to fill the required number of words.</li>
            <li> You have to have the exact same &amp;#34;Pulsonic&amp;#34; model toothbrush to use them, but from the reviews, it&#x27;s a great toothbrush! (I don&#x27;t use them myself, I order them regularly for my employers, and they love the Pulsonic! So apparently it&#x27;s one of the best brushes around, and I KNOW the price is good, because I ALWAYS check around for the best price/quality before buying anything for them! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> The product is wrong.  We have an older version of the Oral B pulsonic.  The replacement brushes do not match.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT THE BRUSHES I WANTED, IT IS HARD TO TELL WITH YOUR DESCRIPTION AND SO FOR THE THIR TIME I HAVE ORDERED THE WRONG THING, THINK YOU COULD DO A BETTER JOB.</li>
            <li> These replacement toothbrush heads are not sold in local drugstores. They must be ordered on line.&lt;br /&gt;Work great. Glad to have found them.  A little expensive, which is why I gave it four rather than five stars.</li>
            <li> My daughter got an Oral-B toothbrush when she got her braces. She liked it a because it helped keep her braces and teeth extra clean, which is extra important in avoiding cavities while wearing orthodontia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the brush head started to wear out, I began looking for the replacements in stores.  I was shocked at the cost of a small piece of plastic with bristles!  Not to mention that most stores have them locked up in a glass cabinet, and I had to wait quite a while for an employee to open it with a key.  Eventually I found these here on Amazon and I was happy to discover that they cost less less than stores were asking.  I also got a 15% discount for using Subscribe &amp; Save, which will send them to me automatically (with free shipping) at the interval I choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads themselves work very well cleaning teeth.  The pointed head works well to help clean between the brackets on braces.  They also last for 3-4 months, which cuts down on needing expensive replacements.</li>
            <li> These brushes fit a specific model of Oral-B sonic toothbrush, and are often unavailable in stores.  The multi-pack comes at a great price.</li>
            <li> New heads they fit the toothbrush as billed. They are white. They clean our teeth as nicely as the originals did.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and I would recommend.  The brushes last about a 4-6 weeks if you use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these heads are fine if you have a Pulsonic toothbrush, but the product description incorrectly states that the brushes work with Oral-B Vitality Sonic toothbrushes.  They do not--they don&#x27;t even come close to fitting -- and now I&#x27;m out more than $20 because I opened the package and can&#x27;t return these toothbrush heads that I can&#x27;t use.  Amazon, fix your product description!!!</li>
            <li> the phone number to order refills is no longer, so I just ordered and and they came and she is happy</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth with some crowding of my bottom teeth and the small replacement head is perfect for cleaning the tight spaces;just wish  there was a replacement pack with just the small ones.</li>
            <li> the toothbrush is great for getting teeth clean and keeping plaque off.  The brushes work GREAT and bristles are gentle on the teeth and gums but do a great job</li>
            <li> Very satisified with this product</li>
            <li> I bought these heads a year ago and have only gone through two.  Of course, if you choose, you can certainly change them more often, but it really isn&#x27;t necessary due to the durability of this product.</li>
            <li> I love my Pulsonic Tooth Brush... it&#x27;s small and fits anywhere.  The tooth brush head is a MUST have item that fits on my Oral-B Pulsonic handle because it isn&#x27;t available anywhere.  So, I&#x27;m glad that I can find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Perfect size and cleans my teeth better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li> So pleased to find the brush replacements for my Pulsonic.  With the new models out, the replacements are more difficult to find in stores.  And the toothbrush works great!  Nice to have a place to get the replacements!</li>
            <li> Was able to use my Pulsonic again and already getting compliments on my teeth.  The cost was good for the amount of product.</li>
            <li> Product does what it is supposed to do.  Rated three stars due to cost.  What else can you say about a toothbrush head?</li>
            <li> these are hard and I prefer soft. I didn&#x27;t see anything in the listing and didn&#x27;t expect this. oh well, live and learn</li>
            <li> Feels like you just went to dentist, I love this toothbrush.I tell everyone it&#x27;s money well spent, do yourself a favor and get one !</li>
            <li> I love my Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush and Amazon was the only place I could find the replacement  brushes.</li>
            <li> Coould not find these anywhere  So am so happy</li>
            <li> I had looked around for a good price for the pulsonic refill brush set. Everywhere I looked the prices were around $25. I saw these at such a great price that I bought 2 packs. I enjoy brushing with my pulsonic toothbrush so much that I find that I actually brush longer. This is a good buy.</li>
            <li> We like our Pulsonic brush and this is the best price I found for the refill.</li>
            <li> I have order these same heads before and just like the first time, they work and fit like a charm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick and have had no problems with them</li>
            <li> Perfect, fast and cheap</li>
            <li> Excellent deliver time and product</li>
            <li> I have had a very difficult time finding these in stores, and I love the tooth brush, so I didn&#x27;t want to give it up just because I couldn&#x27;t find the brush heads.  I found these, they arrived in the mail in one day for free thanks to Amazon Prime, and now I can keep my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Work great, the bristles were very hard but after about two weeks of use they have soften up a bit.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, and best price on the internet.</li>
            <li> I like the clean feeling this toothbrush leaves my teeth feeling. I have been using this type of toothbrush for a couple of years and the only thing I have had to replace is the new toothbrush heads. I recommend this to anyone looking for affordable and reliable electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Extactly what I was looking for. They are hard to find in a store.</li>
            <li> I like the ratio of toothbrush heads to pointed-pic.  I find the bluish bristles to be useless- for most brushes, the color fades and you know you have to replace the head/brush.  However, I&#x27;ve found that the bristles start to splay long before the color wears off.  I&#x27;m the only user of my brush, so I don&#x27;t find the colored bands all that useful, except to keep water from getting under the head a little.&lt;br /&gt;There don&#x27;t seem to be any generic replacement heads for the Pulsonic, so these are the way to go in order to keep getting use from the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are perfect for the Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush--just what our dentist recommended for great pearly white teeth.</li>
            <li> If this were four replacement heads without the &amp;#34;precision tip&amp;#34; it would be a great deal.  However since I don&#x27;t use the precision tip, as that&#x27;s what flossing is for, it increases the cost of the three other heads to $7.12 apiece . . . not sure that&#x27;s a great deal but it&#x27;s impossible to find the heads otherwise packaged.</li>
            <li> Unable to find replacements heads for my families toothbrushes I was glad to turn to Amazon.  Found replacements, they were cheaper than I last remember paying for and they fit and function as designed.  Will be reordering more.</li>
            <li> Searching all over for the right brushes, thank you they are exactly the one I needed.  Don&#x27;t have to return because they don&#x27;t fit. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Described as &amp;#34;new,&amp;#34; but package was opened. I really hoped for a NIB item, not simply item that looks new.</li>
            <li> This is a great little toothbrush, and this is the ONLY place to find these brushes!! You Better stock up!</li>
            <li> Glad I finally found these, and enjoyed the device and finally found the replacement parts, and really glad that I did.</li>
            <li> These worked well and probably even cleaned my teeth, but the main toothbrush broke after only a year, so I&#x27;m not super impressed.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> We love the Pulsonic toothbrush. It&#x27;s one of the best on the market, but you do need to replace the brushes.  These are high quality, original equipment.</li>
            <li> These are the best! When I use my toothbrush with these my teeth feel so clean. I also like they have different heads and not all the same! Great product</li>
            <li> Love my toothbrush, but I couldn&#x27;t find replacement brushes. I had to buy a new different toothbrush, which I hated! I decided once again to search for replacement brushes one last time, within 30 seconds, amazing available...thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> While i have search for replacements for my Oral B toothbrush, but could not find them, Amazon made it extremely easy to get the product that I needed.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush, but hard to find these in stores. I wasted months looking in grocery stores and pharmacies. Got them in two days at my door.</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d quit with the stupid pick and just include a 4th toothbrush head! These things are expensive and I just want the toothbrush, please!</li>
            <li> We can no longer find these replacement heads locally and I was happy that I could find it on Amazon.  We received the heads very quickly and they fit the brush with no problem.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush ever needs replacement heads to continue being the best!  You can buy these in the store or at Amazon - regardless - you need to buy them!</li>
            <li> Fits perfect with my Oral B toothbrush.  Fast shipping and good price.</li>
            <li> Just what I need and could not locate at brick and mortar retailers.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the product however I would have liked it better if the package came with two of each type of brushes. I use the pick style every day as well as the full size brush. It seems like the pick brush gets beat up before the full brush and then I dont have a replacement for it.</li>
            <li> When I purchased the oral - B pulsonic Electric toothbrush, I was prompted to also purchase the replacement heads. I bought two of the packages. They don&#x27;t fit, and were totally useless. waste of money.</li>
            <li> These are twice as much if purchased at local discount department store or pharmacy.  Great deal if you have this type of electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great price..... 1/2 off local discount stores...... best investment in dental care I&#x27;ve made has been this electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. My teeth feel really clean after use. It takes a bit getting used to.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Too bad the smaller toothbrushes aren&#x27;t included in equal number in the refill package.</li>
            <li> Fits and works exactly as described. Only wish it was four regular brushes.  I do sometimes use the pointy brush if I am feeling extra pious about brushing since it reaches in-between teeth pretty well, as an addition to flossing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Used many years and very satisfied.  Amazon has provided the usual excellent shipment and handling.  Recommend Oral B products for all dental needs.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush that I have had.  Love that I can still get the replacement heads.  Very slim, very powerful.  Blasts gunk off teeth.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush I&#x27;ve ever had, sad that it broke. Though this product itself is amazing, nice firm yet gentle bristles worked amazingly in getting anything there was out between my teeth didn&#x27;t even need to switch to the flossing head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still wish the original tooth brush hadn&#x27;t broken because I&#x27;ve got 2 more heads that I can&#x27;t even use :(</li>
            <li> This item annoys me because you are forced to buy the &amp;#34;precision tip&amp;#34; even if you don&#x27;t want it.  It is useless to me (and from the other reviews, most other buyers).  I shudder to think of the piles of brand new precision tip heads in landfills.  Shame on you, P&amp;G.  The precision tips should be sold separately.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, fits like a glove.</li>
            <li> I could not find the replacement brushes for my Oral-B sonic brush anywhere. Found this listing on Amazon and ordered. They were a perfect fit and now I can continue to enjoy my Oral-B with new brushes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this price !! Love it !!</li>
            <li> Fit my Oral-B pulsonic slim perfectly.  They&#x27;re kind of hard to find so I was happy they were the right ones.  I probably wont use the small headed one though so that&#x27;s a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> We purchased our Pulsonic Electric Toothbrushes on the advice of our dentist.  We were very surprised at the results.  Unfortunately, the replacement heads aren&#x27;t carried by our local store so were elated to find them on Amazon.  Although they will last much longer, we make it a habit to replace the heads every couple of months. Plus, this replacement pak comes with the small brush that really gets between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Received the replacement oral-b pulsonic toothbrush heads. Perfect fit for my electric toothbrush.. Would recommend and will purchase again as needed.</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for 3 years....I  replace the head once a month....after shopping locally and purchasing replacements,&lt;br /&gt;it is better to save some $$$ and buy at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product.  I will definitely order these in the future as I cannot find them in the strores.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love my tooth brush. Why spend upwards of $20-25 in stores for each refill pack. I got two packs for $20.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price compared to local retailers.  Delivery was very quick.   I am very happy with this transaction.</li>
            <li> The item I received is not original and did not fit my electric toothbrush. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement parts for my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These keep me from having to have my dogs&#x27; (toy poodles) teeth professionally cleaned.  We brush every day.  These are the smallest brush heads (bristle tip to cheek) that we have found.  Small heads are important when you are dealing with small mouths.</li>
            <li> For the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush heads, always go with the OEM product.  Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush, the brushes just do not last very long.  Still, there work as expected, and fits well as you would expect from OEM.</li>
            <li> These tooth brush replacement heads are the best; work great!</li>
            <li> Ok, doesn&#x27;t really feel like they&#x27;re able to clean your teeth completely.</li>
            <li> While I have never tried another electric toothbrush (well, aside from the cheap battery powered ones) to compare to, I love this brush. I&#x27;m actually kind of sad because it&#x27;s getting older and I&#x27;m beginning to wonder when it will finally die on me. I&#x27;ve had it for 2+ years and really have no complaints.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted and then some.  It fits my brush holder as expected and is Oral B quality of course.</li>
            <li> Work great! My teeth are really feel real clean.</li>
            <li> worked perfect and was exactly what I was looking for. Very happy with this purchase and plan to order again.</li>
            <li> These are the replacement toothbrushes for my Oral-B Pulsonic electric toothbrush. Shopped around for the most reasonable price and ordered right here on amazon because the price could not be beat. Great value for a product I enjoy and use daily. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product comes with 3 real replacement heads and one small gum flosser thing (that already comes with the original product) that we don&#x27;t ever use. This package should have 4 ACTUAL replacement heads.</li>
            <li> The replacement brush-heads fit perfect on my Pulsonic electric toothbrush. That&#x27;s not always the case with some replacements. I would re-order without hesitating!</li>
            <li> Wife uses these and was having trouble finding them in local stores.  She likes the tooth brush and did not want to give it up.  These replacements did the job.</li>
            <li> One of the things I hate about traditional electric toothbrushes is the lack of motion on my part. It just doesn&#x27;t feel natural to simply stand there while it does the work. The Pulsonic is a nice middle ground, with me doing a minimalist interpretation of the standard brushing motion and the machine providing supplementary brushes that greatly exceed anything I would be able to do on my own. I also like that it is much less bulky and feels more natural in my hand. I went into my dentist four months (and zero uses of dental floss) after starting with the Pulsonic and she said \\&quot;finally, you&#x27;re actually using dental floss! I&#x27;m so proud of you\\&quot;. I didn&#x27;t want to break her heart, so I just nodded and smiled.    My only problem with the refills is the stupid pick thing that you have to buy along with the three heads, and thus the three star review. It just gets thrown away, and I know that increases the price. Each head lasts me roughly a month.</li>
            <li> This product was not the proper size that it was advertised for.  It does not fit our electric toothbrush units...</li>
            <li> arrived fast , nicely packed what i was looking for to go with my toothbrush.. but prefer the oral b pro over pulsonic</li>
            <li> Just what I needed that I couldn&#x27;t find in a store.</li>
            <li> They were just what I needed</li>
            <li> Normally, I just buy a whole new unit when the new model comes out, but I decided to keep this unit and just buy replacement heads. Quick delivery and no problems worth crying about.</li>
            <li> Hard as a rock. And nowhere in description does it say these brushes are hard. Waste of money unless you like super hard bristles.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, but it&#x27;s expensive and I wish I could buy it without the extra pick head</li>
            <li> My favorite tooth brush!</li>
            <li> The product description on the Amazon page is wrong when it states &amp;#34;Works with: Oral-B Pulsonic and Oral-B Vitality Sonic&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It does not work with the Vitality Sonic!</li>
            <li> Great service by Amazon... The toothbrushes are amazing... My favorite!</li>
            <li> These hard to find refills fit perfectly on my Pulsonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> A refill Gift for my Dad who just loves the tooth brush I gave to him last year.</li>
            <li> I have an old Braun base and these do not fit.  They look good so I am keeping them  The Braun will go soon and when it does I&#x27;&#x27;ll get the base to fit these</li>
            <li> We have them automatically delivered every three months and it&#x27;s cheaper that way.  We always have a new one to change out when needed.</li>
            <li> These are seemingly hard to find in my area.  They fit my Oral-B Pulsonic just fine.  They are listed for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 out of 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> great price. I love my toothbrush but now i can&#x27;t find replacements so I was thrilled to find these. Will def purchase again</li>
            <li> This particular Oral B tooth brush works very well for me.  The brush head is small and thin so it is able to get to the hard to reach areas.  I am very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I use these to brush my teeth.  They&#x27;re a bit small so i recommend fitting a number 2-4 pencil in the little opening at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush head. I always have good check-ups since I started using this. I have been using this for several years.</li>
            <li> Good value and fast service.</li>
            <li> I love the small head on this toothbrush.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I have to order the replacement heads online and can&#x27;t buy them in store.</li>
            <li> especially since could not find in stores!! Easy shopping for the brush heads on-line &amp; able to purchase enough to last a year or more!!</li>
            <li> The price shown is the best you can get online. Also it is very rare to find this replacement at stores.</li>
            <li> Can no longer find this product on the store shelves. Nice to know I don&#x27;t have to dispose of a perfectly good electric toothbrush because it isn&#x27;t the latest model. Is the exact replacement product and appeared at my door promptly.</li>
            <li> The arrived sooner than expected.  They fit the brush perfectly and cleans our teeth well.  The bristles are not too stiff or too soft.  The heads are getting hard to find in stores.  Thankful I found them here.  Great price, too.</li>
            <li> This one of the few places to find brushes for Oral-B Pulsonic.  I would be happier if I could buy the heads individually as I would like more precision heads.</li>
            <li> It worked perfect for my tooth brush. I have been using it for about a month so far so good.</li>
            <li> They did not fit my toothbrush. Waste of money</li>
            <li> It is very difficult, nearly impossible, finding replacement toothbrush heads for the Oral-B Pulsonic electric toothbrush in most stores such as CVS. This vendor provided a couple of sets of four at reasonable price, and provided the sets quickly.</li>
            <li> Great Seller - great product !!!</li>
            <li> Good delivery time. Worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Perfect for his electric tooth brush. We weren&#x27;t sure where we would find replacements, but after trusting the reviews, we were completely satisfied!!</li>
            <li> I ordered them because I&#x27;m traveling abroad (Asia) and Pulsonic isn&#x27;t sold here..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was really surprised to see that the heads aren&#x27;t compatible with my Oral B Pulsonic - how is this possible? I bought my toothbrush a year ago in Switzerland..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Oral B customer service Germany. He looked up the product and said it doesn&#x27;t seem to be an official product. So why does Amazon sell them? I told him on the package there is written &amp;#34;Copyright 2008 Procter &amp; Gamble&amp;#34; - that surprised him, cause he said Pulsonic was released 2010!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I&#x27;m stuck with it, I don&#x27;t think sending it back is any option as the fees are higher then the product price..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service guy told me there is only one single Pulsonic model sold worldwide, so it can&#x27;t be an issue between different regional products..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, it seems your supplier sold you faked goods? Or do I really have a wrong Pulsonic?</li>
            <li> I love my electric toothbrush and I feel like the Oral B heads don&#x27;t need to be replaced as often as my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Received the item as pictured,great produce the oral-b brush and now I half 4 new spare brushes. Product was packed well and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find replacement heads and the company and oral-b knows it. Stock up on this replacement head. It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Finally found these! Can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore. Fit perfectly and did the trick!</li>
            <li> nothing too fancy, but it&#x27;s what&#x27;s expected. the tiny head has absolutely no utility, and the bristles basically splay quickly. other heads work fine. kind of pricey if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Exactly the brush replacement we needed for a whole lot less money than I would have paid elsewhere!  Brushes are easy to remove and replace since both my husband and I are using it and the colored bands help us know which brush belongs to who.  I married my honey for better or for worse, but sharing a toothbrush is not part of the deal!</li>
            <li> Fast easy and always have what I&#x27;m looking for at  great prices....</li>
            <li> Everything was fine with my order/delivery, with one exception.  I specifically wanted the water pick piece described here and instead got a smaller brush.</li>
            <li> They fit the toothbrush just fine.  Look carefully at the image before you order though - The heads are not all the same, which I didn&#x27;t realize.  The one on the bottom right has just a teeny amount of bristles, and won&#x27;t work for regular brushing.</li>
            <li> returned -- wrong brand</li>
            <li> These work as expected. I really wish these were packaged with just four brush heads, but hey these are not available anywhere else I can find.</li>
            <li> I wish the price was cheaper and they had 4 full sized toothbrush heads</li>
            <li> Can use but not precisely compatible with oral-B pulsonic.</li>
            <li> They make my teeth happy.</li>
            <li> I use it 3 years!!! Here what I can call best quality product!</li>
            <li> Unable to find these replacements in a local store. Price could have been a tad lower but we love the toothbrush so we decided to have them shipped to us. Arrived in perfect condition. Was an original product, not a knock off.</li>
            <li> Great brushes and Pulsonic wand but one of every four brushes is a useless micro brush that you throw away. They need to sell 4 paks for half the price, and I&#x27;d bump them to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> One of the best tooth brush systems. The thooth brush itself last 2-3 times longer if you just charge it every 3 weeks for 24 hours. If you just leave it plugged in charging all the time, the brush (battery) only lasts 1 year opposed too 2-3 years via my method.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming great as it was a gift and we are still friends.</li>
            <li> This work perfectly on my Oral-B Pulsonic with no problems.</li>
            <li> This product came as promised....quickly. I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve found, none of the stores in my area carry these replacement heads any longer.  Therefore, it was essential to buy them online and I was happy that I found them on Amazon.  It was exactly what I needed for my Pulsonic toothbrush and the fact that it was a four pack is great so I can replace my head every six months.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit snugly to the toothbrush so it falls off when brushing.  Has something changed?</li>
            <li> I am not certain what many of the reviewers, who gave this product a 1 star rating, meant when they said that the brush head did not fit the handle. For me, it means that there is too much space between the circular top of the handle and the circular bottom of the brush head so that the brush head does not stay on the handle but rather comes off in your mouth, The circular surface at the bottom of the the brush head and the circular surface at the top of the handle should fit snugly so that the brush head locks in place and cannot wiggle free. My solution was to use my circle punch set and cut a 3/4\\&quot; diameter doughnut shaped, thin, piece of cork from a thin sheet of cork supplied with the circle punch set. Then I cut a 7/16\\&quot; diameter hole in the center of the 3/4\\&quot; diameter cork piece so as to be able to slide this cork \\&quot;doughnut\\&quot; over the shaft of the handle. This piece of cork filled the space nicely between the brush head and handle and the problem is solved. Also, since the outer edge of the cork \\&quot;doughnut\\&quot; extends slightly beyond the circular edge of the brush head, it forms a nice drip edge that prevents the goop from your mouth running all the way down the handle and down your arm.</li>
            <li> Happy to receive a difficult to find item at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> What can I  say, Oral-B. always an excellent product manufacturer. I replace them about once every 4 months or so.</li>
            <li> I have the brush and ordered the replacement heads so until they are needed I will give a 4 star.</li>
            <li> I found this product very compatible and great value. I have used it and happy to recommend to new users.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just left the dentist. They are cleaner and the spin brush polishes teeth too. And be sure to buy thru amazon and not another. The creeps get your Money and you don&#x27;t get product. Thanks amazon for good pricing and reliable quick delivery</li>
            <li> Great deal for the spare brush heads for my Oral B pulsonics toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should last me for the year.</li>
            <li> Brushes are a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is narrow and easy to grip. Heads work well.</li>
            <li> These were hard to find, but I am so glad I stopped here!  The price is great, and it was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> These are kind of difficult to find in a single or multi pack in any type of Target, Walrgreens, CVS or Walmart. This purchase made me realize if I can&#x27;t find it in a store...look on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. It&#x27;s the best price I can find. I hope manufacturer bundles this in a six pack or more for additional savings.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these brush tips in stores locally so decided to check on line, sure enough there they were</li>
            <li> Great price, exactly what I ordered, fits toothbrushes perfectly.  Arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> this is the slimmest, most portable sonic brush on the market, hard to find in stores. Travels well. Not sure why the pulsonic is not one of Oral B&#x27;s bestsellers.</li>
            <li> i learned not to wait until your bristle is worn out too much until it feels like wires.  it can hurt your gums.  now i can replace the brush head as soon as i see a sign of wear.</li>
            <li> This is no great deal unless you subscribe to regular shipments. Since my dog doesn&#x27;t use the toothbrush, I&#x27;d have a hard time using all those brush heads. However, for some reason these brush heads are hard to find, so I&#x27;m delighted I can order them.</li>
            <li> I had checked out multiple local drug stores and could not find the correct replacement toothbrush head for my Oral-B.  This did the trick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 3 brush heads and a toothpick head.  The toothpick head just gets thrown away in our house, so 5 stars if they&#x27;d ship this without.</li>
            <li> These fit a wonderfully slender model introduced some years ago--I adore it and pray they never, ever, quit making new brush heads!</li>
            <li> Bought my Pulsonic in the store a couple years ago and now you can not find the replacement heads, So this was great, don&#x27;t have to buy another toothbrush now since I found these on line. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Hard to find replacement brushes for Oral B Pulsonic.  These are the correct ones.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t especially like the toothbrush but it was expensive so I will keep using it.  Brushheads are great!  Good Valu and I can&#x27;t find them in the stores.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT fit the Vitality Sonic. Error in product description.</li>
            <li> There is nothing much to say other than they work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love it. They fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> The stores stopped carrying the replacements for my pulsonic toothbrush. I like to change my brushes often to prevent germs. I thought I was going to have to get a different brand electric tootbrush but I found the replacement heads on Amazon and buy several on a regular basis. Amazon to the rescue again!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and on time delivery. I am very happy and will shop here again. Thank you, Patrick : )</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pulsonic is my favorite toothbrush! I love the price and delivery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one of those people that was born with problematic teeth and every visit to my dentist is like a visit in Hell. Since I&#x27;ve stared using the Pulsonic, my teeth have been sooo good and my checkups have been perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these replacement heads anymore! but good for me as i found out. I used to pay like $28+ for a 3-pak at Target.  Now I can get same 3-pak for 1/2 that on amazon! excellent!  It&#x27;s the same product.  Works the same.  It may be a little louder, but I found that with the replacement heads purchased in the stores as well.</li>
            <li> I love my oral b pulsonic.  These heads fit perfect and made it like new again. I don&#x27;t use the little precision brush but otherwise its not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> Looked in stores around my area and couldn&#x27;t find the replacement. Works great and the package was the same as the days when I could. Would gladly pay extra for the convenience.</li>
            <li> Inconsistency in overall products. Some fit; some don&#x27;t. Some come apart while brushing.</li>
            <li> My family loves the pulsonic toothbrush and the heads last a reasonable time.  This product is pefect because it comes with the mini flossing tool.</li>
            <li> these are hard to find heads, but they are the right ones- they work. i will get them again and again</li>
            <li> Never had any problems.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush and the replacement</li>
            <li> The product is great, but the price for these replacement heads is outrageous. It does not make sense that they should cost so much.</li>
            <li> I love the oral-b pulsonic!  I&#x27;m happy that I can get the refills online.</li>
            <li> They work fine. It&#x27;s a brush head replacement.... and works!!&lt;br /&gt;I subscribed to get a deal on the price. But after a while I end up with like 3 full replacements</li>
            <li> When I was a kid, the only electric toothbrushes I knew about were the cheesy spinning kind that just irritated your gums. This tooth brush is easy to use and my teeth feel as clean when I step  out of the chair after a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office. I used to dread those cleanings and usually a new cavity would be found. Now cleanings are fast and painless (no more horrible scraping with the sharp metal hook!). I also notice my breath is fresher! I love this toothbrush and I&#x27;ve had mine for a few years now. It&#x27;s still going strong and I ordered one for the boyfriend as well :)</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are nice quality and all is well with them. My only problem is with the price. Twenty-plus dollars for a little bit of plastic, rubber, etc. is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I just got out of hygenist chair!!! So clean.  Hoping I get great report from dentist on gum care.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place where I can find extra brush heads for this brand. If I would have know that I would have brought another toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly with my Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush. Bought them with a coupon which made them cheaper than anywhere I could find. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> Nice replacement for Oral-B Pulsonic toothbursh. It can provide easy use and good quality. It provide convenience and user friendly features.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about how these would be, but the quality is great. I couldn&#x27;t find these in any store, and the replacements on Oral-B&#x27;s site were way more expensive.</li>
            <li> This product was fine. Works great. Made well. Had cut down gum disease. not much else to say about a toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Oral B Pulsonic brush for two years now and I love the brush. I think it does a really good job cleaning my teeth. I&#x27;m rating it at 3 stars, however, because in the four brush head replacement pack, one of the brushes is a \\&quot;precision tip\\&quot; which I have never once found a use for, and it just gets tossed. Figuring $20 for a 4 pack, that&#x27;s throwing away $5 every time I need to buy replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> I like it, it was what i nedd. I will continue to shop with you guys. thanks for your quick delievery</li>
            <li> The Pulsonic is not longer made by Oral B, so finding them on Amazon was great.  Since they&#x27;re manufactured by Oral B, there&#x27;s no question on fit or function.  Wish they still made this model as ours are wearing out.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. Would recommend it to anyone who is thinking of buying the replacements this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I wanted plus more!  More because I got two replacements.  I kept telling my husband that Amazon would have them, but he wanted to look for them in the stores.  Initially Oral-B Pulsonic was recommended by my dentist, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described and on time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and but could not find locally after making the purchase of the toothbrush. Excellent value for the price paid.</li>
            <li> I was really glad to find replacement brushes for my electric toothbrus. I had for a few years and they seemed hard to find for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have a pack in store so I will never miss out on them again</li>
            <li> So glad to find them on amazon. I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in my local stores any more. My teeth feel much cleaner with these than they do when I use a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush that these go to is our favorite of any we&#x27;ve tried. Refills are hard to find in stores, so we&#x27;re glad to be able to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> still had a brush but the stores stopped selling the heads.  Glad I found these or I&#x27;d have a useless Oral-B</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush heads is the same because they are OME equipment. But the price is still waaaaaaay too much for what you get.</li>
            <li> Had looked everywhere for replacement heads for my older Oral-B electric toothbrush, but couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  Found them on Amazon.com and they were exactly what I needed and at a good price too.  I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for at least five years.  I would definitely recommend these, but be sure you have the toothbrush specified.</li>
            <li> I  cannot find this at my local store so I&#x27;m glad I found it online and the price is great!</li>
            <li> I had looked all over for these replacement heads for my electric toothbrush.  I love the brush but the local stores no longer carry the refills.  I hope they are still available next time I need them.</li>
            <li> I do not use the little brush that is supposed to be for cleaning between the teeth. I wish they would package them separately and give you four regular brush heads instead of three. I love the Pulsonic toothbrush. I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it. It is getting harder to find the replacement brushes anywhere but Amazon.</li>
            <li> arrived ontime and as ordered. the packaging back is made out of paper. i was supposed to rip the top part to get the brush out, but mine was already ripped open for me. i&#x27;m not too comfortable getting an open package because it has TOOTHBRUSH HEADS! inside, but i didn&#x27;t have two more days to wait. i ran out of brushheads and had to brush my teeth. that small brush head for getting in between the teeth is not necessary in my opinion. i have  a waterpick flosser and won&#x27;t ever use that small brush. i&#x27;d much rather had an extra normal one.&lt;br /&gt;it did fit the brush unit and stays put, so it works. i&#x27;d have given the product a 5 star if arrived in intact box and was made in the us.</li>
            <li> Oral-B makes the best toothbrushes. These brush heads have a great scrubbing feeling against the teeth, and includes a small brush to get into those hard to reach crevices. If you own an Oral-B Toothbrush, you must buy this product.</li>
            <li> Brushes pull out sooner that with original Oral-B.</li>
            <li> I was SO happy to discover that Amazon carried replacement heads for this toothbrush. I was getting pretty irritated about the possibility of having to buy a whole NEW electric toothbrush in order to replace the brush heads. Whew!</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement toothbrush heads and had them in hand 3 days later without having to pay an exorbitant price for fast shipping.  They are exactly the brand you used to be able to get in the store, but since you can&#x27;t any more, I&#x27;m glad this seller has them in stock!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Brushes fit fine.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Seller!</li>
            <li> It&amp;#34;s what I was looking for. Could not find it anyplace else</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast and these were the perfect ones I needed...</li>
            <li> fit my base like a glove</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these heads as well as the ones with my previous Sonic Complete.  For some reason it is awkward, they don&#x27;t have the variety of bristles the other one had.  I do, however, like the spot  brush to get between teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush design.</li>
            <li> So glad to find these here, as the stores no longer carry them. Just know that the bristles are Medium, not Soft.</li>
            <li> Great item to get item online at a fair price!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Actually am not sure they still make it but I am able to get replacement brushes through Amazon. It&#x27;s smaller that most of the electric toothbrushes so not so bulky. Works great!</li>
            <li> These heads for the pulsonic are less expensive because there&#x27;s no moving parts.  I got them at a great price...$12 for the pack</li>
            <li> I will count on this vender in the future ! Was sent on time, in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> I was long overdue to replace the head of the toothbrush and finally broke down and got these. I waited so long because of the price, I wish it was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;But I decided to do it because I noticed the iron in my water was starting to turn the bottom of the bristles yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did it because I do notice a better brush now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this electronic toothbrush for at least 4 years. It&#x27;s hard to find the replacement toothbrush heads in the local stores around my area. Amazon has it and the price is the lowest I can find. One thing I don&#x27;t like about this replacement is the precision tip brush that I don&#x27;t use at all.</li>
            <li> These are identical to the brushes that came on the Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush.  I was delighted to find them because they don&#x27;t seem to be in my local stores.</li>
            <li> I have the Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush.  I am not aware of any other replacement toothbrush heads for this toothbrush.  I am very satisfied with the product.  But when they say &amp;#34;4 Head Count&amp;#34;; there are 3 regular heads and one small head.</li>
            <li> These can be hard to find sometimes but we love our Pulsonic toothbrushes. I haven&#x27;t found any other compatible replacement brands for the Oral-B Pulsonic so I assume that the genuine Oral-B heads are the only ones to buy, I recommend these for the price and availability, it&#x27;s really just easier to buy them here rather than run around hoping that a local store carries them.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these replacement heads anywhere except on Amazon and they are a much better price than what I was expecting from looking at the other sonic toothbrushes. Great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Oral B has the finest Teeth cleaning brushes we have ever used. We purchased some for the whole family years ago. Have always stuck with the Oral-B</li>
            <li> Good product.  Recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what i needed and when i needed it! I would recommend this product! And I got it for a good deal!</li>
            <li> It should have a larger brush head. Otherwise it is great. The pick is an added feature that I use.</li>
            <li> this one don&#x27;t fit on my S26 toothbrush, and there is no information available about which model it does fit.</li>
            <li> It could be the toothpaste I&#x27;m using, but each brush head lasts about a month and a half before it needs to be replaced. The brush heads are the same that came with the toothbrush when purchased.</li>
            <li> My wife and I really like this toothbrush set.  They clean well and the gum attachment does a good job of minimizing build up at the gum line.  We just hope that Oral-B does not phase these brushes out of their system.</li>
            <li> Purchased the toothbrush heads on line as a gift for a family member. I can only find the replacement heads on line. Wish the company made it easier for people that don&#x27;t have computers to beable to purchase it a hometown store.</li>
            <li> Hmmm...what can I say about reviewing toothbrush heads?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work as expected. Yay for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was very good.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Toothbrush heads. What more can you say. Toothbrush died after I bought them and isn&#x27;t made anymore so I didn&#x27;t get to use them</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement at a good price.</li>
            <li> I finally found the right ones.</li>
            <li> good quality, fast service.</li>
            <li> Worked fine as advertised.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get these for my old and trusty toothbrush from Target so I get them on here and am able to keep my old toothbrush running great!</li>
            <li> After looking in several stores for replacement heads, I had almost given up finding heads for my Pulsonic.  This review is not so much about the heads themselves, (any new toothbrush head is always going to feel great), as it is about the ease of finding replacements on Amazon.</li>
            <li> great price /same item I would have paid more for elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is good item!&lt;br /&gt;I like it :).&lt;br /&gt;Packing is perfect.</li>
            <li> Pricey and would rather have 4 regular heads is the only downside to the replacement heads.  Otherwise the toothbrush is a nice product (gave it 5 stars).  Does the job well &amp; doesn&#x27;t gag you like others do.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find these replacement heads in Target, WalMart, CVS, etc., but no longer seem to stock. This is the only place I could locate.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads do their job but I only wish this product were less expensive, thanks Amazon for offering what seems most of the time a better price than the normal big box retailer.</li>
            <li> it fits my pulsonic toothbrush and always makes my teeth feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wish it were a bit cheaper, and didn&#x27;t include the &amp;#34;precision tip head&amp;#34; since i never use that anyhow.</li>
            <li> I thought all Oral-B tooth brushes were the same size, I was wrong. Now I have 4 heads that are collecting dust. Am i aloud to return them for a full refund?</li>
            <li> The service was excellent. However, for me this was a complete waste of money. They did not fit my oral-B. My bad.</li>
            <li> The replacement flossing head is not very useful and I think it is a watse.  Most people will not likely to use it.</li>
            <li> The sonic brush is great, these heads are as advertised no problems, love em. Arrived on time, great price compared to pharmacy. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> These are durable great quality brush heads that last much longer than any manual toothbrush or electronic toothbrush head I have ever used, no matter the cost! I am convinced that it actually saves me money to own the Pulsonic electronic toothbrush because these heads are so durable and long-lasting, not to mention the savings on future professional dental visits because they work so well. I have never even had a bristle come off and get stuck in my teeth as I have with other brands!</li>
            <li> Execllant price. Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Good product, but expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been refilling the same order for about a year now. No disappointments!</li>
            <li> A wonderfully described item which turns out to be just as described. This is for the person who is looking for &amp;#34;just the right thing&amp;#34; in this category. There is not one bad thing to point out and therefore is perfect in every way discernable to the discriminating consumer. Buy with confidence that satisfaction will be found in this product.</li>
            <li> They fit, they work like they should, they are expensive.</li>
            <li> These are the original item by Oral-B and they fit like the original. They actually last a long time. Of course, my idea of a long time for a toothbrush to last is a month. By then, even if they still look OK, they have been in the toothpaste, my mouth, and on the counter long enough that they need to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is very good.</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are hard to find, but work well !</li>
            <li> Pulsesconic fit great</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit our Oral B electric brushes.</li>
            <li> Works just like it is supposed too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over five years, I haven&#x27;t changed because I haven&#x27;t found anything better in the market. There are generics out there, they just don&#x27;t feel the same, cheap and flimsy, I rather stay with these.</li>
            <li> Great product. Sucks it&#x27;s expensive. But they last awhile.</li>
            <li> Fit the brushholder like it should and cleans like it should.</li>
            <li> I wish that Oral-B still made this toothbrush. It&#x27;s the best that I&#x27;ve ever used. Cleans my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t even come close to working with a &amp;#34;vitality sonic&amp;#34; as the description says.</li>
            <li> My tpothbrush is like new again!</li>
            <li> Back again for more. I could not find this item in my stores anymore. They might not be cheap, but is the only one that fits correctly my toothbrush. They actually arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as expected. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and it was a joy to see that Amazon offers the replacement heads. It would be a sad day if I had to get rid of my toothbrush because I couldn&#x27;t find the replacements. They are new, so it&#x27;s just like having a new toothbrush whenever I buy the replacements! Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the 4 toothbrushes is that they include a very thin brush that I do not use nor like.</li>
            <li> Love my Pulsonic toothbrush heads! Now why doesn&#x27;t Wal-Mart sell these locally anymore?!?</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re OEM Pulsonic replacement heads.  They work fine.  And they&#x27;re cheaper here than any local big box stores.  What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Just as good as the originals that came with the toothbrush. I can&#x27;t detect any difference at all. They last a LONG time too.</li>
            <li> Yo have the toothbrush, so you know what you&#x27;re getting. Enough said. These seem to be harder and harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I bought it on here because its almost impossible to find any where outside of the web, they work very well.</li>
            <li> My local Target recently discontinued this product.  I&#x27;m sorry to see it go, as I think this is a great toothbrush system.  Good price quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these brushes! They seem to last awhile too. Make sure to change them if you get sick too or you will re-infect yourself</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need the little brushes, so it looks like a much better deal, but it was still a good price for the 2 that I wanted</li>
            <li> I bought these then the month after my machine broke. Now they&#x27;re useless.</li>
            <li> I like the always prompt response on amazon products, I choose this item to replace the last set of tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush, but why are the replacement heads so expensive and hard to find? These are no where to be found in my area (not a large city).</li>
            <li> I am happy with these replacement toothbrush heads because I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere else.  Not even where I bought the electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love the brush, I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Finding replacement packages can be a pain. So I ordered some from Amazon. Everything is perfect. But in the title it says \\&quot;4 count\\&quot; I thought I was getting 4 packages. BUT EACH brush counts as one. Its not a rip off because every where else sells them for 25+. But the title is a little misleading.</li>
            <li> These heads work well at cleaning my reach. However, I feel that the round heads do a better job since these heads are hard to get in hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but god hard to find and expensive.  I wish there was a generic.</li>
            <li> Replacement toothbrushes -- what more can be said. Appear to be identical to brush supplied with power head when new.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement. Economical too.</li>
            <li> Kinda pricey, but the only replacement I&#x27;ve found so far for this toothbrush. I.e. I&#x27;ve had trouble finding the replacement for this brush. Seems not very common.</li>
            <li> The product did not work with my braun tooth brush handle. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> My package was open when I got and it should not have been  open</li>
            <li> I live in Canada and these replacement heads are hard to find so I was happy to find some online and get them shipped to me!</li>
            <li> The oral b brushes for the pulsonic toothbrush are ptitty ok the mouth but the brushes should be made to withstand 6 months of use instead of 3 months. By the way Brun should dismiss the precision brush I don&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> It is nice having new bristles. Feels much better with the new ones. Works great.</li>
            <li> Was looking for months for the proper replacements. Plan on buying a few more to keep on hand. Great Buy.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Price was pretty fair too. I would purchase this again.  Description isn&#x27;t correct.  There are only 3  brush heads and another type of head.</li>
            <li> This is quality toothbrush and its doing what its supposed to. nine more words required five more words required one</li>
            <li> Since Oral-B seems to have discontinued the Pulsonic line, this is the only way I can get replacement heads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Pulsonic electric toothbrush for years and it has never let me down. Visits to the dentist confirm that my gums and teeth are healthy and getting a good workout.I like the built in timer that tells you when it&#x27;s time to move on to the next section of the teeth. The brush heads snap on and off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is the availability of the replacement heads. I don&#x27;t see them or the appliance in the grocery store or Walmart like they used to be. It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy them on site, but the pricing on Amazon is good, so what&#x27;s a few days to wait for it in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to see the Pulsonic in a small batter-powered version for travel. I leave my unit at home when I go away because it&#x27;s a little bulky to pack.</li>
            <li> Good replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> very good, but it is so powerful you must use a light touch and let the brush do the work</li>
            <li> Excellent brush heads, just hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have had my toothbrush for several years and was not able to find these heads in stores. I sent for these&lt;br /&gt;and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Love my Pulsonic and these replacement heads are a must.  This is a 9 month supply and with the coupon I had made the price excellent.</li>
            <li> Many years later keep replacing with same Oral B, ... electric toothbrush is still working like the 1st day.... and replacement keep coming every 3 or 4 month.&lt;br /&gt;Feeling of you are getting out of the dentist. No need to bleach or something drastic for your dental needs.&lt;br /&gt;The small attachments fit perfect</li>
            <li> Great product and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for replacement heads for my Oral-B toothbrush but could not find them at any of the local drug stores so I was happy to see them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They fit perfectly and the price was fair. Wish I could have just bought 1 replacement head but the pack came with 4 replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Had trouble finding this item locally.  Happy to find it online.  I considered the aftermarket replacement heads, but I&#x27;m glad I purchased the ones endorsed by Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere locally in any store so I turned to Amazon Prime. There they were at a reasonable price. Perfect. Fits my little Pulsonic toothbrush and I have replacements to change every few months.</li>
            <li> A great tooth brush and I just keep hoping I can contiinue to find the replacement parts. It has worked well for me as an adult with braces, batter life on the tooth brush itself is great. Refill brushes last quite awhile provided you don&#x27;t have braces tearing them apart, but despite that mine still last awhile. It has helped me clean up gum issues and I will continue to use this brush until it either dies or I cannot find parts for it any longer.</li>
            <li> Fit my toothbrush perfectly.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> These fit the toothbrush...the generic do not. I love the fact they come with the small between the teeth brush replacement too</li>
            <li> So happy I found these replacement heads. I had been searching in our local stores and no one carried these.</li>
            <li> The replacement head fits correctly and the tooth brush works with it. The shipping was fast and everything functioned well with my equipment as was advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving these 5 stars because I don&#x27;t have a reason to give them less than 5 stars.  Considering that these are toothbrush heads, there isn&#x27;t much that can be said for them in a review.</li>
            <li> Item was perfect, arrived quickly and was as advertised.  Would buy again from this person.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great and just what I wanted. I&#x27;ve been looking for months in all my local pharmacies, which is where I&#x27;ve purchased them in the past. My daughter has the same tooth brush and she&#x27;s been looking in her area, some 500 miles from my home and she&#x27;s not been able to find replacements either. Trust Amazon! As soon as we tried looking online, there they were, at a store we love and trust and they are exactly what we&#x27;ve spent months looking for in the same places we bought our toothbrushes. Good quality, timely arrival, great price!</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement heads for my Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush.  The heads fit perfectly as expected.  Shipping was fast and would definately order these again.</li>
            <li> Good product, at a great price, and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> $8 a piece for tiny toothbrushes. Seriously? These wear out faster than the free toothbrush the dentist give out and yet cost more than the &amp;#34;Super toothbrush 2000 with color changing flex bristles&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the mold... the MOLD. The inside of these things grow mold like crazy. Disassembling the toothbrush after every use will not stop mold from growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth were super white though.</li>
            <li> suitable, not same as the original one within electric brush</li>
            <li> Great price quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Works fine but don&#x27;t need the water pik device that is included.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Preforms great. Exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again for sure.</li>
            <li> Thank the gods I found these. Can not find at the store I bought it from and no one else in area carry. Brush to expensive to toss. Hate stores that sell then do not carry the needed replacements.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pulsonic Electric Toothbrush is a great tooth cleaning device.  However, the package of heads leaves something to be desired.  They provide 3 full-size heads and one head with 2 bristles.  The 2 bristle head is worthless, and will never get used.  I feel like I was cheated out of 1/4 of my purchase price.</li>
            <li> This is the only place that I can find replacement heads for my Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush. I receive them on an automatic delivery. I just hope the toothbrush holds up. My dentist always give me good marks for clean teeth!</li>
            <li> I have had the Pulsonic for many years now. Hard to find the replacement heads. These came quick and work fantastic on the toothbrush</li>
            <li> The blushes are great except for the flosser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a few years now, and am always pleased with it. It comes on a regular schedule and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The oral-b replacement electric toothbrush heads meets all my expectations.  I purchased the oral-b pulsonic electric toothbrush several years ago, and I am happy I can find replacement heads at amazon.</li>
            <li> These are great and go with the toothbrush systems I purchased for gift.  Price is great, and they were shipped promptly for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> The first of these heads pinches my lip every now and then.  I would return if it weren&#x27;t so much trouble.</li>
            <li> As specified. OEM. Works well. The type of toothbrush is important. This needs to be stressed in the listing. Oral B has many models.</li>
            <li> They do fit the Oral B pulsonic brush.  They are expensive but unable to find alternative.&lt;br /&gt;Wish there is a generic one for sale.</li>
            <li> Works Great! Fit perfect 😄</li>
