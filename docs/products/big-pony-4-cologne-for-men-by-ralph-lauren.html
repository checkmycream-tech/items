            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of Ralph Lauren or you need an office safe (or after a gym workout/shower) fragrance, add #4 to your collection.  </li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>100% original and this super good price</li>
            <li>it is very much worth it !!</li>
            <li>I love to smell it on my son its not to strong.</li>
            <li>I get it right on time to my Fathers Day Gift!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with Polo&#x27;s Big Pony Collection.</li>
            <li>IT IS GENUINE 100%&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It is light and cheerful and doesn&#x27;t overwhelm your sense of smell or hang in the air after the person leaves the room.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad fragrance - I like citrus notes.  </li>
            <li>all of the big pony polo numbers and thisw is far most my favorite one</li>
            <li>I get many compliments while i am out and it last for a long time and its a very fresh smell !!</li>
            <li>Along with all the others of the big pony collection I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>Smell is good &amp; long lasting</li>
            <li>BRAND NEW!!</li>
            <li>VERY REFRESHING&lt;</li>
            <li>This is very citrusy and youthful, without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I get straight citrus notes from beginning to end.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>Big Pony #4 and #1 were the first two added - probably because I am more attracted to orange and blue.  </li>
            <li>price value is good, or even above average.  </li>
            <li>I will add that I do like the bottle and packaging - classic Ralph Lauren design.  </li>
            <li>#4 does offer a great option for office wear - as previously noted, the fragrance sits close to the skin and longevity is below average.  </li>
            <li>If you do not fit into those categories, pass on #4 - there are better citrus based fragrances out there</li>
            <li>not sure I love it.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived early.</li>
            <li>like it in the early morning as I go to work...</li>
            <li>but the fragrance would last the whole day.  </li>
            <li>and it is a classy bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I generally spray the cuff on each sleeve at the seam to check performance during the day..</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Ralph Lauren fragrances - at least 10 in my current collection and added all the Big Pony editions about a year ago.  </li>
            <li>#4 is a decent fragrance, but it lacks historically proven Ralph Lauren charisma, not to mention is below average in longevity and projection/sillage.  </li>

            <li> Sadly, this product doesn&#x27;t do the same it only last somewhere between 2~3hours, not worth the buy for that price.  </li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t last long at all :(</li>
            <li> and now I don&#x27;t have to smell that horrible store bought stuff my teenage boy would wear that came from the grocery store, its initials are O.S.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they have decided to discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> Very happy with the seller. The product arrived early. Would buy from them again! I&#x27;m happy with Polo&#x27;s Big Pony Collection. My only complaint would be that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like it to. Have to keep re-applying.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly and product was as described! Would definitely buy from seller again! I am completely satisfied with the transaction.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so good; it has a fresh smell. I love to smell it on my son its not to strong.</li>
            <li> Came as expected and on time.</li>
            <li> love it i have purchased all of the big pony polo numbers and thisw is far most my favorite one</li>
            <li> DO NOT HESITATE! IT IS GENUINE 100%&lt;br /&gt;This is the best one in the Pony Collection! Everyone asks me about it as they smell it!&lt;br /&gt;I like it in the early morning as I go to work... VERY REFRESHING&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT</li>
            <li> The package should have been delivered between 13-Sept-2013 and 18-Sept-2013 but its been over 10 days and still have not got the package. Have already written 2 emails and have got no replies from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tracking number provided hasn&#x27;t been updated since 11-Sept-2013 and is showing \\&quot;Electronic Shipping Info Received\\&quot; since that day.</li>
            <li> It was here on time and smelt amazing. Great Fathers Day Gift!! I would defanitly recommand this user, great timing, and great product. BRAND NEW!!</li>
            <li> I bought the smaller version of the big pony at Macy&#x27;s, it cost my like $40 but the fragrance would last the whole day.  Sadly, this product doesn&#x27;t do the same it only last somewhere between 2~3hours, not worth the buy for that price.  This is my honest opionon.</li>
            <li> smell great good size</li>
            <li> What can I say, if you love cologne, and owning a library of mens colognes like I do, then you will love it!</li>
            <li> Smells great and now I don&#x27;t have to smell that horrible store bought stuff my teenage boy would wear that came from the grocery store, its initials are O.S.  This is very citrusy and youthful, without being overpowering.  It is light and cheerful and doesn&#x27;t overwhelm your sense of smell or hang in the air after the person leaves the room.  The perfect scent for my son, he really likes it too, he wears it every day.  He loves everything Polo.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Too bad they have decided to discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in soggy box due to leaky bottle. Probably .25 ounces gone.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> good seller, and excellent product</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Ralph Lauren fragrances - at least 10 in my current collection and added all the Big Pony editions about a year ago.  Big Pony #4 and #1 were the first two added - probably because I am more attracted to orange and blue.  #4 is a decent fragrance, but it lacks historically proven Ralph Lauren charisma, not to mention is below average in longevity and projection/sillage.  Other reviews mention &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; notes, but I get straight citrus notes from beginning to end. Not a bad fragrance - I like citrus notes.  My issue (I have plenty of issues, but let&#x27;s stick to the ones regarding the fragrance..!!), is that it lacks the &amp;#34;uumph&amp;#34; to get noticed and does not last.  I got about 4 hours from this fragrance and shortly after the initial application, #4 settled close to skin level.  Yes, I did smell the fragrance on my clothing for a longer period (I generally spray the cuff on each sleeve at the seam to check performance during the day..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the citrus basenotes, #4 is best suited for day wear and in Spring and Summer.  #4 does offer a great option for office wear - as previously noted, the fragrance sits close to the skin and longevity is below average.  I will add that I do like the bottle and packaging - classic Ralph Lauren design.  I am especially drawn to the orange bottle - I like orange and it is a classy bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price value is good, or even above average.  A check of current pricing suggests that a small bottle can be purchased for about $30 USD.  Not too shabby..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Big Pony #4 is 4 stars out of 5.  I like it, but not sure I love it.  If you are a fan of Ralph Lauren or you need an office safe (or after a gym workout/shower) fragrance, add #4 to your collection.  If you do not fit into those categories, pass on #4 - there are better citrus based fragrances out there that last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and make it count - invest your time rather than wasting it..!!ting it..!!</li>
            <li> Along with all the others of the big pony collection I absolutely love it this is my second time puchasing it. I get many compliments while i am out and it last for a long time and its a very fresh smell !! Great job Ralph Lauren I would recomend anyone to purchase this item it is very much worth it !!</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it came in on time just when I needed it. the perfume came nicely proctect</li>
            <li> Smell is good &amp; long lasting</li>
            <li> It is what it is! Smells SO good!!</li>
            <li> Amazing smelling cologne! Just doesn&#x27;t last long at all :(</li>
            <li> excellent product excellent selling very fast and very reliable treatment very good aroma 100% original and this super good price</li>
