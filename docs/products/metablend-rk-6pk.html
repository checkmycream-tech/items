            <li>I have more energy all day and</li>
            <li>I do not use this for weightloss, but more for energy so can&#x27;t give RK a weightloss review.</li>
            <li>I do believe I have more energy</li>
            <li>clean eating routine.</li>
            <li>I can find myself eating my lunch and feeling full</li>
            <li>Pants fit better, and last years shorts zipped right up!  </li>
            <li>I still have about 20 pounds that I would love to lose, its not about who makes it in first but about who is strong enough to make it through!</li>

            <li>Right there is my problem.  </li>
            <li>I returned the product because it did not look the same as the original product from slim fit labs.</li>
            <li>but i am sure soon or later with disipline it will work...</li>

            <li>Now, lets be realistic: there is no miraculous weight loss product, nothing that will drop your pounds and inches if you eat without control and dont add some excercing to your life.</li>

            <li>The product appeared old and murky, I did not try it.</li>
            <li>I lost 50 pounds so far in just 3 months.</li>
            <li>So far have lost some belly fat and about 7 pounds.  </li>
            <li>and if I drink a couple bottles throughout the day, I don&#x27;t get the mid day sleepiness I normally felt.</li>
            <li>This is by far the only product that has helped me lose weight.</li>

            <li> After modifying my diet and increasing my exercise, I have had very little positive results (weight loss) with this Metablend supplement.</li>
            <li> I am someone who only wanted to loose anywhere from 5 to 10 pounds.</li>
            <li> So, whether this product curves your appetite, it&#x27;s possible, but if the reasons why you over eat are similar to mine, drinking this will do nothing for you, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Didnt loose any weight</li>

            <li> I got sick after drinking it but in 20 Min I eat something and was better.  </li>
            <li> Instead of reaching for other things in my pantry and fridge</li>
            <li> It was a waste of $100.00.</li>
            <li> I think I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Now, I exercise nearly everyday</li>
            <li> inside the box it is the green tea flavor .</li>
            <li> After NOT taking Metablend for the past 2 1/2 weeks, I lost 4 lbs.</li>
            <li> It has been hard on us.  </li>
            <li> I play a mind game with it.....</li>
            <li> The lady in the Sams said we could if we were not happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> If I am sad or stressed I will eat.  </li>
            <li> Sorry we did not like it.</li>
            <li> and I lost weight to say the least!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it work for me.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by this product. My mom had tried a sample while shopping at Sam&#x27;s Club one day. She gave me a bottle to try. If anything it helped me to get the right amount of fluids consumed each day. I really like the flavor and feel as if it helped me to jump start my fitness and clean eating routine. It was also a lot cheaper to order on Amazon than through the company or at my local retailer.</li>
            <li> Gives.me energy and curbs my appetite</li>
            <li> This is by far the only product that has helped me lose weight. It decreases my apetite and it gave me energy to work out. I lost 10-15 lbs that I have not gained even though I have not been so good with watching what I eat. Now, lets be realistic: there is no miraculous weight loss product, nothing that will drop your pounds and inches if you eat without control and dont add some excercing to your life. It is possible if you are willing to help. I still have about 20 pounds that I would love to lose, its not about who makes it in first but about who is strong enough to make it through! Good luck all!</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes great and works really well. Take it a directed and you will get results. Combine it with a good diet and exercise and you will get amazing results.</li>
            <li> After modifying my diet and increasing my exercise, I have had very little positive results (weight loss) with this Metablend supplement. In fact, actually GAINED weight after faithfully taking four (4) bottles. After NOT taking Metablend for the past 2 1/2 weeks, I lost 4 lbs. with daily excercise &amp; diet modification...WOW!!</li>
            <li> Didnt loose any weight</li>
            <li> I am someone who only wanted to loose anywhere from 5 to 10 pounds. I didn&#x27;t loose any weight. I may also have gained a couple pounds. I was combining the Metablend RK along with the De-Carb CGX to get the benefit of both as suggested to me by the salesperson. It was a waste of $100.00. On the upside, it did taste good.</li>
            <li> First I purchased this item at a big box store. I need some more so I decided to buy it on line. The product that I purchased on line is not as good as the original that I purchased, taste very weak and did not have the same effects as the first box I purchased. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the same product although the boxes look identical. I think I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I returned the product because it did not look the same as the original product from slim fit labs. The product appeared old and murky, I did not try it.</li>
            <li> So, this didn&#x27;t work for me, in fact, I gained 7 pounds.  Now the reason why I am not trashing this product in my review is because I am giving it the benefit of the doubt as it may just be that this product is meant to help specific people:  people that are overweight because they over eat because they are hungry.  I saw an earlier review that said: it works, just combine with exercise and diet and you&#x27;ll see results, well LOL, if you diet and exercise I can also sell you a drink that will probably work for you!  Now, I exercise nearly everyday and I don&#x27;t eat junk.  However my problem is my portions and constant eating, but the reason why I think this product didn&#x27;t work for me is because I am an emotional eater.  If I am sad or stressed I will eat.  I can find myself eating my lunch and feeling full and I still have half of my food left on my plate and I will finish it.  Right there is my problem.  So, whether this product curves your appetite, it&#x27;s possible, but if the reasons why you over eat are similar to mine, drinking this will do nothing for you, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, I will continue to order as needed.</li>
            <li> Works!!! Tastes great</li>
            <li> Totally disapointed . I received the box with different container  that had nothing to do with my order . I asked for strawberry flavor and  they sent me the box with the picture of the strawberry but inside the box it is the green tea flavor . Now I do not know how to get my money back because  lost the credit card that I use to purchase , unless they sent me my original flavor</li>
            <li> just bought it from Sams club but i know it taste great in lipton ice tea and made smoothies with it and I  drink them every morning and it do curve my cravings for sweets the whole day so glad i got it not sure about weightless but i am sure soon or later with disipline it will work...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a diet guy BUT there was a guy sampling this at SAM&#x27;s club and I tried it, I could feel myself having extra energy while I was shopping at SAMs club without the shakiness like u get with energy drinks, I was also going through a divorce at the time I bought it and I lost weight to say the least!!!! I will buy it again</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great. I lost 50 pounds so far in just 3 months. Only exercise I did was a bike ride maybe once a week, and I ate less high saturated fat foods.  I have more energy all day and even my boom boom in the sack is mucho improved.  Love this JUiCE!</li>
            <li> MOTIVATION!  Instead of reaching for other things in my pantry and fridge I found myself re-filling my glass with this great tasting drink. Water is essential to our bodies, and we don&#x27;t get enough of it.  I have been on this for 2 weeks, drinking 3-4 glasses per day along with the carb blocker.  So far have lost some belly fat and about 7 pounds.  Pants fit better, and last years shorts zipped right up!  It won&#x27;t work if you are still eating the same amount of snacks and regular portions of food. I play a mind game with it.....drink instead of eating..........until meal time.  Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels. This a great SKINNY drink!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works for my daughter &amp; me.  We are both using the Atkins diet, so we use this product 20 minutes before our fattiest meal.  Gives very good energy as well.  Company sent a 50% off coupon on my next order, &amp; we will definitely be using that.  :)</li>
            <li> We bought Metablend on Tea and Reasberry.  We had 12 bottles. We followed the direction as they were on the box.  We watched our Diet and did not eat anything after 7:00 PM  It has been hard on us.  My Husband is 81 and I am 76.  We both exercise 5 days a week.  I got sick after drinking it but in 20 Min I eat something and was better.  I am looking to get our money back because we both have not lost a lb.  The lady in the Sams said we could if we were not happy with the results.  You can reach us at almcd@fuse.net or phone 513-941-4407.  Sorry we did not like it.</li>
            <li> I love the taste! I do not use this for weightloss, but more for energy so can&#x27;t give RK a weightloss review. I do believe that as for energy, it doesn&#x27;t work like coffee or energy drinks where you feel your heart race and get the gitters. I do believe I have more energy and if I drink a couple bottles throughout the day, I don&#x27;t get the mid day sleepiness I normally felt. I also never feel the crash you get when using the energy drinks. It is a bit pricey, but I will continue to use RK for my energy booster!</li>
