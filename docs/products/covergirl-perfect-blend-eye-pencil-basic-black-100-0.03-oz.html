            <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>the best eyeliner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Great eye liner for lower lash line.</li>
            <li>That is one of moy favorite things about this eyeliner pencil, very handy, and you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good eyeliner for the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>and everyone ask what kind of eyeliner do i use.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product, I am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay--</li>
            <li>Why change it? :)</li>
            <li>Stays on most of the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this type of eyeliner for many years now.</li>
            <li>And it lasts 3 months or more.</li>
            <li>But fairly ok for price.....</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>0.03 ounce is surprisingly more than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Way better than those overpriced grease pens they peddle at the seasonal shops.</li>
            <li>I love the smudger applicator tip,  </li>
            <li>It just glides on smooth!</li>
            <li>You end up wasting most of the pencil trying to sharpen it.</li>
            <li>It works well &amp; sharpens easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>It glides on smooth with no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>but this one goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>But overall, pretty  good for the price!</li>
            <li>Love these I ordered with other items so the price was good.</li>
            <li>stays good for 3 hours or so ,later its starts coming out..</li>
            <li>I gave this pencil 5 stars because it is fantastic, I have paid far more for some that say they don&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li>You get a nice sharp edge and then --it breaks!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, can&#x27;t recommend it, but the glide on type is better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only brand that doesn&#x27;t smear and it looks nice all through the night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice pencil, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is the only kind of eyeliner i will buy.</li>
            <li>I like the larger size of the pencil point, and finds it blends in nicely with any eye shadow I use.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite liner.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many others, and keep coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li>glides on effortlessly.this has been a favorite eyeliner since i was a teen.</li>
            <li>My eyes tend to be super sensitive when it comes to eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend it.</li>
            <li>and she says it smudges too much</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and is also easy to wipe off.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and smooth and you don&#x27;t have to go over the same area a million times turning gray to black.</li>
            <li>i remember what it was like before i found this particular pencil.</li>
            <li>My very first eyeliner as a teenager was CoverGirl, and 14 years later I still reach for it.</li>
            <li>Good eyeliner, but only comes with one (not the two that past reviewers have said)</li>
            <li>Way to dark for my eyebrows and kind of Gloopy and takes a long time to get out</li>
            <li>because this really is a very soft  creamy eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Not long wearing but really pigmented</li>
            <li>Have been using for years; as I&#x27;ve matured and have a little more money to burn I&#x27;ve dabbled in the some of the pricier pencils but always come back to this.</li>
            <li>It is exactly how I expected.</li>
            <li>Those who are pros at applying lines will like the ease of going from thin to wider lines, and those who lack the precision will love the smudger.</li>
            <li>Although I find the sleept-in makeup hot, my girlfriend only uses it on her upper eyelid and smudges it a little.</li>

            <li> and then they are all over, this one holds up pretty good, you may get some smudge from the waterline after quite a few hours of wear , which is not that bad, but I switched to gel eyeliner for the waterline, and I use this pencil for the upper inner corners, and my bottom base of my lashes</li>

            <li> BEST EYE LINER EVER. I&#x27;ve been using this since middle school, I&#x27;m 21 now.</li>
            <li> Works just like the ones you buy at the drugstore I always get.&lt;br /&gt;THIS CAME WITH TWO&lt;br /&gt;I was super shocked, I thought only ONE pencil was going to come in the mail, but two actually came!!!!&lt;br /&gt;what a steal!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it. It is exactly how I expected.</li>
            <li> Been buying this pencil for at least 20 years!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. It&#x27;s the only brand that doesn&#x27;t smear and it looks nice all through the night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice pencil, especially for the price.  It works well &amp; sharpens easily.</li>
            <li> Sorry, CoverGirl. This pencil is too messy, it bleeds and smudges on it&#x27;s own. Does not stay put on the waterline and it STINGS my eyes!  Maybelline has a pencil that does not irritate my eyes and I will be using theirs from now on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay--but then there&#x27;s the sharpening problem, and it is a problem.  You get a nice sharp edge and then --it breaks!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, can&#x27;t recommend it, but the glide on type is better.</li>
            <li> This is the only kind of eyeliner i will buy. I have been buying it for years and everyone ask what kind of eyeliner do i use. You only have to apply it once and it last all day. I would really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have been using for years; as I&#x27;ve matured and have a little more money to burn I&#x27;ve dabbled in the some of the pricier pencils but always come back to this. Those who are pros at applying lines will like the ease of going from thin to wider lines, and those who lack the precision will love the smudger. When I am in a rush I just swipe a imprecise line and smudge to shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. It lasts a long time and is also easy to wipe off. The &amp;#34;Blending tool&amp;#34; on the back only works the first few times, then it gets too dirty to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smudge all the day and it&#x27;s not water resistant as they write.</li>
            <li> My very first eyeliner as a teenager was CoverGirl, and 14 years later I still reach for it. My eyes tend to be super sensitive when it comes to eyeliner. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with the CoverGirl Perfect Blend Pencil. It glides on smooth with no irritation whatsoever. What can I say, when you find something that works... Why change it? :)</li>
            <li> Great eye liner for lower lash line. It came with 2! The blender brush is really really hard tho so be careful.</li>
            <li> Stays on most of the day. I&#x27;ve used this type of eyeliner for many years now. And it lasts 3 months or more.</li>
            <li> stays good for 3 hours or so ,later its starts coming out..But fairly ok for price..... I ordered black one</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  I have tried so many others, and keep coming back to this one.  My teenage daughter loves it to!</li>
            <li> glides on effortlessly.this has been a favorite eyeliner since i was a teen. i hope they never stop  making it. i remember what it was like before i found this particular pencil. i used to have to heat the other brands of eyeliners up with a lighter just to get them to work. but this one goes on smooth. just remember to use  some translucent powder under your eyes to help keep it from smudging during the day. because this really is a very soft  creamy eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product, I am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Way to dark for my eyebrows and kind of Gloopy and takes a long time to get out</li>
            <li> 0.03 ounce is surprisingly more than I thought it would be.  Used for Halloween make up.  Way better than those overpriced grease pens they peddle at the seasonal shops.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she says it smudges too much and she ends up looking like a panda. Although I find the sleept-in makeup hot, my girlfriend only uses it on her upper eyelid and smudges it a little. She says it doesn&#x27;t wear properly too long.</li>
            <li> Good eyeliner, but only comes with one (not the two that past reviewers have said)</li>
            <li> Love these I ordered with other items so the price was good.</li>
            <li> I gave this pencil 5 stars because it is fantastic, I have paid far more for some that say they don&#x27;t smudge and then they are all over, this one holds up pretty good, you may get some smudge from the waterline after quite a few hours of wear , which is not that bad, but I switched to gel eyeliner for the waterline, and I use this pencil for the upper inner corners, and my bottom base of my lashes and it doesnt&#x27; run all over the place there. I love the smudger applicator tip,  That is one of moy favorite things about this eyeliner pencil, very handy, and you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> Not long wearing but really pigmented</li>
            <li> Covergirl makes the perfect eye liner.  Been buying this same one for years!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I like the larger size of the pencil point, and finds it blends in nicely with any eye shadow I use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom as a holiday gift. She loves this brand and has been using it for years. If you wear black eyeliner then you would like this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good eyeliner for the price. Lasts about 6 hours before I have to re-apply. Occasionally smudges on the sides of my eye. But overall, pretty  good for the price!</li>
            <li> the best eyeliner I have ever used. It just glides on smooth!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite liner. It goes on easy and smooth and you don&#x27;t have to go over the same area a million times turning gray to black. I remember the days of having to use a lighter on pencils to make the color work properly, not with this liner. The only negative Is once in a while you will get one that has been poorly shipped so the pencil inside gets broken up and it becomes a pain to sharpen. You end up wasting most of the pencil trying to sharpen it.</li>
