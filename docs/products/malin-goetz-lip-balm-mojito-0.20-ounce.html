            <li>I&#x27;ve never written a review for ANYTHING that I&#x27;ve ever purchased on Amazon (and it&#x27;s been quite a bit), but this lip balm is beyond amazing</li>
            <li>My lips have never felt this good:)</li>
            <li>Which is good, if I&#x27;m paying $12+ for a lip balm, it better stay around and not disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>Love love love!</li>

            <li>I have gotten so many people hooked on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product when it came in my monthly iPsy bag.</li>

            <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>and I think  you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li>Would purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li>Amazon was awesome and returned my money the very next day</li>
            <li>I rubbed some of the excess on my nails and they are in better shape,</li>
            <li>I received this in my IPSY bag this month and I am absolutely in love.</li>
            <li>I love rubbing my lips together after I apply it on.</li>
            <li>I even love this stuff more than my EOS balls.</li>
            <li>It made my lips feel better almost immediately as it coated them.  </li>
            <li>Glad I got the chance to try it.</li>
            <li>I have read many great reviews and expected it to be great.</li>
            <li>I have tried many types of lip balms</li>
            <li>I needed to spread the love.</li>
            <li>smell and taste is also very unique.</li>
            <li>and I can say my lips are in the best condition they have been in a long time.</li>
            <li>Lol but in all seriousness this is my new go-to lip balm.</li>
            <li>Simply the best and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The texture is amazing and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought as soon as I got home.</li>
            <li>It smells good, and there&#x27;s no icky taste.</li>
            <li>This is hands down THE best lip balm I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Iristree.com has it for $ 12.00 no tax and free shipping.</li>
            <li>so I enjoy that.</li>
            <li>Gotta say they are so smooth now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended it; you will love to kiss!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very very shiny so for men, who are not metro sexual, this might not be the thing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is golden!</li>
            <li>I honestly wish they would sell this in stores, as I&#x27;ve only been able to find it on here.</li>
            <li>My lips are soft and look amazing.</li>
            <li>I have since purchased a tube because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Received sample (full size) from Ipsy.</li>
            <li>I love the cinnamint for the scent and super glossiness, this one is really glossy at all.</li>
            <li>Most importantly it makes my lips uber soft even though I pick and bite at them!</li>
            <li>etc...basically every drugstore brand/type/formula, to pricier lip balms, to home remedies, even pure lanolin made for breastfeeding nipples!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It heals chapped lips quickly.</li>
            <li>I tried this balm originally through Ipsy, and My lips instantly fell in love!</li>
            <li>And wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks more like the other kind of lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li>I received this lip balm in my Ipsy Glam Bag, and I&#x27;ve never had such an amazing lip balm in my life.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>but well worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Noe I have soft, healthy looking lips.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this again because I feel its well worth the price</li>
            <li>You can use other brands 10 times and not get the excellent results in only one application of  Malin + Goetz Mojito Lip Balm!  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It is not sticky, it has the right amount of gloss look.</li>
            <li>Your lips will feel so smooth, soft, silky!!</li>
            <li>I have a nervous habit of picking at my lips until they are bleeding, and with normal chapstick it takes a good week to get my lips back into pretty state, however this stuff is like an overnight cure.  </li>
            <li>I generally trust the quality on most things from this company.</li>
            <li>Nice flavor-doesn&#x27;t leave any strange taste in your mouth-and keeps your lips moist like it should.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sticky I can live with given the fabulous results of the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Number</li>
            <li>I put it on at night with my other face creams, and my lips have never felt better!</li>
            <li>I even put this on top of my lipstick daily to keep my lips moisturized.  </li>
            <li>If anyone knows of a store that carries this, I would be so grateful, as I will more than likely NEVER use another lip balm again.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The balm has a smooth, clear gel-like consistency to it.  </li>
            <li>Expensive but works great!</li>
            <li>At first I was thinking to myself....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I would apply it multiple times throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, although expensive, lip balm</li>
            <li>(I mean that in a good way) and not at all like a cool gel.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite lip balm on the planet!</li>
            <li>She is an avid chap-stick user (I wanted to post a picture of her drawer next to the bed filled with chap-stick</li>
            <li>It stays on really well and makes lips super soft.  </li>
            <li>Healed chapped lips after one use, while the applicator needs a little improvement, the product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>but although a little more expensive, this one is the best I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Chemically the ingredients list is a who&#x27;s who of modern alchemy with every -ene</li>
            <li>Can wear real lipstick every day without worrying about my lips peeling off in sheets.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute must have in my world.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does make your lips feel very moist.  </li>
            <li>Wears off fast and doesn&#x27;t help for chapped lips ..</li>
            <li>Instantly your lips are smooth and conditioned.</li>
            <li>nothing much works.</li>
            <li>It is very expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>any rate, this has really helped with healing my lips.  </li>
            <li>I find it very sticky.  </li>
            <li>I received my first tube this past January/February and by June I ordered two more.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m just not noticing, or else it&#x27;s mild.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this balm, give it a try or two</li>
            <li>Because of the high cost, I&#x27;ll just consider it more of a minor OTC medical expense than a beauty item.</li>
            <li>But this goes on very smooth, really hydrates, only has a slight scent to it, none really at all.</li>
            <li>I am always surprised that this lip balm is not more popular.</li>
            <li>Really love this and hope in the near future they offer multiple quantities at a discounted price.</li>
            <li>I normally use bath and body works cinnamint lipgloss as my go to for everyday gloss, I still love it it</li>
            <li>It normally takes a week for my lips to fully heal.</li>
            <li>I used it several times yesterday, including right before bed.  </li>
            <li>Every winter I get super dry lips</li>
            <li>After first use I could see a BIG difference in my lips!!!!!</li>
            <li>love the product, but the packaging was excessive and unnecessay.</li>
            <li>The only one that actually moisturizes my super chapped lips overnight.</li>
            <li>Love the product, it is amazing in the cold dry winter months.</li>
            <li>It is great to soothe chapped lips and even shield them from some of the cold weather.</li>
            <li>COMES THIS CLEAR GEL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps plump your lips and keeps them amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>No messy reapplication.</li>
            <li>BALM FIXED</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see the price</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t very optimistic about initially but tried it.</li>
            <li>This is nice looking but for the price not nice enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very slick and greasy and (like others have said like a different kind of lube) but it WORKS.</li>
            <li>Whenever I have really dry cracked lips, I go straight to my Malin + Goetz.</li>
            <li>I use this product at night before bed and wake up with soft, moisturized lips that last through my morning coffee.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too thick and applys smoothly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to any one with a dry lip problem!</li>
            <li>have tried various lip balms, creams, cocoa butter and various natural remedies and</li>
            <li>Definitely buying this again in the near future.</li>
            <li>I used it a few times through the day the first day.</li>
            <li>Unlike other products that softened my lips for a while but had to be reapplied constantly, this lasts hours and hours and after a few days my lips were healed to the point that I don&#x27;t even need to carry this with me, I apply some in the morning and some before bed and my lips are super soft allll day.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I generally trust the quality on most things from this company.</li>
            <li> Nice flavor-doesn&#x27;t leave any strange taste in your mouth-and keeps your lips moist like it should.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sticky I can live with given the fabulous results of the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Number</li>
            <li> I put it on at night with my other face creams, and my lips have never felt better!</li>
            <li> I even put this on top of my lipstick daily to keep my lips moisturized.  </li>
            <li> If anyone knows of a store that carries this, I would be so grateful, as I will more than likely NEVER use another lip balm again.</li>
            <li> It makes my lips feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The balm has a smooth, clear gel-like consistency to it.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but works great!</li>
            <li> At first I was thinking to myself....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I would apply it multiple times throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Excellent, although expensive, lip balm</li>
            <li> (I mean that in a good way) and not at all like a cool gel.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite lip balm on the planet!</li>
            <li> She is an avid chap-stick user (I wanted to post a picture of her drawer next to the bed filled with chap-stick</li>
            <li> It stays on really well and makes lips super soft.  </li>
            <li> Healed chapped lips after one use, while the applicator needs a little improvement, the product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> but although a little more expensive, this one is the best I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Chemically the ingredients list is a who&#x27;s who of modern alchemy with every -ene</li>
            <li> Can wear real lipstick every day without worrying about my lips peeling off in sheets.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must have in my world.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does make your lips feel very moist.  </li>
            <li> Wears off fast and doesn&#x27;t help for chapped lips ..</li>
            <li> Instantly your lips are smooth and conditioned.</li>
            <li> nothing much works.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> any rate, this has really helped with healing my lips.  </li>
            <li> I find it very sticky.  </li>
            <li> I received my first tube this past January/February and by June I ordered two more.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m just not noticing, or else it&#x27;s mild.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this balm, give it a try or two</li>
            <li> Because of the high cost, I&#x27;ll just consider it more of a minor OTC medical expense than a beauty item.</li>
            <li> But this goes on very smooth, really hydrates, only has a slight scent to it, none really at all.</li>
            <li> I am always surprised that this lip balm is not more popular.</li>
            <li> Really love this and hope in the near future they offer multiple quantities at a discounted price.</li>
            <li> I normally use bath and body works cinnamint lipgloss as my go to for everyday gloss, I still love it it</li>
            <li> It normally takes a week for my lips to fully heal.</li>
            <li> I used it several times yesterday, including right before bed.  </li>
            <li> Every winter I get super dry lips</li>
            <li> After first use I could see a BIG difference in my lips!!!!!</li>
            <li> love the product, but the packaging was excessive and unnecessay.</li>
            <li> The only one that actually moisturizes my super chapped lips overnight.</li>
            <li> Love the product, it is amazing in the cold dry winter months.</li>
            <li> It is great to soothe chapped lips and even shield them from some of the cold weather.</li>
            <li> COMES THIS CLEAR GEL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps plump your lips and keeps them amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> No messy reapplication.</li>
            <li> BALM FIXED</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the price</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t very optimistic about initially but tried it.</li>
            <li> This is nice looking but for the price not nice enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very slick and greasy and (like others have said like a different kind of lube) but it WORKS.</li>
            <li> Whenever I have really dry cracked lips, I go straight to my Malin + Goetz.</li>
            <li> I use this product at night before bed and wake up with soft, moisturized lips that last through my morning coffee.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too thick and applys smoothly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to any one with a dry lip problem!</li>
            <li> have tried various lip balms, creams, cocoa butter and various natural remedies and</li>
            <li> Definitely buying this again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times through the day the first day.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products that softened my lips for a while but had to be reapplied constantly, this lasts hours and hours and after a few days my lips were healed to the point that I don&#x27;t even need to carry this with me, I apply some in the morning and some before bed and my lips are super soft allll day.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that I feel actually healed my dry lips to where after a couple days I didn&#x27;t even have to put this on regularly.  </li>
            <li> I was a little surprised (although I believe I have identified the culprit, an SPF-containing lip balm I&#x27;d recently started using).  </li>
            <li> But softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for everyone, especially people with dry lips.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even explain how dry my lips were; ALWAYS peeling, cracking, bleeding, gross!  </li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about the packaging and the clear gel</li>
            <li> Brilliant lick balm but terrible packaging.  </li>
            <li> This is long-lasting as long as you&#x27;re not eating, drinking or smooching your sweetheart.  </li>
            <li> Slowly in days you start seeing real healing process.</li>
            <li> If you have chronic dry lips or nose..</li>
            <li> But so is my mac lip gloss that makes my lips sticky and dry, and causes me to pick them.</li>
            <li> Has shine and that&#x27;s it and that don&#x27;t stay long !!</li>
            <li> so the little tube will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> my lips and the skin around my mouth were so dry!</li>
            <li> I literally spent hours online researching what could be causing my horribly dry lips and what I could do to fix them.  </li>
            <li> then this tune should last you a few months.</li>
            <li> apply a tiny drop before bed each night and maybe after wind/sun exposure or wearing harsh lipcolor, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of paper</li>
            <li> So much so I end up picking at them which makes it worse.</li>
            <li> (A little goes a long way)</li>
            <li> and as others have posted a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but if applied less than liberally (Honestly a little goes a long way)</li>
            <li> Honestly, it is a little on the sticky side, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is a tiny bit on the sticky side, but I don&#x27;t look at that negatively.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not noticing the scent/flavor but my allergies have been acting up lately.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough that it lasts for a while</li>
            <li> You can blot and knock down the shine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a product queen nor am I one to jump up and down raving about a product.</li>
            <li> This lip balm took that down to 3 days.</li>
            <li> but so much less sticky.</li>
            <li> but with that half the moisturizing effects goes away too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t sticky or messy.</li>
            <li> Started using it in the dead of Winter and went after a week from my lips being like molting snakeskin to being lipstick-model plump and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it all throughout the harsh winter this year and didn&#x27;t have any problems with my lips being chapped.</li>
            <li> am a lady of a &#x27;certain age&#x27; and have extremely dry, cracked lips that are worse because of cold sores.</li>
            <li> No doubt this is a very thick lip balm, but I have very dry lips</li>
            <li> I got a small sample of this product in an accessory kit for a flight to Australia.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because of the consistency that I strictly use it overnight; I usually stick to my EOS for daily/daytime use.</li>
            <li> She states its one of the few she has ever tried that stay on all night, and she loves the subtle flavor.  </li>
            <li> It is thick.</li>
            <li> This small tube goes for 10+ dollars!</li>
            <li> and I mean teeeeeeniest bit is all you need</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Very thick formula too, the teeniest</li>
            <li> chap was healed within one day of use and I&#x27;ve searched a near half century to find a lip product that wasn&#x27;t useless, didn&#x27;t have an off odor or disgusting artificial flavor.  </li>
            <li> Would purchase again, but for the expensive price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re product is expensive for the amount you get,</li>
            <li> I think my lip balm was used as the cover wasn&#x27;t even screwed on and the tube was dirty</li>
            <li> But my lips hurt and they looked bad.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad chap lips.</li>
            <li> I had ugly looking lips this winter and none of my lip balms was working.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s crazy talk!</li>
            <li> Thoroughly disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> a tube of crap.</li>
            <li> Disgusting!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> But then, yesterday, I noticed that my lips were in awful shape -- peeling and cracking.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recently had to have work done and my lips and the skin around my mouth were so dry! this has been my life saver!</li>
            <li> Brilliant lick balm but terrible packaging.  There&#x27;s no applicator tip, so you have to use your finger. Which means your finger becomes a greasy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heals chapped lips quickly. If they improved the packaging it would earn 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this. It stays on really well and makes lips super soft.  Smells like mojito, but has no taste. I am totally getting this again.</li>
            <li> love this stuff-my favorite lip stuff. Carry in my purse and have by my bedside.</li>
            <li> This product makes my lips feel great! I absolutely love it! HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> This balm is amazing! Not at all sticky &amp; lasts! Smells delicious too. Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I got this in my ipsy glam bag and I am in love. This is the best lip balm ever. I have since purchased a tube because I love it so much. It is not sticky, it has the right amount of gloss look. It feels so hydrating on my lips. During the winter months this is a must! Iristree.com has it for $ 12.00 no tax and free shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have EVER used! The texture is amazing and worth the money. My lips have never felt this good:)</li>
            <li> I got this in my Ipsy bag a couple months ago. It&#x27;s the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used! I put it on at night with my other face creams, and my lips have never felt better! Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am always surprised that this lip balm is not more popular. I have gotten so many people hooked on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of this is unreal. Thicker than the Rosebud Salve, maybe like Vaseline but so much less sticky. I have never found anything else like it. No doubt this is a very thick lip balm, but I have very dry lips so I enjoy that. The finish is a bit shiny, but I think it looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell and taste is also very unique. Definitely mojito. But softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for everyone, especially people with dry lips.</li>
            <li> Malin + Goetz NAILED IT with this lip balm. I was a little apprehensive about the packaging and the clear gel but once it was on my lips I was sold! This is hands down my favorite lip balm on the planet! Love love love!</li>
            <li> Honestly AMAZING! It&#x27;s thick enough that it lasts for a while but it isn&#x27;t sticky or messy. So soothing and it gives your lips a good shine as well. DO NOT buy off here though because it is being sold at $20+ for the .35oz while on the malin+goetz website has the same size for $12</li>
            <li> Best lip balm I have ever used!  I have a nervous habit of picking at my lips until they are bleeding, and with normal chapstick it takes a good week to get my lips back into pretty state, however this stuff is like an overnight cure.  I even put this on top of my lipstick daily to keep my lips moisturized.  I honestly wish they would sell this in stores, as I&#x27;ve only been able to find it on here. If anyone knows of a store that carries this, I would be so grateful, as I will more than likely NEVER use another lip balm again.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product when it came in my monthly iPsy bag. This stuff is golden! It helps plump your lips and keeps them amazingly soft. I just ordered my second tube.</li>
            <li> I tried this balm originally through Ipsy, and My lips instantly fell in love! Not greasy or oily, and no disgusting flavor. A bit pricey, but if applied less than liberally (Honestly a little goes a long way) then this tune should last you a few months.</li>
            <li> Received sample (full size) from Ipsy. Would purchase again, but for the expensive price. This small tube goes for 10+ dollars! Way too steep for just my lips.</li>
            <li> This is the lip balm I&#x27;ve been wanting my entire life! Healed chapped lips after one use, while the applicator needs a little improvement, the product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> Indeed as one reviewer said the surprise is HERE COMES THIS CLEAR GEL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks more like the other kind of lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on rather greasy (I mean that in a good way) and not at all like a cool gel.  A trick for the eyes every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My chap was healed within one day of use and I&#x27;ve searched a near half century to find a lip product that wasn&#x27;t useless, didn&#x27;t have an off odor or disgusting artificial flavor.  This is costly but this is IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very very shiny so for men, who are not metro sexual, this might not be the thing.  You can blot and knock down the shine but with that half the moisturizing effects goes away too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Mojito version.  There&#x27;s the tiiiiniest whiff of lime as you puff out a drop but that&#x27;s all there is to scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chemically the ingredients list is a who&#x27;s who of modern alchemy with every -ene in it they could find.  I just have to hope none are killers.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm. It makes my lips feel so soft and smooth. It stays in for many hours!!</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t use this product every day because it does leave my lips feeling a bit sticky, I do use it often during the winter.  It is great to soothe chapped lips and even shield them from some of the cold weather.</li>
            <li> Seriously. Best ever.&lt;br /&gt;I apply a tiny drop before bed each night and maybe after wind/sun exposure or wearing harsh lipcolor, and that&#x27;s it. No messy reapplication. Can wear real lipstick every day without worrying about my lips peeling off in sheets. Started using it in the dead of Winter and went after a week from my lips being like molting snakeskin to being lipstick-model plump and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, mojito. Hello.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stock up before whatever apocalypse is coming. Don&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t told.</li>
            <li> The only one that actually moisturizes my super chapped lips overnight. It&#x27;s very slick and greasy and (like others have said like a different kind of lube) but it WORKS.</li>
            <li> Amazing lip balm-looks like lipgloss but stays on and protects a lot better! I bought it for skiing-apply once before hitting the slopes and it stays on until lunch. Great lip protector from the elements-I need to get another one so I can carry it with me everywhere and leave one in the backpack for sports!</li>
            <li> This is hands down THE best lip balm I have ever used.  If I have any problems with my lips, dry/flaky/chapped, I will apply this at night and by morning the issue is longer an issue.  I received my first tube this past January/February and by June I ordered two more.  This is an absolute must have in my world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balm has a smooth, clear gel-like consistency to it.  It is a tiny bit on the sticky side, but I don&#x27;t look at that negatively.  When I apply it at night, there is still some left on my lips in the morning, the product stays put.  Which is good, if I&#x27;m paying $12+ for a lip balm, it better stay around and not disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this balm, give it a try or two and I think  you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is absolutely amazing.  You can use other brands 10 times and not get the excellent results in only one application of  Malin + Goetz Mojito Lip Balm!  Love it and will buy it forever!</li>
            <li> Love it!! That is all I can say about this product!! This product actually works! My lips are soft and look amazing. I put it on my nephews chapped lips, he didn&#x27;t like it (he is 4 - he doesn&#x27;t like anything) and told him to let it &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; for a minute then wipe it off. Even doing that helped his lips out. I will buy this product again and again!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend.  She is an avid chap-stick user (I wanted to post a picture of her drawer next to the bed filled with chap-stick but I will refrain.  Either way, she doesnt use any of them anymore and uses this every night.  She states its one of the few she has ever tried that stay on all night, and she loves the subtle flavor.  Would purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a very good lip balm.  It does make your lips feel very moist.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got a small sample of this product in an accessory kit for a flight to Australia. I loved it so much I bought as soon as I got home. Expensive but works great!</li>
            <li> Really love this and hope in the near future they offer multiple quantities at a discounted price. Best lip conditioner ever!!</li>
            <li> Simply the best and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Disgusting!! I think my lip balm was used as the cover wasn&#x27;t even screwed on and the tube was dirty but yet the packaging it came in was not. Amazon was awesome and returned my money the very next day</li>
            <li> Wears off fast and doesn&#x27;t help for chapped lips .. Has shine and that&#x27;s it and that don&#x27;t stay long !!&lt;br /&gt;Save your money!!</li>
            <li> I got this in a Glossybox and I love it! I normally use bath and body works cinnamint lipgloss as my go to for everyday gloss, I still love it it and it&#x27;s cheaper than this. But this goes on very smooth, really hydrates, only has a slight scent to it, none really at all. I love the cinnamint for the scent and super glossiness, this one is really glossy at all. It&#x27;s almost like a cross between a chapstick and vaseline the way it hydrates so well. I&#x27;d totally buy this gloss!</li>
            <li> After first use I could see a BIG difference in my lips!!!!! It is worth every penny!!!!! I highly recommend it to any one with a dry lip problem!</li>
            <li> This is nice looking but for the price not nice enough. Doesn&#x27;t moisturize my lips like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens and dozens, but this is the king of them all! Your lips will thank you. Smooch</li>
            <li> Nothing tops this lip balm. Has an amazing lime mojito smell and works wonders on chapped lips. Instantly your lips are smooth and conditioned. Best I&#x27;ve ever used and nothing ever worked for me before. This is the Queen of chapstick.</li>
            <li> love the product, but the packaging was excessive and unnecessay. Such a waste of paper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a product queen nor am I one to jump up and down raving about a product. However, I had to review this one. I got a sample in last month&#x27;s Ipsy Glam Bag.&lt;br /&gt;I am a lady of a &#x27;certain age&#x27; and have extremely dry, cracked lips that are worse because of cold sores. When I get the sores, my lips actually bleed.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried various lip balms, creams, cocoa butter and various natural remedies and nothing much works. Those items make my lips a tad softer/glossier but they did not solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;THIS BALM FIXED MY CRACKED LIPS IN JUST ONE DAY!&lt;br /&gt;And I rubbed some of the excess on my nails and they are in better shape, also!&lt;br /&gt;I have found only two drawbacks to the balm: 1. It is a bit sticky and 2. It is very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Sticky I can live with given the fabulous results of the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Number two is not an obstacle for me because the balm works so well and nothing else does. Because of the high cost, I&#x27;ll just consider it more of a minor OTC medical expense than a beauty item.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even explain how dry my lips were; ALWAYS peeling, cracking, bleeding, gross!  I had tried EVERYTHING I could get my hands on: regular chapstick, EOS, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Softlips, Carmex, Yes to Carrots, etc...basically every drugstore brand/type/formula, to pricier lip balms, to home remedies, even pure lanolin made for breastfeeding nipples!!  I literally spent hours online researching what could be causing my horribly dry lips and what I could do to fix them.  Then I found THIS!  This is A-MAZING!!!  The ONLY thing that I feel actually healed my dry lips to where after a couple days I didn&#x27;t even have to put this on regularly.  Unlike other products that softened my lips for a while but had to be reapplied constantly, this lasts hours and hours and after a few days my lips were healed to the point that I don&#x27;t even need to carry this with me, I apply some in the morning and some before bed and my lips are super soft allll day.  Very thick formula too, the teeniest and I mean teeeeeeniest bit is all you need so the little tube will last a long time.  Best part is since my lips are&#x27;t cracked and peeling anymore I can finally wear lipstick again!!!  Buy this lip balm...it works!!!</li>
            <li> I received this in my IPSY bag this month and I am absolutely in love. I used it a few times through the day the first day. Then after that just once in the evening. My lips feel and look amazing. I was surprised to see the price but honestly I would pay this. It&#x27;s bigger than my sample size and I will be getting another tube once I&#x27;m running low.</li>
            <li> I generally trust the quality on most things from this company. They&#x27;re product is expensive for the amount you get, but well worth it in my opinion. Nice flavor-doesn&#x27;t leave any strange taste in your mouth-and keeps your lips moist like it should. I used it all throughout the harsh winter this year and didn&#x27;t have any problems with my lips being chapped. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it the extra star is that it is pricey.</li>
            <li> I had ugly looking lips this winter and none of my lip balms was working. Tried all different brands, home made stuff, nothing was working.&lt;br /&gt;I got this with ipsy.  wasn&#x27;t very optimistic about initially but tried it. You can see the difference in 1 day. immediately you see shiny,  yummy lips. Slowly in days you start seeing real healing process. Noe I have soft, healthy looking lips. I think I am going to be a fan of this product.  Highly recommended it; you will love to kiss!</li>
            <li> Every winter I get super dry lips and sometimes they crack and bleed and it&#x27;s awful. This stuff is amazing! It feels so good I love rubbing my lips together after I apply it on. (A little goes a long way) I even love this stuff more than my EOS balls. What? I know. That&#x27;s crazy talk! Lol but in all seriousness this is my new go-to lip balm. I ordered another one just for my purse!</li>
            <li> Awesome sauce!!! Your lips will feel so smooth, soft, silky!! Got it on my Ipsy glam bag!</li>
            <li> Very good lip balm, I put it on at night and its still on in the morning. Most importantly it makes my lips uber soft even though I pick and bite at them! Definitely buying this again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I got this in my Ipsy bag in January. At first I was thinking to myself....great...a tube of crap. Good job ipsy. Then I tried it out one night when I lost my lipbalm. It was immediately hydrating and I was impressed. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a month now and I can say my lips are in the best condition they have been in a long time. They are no longer flaky, and wearing  lipstick is no longer a nightmare, the flaking skin is gone. I will be buying this again because I feel its well worth the price and as others have posted a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I got this in July&#x27;s Glossybox and set it aside.  I have a LOT of lip balms from subscription boxes.  But then, yesterday, I noticed that my lips were in awful shape -- peeling and cracking.  I was a little surprised (although I believe I have identified the culprit, an SPF-containing lip balm I&#x27;d recently started using).  But my lips hurt and they looked bad.  I saw this when I was rummaging through my supplies and thought I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, this is just what I needed.  It made my lips feel better almost immediately as it coated them.  I used it several times yesterday, including right before bed.  When I woke up in the morning, I could still feel it on my lips.  So, it lasts a long-time.  It also provides a lot of shine, if you&#x27;d like shine without adding color (or put it over a lip stain for moisturizing effects).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not noticing the scent/flavor but my allergies have been acting up lately.  So it&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m just not noticing, or else it&#x27;s mild.  Either way, it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients since I don&#x27;t see them on the product page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Tricaprylin, Benzyl Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance (Parfum), Limonene, Citral, Bisabolol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, this has really helped with healing my lips.  Glad I got the chance to try it.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly disappointed in this product.  I have read many great reviews and expected it to be great. I find it very sticky.  And wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> I have Lupus and get sore lips as part of this syndrome.. I have tried many types of lip balms but although a little more expensive, this one is the best I&#x27;ve tried.  If you have chronic dry lips or nose.. Try this.. It works!!  M. Stoker / Basin City WA</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for ANYTHING that I&#x27;ve ever purchased on Amazon (and it&#x27;s been quite a bit), but this lip balm is beyond amazing I needed to spread the love. The lip balm honestly works miracle overnight!! Whenever I have really dry cracked lips, I go straight to my Malin + Goetz. Honestly, it is a little on the sticky side, but a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s because of the consistency that I strictly use it overnight; I usually stick to my EOS for daily/daytime use.</li>
            <li> I got this product through my monthly &amp;#34;ipsy&amp;#34; subscription (great service ladies!).  My daughter got it as well and we both raved about it.  I&#x27;m a chapstick/Burt&#x27;s Bees addict.  Literally.  I have tubes stashed everywhere.  I use this product at night before bed and wake up with soft, moisturized lips that last through my morning coffee.  I would like to use this product exclusively, but I just can&#x27;t justify the cost.  I&#x27;m sure I would apply it multiple times throughout the day.  Chapstick is just cheaper.  This is long-lasting as long as you&#x27;re not eating, drinking or smooching your sweetheart.  I will continue to use it at night, but whenever money isn&#x27;t an issue, I&#x27;ll be sneaking a tube into the next order.</li>
            <li> I have really bad chap lips. So much so I end up picking at them which makes it worse. This balm is the best ever. It is thick. So it evens out my lips and I dont feel the seperated skin. Gotta say they are so smooth now. It normally takes a week for my lips to fully heal. This lip balm took that down to 3 days. At 12.00 its pricy. But so is my mac lip gloss that makes my lips sticky and dry, and causes me to pick them. Check out ipsy thats how I discovered this balm. Xo</li>
            <li> Love the product, it is amazing in the cold dry winter months. Only gave it 3 stars instead of 5 because this balm is only $12 through the company&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> I received this lip balm in my Ipsy Glam Bag, and I&#x27;ve never had such an amazing lip balm in my life. It smells good, and there&#x27;s no icky taste. It isn&#x27;t too thick and applys smoothly. Definitely going to buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Excellent, although expensive, lip balm</li>
