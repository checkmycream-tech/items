            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Buying it from Amazon is cheaper than most salons,</li>
            <li>I would love to hear about it.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>will order again :)</li>
            <li>I love Tigi&#x27;s Curl Amplifier, so I got this to try when I go for a straightened style.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT FOR MY CULY HAIR</li>
            <li>I love this for my hair</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this product</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned this is the best product for creating smooth hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>It was my favorite hair styling serum.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>On top of all of this, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I love how this product makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>shipping was more than the product.</li>
            <li>I have coarse, curly hair, this stuff is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Smells phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and my hair behaves much better.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully, but my hair smelled like that guy at the gym who rolls around in a vat of cologne instead of taking a shower all day long</li>
            <li>It smells good and really helps control the frizzies.</li>
            <li>Amazon made it too easy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been getting good results with Josie Maran&#x27;s hair serum, and didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>For as many products as I&#x27;ve tried on my dry, frizzy hair, I can honestly say this one is amazing.</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference when I use it</li>
            <li>The line has an amazing smell and really helps you straighten your hair leaving it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>When I do not use this product, I can tell a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it was much cheaper online.</li>
            <li>It has the same great scent, but when my hair dries, it&#x27;s just as frizzy as if I did not use the balm.</li>
            <li>Would have given this product 5 stars if it hadn&#x27;t smelled like cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>light weight silky shine</li>
            <li>sleek and smooth too.</li>
            <li>The results are worth a lot more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a smooth silicone feel to it.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair so soft and smells good.</li>
            <li>BUT AMAZON NEVER GAVE UP AND CONTINUED TO STAY ON TOP OF THIS TO GET THE RIGHT ONE TO ME.  </li>
            <li>Seller offers this product at a good price with quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I liked it better than Aveda&#x27;s product and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>It is also great when I decide to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li>I really should have smelled it in a store before buying online, but years of using various Tigi products had me feeling confident that this one would be equally good.</li>
            <li>I wish Redken would bring back their straight-line that was so good</li>
            <li>The only thing is I have to use a lot of this to get good results.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair straight, healthy, and shiney.</li>
            <li>So far I have only very good things to say.  </li>
            <li>Hair is really smooth and very straight..  </li>
            <li>It looks much healthier and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>You can use it on wet hair or dry hair to control frizz, fly aways, or just to smooth your finished style!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, wavy, color-treated, longish, and thanks to this stuff, the sleekest it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky, straight, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It helps protect my hair from all the heat styling I do and leaves my hair feeling very silky and smooth</li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit of this stuff worked into the ends makes my hair FEEL amazing.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my hair stays smooth and straight all day.</li>
            <li>and It makes my hair silky, straight, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was amazed and very hapoy to find it available at Amazon.</li>
            <li>It certainly is good performance-wise, but absolutely not scent-wise.</li>
            <li>So worth the money</li>
            <li>Usually Tigi hair products have such wonderful feminine fruity or floral scents, but they went with cheap men&#x27;s cologne on this one.</li>
            <li>my coworker used it on me for the 1st time last week and i can&#x27;t stop touching my hair , it&#x27;s so soft and shiny :)</li>
            <li>This is a great styling product and hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>As long as I don&#x27;t use too much, though, it&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I love this product,been using it for several years.</li>
            <li>I actually settled on 3 pumps for my mid-back length hair, and may try a bit more tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>First of all...</li>
            <li>I first tried it out when I went to a hairdresser in Canada.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work wonders!</li>
            <li>I just recently was introduced with this product and am in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love this balm for before using hair dryer and flat or curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am constantly blow drying and hot ironing my hair, and this product really helps keep it healthy.  </li>
            <li>But i loved how the flat iron spray peoduced similar results.</li>
            <li>I love using it on my toddler, just a single drop covers his hair, smooths it and leaves it glossy.  </li>
            <li>When applied to hair that has dried a little bit, it works the best.</li>
            <li>Both of them require a light hand, however; if I use even a tiny bit too much, my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li>I have battled frizzy hair my whole life.  </li>
            <li>However, the product does not seem to work very well.</li>
            <li>curly then straight by the end</li>
            <li>I have very curly, freezy hair.</li>
            <li>I told my friend about it &amp; she now wants to buy it for herself.</li>
            <li>When I use this, my hair is really bouncy and volumous and suuper shiny and straight.</li>
            <li>Arrived very timely.</li>
            <li>how much do I apply?</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair sleek and manageable and you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>seems to hold the straight.</li>
            <li>its cheap enough at amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It helps soften and control frizz on curly or straight hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li>You need only a small amount for this product to have a beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>I live in sunny, hot, HUMID Florida.</li>
            <li>Great product and serious seller!</li>
            <li>With both my hair doesn&#x27;t look thick or frizzy, and looks and feels healthy and clean after using the blow dryer and iron.</li>
            <li>My hair blow-dries smooth and flat irons</li>
            <li>My hairdresser said that buying this kind of product other than through a salon, you would probably get something other than the original.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Living Proof &amp; this product works just as good for much less plus adds extra shine.</li>
            <li>When I blew-dry my hair, it still ended up very poofy and frizzy and had to be finished with a flat-iron, which is normal for me.</li>
            <li>I have straight, thick, caucasian hair, so don&#x27;t need a lot of straightening, but I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I live in hot, humid New Orleans, but even when I lived in California my hair frizzed.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this hair product!</li>
            <li>The actuall serum has specks of sparkle in it which makes your hair a glassy and vibrant shine.</li>
            <li>I have an 8 month old currently and my hair looks fantastic again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Still highly rated though since this is user error.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, you don&#x27;t need a lot to work through your hair, just the size of a dime.</li>
            <li>Together they are super duper providing a long lasting straight, silky, shiny and salon worthy result nearly without effort.</li>
            <li>My only problem is figuring out exactly how much to use, but that will come with experience.  </li>
            <li>The blow out balm in Tigi&#x27;s Catwalk line is the only product that I&#x27;ve has success with in controlling the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>I rarely need a flat iron anymore.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by a new hairdresser that I used.</li>
            <li>I could totally see the difference, soft, smooth&amp; so much easier to flat iron.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the office in which I work is super dry in the winter</li>
            <li>but I was looking for something to help me with dry ends, protect it from heat and generally give my fine hair a boost.</li>
            <li>The flat ironing only takes a few min after the blowout bcz its nice and straight already.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair straight, but not flat.</li>
            <li>This balm makes my hair smooth without feeling sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s too old or was stored improperly.</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot, especially since I straight iron my hair all the time.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I ever have with it is that I sometimes get too much-</li>
            <li>AND IT FEELS SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>I have tried to use it all over, but it leaves my hair too oily near the scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to try this on my human hair extensions</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I have only used this a handful of times as it just recently arrived, but the smell is nice and it doesn&#x27;t make hair heavy or greasy looking, I may try the shampoo and conditioner to go with it too</li>
            <li>My husband (who is kind), my sister-in-law (who never gives a compliment) and my brother (on FaceTime, where I look like what I hope is a worse version of myself)</li>
            <li>I love this product I have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li>I have long hair, do I use 3-4 pumps, less or more?  </li>
            <li>Really not any better than any other (and cheaper) smoothing serum.</li>
            <li>I put half a pump at most on my dry hair and used the straightener, too, and it made my hair into my dream hair.</li>
            <li>It makes it soft (not dry and wiry).</li>
            <li>My hair type is dark, shoulder length and very, very wavy/curly.</li>
            <li>I expect it to last a long time since it does not take much to do the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too big on hair products because I don&#x27;t like the build up it leaves, but this product makes my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair sleek, shiny and soft after a blow out and provides some protection with the flat iron.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to use for blow out prior to using a flat iron on my naturally curly, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>and I have a small humidifier sitting at my desk blowing right on my face and hair.</li>

            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> will order again :)</li>
            <li> I love Tigi&#x27;s Curl Amplifier, so I got this to try when I go for a straightened style.</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT FOR MY CULY HAIR</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this brand.</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned this is the best product for creating smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> It was my favorite hair styling serum.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> On top of all of this, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> shipping was more than the product.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, curly hair, this stuff is awesome!  </li>
            <li> Smells phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and my hair behaves much better.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, but my hair smelled like that guy at the gym who rolls around in a vat of cologne instead of taking a shower all day long</li>
            <li> It smells good and really helps control the frizzies.</li>
            <li> Amazon made it too easy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been getting good results with Josie Maran&#x27;s hair serum, and didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> For as many products as I&#x27;ve tried on my dry, frizzy hair, I can honestly say this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference when I use it</li>
            <li> The line has an amazing smell and really helps you straighten your hair leaving it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> When I do not use this product, I can tell a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it was much cheaper online.</li>
            <li> It has the same great scent, but when my hair dries, it&#x27;s just as frizzy as if I did not use the balm.</li>
            <li> Would have given this product 5 stars if it hadn&#x27;t smelled like cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> light weight silky shine</li>
            <li> sleek and smooth too.</li>
            <li> The results are worth a lot more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a smooth silicone feel to it.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair so soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> BUT AMAZON NEVER GAVE UP AND CONTINUED TO STAY ON TOP OF THIS TO GET THE RIGHT ONE TO ME.  </li>
            <li> Seller offers this product at a good price with quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I liked it better than Aveda&#x27;s product and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> It is also great when I decide to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> I really should have smelled it in a store before buying online, but years of using various Tigi products had me feeling confident that this one would be equally good.</li>
            <li> I wish Redken would bring back their straight-line that was so good</li>
            <li> The only thing is I have to use a lot of this to get good results.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair straight, healthy, and shiney.</li>
            <li> So far I have only very good things to say.  </li>
            <li> Hair is really smooth and very straight..  </li>
            <li> It looks much healthier and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> You can use it on wet hair or dry hair to control frizz, fly aways, or just to smooth your finished style!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, wavy, color-treated, longish, and thanks to this stuff, the sleekest it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky, straight, and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It helps protect my hair from all the heat styling I do and leaves my hair feeling very silky and smooth</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit of this stuff worked into the ends makes my hair FEEL amazing.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my hair stays smooth and straight all day.</li>
            <li> and It makes my hair silky, straight, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was amazed and very hapoy to find it available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> It certainly is good performance-wise, but absolutely not scent-wise.</li>
            <li> So worth the money</li>
            <li> Usually Tigi hair products have such wonderful feminine fruity or floral scents, but they went with cheap men&#x27;s cologne on this one.</li>
            <li> my coworker used it on me for the 1st time last week and i can&#x27;t stop touching my hair , it&#x27;s so soft and shiny :)</li>
            <li> This is a great styling product and hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t use too much, though, it&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this product,been using it for several years.</li>
            <li> I actually settled on 3 pumps for my mid-back length hair, and may try a bit more tomorrow.  </li>
            <li> First of all...</li>
            <li> I first tried it out when I went to a hairdresser in Canada.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work wonders!</li>
            <li> I just recently was introduced with this product and am in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love this balm for before using hair dryer and flat or curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am constantly blow drying and hot ironing my hair, and this product really helps keep it healthy.  </li>
            <li> But i loved how the flat iron spray peoduced similar results.</li>
            <li> I love using it on my toddler, just a single drop covers his hair, smooths it and leaves it glossy.  </li>
            <li> When applied to hair that has dried a little bit, it works the best.</li>
            <li> Both of them require a light hand, however; if I use even a tiny bit too much, my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li> I have battled frizzy hair my whole life.  </li>
            <li> However, the product does not seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> curly then straight by the end</li>
            <li> I have very curly, freezy hair.</li>
            <li> I told my friend about it &amp; she now wants to buy it for herself.</li>
            <li> When I use this, my hair is really bouncy and volumous and suuper shiny and straight.</li>
            <li> Arrived very timely.</li>
            <li> how much do I apply?</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair sleek and manageable and you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> seems to hold the straight.</li>
            <li> its cheap enough at amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It helps soften and control frizz on curly or straight hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> You need only a small amount for this product to have a beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> I live in sunny, hot, HUMID Florida.</li>
            <li> Great product and serious seller!</li>
            <li> With both my hair doesn&#x27;t look thick or frizzy, and looks and feels healthy and clean after using the blow dryer and iron.</li>
            <li> My hair blow-dries smooth and flat irons</li>
            <li> My hairdresser said that buying this kind of product other than through a salon, you would probably get something other than the original.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Living Proof &amp; this product works just as good for much less plus adds extra shine.</li>
            <li> When I blew-dry my hair, it still ended up very poofy and frizzy and had to be finished with a flat-iron, which is normal for me.</li>
            <li> I have straight, thick, caucasian hair, so don&#x27;t need a lot of straightening, but I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I live in hot, humid New Orleans, but even when I lived in California my hair frizzed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this hair product!</li>
            <li> The actuall serum has specks of sparkle in it which makes your hair a glassy and vibrant shine.</li>
            <li> I have an 8 month old currently and my hair looks fantastic again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Still highly rated though since this is user error.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, you don&#x27;t need a lot to work through your hair, just the size of a dime.</li>
            <li> Together they are super duper providing a long lasting straight, silky, shiny and salon worthy result nearly without effort.</li>
            <li> My only problem is figuring out exactly how much to use, but that will come with experience.  </li>
            <li> The blow out balm in Tigi&#x27;s Catwalk line is the only product that I&#x27;ve has success with in controlling the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> I rarely need a flat iron anymore.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a new hairdresser that I used.</li>
            <li> I could totally see the difference, soft, smooth&amp; so much easier to flat iron.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the office in which I work is super dry in the winter</li>
            <li> but I was looking for something to help me with dry ends, protect it from heat and generally give my fine hair a boost.</li>
            <li> The flat ironing only takes a few min after the blowout bcz its nice and straight already.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair straight, but not flat.</li>
            <li> This balm makes my hair smooth without feeling sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s too old or was stored improperly.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, especially since I straight iron my hair all the time.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I ever have with it is that I sometimes get too much-</li>
            <li> AND IT FEELS SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use it all over, but it leaves my hair too oily near the scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting ready to try this on my human hair extensions</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a handful of times as it just recently arrived, but the smell is nice and it doesn&#x27;t make hair heavy or greasy looking, I may try the shampoo and conditioner to go with it too</li>
            <li> My husband (who is kind), my sister-in-law (who never gives a compliment) and my brother (on FaceTime, where I look like what I hope is a worse version of myself)</li>
            <li> I love this product I have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair, do I use 3-4 pumps, less or more?  </li>
            <li> Really not any better than any other (and cheaper) smoothing serum.</li>
            <li> I put half a pump at most on my dry hair and used the straightener, too, and it made my hair into my dream hair.</li>
            <li> It makes it soft (not dry and wiry).</li>
            <li> My hair type is dark, shoulder length and very, very wavy/curly.</li>
            <li> I expect it to last a long time since it does not take much to do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too big on hair products because I don&#x27;t like the build up it leaves, but this product makes my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair sleek, shiny and soft after a blow out and provides some protection with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use for blow out prior to using a flat iron on my naturally curly, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> and I have a small humidifier sitting at my desk blowing right on my face and hair.</li>
            <li> I usually use Aveda Smooth Infusion and thought I&#x27;d try this at half the price.  </li>
            <li> This product really helped tame my frizzies and seemed to put a protective shield on my hair.  </li>
            <li> and this really helps tame it.  </li>
            <li> It certainly adds a little shine!  </li>
            <li> My hairstylist used it prior to blow drying and flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> I use and blowdry with the flat nozzle attachment and a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I also use the Haute Iron spray by Tigi Catwalk as a heat protectant before the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I applied it after I washed my hair, used the blow dryer to dry it enough to use the flat iron &amp; then flat ironed my hair.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment for me, especially since I&#x27;ve been searching for a replacement for the Fashionista Smooth and Shine product of theirs that I used for years, but they recently discontinued.</li>
            <li> this amazing product really helps with my crazy curly thick hair when blowdrying!</li>
            <li> I use it with a flat iron, curling iron, blow dryer, and even on dry hair when I needed some moisture and shine on the ends.</li>
            <li> I have softness that I haven&#x27;t had in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I think I will use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted medium length hair that is fairly thick, and I have to use 3-4 whole pumps.</li>
            <li> Not as greasy as other similar products.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t add any weight, seems to help my hair dry faster, add lots of shine and smoothness.</li>
            <li> I put it on when my hair is wet,blow dry and style as usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I just work 1-2 pumps through my damp hair then blow dry, and it feels like I just got my hair done at a salon!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t dry my hair without it!</li>
            <li> I have straight, long, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I usually straighten my hair without using anything, and I really didn&#x27;t see any benefits from using this product other than a slightly shinier finish.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small but it will last soo long.</li>
            <li> You only need a few pumps of this on wet hair and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I put two pumps of this on my wet hair and blew it out, and it looked like it had when I was using the other stuff &amp; blew it out plus used my straightener (iron).</li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair prone to frizz when left to airdry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it works wonders on damaged hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way....</li>
            <li> It has a shimmer to the serum and a little goes a really long way.</li>
            <li> You need only a small amount for this product to work wonders.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount too</li>
            <li> I usually get my hair cut at the Toni &amp; Guy Academy (because it&#x27;s cheaper and about the same quality), and one of the students used this product on my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle, but goes a long way.</li>
            <li> by no means terrible, it is simply that this reminds me of a lot of straightening/blow drying Products where you put them in your hair and for a moment you achieved greatness however because it stays wet your hair and ends up looking more  </li>
            <li> The product protects my hair when blowdrying, it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and nourishes it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, priced that high, i never would have tried it to know.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy on your hand, but once it goes on your hair</li>
            <li> which makes my hair a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> Less washing means less abuse with the dryer and straightener - YAY!</li>
            <li> IT TOOK A FEW TIMES TO GET THE CORRECT PRODUCT TO ME</li>
            <li> But I did not enjoy the process of dealing with fragrance.net.</li>
            <li> and gives me a very odd luck quite frankly – not at all for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft,(well, it usually</li>
            <li> You can have this one for a small price on amazon.</li>
            <li> Its a small bottle.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m concerned that I spent money on a fake and not the product that I requested.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> poor job packing.</li>
            <li> My husband randomly brought this home because it was half-off with his haircut.</li>
            <li> And what&#x27;s weird is it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, even the day after.</li>
            <li> Despite the lack if clearer instructions, this is a no-brainer, buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was a given a bottle by my stylist and when I ran out was unable to find it until now.</li>
            <li> Meaning i can wear a headband or a twisted pony-bun all day while tending kids and then dhake it out</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t go crazy on the spray bcz</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I live in hot, humid New Orleans, but even when I lived in California my hair frizzed. It&#x27;s fine, wavy, color-treated, longish, and thanks to this stuff, the sleekest it&#x27;s ever been. I&#x27;ve tried tons of frizz-fighters, both inexpensive and above what I could afford. My husband randomly brought this home because it was half-off with his haircut. I&#x27;d been getting good results with Josie Maran&#x27;s hair serum, and didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this.  I put two pumps of this on my wet hair and blew it out, and it looked like it had when I was using the other stuff &amp; blew it out plus used my straightener (iron). I put half a pump at most on my dry hair and used the straightener, too, and it made my hair into my dream hair. My husband (who is kind), my sister-in-law (who never gives a compliment) and my brother (on FaceTime, where I look like what I hope is a worse version of myself) all commented on how great my hair looked, so I knew it wasn&#x27;t in my head. I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s only around $10 with Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save, and with the amount I use and the size of the bottle, I see it lasting for a couple of months with daily use. Great product, great deal. Try it!</li>
            <li> Love this. Not greasy.  Beautiful shine and eliminates friz</li>
            <li> I have coarse curly hair and this leaves my hair looking shiny and controlled.  No frizz.</li>
            <li> I love this balm for before using hair dryer and flat or curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more of it.</li>
            <li> You need only a small amount for this product to work wonders. I researched this product before buying it and am so glad that I did. Amazon made it too easy.  The product protects my hair when blowdrying, it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and nourishes it throughout the day. The actuall serum has specks of sparkle in it which makes your hair a glassy and vibrant shine.</li>
            <li> I have battled frizzy hair my whole life.  This balm makes my hair smooth without feeling sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> The title for this review says it all: It&#x27;s the only anti-frizz serum that has ever worked on my hair. Love it. Buying it from Amazon is cheaper than most salons, so stock-up here.</li>
            <li> I usually use Aveda Smooth Infusion and thought I&#x27;d try this at half the price.  It&#x27;s a little greasy on your hand, but once it goes on your hair it&#x27;s fine.  Hair is really smooth and very straight..  I liked it better than Aveda&#x27;s product and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I have never used extra hair products before but my hair is changing and getting dryer.  This product is AMAZING.  I have softness that I haven&#x27;t had in a long time.  ~~EllieJo</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, but purchased it from a department store. I liked the fact that it was much cheaper online. However, the product does not seem to work very well. I \\&quot;spray\\&quot; it into my hand but an oily substance drips onto my palm. It has the same great scent, but when my hair dries, it&#x27;s just as frizzy as if I did not use the balm. Maybe it&#x27;s too old or was stored improperly. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have straight, thick, caucasian hair, so don&#x27;t need a lot of straightening, but I love this product!  It makes my hair silky, straight, and smooth.  I can tell a huge difference when I use it and when I don&#x27;t.  It also helps cut drying time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Would have given this product 5 stars if it hadn&#x27;t smelled like cheap men&#x27;s cologne. Yuck! Works wonderfully, but my hair smelled like that guy at the gym who rolls around in a vat of cologne instead of taking a shower all day long and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get back home to wash the scent out of my hair. Haven&#x27;t used it since. I don&#x27;t understand why they went with this scent. Usually Tigi hair products have such wonderful feminine fruity or floral scents, but they went with cheap men&#x27;s cologne on this one. I really should have smelled it in a store before buying online, but years of using various Tigi products had me feeling confident that this one would be equally good. It certainly is good performance-wise, but absolutely not scent-wise. Big disappointment for me, especially since I&#x27;ve been searching for a replacement for the Fashionista Smooth and Shine product of theirs that I used for years, but they recently discontinued. If anyone knows a good replacement for that product (that doesn&#x27;t stink like this one) I would love to hear about it.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, especially since I straight iron my hair all the time.  It certainly adds a little shine!  The only problem I ever have with it is that I sometimes get too much- which makes my hair a little greasy.  Still highly rated though since this is user error.  &#x3D;)  Smells AWESOME.</li>
            <li> Loved the catwalk sleek mystique blow out balm.!! will order again :)&lt;br /&gt;it is the best you can find out there.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product. A little goes a long way and it works wonders on damaged hair. I use it in conjunction with the Haute Iron Spray. Both of them require a light hand, however; if I use even a tiny bit too much, my hair looks greasy. As long as I don&#x27;t use too much, though, it&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use for blow out prior to using a flat iron on my naturally curly, color treated hair. This product makes my hair sleek, shiny and soft after a blow out and provides some protection with the flat iron. I also use the Haute Iron spray by Tigi Catwalk as a heat protectant before the flat iron. With both my hair doesn&#x27;t look thick or frizzy, and looks and feels healthy and clean after using the blow dryer and iron. You only need a few pumps of this on wet hair and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve found to use on curly hair. Have recommended this to several friends.</li>
            <li> This product really helped tame my frizzies and seemed to put a protective shield on my hair.  I definitely like it.  My only problem is figuring out exactly how much to use, but that will come with experience.  When applied to hair that has dried a little bit, it works the best.</li>
            <li> I love Tigi&#x27;s Curl Amplifier, so I got this to try when I go for a straightened style. It was ok. Really not any better than any other (and cheaper) smoothing serum. I usually straighten my hair without using anything, and I really didn&#x27;t see any benefits from using this product other than a slightly shinier finish. It did not noticeably decrease frizz or make it stay straighter longer. When I blew-dry my hair, it still ended up very poofy and frizzy and had to be finished with a flat-iron, which is normal for me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF IT TOOK A FEW TIMES TO GET THE CORRECT PRODUCT TO ME BUT AMAZON NEVER GAVE UP AND CONTINUED TO STAY ON TOP OF THIS TO GET THE RIGHT ONE TO ME.  I LOVE IT FOR MY CULY HAIR AND IT FEELS SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I have been using Living Proof &amp; this product works just as good for much less plus adds extra shine.</li>
            <li> Good product to soften and control frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes your hair so soft and smells good. You only need a small amount too so it last awhile</li>
            <li> by no means terrible, it is simply that this reminds me of a lot of straightening/blow drying Products where you put them in your hair and for a moment you achieved greatness however because it stays wet your hair and ends up looking more  curly then straight by the end and gives me a very odd luck quite frankly – not at all for me. I wish Redken would bring back their straight-line that was so good</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair it&#x27;s an awesome balm for blow out for your hair. It smells great too. It works perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist used this product on my curly hair and it was very effective.  So glad to find it at a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price! I will definately buy again!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. The line has an amazing smell and really helps you straighten your hair leaving it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have never found a product that works as well as this,  and believe me I have tried a lot. This was recommended by a new hairdresser that I used. She has curly hair and knows all about the problems associated with it. I only use it on the mid shaft and below of my shoulder hair. It makes it soft (not dry and wiry). It also helps retain curl added with a curling iron. I have tried to use it all over, but it leaves my hair too oily near the scalp.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> I have used this product every day for over 2 years now. It helps protect my hair from all the heat styling I do and leaves my hair feeling very silky and smooth</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has changed the look of my hair. It looks much healthier and is easy to use. I love this brand.</li>
            <li> When I received my order, I was concerned that the bottle it came in did not look like the one in the store. Also, the product did not smell or look the same.  My hairdresser said that buying this kind of product other than through a salon, you would probably get something other than the original.  Now I&#x27;m concerned that I spent money on a fake and not the product that I requested.  It happened to me once before and got my money back.  I probably should do that again.  It makes me think twice  now about ordering something like this again through amazon! How can these sellers get away with it?  Anyone else have the same problem?</li>
            <li> They best hair gel ever! It helps with the straighting of your hair.  This product is not oily and smells great.</li>
            <li> This product transforms my hair. I have straight, long, thin hair. Just a tiny bit of this stuff worked into the ends makes my hair FEEL amazing. It keeps the ends from getting stringy, gives brilliant shine and texture. I use it with a flat iron, curling iron, blow dryer, and even on dry hair when I needed some moisture and shine on the ends.</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned this is the best product for creating smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, freezy hair. I applied it after I washed my hair, used the blow dryer to dry it enough to use the flat iron &amp; then flat ironed my hair. I could totally see the difference, soft, smooth&amp; so much easier to flat iron. I love this product, I recommend this to everyone. I told my friend about it &amp; she now wants to buy it for herself. The best thing is that it won&#x27;t leave your hair feeling/looking greasy!</li>
            <li> When I use this, my hair is really bouncy and volumous and suuper shiny and straight. And what&#x27;s weird is it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, even the day after. The smell is amazing too. The only thing is I have to use a lot of this to get good results. I have highlighted medium length hair that is fairly thick, and I have to use 3-4 whole pumps. But its still a great value. The bottle is small but it will last soo long.</li>
            <li> Great product! Will use and order again. No build up on hair. Arrived very timely. We all use it in our house.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year, and I would not consider using anything else.  I am constantly blow drying and hot ironing my hair, and this product really helps keep it healthy.  When I do not use this product, I can tell a huge difference in my hair.  This product leaves my hair straight, healthy, and shiney.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!!  I had bought one of these from Ulta 5 years prior.  It was my favorite hair styling serum.  It does wonders for knots in your hair and tangles and it makes your hair shine!  I love using it on my toddler, just a single drop covers his hair, smooths it and leaves it glossy.  I don&#x27;t even use heat products at all.</li>
            <li> Ordered on a Saturday and arrived on Tuesday with regular shipping.  I love this product,been using it for several years.</li>
            <li> recently got a waive perm and my stylist recommended I use this. I use it all the time and works perfectly in my hair. love it.</li>
            <li> I am a hair product junkie! For as many products as I&#x27;ve tried on my dry, frizzy hair, I can honestly say this one is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t add any weight, seems to help my hair dry faster, add lots of shine and smoothness. Additionally, the office in which I work is super dry in the winter and I have a small humidifier sitting at my desk blowing right on my face and hair. Before I started using this, the humidifier would make my hair get frizzy. After using this product, my hair stays smooth and straight all day. I&#x27;ve even found I can skip a day between washing without having that stringy look the second day. Less washing means less abuse with the dryer and straightener - YAY! On top of all of this, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of Tigi Catwalk Balm but I was looking for something to help me with dry ends, protect it from heat and generally give my fine hair a boost. (Oh,  I also just went blonde to hide the grays.) So far I have only very good things to say.  My hair is soft,(well, it usually was)there&#x27;s virtually no fuzzies on the ends and the shine is wonderful and healthy, beautiful!! I also love the smell!!! The only thing I&#x27;d like to see would be definitive instructions; ie. how much do I apply? There probably is some sort of guideline for hair type and length. I have long hair, do I use 3-4 pumps, less or more?  I actually settled on 3 pumps for my mid-back length hair, and may try a bit more tomorrow.  I would just rather not have to deal with trial and error.  I&#x27;m getting ready to try this on my human hair extensions so I&#x27;ll update this with the results later.  Despite the lack if clearer instructions, this is a no-brainer, buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my hair feel.  I was a given a bottle by my stylist and when I ran out was unable to find it until now.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way....I really like this.My hairstylist used it prior to blow drying and flat ironing my hair.It smells good and really helps control the frizzies.Could not beat the price on Amazon...shipping was more than the product.I expect it to last a long time since it does not take much to do the job.</li>
            <li> First of all...THIS SMELLS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! I first tried it out when I went to a hairdresser in Canada. She used it on me before blow drying my hair and I was amazed at how gorgeous my locks were! It has a shimmer to the serum and a little goes a really long way. I promise you, this won&#x27;t make your hair greasy and will do amazing things for your hair. I can&#x27;t live without this hair product! It is a holy grail MUST HAVE! So worth the money and I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> This product is great! It keeps my hair straight, but not flat. Not as greasy as other similar products. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this product, I get compliments. Makes my hair shiny and soft. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> this amazing product really helps with my crazy curly thick hair when blowdrying! my coworker used it on me for the 1st time last week and i can&#x27;t stop touching my hair , it&#x27;s so soft and shiny :)deff recommend it, for all hair types</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome! It keeps my hair sleek and manageable and you don&#x27;t need to use much. One of my favorite haircare products!</li>
            <li> As always, catwalk sleek mystique products work great! Seller offers this product at a good price with quick shipping.</li>
            <li> poor job packing. Container leaked all over the envelope</li>
            <li> I have coarse, curly hair, this stuff is awesome!  I highly recommend this product, you don&#x27;t need a lot to work through your hair, just the size of a dime. (if that..depending on the length of your hair.) This product has a pleasant fragrance, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> amazing product works on all hair types light weight silky shine</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and It makes my hair silky, straight, shiny and smooth. You can have this one for a small price on amazon. You need only a small amount for this product to have a beautiful hair. Love it!! I think I will use this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work wonders! I got so any compliments on my hair when I used- everyone thought I cut and colored my hair! Nope just gaveyslef a blowout! I stocked up!!</li>
            <li> really great. i use it before I blow-dry and flatiron. Smells phenomenal. My hair type is dark, shoulder length and very, very wavy/curly.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have thick wavy hair and this really helps tame it.  It is also great when I decide to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> Love this product!! It&#x27;s a must have. You can use it on wet hair or dry hair to control frizz, fly aways, or just to smooth your finished style!!</li>
            <li> I usually get my hair cut at the Toni &amp; Guy Academy (because it&#x27;s cheaper and about the same quality), and one of the students used this product on my hair. I&#x27;m not too big on hair products because I don&#x27;t like the build up it leaves, but this product makes my hair silky soft. I just work 1-2 pumps through my damp hair then blow dry, and it feels like I just got my hair done at a salon! It&#x27;s also way cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a handful of times as it just recently arrived, but the smell is nice and it doesn&#x27;t make hair heavy or greasy looking, I may try the shampoo and conditioner to go with it too</li>
            <li> I live in sunny, hot, HUMID Florida. This is my holy grail for blow drying and straightening my hair. It is a small bottle, but goes a long way. I will continue to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great communication.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Tigi catwalk blow out balm for years. I only use about a nickel size amount in the palm of my hand and work it through the ends of my hair (I have a bob that is to my chin). My hair blow-dries smooth and flat irons sleek and smooth too. Great price on Amazon. It is much more expensive in salons.</li>
            <li> I just recently was introduced with this product and am in love with it. The quality is awesome and does not grease your hair. Definitely will keep being a costumer.</li>
            <li> Great product and serious seller! Fully recommended!!</li>
            <li> Great. I use and blowdry with the flat nozzle attachment and a regular brush. I rarely need a flat iron anymore. What used to take 2 hours now takes about 30 min shower included on both scenarios. I have long thick wavy hair prone to frizz when left to airdry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe i went 4 years just leaving my hair in a bun bcz of time constraints having babies! I have an 8 month old currently and my hair looks fantastic again. The tigi catwalk line (haute iron spray is great too i do not have the shampoo) seems to hold the straight. Meaning i can wear a headband or a twisted pony-bun all day while tending kids and then dhake it out and theres no creases! Whhhaaattt? I say this is magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $8. Its a small bottle. I was hesitant to pay. But i loved how the flat iron spray peoduced similar results. The results are worth a lot more. I am a thrifty gal and would fork over $40+ for it. Unfortunately, priced that high, i never would have tried it to know. Good thing its cheap enough at amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: the haute iron spray and the blowout balm rock. Seperately. Together they are super duper providing a long lasting straight, silky, shiny and salon worthy result nearly without effort. The flat ironing only takes a few min after the blowout bcz its nice and straight already. Just don&#x27;t go crazy on the spray bcz you will end up looking greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a great styling product and hard to find in the stores. I won&#x27;t dry my hair without it!</li>
            <li> I put it on when my hair is wet,blow dry and style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;It helps soften and control frizz on curly or straight hair. (I do both)&lt;br /&gt;It has a smooth silicone feel to it. Can even use it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It smells incredible!</li>
            <li> The blow out balm in Tigi&#x27;s Catwalk line is the only product that I&#x27;ve has success with in controlling the frizzies.  I have very fine hair living and working north of Seattle where even on nice sunny days we have damp mornings which is not the ideal start to a good hair day.  I was amazed and very hapoy to find it available at Amazon. Even if I had to purchase 3 bottles to get the best price. Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love this product. But I did not enjoy the process of dealing with fragrance.net.</li>
            <li> Use this stuff A LOT and my hair behaves much better. i have curls and am older,&lt;br /&gt;so my hair is dry.</li>
