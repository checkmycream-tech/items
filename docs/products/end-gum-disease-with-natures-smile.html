            <li>This&#x27;s a good natural way to treat your gums &amp; dental needs.</li>
            <li>so far so good ........</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Please be aware of what you put in your mouth which gets into your bloodstream etc !!?</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth and gums so clean that I substitue it for toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to chance going back to my dentist and hear that my gums weren&#x27;t looking good.</li>
            <li>I would have given it more stars but the packaging is weird.&lt;br /&gt;So not to contaminate the whole thing by dipping my tootbrush in it</li>
            <li>A FULL 18 days before the 60 day guarantee expired.</li>
            <li>They had the product in their possession for 18 full days before the 60 day guarantee was up and then did not issue the refund until Nov 27.</li>
            <li>BUT WHEN YOU GET THE LIST OF INGREDIENTS, YOU SEE IT IS FULL OF ADDED CANCER</li>
            <li>it has helped out it just depends on how far along your on gum disease and trust me i always taken good care of my teeth and gums but no matter how healthy you are some people are more prone to getting it and other things but want to try it go for it</li>
            <li>i might be one of the lucky ones .</li>
            <li>helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>The maker on their own website offer deals for multiple bottles for significant savings.</li>
            <li>My son and I tried the product Nature&#x27;s Smile and the reason I bought</li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Smile is like a balm for your gums, and it works as advertised if used the way they prescribe.</li>
            <li>It does keep my breath fresh longer than alcohol based mouthwash or toothpastes - for that reason alone</li>
            <li>so he tried the natures smile and it didn&#x27;t stop the bleeding</li>
            <li>nature&#x27;s smile has an F rating with the BBB.  </li>
            <li>The return was delivered to Nature&#x27;s Smile on October 24, 2012.</li>
            <li>I would recommend think smile tooth paste and rinse to others.</li>
            <li>My gums aren&#x27;t inflamed or  bleeding, the product did leave you mouth feeling really fresh  </li>
            <li>Currently can buy 4, get 2 free and free ship.</li>
            <li>Easy to use but not sure how effective it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product a couple weeks, sometimes with herbal remedies more time is needed.  </li>
            <li>the product doesn&#x27;t work, all the positive reviews are lies....</li>
            <li>It absolutely does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Her gums were healthy, her gums measurements were almost all normal and the dentist did a standard cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It really worked.</li>
            <li>Gave it 3 stars because it might work for other people and it is ok but not for me.</li>
            <li>It might help, but at much too high a price for what you get.</li>
            <li>So between the even more sensitive gums and the dry mouth, I just gave up after 4 days.</li>
            <li>So I stopped brushing with my regular toothpaste and just used Nature&#x27;s Smile.</li>
            <li>Its a rare thing these days to find a product that actually does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>When the credit was finally given on NOVEMBER 27, 2012, , Natures Smile Customer Service shorted me 10$ because the refund was issued after the 60 day guarantee period.</li>
            <li>The double brushing just ended up making my gums bleed and super sensitive.</li>
            <li>First of all I was thrilled to find a product that claims to be (ALL NATURAL)also helps with gum disease issues,all for the very resonable cost of approximately $25 plus shipping,so I went ahead and ordered !</li>
            <li>and my teeth were very sensitive.</li>
            <li>My gums may never grow back to where they were when I was young, but they are now pink and healthy.</li>
            <li>, I thought it was all natural herbs.  </li>
            <li>i suffer years with gum disease even though it not gone completely</li>
            <li>I tried it and it made my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any receding of the gums going on so far that has seem to stop.</li>
            <li>AS ALL NATURAL,</li>
            <li>I have used it for 3 weeks now and so far my gums are getting back to normal.</li>
            <li>NO HIDDEN SURPRISES.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s dentist was going to do a deep root gum cleaning because her measurements were well below normal.  </li>
            <li>amazon only shows positive reviews, so mine probably won&#x27;t make it for long if it does at all...</li>
            <li>I have used Nature&#x27;s Smile for a few years now.  </li>

            <li> I have used Nature&#x27;s Smile for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> My gums seem pink and healthy, but I have not seen any new gum growing back - that was my disappointment.  </li>
            <li> My dentist is actually endorsing this to other patients now because of my personal results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I really thought it was going to a least help with my gum disease.</li>
            <li> Any pain and minor bleeding</li>
            <li> I thought oh well as long as it helps with the gum disease.</li>
            <li> but my mouth is fresh and free of bad breath!</li>
            <li> The product does not seem to have done me any harm, works like a second toothpaste after my other oral hygiene is completed.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are due to be cleaned  next month.  </li>
            <li> I have one tooth that was really bad, the top of it was exposed and the gums were red</li>
            <li> The problem with that is the paste was making my mouth dry.</li>
            <li> Single bottles are pricey.</li>
            <li> The second day I used it in the morning and started to notice it was dyeing the backside of my teeth a dark color.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after that because I also had a tooth really loose.</li>
            <li> Trust me when I say that most of the high reviews here are in fact fake, fake, fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very polite and when I tried a little harder to find out the ingredients he rudely told me &amp;#34;just don&#x27;t buy it -</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day until two containers and 2 mouth rinses were totally empty.</li>
            <li> Very dismayed at the array of unhealthy additives not listed on ad.</li>
            <li> Be Careful.</li>
            <li> I went ahead with the expensive purchase believing the product would be worth it.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> it is when I lookede up the ingredients there was no mention of other ingrdints suh as sodium laurel sulfate and other ingredints</li>
            <li> The other ingredints irritated our mouths and gums.  </li>
            <li> I went back to the dentist after using and my gums were not much better.</li>
            <li> and wow there was not just a little pink in the sink, my mouth was seriously bleeding from one tooth.</li>
            <li> on the website do they disclose these awful ingredients just the good stuff,it is quite disengenious to put this phoney product out there.</li>
            <li> Afer one week the swelling was down and my gums were healing.</li>
            <li> If I could leave less than one star I would.  </li>
            <li> This is falsely advertised as a natural product and it is costing me $15 to pay shipping to receive then return this toxic waste product.</li>
            <li> so he went back to a different dentist and the cost of a deep cleaning after insurance was not that bad.  </li>
            <li> I read a review containing a full list of the ingredients and was shocked.</li>
            <li> It might whiten your teeth a little bit.</li>
            <li> Although the bleeding did not quit entirely it did slow, but my gums had receded worse than they were before I use this product and now I have to have a periodontist look at my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> it arrived I looked at the ingredients and was really quite shocked</li>
            <li> I was wrong, it is starting to heal!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they would say this product was natural and then put all these dangerous chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> i will continue using this product until i start to see negative results.</li>
            <li> Their fault the refund was late, mind you, but I got charged for their irresponsible behavior.</li>
            <li> This product does what it claims to do; at least it did for me.</li>
            <li> Negative stars.</li>
            <li> When using at night before bed, mouth is much fresher - way less nasty in the morning.</li>
            <li> These are not good people to do business with.</li>
            <li> It felt like it was making everything worse.</li>
            <li> HE WAS SO ANGRY AND RUDE.</li>
            <li> this product does not work it also tastes bad, do not buy this and waste money</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I was skeptical\\&quot; and \\&quot;a miracle\\&quot; are invariably fake.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it didn&#x27;t help us.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate for this product to work.</li>
            <li> , I thought it was in too bad of shape for this product and</li>
            <li> taste isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I had Surgery for Gum disease which is painful &amp; costly</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I don&#x27;t think this is a terrible product, but it&#x27;s not going to cure your bad gum disease.</li>
            <li> Please give this one a try you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was so very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The taste was almost like a band-aide but that wasn&#x27;t the worst.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year and it has been a great help. Just brushing with toothpaste didn&#x27;t seem to help my gums they were swollen and would bleed. But following the directions of this product and regular use has stopped the bleeding and you can just feel the difference</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 3 weeks but what a difference. My gums are looking good. I have one tooth that was really bad, the top of it was exposed and the gums were red, I thought it was in too bad of shape for this product and the dentist would deal with it. I was wrong, it is starting to heal! I love this product and will order more. It is saving my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I tried this product hoping it would help with my gingivitis. As for whether or not it works, I have no clue. I used it for about 4 days and then ended up having to stop. The double brushing just ended up making my gums bleed and super sensitive. So I stopped brushing with my regular toothpaste and just used Nature&#x27;s Smile. The problem with that is the paste was making my mouth dry. So between the even more sensitive gums and the dry mouth, I just gave up after 4 days. It felt like it was making everything worse.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and used it for about 6 weeks. It did seem to help my reddened gums somewhat, but not enough to make me want to buy the stuff again. I felt I had to offer a more balanced review than these silly, obviously paid 5-star reviews. Folks, reviews with language like, \\&quot;I was skeptical\\&quot; and \\&quot;a miracle\\&quot; are invariably fake. Companies pay people to publish good reviews and drive up sales. Trust me when I say that most of the high reviews here are in fact fake, fake, fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I don&#x27;t think this is a terrible product, but it&#x27;s not going to cure your bad gum disease. It might help, but at much too high a price for what you get. If this were $10 I&#x27;d say go for it.</li>
            <li> My son and I tried the product Nature&#x27;s Smile and the reason I bought it is when I lookede up the ingredients there was no mention of other ingrdints suh as sodium laurel sulfate and other ingredints, I thought it was all natural herbs.  The other ingredints irritated our mouths and gums.  Needless to say it didn&#x27;t help us.  It may work for someone else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now. It absolutely does exactly what it says it will do. My dentist is actually endorsing this to other patients now because of my personal results. I wish I could have found something like this when I was much younger. This is a great way to end problematic gum conditions. I gave this as a gift to my 3 kids (college age) about 6 months ago and everyone is getting great results. Its a rare thing these days to find a product that actually does what it says it will do. I&#x27;m so glad I found this.</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully for 2 weeks and noticed that my gums did not look healthier. I use ORA MD Extra Strength and once I went back to this my gums starting looking better.&lt;br /&gt;The taste isn&#x27;t bad. It might whiten your teeth a little bit. Gave it 3 stars because it might work for other people and it is ok but not for me. I didn&#x27;t want to chance going back to my dentist and hear that my gums weren&#x27;t looking good.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for two weeks and have had good results . i no longer have any blood when brushing and my gums seem to have tightened up to my teeth. . so far so good . i might be one of the lucky ones . i will continue using this product until i start to see negative results.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it does. Stopped my gums from bleeding in one week. Please give this one a try you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Smile is like a balm for your gums, and it works as advertised if used the way they prescribe.</li>
            <li> This works realy well. I would have given it more stars but the packaging is weird.&lt;br /&gt;So not to contaminate the whole thing by dipping my tootbrush in it I have to dig out some with my finger and put on the toothbush. It should come in a more sanitary fashion like in a tube. But the product works well.</li>
            <li> Have used for one month. Definate improvement. Any pain and minor bleeding I had is gone. When using at night before bed, mouth is much fresher - way less nasty in the morning. Single bottles are pricey. The maker on their own website offer deals for multiple bottles for significant savings. That is how I am making my next purchase. Currently can buy 4, get 2 free and free ship. That&#x27;s the way to go.</li>
            <li> Great price Great Product Great and Fast Delivery Try this stuff works great i suffer years with gum disease even though it not gone completely it has helped out it just depends on how far along your on gum disease and trust me i always taken good care of my teeth and gums but no matter how healthy you are some people are more prone to getting it and other things but want to try it go for it it might seem pricey but think about all money you save in long run if it cures it wish you all best.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I can&#x27;t afford to go to the dentist and at the age of 42 I&#x27;m worried about my receding gum line.  But to be honest I don&#x27;t know that I have any gum disease, as I have not been diagnosed.  I do not experience any gum bleeding nor soreness at this time.  The product does not seem to have done me any harm, works like a second toothpaste after my other oral hygiene is completed.  Tastes ok.  My gums seem pink and healthy, but I have not seen any new gum growing back - that was my disappointment.  To be fair I&#x27;ve only used this product a couple weeks, sometimes with herbal remedies more time is needed.  I would say try it if like me you have no dental insurance, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt and may help.  It does keep my breath fresh longer than alcohol based mouthwash or toothpastes - for that reason alone I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought a package deal 3 containers of the paste and 2 mouth rinses. I used it twice a day until two containers and 2 mouth rinses were totally empty. Went to a dentist before I started using these products, was told I periodontal disease  and my teeth were very sensitive. I did&#x27;t like having to brush my teeth four times a day, but I was praying for this to work. I went back to the dentist after using and my gums were not much better. Although the bleeding did not quit entirely it did slow, but my gums had receded worse than they were before I use this product and now I have to have a periodontist look at my gums and teeth. I also now have my gums in the back of my mouth growing over my wisdom teeth and before this product I was told by the dentist my wisdom teeth were fine and there was no need in removing them. Now I have to have them removed. I don&#x27;t understand why they would say this product was natural and then put all these dangerous chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Its good just for releasing pain but my gums are growing back.I have been using it since a week.&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestion.Welcome.</li>
            <li> My husband went to the dentist  because he had bleeding gums but we didn&#x27;t want to pay the cost of the cleaning so he tried the natures smile and it didn&#x27;t stop the bleeding so he went back to a different dentist and the cost of a deep cleaning after insurance was not that bad.  It is costing him 74 dollars per side after insurance.  The cleaning removed the built of plaque that he had and the bleeding stopped after one cleaning.</li>
            <li> this product does not work it also tastes bad, do not buy this and waste money</li>
            <li> nature&#x27;s smile has an F rating with the BBB.  the product doesn&#x27;t work, all the positive reviews are lies....&lt;br /&gt;and amazon only shows positive reviews, so mine probably won&#x27;t make it for long if it does at all...&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve used the product, and it doesn&#x27;t reverse receding gums like they advertise.  which is why i bought it...&lt;br /&gt;check them out on the BBB website....&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t spend your money on lies...</li>
            <li> I have used Nature&#x27;s Smile for a few years now.  My gums were receding and that is no longer a problem.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 weeks and noticed a huge difference!!  Fresher  breath, and no bleeding while brushing.  My teeth are due to be cleaned  next month.  I am looking forward to a good report.  I will keep you   posted.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a last resort after having to schedule surgery for receeding and infected gums. Afer one week the swelling was down and my gums were healing. It really worked. I have used it for 3 weeks now and so far my gums are getting back to normal. I cancelled the surgery for now and I intend to use this product as part of my regular dental routine. My gums may never grow back to where they were when I was young, but they are now pink and healthy.</li>
            <li> After using this product I broke out in hives. Do not swallow any of the product, it is considered a poison.</li>
            <li> I had Surgery for Gum disease which is painful &amp; costly so I tried the it after and the dentist is telling me their is a difference my gums are looking way better neither the dentist or peradontist say they heard of it I smoke they say that doesn&#x27;t help i&#x27;m getting good results so i will keep using it</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my husband as he has gum disease. Very dismayed at the array of unhealthy additives not listed on ad. If you are looking for a miracle this isn&#x27;t it. I suspect all the good reviews are written by employees or friends. Ask your dentist about this product.  When I returned the bottles per their guarantee on October 22, 2012,  I had to continue to send emails to ask for the credit. The return was delivered to Nature&#x27;s Smile on October 24, 2012. A FULL 18 days before the 60 day guarantee expired. When the credit was finally given on NOVEMBER 27, 2012, , Natures Smile Customer Service shorted me 10$ because the refund was issued after the 60 day guarantee period. They had the product in their possession for 18 full days before the 60 day guarantee was up and then did not issue the refund until Nov 27. Their fault the refund was late, mind you, but I got charged for their irresponsible behavior. I am disputing and filing complaints everywhere I can think of. These are not good people to do business with. If I could leave less than one star I would.  BUYER BEWARE!!</li>
            <li> This&#x27;s a good natural way to treat your gums &amp; dental needs.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I really thought it was going to a least help with my gum disease. Oh boy what a mistake! I used it the 1st day morning and night. The taste was almost like a band-aide but that wasn&#x27;t the worst. The second day I used it in the morning and started to notice it was dyeing the backside of my teeth a dark color. I thought oh well as long as it helps with the gum disease. That night I used it again before bed and wow there was not just a little pink in the sink, my mouth was seriously bleeding from one tooth. I stopped using it after that because I also had a tooth really loose. This made me look at the ingredients that are on the bottle not the piece of paper they send with. And what did I find? Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. I can not use that it gives me mouth ulsers. Thanks Natures Smile for the problems!!!!</li>
            <li> This formula is pleasant on the teeth &amp; gum, more like toothpaste.  Easy to use but not sure how effective it is.</li>
            <li> This product does what it claims to do; at least it did for me. Gum swelling and bleeding has been resolved. A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s dentist was going to do a deep root gum cleaning because her measurements were well below normal.  She used this stuff for 2 months then went back to the dentist.  Her gums were healthy, her gums measurements were almost all normal and the dentist did a standard cleaning.  She still uses it and gives it 5 stars.  I tried it and it made my teeth sensitive so I would give 1 or 2 stars. But since the wife is happy, it gets 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Excellence product all redness went away... I would recommend think smile tooth paste and rinse to others. It only took a couple of days to see results.</li>
            <li> this gum balm actually cured my gum disease.</li>
            <li> I read a review containing a full list of the ingredients and was shocked. When I called customer service to verify what is actually in this product the customer service rep couldn&#x27;t tell me. I was very polite and when I tried a little harder to find out the ingredients he rudely told me &amp;#34;just don&#x27;t buy it - we don&#x27;t care - just don&#x27;t buy it&amp;#34; and then he hung up. Based upon his attitude I would have to assume that they don&#x27;t care at all about you or me or any customer. Be Careful.</li>
            <li> Great product for gum disease. It makes my teeth and gums so clean that I substitue it for toothpaste. I ran out and the dentist could tell and made me come back in a month instead of my regular 6 months. I wont run out again.</li>
            <li> terrific product.  helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT! I did before I knew it contains methylparaben ( endocrine disruptor), sodium laurel sulfate ( carcinogen), 2-bromo-2 nitro propane-1-3-diol which sounds nothing like what I want to rub in my mouth! This is falsely advertised as a natural product and it is costing me $15 to pay shipping to receive then return this toxic waste product. Disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;Zero stars. Negative stars. I had to press one star for this to post!!</li>
            <li> I had to give 4* s, as i still didn&#x27;t see miracle with this.Hoping it acts soon.</li>
            <li> I was desperate for this product to work. I read ALL the reviews and thought it sounded possitive. I went ahead with the expensive purchase believing the product would be worth it. I was so very disappointed. What a total wast of money.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have been purchasing this for two years! I haven&#x27;t seen any gum regrowth for me personally but my mouth is fresh and free of bad breath!</li>
            <li> I needed a root cleaning 1200.00  google says s/b 1000.00  I heard of cleaning and periodontal cleaning, never deep root...  So I googled more and found this product..  My gums aren&#x27;t inflamed or  bleeding, the product did leave you mouth feeling really fresh  so far so good ........ I go back to the dentist and will let you know if the periodontal dentist says the bacterial infection is cleaned up a bit... to be continued  thank you Diane</li>
            <li> So far so good. The ache is gone in my gums. I don&#x27;t see any receding of the gums going on so far that has seem to stop. Only used it about a month.</li>
            <li> First of all I was thrilled to find a product that claims to be (ALL NATURAL)also helps with gum disease issues,all for the very resonable cost of approximately $25 plus shipping,so I went ahead and ordered ! 1 months supply (sounded to good to be true)hence only the 1 month!!.After it arrived I looked at the ingredients and was really quite shocked ie Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, 2-bromo-2-nitro propane-1.3 diol???,titanium dioxide !! OK your getting the point !?.Nowhere on the website do they disclose these awful ingredients just the good stuff,it is quite disengenious to put this phoney product out there.Please be aware of what you put in your mouth which gets into your bloodstream etc !!?.I have since found an aternative oral balm that is 100% Natural it is Bentonite Oral Balm (great stuff 100%) NO HIDDEN SURPRISES.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS LABELED AND SOLD AS ALL NATURAL, BUT WHEN YOU GET THE LIST OF INGREDIENTS, YOU SEE IT IS FULL OF ADDED CANCER CAUSING CHEMICALS. THEN THE OWNER HUNG UP ON ME WHEN I ASKED HIM ABOUT THIS. HE WAS SO ANGRY AND RUDE.</li>
            <li> I use this toothpaste all the time. It is my favorite!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t rinse really good this will burn your gum won&#x27;t reorder</li>
