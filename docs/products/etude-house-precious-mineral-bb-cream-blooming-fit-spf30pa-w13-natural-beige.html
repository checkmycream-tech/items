    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This BB cream is just perfect.</li>
            <li>One of the best BB creams ever.</li>
            <li>This was a great buy!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break me out and gives me the perfect coverage that I need.</li>
            <li>Its wonderful on the skin...</li>
            <li>Not the best</li>
            <li>cream of Origins was the best for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>The best part is because it is a BB cream I am now moisturizing my face every morning and getting the SPF protection I need.</li>
            <li>This is the best BB cream/ foundation I have ever worn.</li>
            <li>I also feel that this is the perfect product for people who don&#x27;t feel like spending a lot of time on makeup.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality and price!</li>
            <li>I still use BM, but on occasion when I have used this product, I&#x27;ve received nothing but praise for my &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; skin - at 55 that is a wonderful compliment - as I&#x27;ve never considered myself to have beautiful skin</li>
            <li>It gives my face a flawless coverage... amazing!</li>
            <li>Great packaging.  </li>
            <li>This was offered at a great price, even coming from Korea.  </li>
            <li>So in order to find the perfect korean bb cream I have been trying all the popular cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>This is a great make-up.</li>
            <li>It makes me wonder why they would stop making the one that&#x27;s been a great hit.</li>
            <li>This one gives great coverage and has a 30 SPF.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve heard really great things about this BB cream and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>In case you were wondering.. lol )</li>
            <li>It is a great product.</li>
            <li>This product works great, I will be using this brand of BB cream from now on.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love the Sanitary feature of the pump!!</li>
            <li>I really love wearing this!!</li>
            <li>The coverage is amazing!</li>
            <li>Moisturizing without being greasy, lovely consistency, blends awesome.</li>
            <li>And the product was the perfect shade for my skin :)</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t disturb the concealer at all, it just smoothes on top perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great coverage, but extremely fair in color.</li>
            <li>In comparison with the famous Missha Perfect Cover BB cream:</li>
            <li>bb cream provides easily buildable light/medium coverage, and the shades worked perfectly with my skin.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have fair skin...</li>
            <li>This was a good product</li>
            <li>It is good.</li>
            <li>those needing SPF protection and want a good foundation cover for fair skin, this product is for you.</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t use or try it yet, but I according to.my review its a good Bb cream.</li>
            <li>Through out the day it stays on fairly well</li>
            <li>Has a good selection of shades, which some BB creams don&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li>Really good.</li>
            <li>I can even go to the gym and sweat and still look good.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of giving my face a nice glow and covering up my acne scars.</li>
            <li>I love this make up and am so happy I can continue to buy it here in the United States.  </li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>and I love them!</li>
            <li>The coverage is great and the color matches, so I am pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this here in Korea and the natural beige almost perfectly matches my skin tone; maybe very suitable since I&#x27;m Korean.</li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>So I googled and found a review that liked this brand.</li>
            <li>Also matches skin tone nicely.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really get the &amp;#34;awesome perfect skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I mix it with my foundation to fix the color and the coverage is nice.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice; however, it&#x27;s one shade and not recommended for darker than NC-35.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best thing I have ever done for my skin and complexion.</li>
            <li>The color is really nice and blends very easily.</li>
            <li>This works amazing, has great coverage, and it&#x27;s super lightweight.</li>
            <li>Love this bb cream, its light, feels great on the skin and has spf.</li>
            <li>It has a medium coverage, a light and pleasant scent, and SPF.</li>
            <li>This BB cream is light and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I am korean with a medium complexion, and i tan very easily.</li>
            <li>, closest is #2 Natural Beige (I use a mix of #2 and 3 to get the perfect shade).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think skinfood is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is just nice... :)</li>
            <li>and when I say perfect, I don&#x27;t fool myself into thinking I look natural-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect enhancer but not necessarily a heavy duty coverager/concealer...</li>
            <li>they never fail to make my skin look great.</li>
            <li>The product is very light and airy.</li>
            <li>The transaction was very smooth.</li>
            <li>shades they have are very light, they&#x27;re lightest shade made me look like a porcelain doll.</li>
            <li>This is an ok bb cream.</li>
            <li>Product is great as it gives me a nice natural look</li>
            <li>sheer amount of product one gets with the Etude House bb cream is the best part.</li>
            <li>I was iffy on the price for a product I wasn&#x27;t sure I would truly like, but 50mL of product is a ton.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried many BB creams before this</li>
            <li>I do love it and recommend it, just maybe during winter time.</li>
            <li>This BB cream has surpassed a lot of the American BB creams sold in the market and I am so happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>I would use this product more in the winter time than summer, however I used this product while playing tennis</li>
            <li>I love this BB Cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this product -</li>
            <li>Also I felt that it works better than Loreal, garnier, and maybelline.</li>
            <li>If you love BB creams, this needs to be in your collection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i need to add Shiseido refining moisturizer on top... just to help my skin not looking too dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Jart&#x27;s silver BB for so many years</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to find anything to replace it.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better with just some moisturizer.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>I ended up giving this to my sister who has more sebum/oil than I and does better with her skin than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Can be used on oily skin in the winter time when your skin is more dry.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I was so in love with this product, until the warmer season came.</li>
            <li>I will see if I like that one better.</li>
            <li>Works really well, and color correction is great.</li>
            <li>We will be purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li>It is okay but not my favorite bb cream</li>
            <li>Next time I might get one shade darker and play around with both of them to see what works best.</li>
            <li>Liked the light feel of this cream.  </li>
            <li>Also, buy from a reputable Ebay sellers.  </li>
            <li>But since we can&#x27;t get our hands on, we are paying a bit more.  </li>
            <li>but this one matches better.</li>
            <li>THere&#x27;s one thing i don&#x27;t like about most BB cream</li>
            <li>the thing is, it gets soooo much better if you mix it with some liquid foundation / moisturizer when you apply it.</li>
            <li>I have been doing that with this one as well because I love how this BB cream can hide blotchy spots on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m left with an awesome glow from the pearl extract.</li>
            <li>I prefer BB creams so much more than foundations</li>
            <li>The lady at the shop told me that this color (W13) was the color that ran the most \\&quot;natural.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s definitely more dewier than demi-matte though; leans more towards glowy than matte, basically.</li>
            <li>I love love the packaging (except the pump of course)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so durable and extremely cute.</li>
            <li>it does have a tendency to transfer which is often a factor in makeup than leans more dewey.</li>
            <li>So its up to you on how you see it :).</li>
            <li>A friend of mine told me about this great quality product that is reasonable priced.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it match my skin tone perfectly, it leaves my skin looking like a Hollywood makeup artist applied my makeup</li>
            <li>Everything is okay</li>
            <li>so I think I can confidently write a review.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive the right color, but I gave it to a friend &amp; she loved it.</li>
            <li>bb cream was pretty good.</li>
            <li>and I love how dewy this makes me look without settling into fine lines.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s perfect, in fact I don&#x27;t look like or feel like I am wearing any product at all, and don&#x27;t agree with those that says it comes off easy - I&#x27;ve worn in all day, and still had to wash off, and I don&#x27;t even really use that much.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and need extra protection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great product, and my only reason for giving 4 stars is that my Holika Holika cream does a better job of managing my oily skin, and has slightly better longevity.</li>
            <li>Etude House Precious Mineral #13 is a bit light for me.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is good for people who have NC20-NC25 skintone or cool tone, but you can always use a bronzer to make it match the right skintone.</li>
            <li>I tan easily</li>
            <li>I dislike how easily it comes off.</li>
            <li>As for those that say it comes off easily I can&#x27;t agree.</li>
            <li>Just as others have said before me, this stuff comes off easily.</li>
            <li>And it smells alright at first but afterwards kind of starts to smell like..</li>
            <li>My skin tone instantly looks even, I have beautiful color</li>
            <li>They all go on every smooth and easy to blend (I use stippling brush).  </li>
            <li>To me it feels light on the skin</li>
            <li>It covers light blemishes, but nothing else.</li>
            <li>This product was a bit too light for me.</li>
            <li>Both of these creams are great, personally I prefer my Holika Holika</li>
            <li>I was worried they would be too light, as I have light, but olive toned, skin.</li>
            <li>Great make up for a sensitive skin, I&#x27;m very allergic to so many things and these product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, really.</li>
            <li>:) I actually ordered a bright fit version W13 though</li>
            <li>but somehow i received the Blooming Fit version instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its goes on smooth...</li>
            <li>just lightly dust powder over it</li>
            <li>After applying it you will need to wait  a few minutes until it settles in, the result is a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be such a great product.</li>
            <li>it have a light scent and it covered all the redness in my face.</li>
            <li>For light coverage, Skin 79.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a seriously fast process and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>At 25 these two things are both really important to me.</li>
            <li>light texture.</li>
            <li>However, I have found that a light dusting of translucent powder helps it stay in place.</li>
            <li>The product smells so clean and feels light on my skin...</li>
            <li>,,most importantly very reasonable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what it says it does which is my favorite part.</li>
            <li>So far, i love it!</li>
            <li>I originally received a trial size of this BB cream and loved it so ordered the larger size.  </li>
            <li>Came right on time!</li>
            <li>Not only does this Etude House BB cream provide great coverage, it REALLY protects against the sun!</li>
            <li>Great price, shipping as expected.</li>
            <li>Then apply this over a facial cream and it gives a good coverage.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s medium to full coverage as well.</li>
            <li>Set it with a powder, and BAM completely full coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This BB cream is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>and I am a fair skinned blonde.  </li>
            <li>product is buildable medium to full</li>
            <li>Too Face gives a dewy/sheer/natural look and good for yellow tone</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if I can express how much I love this stuff and</li>
            <li>The product does seem to improve the texture of my skin over time and usage of the product though so its not a bad quality BB cream at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this BB cream with my purchase of Missha&#x27;s Super Aqua Cleansing Foam.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the coverage and the smooth, soft finish.</li>
            <li>I am super prone to breakouts and I have combination skin.</li>
            <li>The bb cream isn&#x27;t super dewey nor is it super matte.</li>
            <li>Loved it right away, and it&#x27;s a big amount for the price.</li>
            <li>The Missha one is a bit more thick (hence the better coverage) and is quite nice</li>
            <li>M Perfect Cover BB cream has a heavier consistency, offers more coverage, and has 5 color options, closest is #23 Natural Beige (I use #23, which is still a tad light and is heavily scented!!).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also helps in photos if you are going for that dewy look but does not look good in person if you have dry skin and visible pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks like a really fancy girly type of cute and not like a cheap kind of cute if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>Also, it has not created any blemishes so far which is a good sign since my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I think this product is great, but in humidity weather it feels a little bit greasy</li>
            <li>I bought this from SeoulGlamor and they were nice enough to add in freebies (such as the nymph aura volumizer by etude house - a liquid applied with bb cream or foundation to give that coveted \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; glow) which made my Korean cosmetic experience all the better!</li>
            <li>: it doesn&#x27;t make my skin perfect, but it makes it looks natural with little effort.</li>
            <li>It gives great coverage without a heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>The scent is extremely light and this is something I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Skinfood&#x27;s Mushroom BB cream has a heavier consistency, offers more coverage, and has 2 color options,</li>
            <li>Good product, seller was a fast shipper, got the product around a week later.</li>
            <li>I really just cannot stress how much this stuff has helped my face while also giving me better coverage than any foundation</li>
            <li>Covers nicely without big buildup.  </li>
            <li>Few months ago, after all the hype about BB creams, I bought Missha Perfect BB Cream #23, Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream #13, and Skin 79 pink label BB Cream (Ebay seller in Korea).  </li>
            <li>, i&#x27;m THE rare, dark-skinned Korean if you can believe. )</li>
            <li>The packaging is suitable for the product to not dry out.</li>
            <li>It has a nice full coverage that covers most of my imperfections and it doesn&#x27;t feel too thick on the skin.</li>
            <li>I think I chose the right shade.  </li>
            <li>you will find a right products.</li>
            <li>My skin is highly sensitive to most lotions and creams and I have never been able to use face products for more than a few days in a row.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to smooth back, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel that this product will sit on top of your face very very naturally and really reduce the appearance of your pores.</li>
            <li>It also feels very light which I love because a lot of liquids feel heavy and looks cakey/flakey.</li>
            <li>Originally I&#x27;ve been with Etude House for a while, except I&#x27;ve been using their older BB Cream - -</li>
            <li>have quite a dry skin, so i&#x27;m just kinda glad that this BB cream Blooming Fit actually makes my skin more</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I am very very acne prone and have quite a bit of redness</li>
            <li>My skin is very pale and this blends in very nicely.</li>
            <li>This is my first advemture with BB cream.  </li>
            <li>However, the first day I used it, I broke out all over my face.</li>
            <li>The natural beige was also still too light for me..</li>
            <li>so it was really fast!</li>
            <li>With about 2 minutes of oxidation time, this cream settles more into your actual skin tone.</li>
            <li>I bought the Natural Beige color and even though it&#x27;s a bit light for my skin, it blends pretty well</li>
            <li>I fell IN LOVE with it instantly!</li>
            <li>only downfall was that I thought it would have better coverage and after wearing it for a while (I would say 8 hours)</li>
            <li>When I first put on this BB Cream</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with this</li>
            <li>I was really scared at first to try bb cream, but this product was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It really does what it says and it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>B/c of popularity of Missha, I used it first.  </li>
            <li>but if you add the shipping it&#x27;d be basically $20 bucks so in total, your paying 7 or 8 more bucks for it.</li>
            <li>but if I were to just wear one of the two, I would most likely reach for the Etude House one.</li>
            <li>This product works better for me than the American BB creams.</li>
            <li>i have pretty oil face</li>
            <li>the only thing is i wish it has better coverage</li>
            <li>Overall, I absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was able to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li>I never smell it throughout the day and you really have to put it right under your nose and sniff to take a smell out of it.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m liking the Missha Signature one, or my original go-to:</li>
            <li>but this is by far my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this after watching eatyourkimchi&#x27;s Martina review it (also after seeing SHINee endorse it, haha), and it pretty much works!</li>
            <li>, Korean makeup is very pale, and while I am usually a FAIR in American makeup, I am a MEDIUM in Korean, so make sure you take that into account when ordering and go a shade darker.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer said, you can pretty much scrape it off with your nails if you scratch your face (and I&#x27;m not used to wearing makeup</li>
            <li>I first thought maybe I put on too much of my moisturizer</li>
            <li>But it is super light and it does not clump around my dry spots or blemishes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s calming down now, and honestly it may be just that finals stress kicked in, or</li>
            <li>I hope I&#x27;m able to keep purchasing it (since I&#x27;m in the US) for a long time coming!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing at covering blemishes without oddly caking up around them like foundation tends to do.</li>
            <li>Any spots that the cream doesn&#x27;t cover so well, such as acne, are easily covered by concealer.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s really easy to blend</li>
            <li>It does help my face to stay a little moisturized as the day goes by and adds that nice dewiness I favor.</li>
            <li>great build-able coverage for a BB, natural beige is a good color for my skin (fair with pink undertones) and blends well, it actually dries unlike a lot of other BBs, fresh smelling, makes makeup application super fast in the morning, long wearing, doesn&#x27;t make my acne worse and camouflages quite a bit, i would recommend it and would buy it again</li>
            <li>Natural Skin(I use #2 Natural Skin, which is still a bit light).</li>
            <li>I am big into makeup, and lately it seems that Korean beauty products are incredibly talked about.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>but I have very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blotting is something I have to do with any makeup though, as I tend to have a very oily T-Zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really reccomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>helped me to keep my skin fresh and looking young.</li>
            <li>I really do like the product, however the shade didn&#x27;t match my skintone.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>way better than American BBs in that it&#x27;s nice and thick and covers like a foundation vs a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I started to really like using Etudes House bb cream.</li>
            <li>And I was really dissapointed when I learned that Etude House discontinued &amp;#34;bright fit&amp;#34</li>
            <li>your skin gets really oily.</li>
            <li>really-</li>
            <li>It also delivered superrrr fast which</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see it as feasible to spend a lot of time getting ready in the morning</li>
            <li>$15.50 is definitely reasonable</li>
            <li>Gives nice even coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>and I have some kind of blemish everyday.</li>
            <li>Plus of Missha BB cream, high SPF (maybe that why it seems more oily).&lt;br /&gt;In summary, for medium coverage Missha (if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrant), Etude House (if you don&#x27;t have dry skin).  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not a fan of the strong smell and grey undertones..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited because i finally got my bb cream.</li>
            <li>I was originally using Banila Co&#x27;s Be Touched BB cream in Yellow Beige, but they discontinued the color.</li>
            <li>This product was a lot more moisturizing than other reviews had led me to believe.  </li>
            <li>One other thing is that (and this goes for most BB creams)</li>
            <li>If only it came in a bigger size because I will use it up very quickly!</li>
            <li>It is super cheap which I like, most high quality BB Creams in America are expensive.</li>
            <li>I have used other BB creams (mostly Missha BB products) and found them OK, but a bit greasy and heavy.  </li>
            <li>I do appear much more white-ish, and slightly washed out.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;s not applied smoothly, and sometimes it gets too dry</li>
            <li>definitely reliable and will purchase more from them in the future.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve introduced this same Precious Mineral line but with different name like &amp;#34;cotton fit&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;bright fit&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Either too orange or too pink or too pale but this one is a great match ( I got honey beige ) and it finishes Dewey but with some matte primer</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>high coverage.</li>
            <li>It also looks more natural than the other BB creams I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>BB cream can also highlight any dryness on your face, but some days I just mix in a little of my favorite moisturizer and it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>I normally use Revlon Colorstay, which has 30mL of product.</li>
            <li>i love the satin finish it gives my skin, it gives me a very natural glow, and as pale as I am it gives me a bit of a tint.</li>
            <li>not really sure what were the differences but the Natural Beige W13, at first, i was worried since it didn&#x27;t look that fit with my skin tone, it kinda a little bit light in color (when i first applied)</li>
            <li>, i used maybelline before, it just make it worse, but this one at least wont make your face look shinny, and the SPF was pretty awesome!</li>
            <li>It looks like I need to start looking for a new BB cream...</li>
            <li>I would also recommend against this if you live in a hot/humid climate.  </li>
            <li>It feels very lightweight on the skin, and hasn&#x27;t caused any major breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been very interested in trying Korean BB creams for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I have never tried BB Creams before because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>the shipment was very fast, especially its come from south korea.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and last long.</li>
            <li>Also bought Smash Box BB cream and tried many other American brands BB creams (Dior, Boscia, Too Face, Tarte).  </li>
            <li>Even though, you can build for more coverage, but I&#x27;d not recommended b/c it will look very heavy.  </li>
            <li>Dior BB creams are more of yellow tone and dark.  </li>
            <li>You get double the amount of an average high-end foundation at a much more wallet-friendly price.</li>
            <li>B007BYPCPG Etude House Nymph Aura Volumer #3 Transparent Nymph Aura 25g]] does help the look of this BB Cream in CERTAIN areas (as you can see in chichibanban blogspot listed above).</li>
            <li>The other BB creams I have used do not provide adequate coverage or the SPF protection claimed.  </li>
            <li>texture is a more of a liquid than cream, and it&#x27;s hard to control the amount you get with the pump.</li>
            <li>but my face has never been clear or one color.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s finishes really natural.</li>
            <li>I gave it a four because my skin is a bit oily to begin with and already has the natural shine, but this BB cream also has a glowing to it.</li>
            <li>So far I have tried, Missha, Skin79 (hotpink one), skin79 diamond, and  skinfood aloe bbcream</li>
            <li>far among the cheaper bbcreams</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, i didn&#x27;t have breakout from the bb cream either.&lt;br /&gt;Natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the Nymph Aura Volumer acts like real sebum and that I finally can achieve the look I have seen this give to others!&lt;br /&gt;http://chichibanban.blogspot.com/2014/04/etude-house-nymph-aura-volumer-3-dry.html</li>
            <li>I have to use a tinted powder that matches my natural skin tone as a finishing powder to get rid of the tacky-ness and adjust the color.</li>
            <li>But once I put powder on, the shine completely went away.</li>
            <li>I ordered Natural.</li>
            <li>I am Korean and I&#x27;ve tried almost every brand&#x27;s BB cream so far.</li>
            <li>(So far BB ?</li>
            <li>(I normally use Bare Minerals as my makeup and while I like it there are a lot of steps before I get the look I want.)</li>
            <li>All in all, I really really really recommend this product and you should definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried at first because it created this super &amp;#34;oily shine&amp;#34; across my ENTIRE face.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the product has pretty great coverage, but I may have chosen either the wrong shade where it comes off TOO light.  </li>
            <li>Next I will try Hanskin and Dr. Jart, which are definitely more expensive, but I want to see if they are worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light-medium shade with yellow undertones normally.</li>
            <li>I have combination, normal to oil skin, thus, make-up only lasts about 4 hours, even though I work indoor</li>
            <li>It has an okay SPF (SPF 30 PA+++) but definitely less than a lot of other BB creams out there.</li>
            <li>I know they&#x27;re eager to produce new lines constantly</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to much, I put three tiny pea sized dots and it covered my entire face.</li>
            <li>it provides semi-sheer coverage when spread thinly and almost opaque coverage when concentrated on \\&quot;problem areas.\\&quot; Great product for gals (and guys) with uneven and blemished skin.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; coverage (I used Laura Bare Mineral and Mercier tinted moisturizure for a long time).  </li>
            <li>Gets a bit too oily looking if too much is used (and by too much, I mean like 5/8 of a pump instead of 1/2 of a pump, so it&#x27;s difficult to control), but otherwise good!</li>
            <li>and I general makes me feel like a million bucks!</li>
            <li>(nothing an extra minute of concealing and powdering can&#x27;t fix), BUT it looks really natural once it sets (the length of my commute!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing major though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;- Not for use if you have very oily or very dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried lots of others that haven&#x27;t worked and are looking to try something different than what is on the North American market, I highly you suggest you give this a try.</li>
            <li>give the product an average review because although it was not right for my skin, I felt that it may work better for Caucasian skin possibly.  </li>
            <li>I like Etude House&#x27;s products in general.</li>
            <li>Peach Sake BB cream has a similar consistency, offers lighter coverage, and has 5 color options</li>
            <li>and I use it everyday, but I was looking for something economical.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t have much oil) or if it&#x27;s how much they&#x27;re using (you really only need a little!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, not gonna lie, but it&#x27;s too pale for my skin (which is probAbly my fault) and it feels and looks dusty on my skin.</li>
            <li>although using Bare Minerals has definitely improved my skin.</li>
            <li>Lately, I have gravitated toward this BB cream over my Holika Holika Pore Clearing Petit BB cream because I can just slap it on really quickly in the morning, even though it doesn&#x27;t fully cover all the redness</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This BB cream is just perfect.</li>
            <li> One of the best BB creams ever.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break me out and gives me the perfect coverage that I need.</li>
            <li> Its wonderful on the skin...</li>
            <li> Not the best</li>
            <li> cream of Origins was the best for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> The best part is because it is a BB cream I am now moisturizing my face every morning and getting the SPF protection I need.</li>
            <li> This is the best BB cream/ foundation I have ever worn.</li>
            <li> I also feel that this is the perfect product for people who don&#x27;t feel like spending a lot of time on makeup.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality and price!</li>
            <li> I still use BM, but on occasion when I have used this product, I&#x27;ve received nothing but praise for my &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; skin - at 55 that is a wonderful compliment - as I&#x27;ve never considered myself to have beautiful skin</li>
            <li> It gives my face a flawless coverage... amazing!</li>
            <li> Great packaging.  </li>
            <li> This was offered at a great price, even coming from Korea.  </li>
            <li> So in order to find the perfect korean bb cream I have been trying all the popular cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> This is a great make-up.</li>
            <li> It makes me wonder why they would stop making the one that&#x27;s been a great hit.</li>
            <li> This one gives great coverage and has a 30 SPF.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve heard really great things about this BB cream and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> In case you were wondering.. lol )</li>
            <li> It is a great product.</li>
            <li> This product works great, I will be using this brand of BB cream from now on.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love the Sanitary feature of the pump!!</li>
            <li> I really love wearing this!!</li>
            <li> The coverage is amazing!</li>
            <li> Moisturizing without being greasy, lovely consistency, blends awesome.</li>
            <li> And the product was the perfect shade for my skin :)</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t disturb the concealer at all, it just smoothes on top perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, but extremely fair in color.</li>
            <li> In comparison with the famous Missha Perfect Cover BB cream:</li>
            <li> bb cream provides easily buildable light/medium coverage, and the shades worked perfectly with my skin.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have fair skin...</li>
            <li> This was a good product</li>
            <li> It is good.</li>
            <li> those needing SPF protection and want a good foundation cover for fair skin, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use or try it yet, but I according to.my review its a good Bb cream.</li>
            <li> Through out the day it stays on fairly well</li>
            <li> Has a good selection of shades, which some BB creams don&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li> Really good.</li>
            <li> I can even go to the gym and sweat and still look good.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of giving my face a nice glow and covering up my acne scars.</li>
            <li> I love this make up and am so happy I can continue to buy it here in the United States.  </li>
            <li> I just love it!</li>
            <li> and I love them!</li>
            <li> The coverage is great and the color matches, so I am pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this here in Korea and the natural beige almost perfectly matches my skin tone; maybe very suitable since I&#x27;m Korean.</li>
            <li> amazing.</li>
            <li> So I googled and found a review that liked this brand.</li>
            <li> Also matches skin tone nicely.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get the &amp;#34;awesome perfect skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I mix it with my foundation to fix the color and the coverage is nice.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice; however, it&#x27;s one shade and not recommended for darker than NC-35.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best thing I have ever done for my skin and complexion.</li>
            <li> The color is really nice and blends very easily.</li>
            <li> This works amazing, has great coverage, and it&#x27;s super lightweight.</li>
            <li> Love this bb cream, its light, feels great on the skin and has spf.</li>
            <li> It has a medium coverage, a light and pleasant scent, and SPF.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is light and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I am korean with a medium complexion, and i tan very easily.</li>
            <li> , closest is #2 Natural Beige (I use a mix of #2 and 3 to get the perfect shade).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think skinfood is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is just nice... :)</li>
            <li> and when I say perfect, I don&#x27;t fool myself into thinking I look natural-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect enhancer but not necessarily a heavy duty coverager/concealer...</li>
            <li> they never fail to make my skin look great.</li>
            <li> The product is very light and airy.</li>
            <li> The transaction was very smooth.</li>
            <li> shades they have are very light, they&#x27;re lightest shade made me look like a porcelain doll.</li>
            <li> This is an ok bb cream.</li>
            <li> Product is great as it gives me a nice natural look</li>
            <li> sheer amount of product one gets with the Etude House bb cream is the best part.</li>
            <li> I was iffy on the price for a product I wasn&#x27;t sure I would truly like, but 50mL of product is a ton.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many BB creams before this</li>
            <li> I do love it and recommend it, just maybe during winter time.</li>
            <li> This BB cream has surpassed a lot of the American BB creams sold in the market and I am so happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I would use this product more in the winter time than summer, however I used this product while playing tennis</li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream.  </li>
            <li> I love this product -</li>
            <li> Also I felt that it works better than Loreal, garnier, and maybelline.</li>
            <li> If you love BB creams, this needs to be in your collection.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i need to add Shiseido refining moisturizer on top... just to help my skin not looking too dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Jart&#x27;s silver BB for so many years</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to find anything to replace it.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better with just some moisturizer.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I ended up giving this to my sister who has more sebum/oil than I and does better with her skin than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Can be used on oily skin in the winter time when your skin is more dry.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I was so in love with this product, until the warmer season came.</li>
            <li> I will see if I like that one better.</li>
            <li> Works really well, and color correction is great.</li>
            <li> We will be purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li> It is okay but not my favorite bb cream</li>
            <li> Next time I might get one shade darker and play around with both of them to see what works best.</li>
            <li> Liked the light feel of this cream.  </li>
            <li> Also, buy from a reputable Ebay sellers.  </li>
            <li> But since we can&#x27;t get our hands on, we are paying a bit more.  </li>
            <li> but this one matches better.</li>
            <li> THere&#x27;s one thing i don&#x27;t like about most BB cream</li>
            <li> the thing is, it gets soooo much better if you mix it with some liquid foundation / moisturizer when you apply it.</li>
            <li> I have been doing that with this one as well because I love how this BB cream can hide blotchy spots on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left with an awesome glow from the pearl extract.</li>
            <li> I prefer BB creams so much more than foundations</li>
            <li> The lady at the shop told me that this color (W13) was the color that ran the most \\&quot;natural.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s definitely more dewier than demi-matte though; leans more towards glowy than matte, basically.</li>
            <li> I love love the packaging (except the pump of course)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so durable and extremely cute.</li>
            <li> it does have a tendency to transfer which is often a factor in makeup than leans more dewey.</li>
            <li> So its up to you on how you see it :).</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about this great quality product that is reasonable priced.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it match my skin tone perfectly, it leaves my skin looking like a Hollywood makeup artist applied my makeup</li>
            <li> Everything is okay</li>
            <li> so I think I can confidently write a review.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the right color, but I gave it to a friend &amp; she loved it.</li>
            <li> bb cream was pretty good.</li>
            <li> and I love how dewy this makes me look without settling into fine lines.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s perfect, in fact I don&#x27;t look like or feel like I am wearing any product at all, and don&#x27;t agree with those that says it comes off easy - I&#x27;ve worn in all day, and still had to wash off, and I don&#x27;t even really use that much.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and need extra protection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a great product, and my only reason for giving 4 stars is that my Holika Holika cream does a better job of managing my oily skin, and has slightly better longevity.</li>
            <li> Etude House Precious Mineral #13 is a bit light for me.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is good for people who have NC20-NC25 skintone or cool tone, but you can always use a bronzer to make it match the right skintone.</li>
            <li> I tan easily</li>
            <li> I dislike how easily it comes off.</li>
            <li> As for those that say it comes off easily I can&#x27;t agree.</li>
            <li> Just as others have said before me, this stuff comes off easily.</li>
            <li> And it smells alright at first but afterwards kind of starts to smell like..</li>
            <li> My skin tone instantly looks even, I have beautiful color</li>
            <li> They all go on every smooth and easy to blend (I use stippling brush).  </li>
            <li> To me it feels light on the skin</li>
            <li> It covers light blemishes, but nothing else.</li>
            <li> This product was a bit too light for me.</li>
            <li> Both of these creams are great, personally I prefer my Holika Holika</li>
            <li> I was worried they would be too light, as I have light, but olive toned, skin.</li>
            <li> Great make up for a sensitive skin, I&#x27;m very allergic to so many things and these product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, really.</li>
            <li> :) I actually ordered a bright fit version W13 though</li>
            <li> but somehow i received the Blooming Fit version instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its goes on smooth...</li>
            <li> just lightly dust powder over it</li>
            <li> After applying it you will need to wait  a few minutes until it settles in, the result is a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be such a great product.</li>
            <li> it have a light scent and it covered all the redness in my face.</li>
            <li> For light coverage, Skin 79.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a seriously fast process and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> At 25 these two things are both really important to me.</li>
            <li> light texture.</li>
            <li> However, I have found that a light dusting of translucent powder helps it stay in place.</li>
            <li> The product smells so clean and feels light on my skin...</li>
            <li> ,,most importantly very reasonable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it says it does which is my favorite part.</li>
            <li> So far, i love it!</li>
            <li> I originally received a trial size of this BB cream and loved it so ordered the larger size.  </li>
            <li> Came right on time!</li>
            <li> Not only does this Etude House BB cream provide great coverage, it REALLY protects against the sun!</li>
            <li> Great price, shipping as expected.</li>
            <li> Then apply this over a facial cream and it gives a good coverage.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s medium to full coverage as well.</li>
            <li> Set it with a powder, and BAM completely full coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This BB cream is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> and I am a fair skinned blonde.  </li>
            <li> product is buildable medium to full</li>
            <li> Too Face gives a dewy/sheer/natural look and good for yellow tone</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if I can express how much I love this stuff and</li>
            <li> The product does seem to improve the texture of my skin over time and usage of the product though so its not a bad quality BB cream at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this BB cream with my purchase of Missha&#x27;s Super Aqua Cleansing Foam.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the coverage and the smooth, soft finish.</li>
            <li> I am super prone to breakouts and I have combination skin.</li>
            <li> The bb cream isn&#x27;t super dewey nor is it super matte.</li>
            <li> Loved it right away, and it&#x27;s a big amount for the price.</li>
            <li> The Missha one is a bit more thick (hence the better coverage) and is quite nice</li>
            <li> M Perfect Cover BB cream has a heavier consistency, offers more coverage, and has 5 color options, closest is #23 Natural Beige (I use #23, which is still a tad light and is heavily scented!!).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also helps in photos if you are going for that dewy look but does not look good in person if you have dry skin and visible pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like a really fancy girly type of cute and not like a cheap kind of cute if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Also, it has not created any blemishes so far which is a good sign since my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great, but in humidity weather it feels a little bit greasy</li>
            <li> I bought this from SeoulGlamor and they were nice enough to add in freebies (such as the nymph aura volumizer by etude house - a liquid applied with bb cream or foundation to give that coveted \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; glow) which made my Korean cosmetic experience all the better!</li>
            <li> : it doesn&#x27;t make my skin perfect, but it makes it looks natural with little effort.</li>
            <li> It gives great coverage without a heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> The scent is extremely light and this is something I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Skinfood&#x27;s Mushroom BB cream has a heavier consistency, offers more coverage, and has 2 color options,</li>
            <li> Good product, seller was a fast shipper, got the product around a week later.</li>
            <li> I really just cannot stress how much this stuff has helped my face while also giving me better coverage than any foundation</li>
            <li> Covers nicely without big buildup.  </li>
            <li> Few months ago, after all the hype about BB creams, I bought Missha Perfect BB Cream #23, Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream #13, and Skin 79 pink label BB Cream (Ebay seller in Korea).  </li>
            <li> , i&#x27;m THE rare, dark-skinned Korean if you can believe. )</li>
            <li> The packaging is suitable for the product to not dry out.</li>
            <li> It has a nice full coverage that covers most of my imperfections and it doesn&#x27;t feel too thick on the skin.</li>
            <li> I think I chose the right shade.  </li>
            <li> you will find a right products.</li>
            <li> My skin is highly sensitive to most lotions and creams and I have never been able to use face products for more than a few days in a row.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to smooth back, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel that this product will sit on top of your face very very naturally and really reduce the appearance of your pores.</li>
            <li> It also feels very light which I love because a lot of liquids feel heavy and looks cakey/flakey.</li>
            <li> Originally I&#x27;ve been with Etude House for a while, except I&#x27;ve been using their older BB Cream - -</li>
            <li> have quite a dry skin, so i&#x27;m just kinda glad that this BB cream Blooming Fit actually makes my skin more</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> I am very very acne prone and have quite a bit of redness</li>
            <li> My skin is very pale and this blends in very nicely.</li>
            <li> This is my first advemture with BB cream.  </li>
            <li> However, the first day I used it, I broke out all over my face.</li>
            <li> The natural beige was also still too light for me..</li>
            <li> so it was really fast!</li>
            <li> With about 2 minutes of oxidation time, this cream settles more into your actual skin tone.</li>
            <li> I bought the Natural Beige color and even though it&#x27;s a bit light for my skin, it blends pretty well</li>
            <li> I fell IN LOVE with it instantly!</li>
            <li> only downfall was that I thought it would have better coverage and after wearing it for a while (I would say 8 hours)</li>
            <li> When I first put on this BB Cream</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with this</li>
            <li> I was really scared at first to try bb cream, but this product was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says and it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> B/c of popularity of Missha, I used it first.  </li>
            <li> but if you add the shipping it&#x27;d be basically $20 bucks so in total, your paying 7 or 8 more bucks for it.</li>
            <li> but if I were to just wear one of the two, I would most likely reach for the Etude House one.</li>
            <li> This product works better for me than the American BB creams.</li>
            <li> i have pretty oil face</li>
            <li> the only thing is i wish it has better coverage</li>
            <li> Overall, I absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was able to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> I never smell it throughout the day and you really have to put it right under your nose and sniff to take a smell out of it.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m liking the Missha Signature one, or my original go-to:</li>
            <li> but this is by far my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching eatyourkimchi&#x27;s Martina review it (also after seeing SHINee endorse it, haha), and it pretty much works!</li>
            <li> , Korean makeup is very pale, and while I am usually a FAIR in American makeup, I am a MEDIUM in Korean, so make sure you take that into account when ordering and go a shade darker.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, you can pretty much scrape it off with your nails if you scratch your face (and I&#x27;m not used to wearing makeup</li>
            <li> I first thought maybe I put on too much of my moisturizer</li>
            <li> But it is super light and it does not clump around my dry spots or blemishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s calming down now, and honestly it may be just that finals stress kicked in, or</li>
            <li> I hope I&#x27;m able to keep purchasing it (since I&#x27;m in the US) for a long time coming!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing at covering blemishes without oddly caking up around them like foundation tends to do.</li>
            <li> Any spots that the cream doesn&#x27;t cover so well, such as acne, are easily covered by concealer.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s really easy to blend</li>
            <li> It does help my face to stay a little moisturized as the day goes by and adds that nice dewiness I favor.</li>
            <li> great build-able coverage for a BB, natural beige is a good color for my skin (fair with pink undertones) and blends well, it actually dries unlike a lot of other BBs, fresh smelling, makes makeup application super fast in the morning, long wearing, doesn&#x27;t make my acne worse and camouflages quite a bit, i would recommend it and would buy it again</li>
            <li> Natural Skin(I use #2 Natural Skin, which is still a bit light).</li>
            <li> I am big into makeup, and lately it seems that Korean beauty products are incredibly talked about.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> but I have very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blotting is something I have to do with any makeup though, as I tend to have a very oily T-Zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really reccomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> helped me to keep my skin fresh and looking young.</li>
            <li> I really do like the product, however the shade didn&#x27;t match my skintone.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> way better than American BBs in that it&#x27;s nice and thick and covers like a foundation vs a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I started to really like using Etudes House bb cream.</li>
            <li> And I was really dissapointed when I learned that Etude House discontinued &amp;#34;bright fit&amp;#34</li>
            <li> your skin gets really oily.</li>
            <li> really-</li>
            <li> It also delivered superrrr fast which</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see it as feasible to spend a lot of time getting ready in the morning</li>
            <li> $15.50 is definitely reasonable</li>
            <li> Gives nice even coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> and I have some kind of blemish everyday.</li>
            <li> Plus of Missha BB cream, high SPF (maybe that why it seems more oily).&lt;br /&gt;In summary, for medium coverage Missha (if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrant), Etude House (if you don&#x27;t have dry skin).  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a fan of the strong smell and grey undertones..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited because i finally got my bb cream.</li>
            <li> I was originally using Banila Co&#x27;s Be Touched BB cream in Yellow Beige, but they discontinued the color.</li>
            <li> This product was a lot more moisturizing than other reviews had led me to believe.  </li>
            <li> One other thing is that (and this goes for most BB creams)</li>
            <li> If only it came in a bigger size because I will use it up very quickly!</li>
            <li> It is super cheap which I like, most high quality BB Creams in America are expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used other BB creams (mostly Missha BB products) and found them OK, but a bit greasy and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I do appear much more white-ish, and slightly washed out.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s not applied smoothly, and sometimes it gets too dry</li>
            <li> definitely reliable and will purchase more from them in the future.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve introduced this same Precious Mineral line but with different name like &amp;#34;cotton fit&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;bright fit&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Either too orange or too pink or too pale but this one is a great match ( I got honey beige ) and it finishes Dewey but with some matte primer</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> high coverage.</li>
            <li> It also looks more natural than the other BB creams I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> BB cream can also highlight any dryness on your face, but some days I just mix in a little of my favorite moisturizer and it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I normally use Revlon Colorstay, which has 30mL of product.</li>
            <li> i love the satin finish it gives my skin, it gives me a very natural glow, and as pale as I am it gives me a bit of a tint.</li>
            <li> not really sure what were the differences but the Natural Beige W13, at first, i was worried since it didn&#x27;t look that fit with my skin tone, it kinda a little bit light in color (when i first applied)</li>
            <li> , i used maybelline before, it just make it worse, but this one at least wont make your face look shinny, and the SPF was pretty awesome!</li>
            <li> It looks like I need to start looking for a new BB cream...</li>
            <li> I would also recommend against this if you live in a hot/humid climate.  </li>
            <li> It feels very lightweight on the skin, and hasn&#x27;t caused any major breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been very interested in trying Korean BB creams for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have never tried BB Creams before because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> the shipment was very fast, especially its come from south korea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and last long.</li>
            <li> Also bought Smash Box BB cream and tried many other American brands BB creams (Dior, Boscia, Too Face, Tarte).  </li>
            <li> Even though, you can build for more coverage, but I&#x27;d not recommended b/c it will look very heavy.  </li>
            <li> Dior BB creams are more of yellow tone and dark.  </li>
            <li> You get double the amount of an average high-end foundation at a much more wallet-friendly price.</li>
            <li> B007BYPCPG Etude House Nymph Aura Volumer #3 Transparent Nymph Aura 25g]] does help the look of this BB Cream in CERTAIN areas (as you can see in chichibanban blogspot listed above).</li>
            <li> The other BB creams I have used do not provide adequate coverage or the SPF protection claimed.  </li>
            <li> texture is a more of a liquid than cream, and it&#x27;s hard to control the amount you get with the pump.</li>
            <li> but my face has never been clear or one color.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s finishes really natural.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four because my skin is a bit oily to begin with and already has the natural shine, but this BB cream also has a glowing to it.</li>
            <li> So far I have tried, Missha, Skin79 (hotpink one), skin79 diamond, and  skinfood aloe bbcream</li>
            <li> far among the cheaper bbcreams</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, i didn&#x27;t have breakout from the bb cream either.&lt;br /&gt;Natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the Nymph Aura Volumer acts like real sebum and that I finally can achieve the look I have seen this give to others!&lt;br /&gt;http://chichibanban.blogspot.com/2014/04/etude-house-nymph-aura-volumer-3-dry.html</li>
            <li> I have to use a tinted powder that matches my natural skin tone as a finishing powder to get rid of the tacky-ness and adjust the color.</li>
            <li> But once I put powder on, the shine completely went away.</li>
            <li> I ordered Natural.</li>
            <li> I am Korean and I&#x27;ve tried almost every brand&#x27;s BB cream so far.</li>
            <li> (So far BB ?</li>
            <li> (I normally use Bare Minerals as my makeup and while I like it there are a lot of steps before I get the look I want.)</li>
            <li> All in all, I really really really recommend this product and you should definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first because it created this super &amp;#34;oily shine&amp;#34; across my ENTIRE face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the product has pretty great coverage, but I may have chosen either the wrong shade where it comes off TOO light.  </li>
            <li> Next I will try Hanskin and Dr. Jart, which are definitely more expensive, but I want to see if they are worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light-medium shade with yellow undertones normally.</li>
            <li> I have combination, normal to oil skin, thus, make-up only lasts about 4 hours, even though I work indoor</li>
            <li> It has an okay SPF (SPF 30 PA+++) but definitely less than a lot of other BB creams out there.</li>
            <li> I know they&#x27;re eager to produce new lines constantly</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to much, I put three tiny pea sized dots and it covered my entire face.</li>
            <li> it provides semi-sheer coverage when spread thinly and almost opaque coverage when concentrated on \\&quot;problem areas.\\&quot; Great product for gals (and guys) with uneven and blemished skin.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; coverage (I used Laura Bare Mineral and Mercier tinted moisturizure for a long time).  </li>
            <li> Gets a bit too oily looking if too much is used (and by too much, I mean like 5/8 of a pump instead of 1/2 of a pump, so it&#x27;s difficult to control), but otherwise good!</li>
            <li> and I general makes me feel like a million bucks!</li>
            <li> (nothing an extra minute of concealing and powdering can&#x27;t fix), BUT it looks really natural once it sets (the length of my commute!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing major though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;- Not for use if you have very oily or very dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried lots of others that haven&#x27;t worked and are looking to try something different than what is on the North American market, I highly you suggest you give this a try.</li>
            <li> give the product an average review because although it was not right for my skin, I felt that it may work better for Caucasian skin possibly.  </li>
            <li> I like Etude House&#x27;s products in general.</li>
            <li> Peach Sake BB cream has a similar consistency, offers lighter coverage, and has 5 color options</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday, but I was looking for something economical.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t have much oil) or if it&#x27;s how much they&#x27;re using (you really only need a little!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, not gonna lie, but it&#x27;s too pale for my skin (which is probAbly my fault) and it feels and looks dusty on my skin.</li>
            <li> although using Bare Minerals has definitely improved my skin.</li>
            <li> Lately, I have gravitated toward this BB cream over my Holika Holika Pore Clearing Petit BB cream because I can just slap it on really quickly in the morning, even though it doesn&#x27;t fully cover all the redness</li>
            <li> My skin is very clear except for the capillary red spots around the nose and occasional black acne spots.  </li>
            <li> it makes you look slightly unreal with its coverage, and since I don&#x27;t have time to contour my face with fancy shadows and powders I just live with</li>
            <li> So it wouldn&#x27;t be wild if you got a shade that seemed too dark for you.</li>
            <li> Literally I have a strange yellow undertone skin tone and no makeup</li>
            <li> So I wanted to try this BB cream since I heard good things about it on hauls, but was disappointed with the outcome.</li>
            <li> maybe a combination of new shit on my face + finals stress</li>
            <li> I feel like I can clearly tell I look slightly plasticine because that&#x27;s what bb cream does,</li>
            <li> has a heavier consistency, offers slightly less coverage, and has one color</li>
            <li> /&gt;Skin79&#x27;s Gold label BB cream has a heavier consistency, offers slightly less coverage, and has one color</li>
            <li> As for the shade: I&#x27;ve got fair-medium skin tone that&#x27;s got a yellow undertone and initially this product appeared way too pink for me (Shade W13).  </li>
            <li> It does leave my skin with a slightly desaturated undertone, though, but overall the coverage only makes me slightly lighter than my normal skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for years and any time I had gone back to using any other product it would cause terrible break outs in less than 24 hours - after reading about this cream I decided to try it - it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> However, I have dry skin with some dry patches and larger pores around my nose.</li>
            <li> but sometimes they gotta learn to have that signature product to stay long in business.</li>
            <li> Skin 79 pink label only comes in 1 color</li>
            <li> This product has lasted me a veryyy long time.</li>
            <li> This is far to pale for me.</li>
            <li> As long as your face isn&#x27;t dry or patchy</li>
            <li> and I have found that this BB cream doesn&#x27;t settle and cling to the dry spots like some foundations do.</li>
            <li> Since my skin type is combo/dry, I like that this is moisturizing so it doesn&#x27;t dry up and get cakey on the skin.</li>
            <li> even  (not oily though, but maybe because my skin are already dry, so it&#x27;s not oily lol)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the Nymph Aura Volumer or a primer for dry skin</li>
            <li> : I would like to add that, for us dry skin gals, the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Does give a dewy look, but will emphasize pores and dry patches.</li>
            <li> However, I found that it&#x27;s a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> and it was a bit.. dry.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY really dry skin</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like that feeling even if I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I still prefer having dry skin vs sticky sensation.</li>
            <li> Face products can be really difficult because it&#x27;s a matter of finding the right one that gives you the look you want without totally jacking up your face.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this will last you forever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wait half a minute after putting on the concealer, and then I put 1 squeeze of this stuff on my face by dotting it on various areas and then blending-</li>
            <li> This has enough coverage to cover up my dark undereye circles as well as the severe redness I have on the center of my face.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit to cover my face as well.</li>
            <li> but it does not cover capillary red spots or black spots due to acnes.  </li>
            <li> it was everything minus the Mary Kay foundation.</li>
            <li> I have a few leftover teenage blemishes.</li>
            <li> Nope, I ended up w/ a dead white face</li>
            <li> This is not what I wanted or expected going in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I expected that.</li>
            <li> It did ship and arrive quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> But after a couple of minutes it blended into my skin tone and didn&#x27;t look so pink.</li>
            <li> for American brands, Smash Box is heavy, almost like foundation.  </li>
            <li> are comparisons to other BB creams in terms of consistency, coverage, and color):&lt;br /&gt;Skin79&#x27;s pink label BB cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a truly odd combination that I&#x27;m chalking up to my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this bb cream goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The pump doesnt work well and is never consistent with each pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely oily complexion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like any other tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t at all like the other one, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to continuously reapply throughout the day like with other make-ups.</li>
            <li> That was also one other reason I stopped using Missha.  </li>
            <li> I found that after I put this bbcream on my skin looked a little dry and oddish.</li>
            <li> It may be a little light, but nothing crazy noticeable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want it to be too dark.  </li>
            <li> Too dark, unnatural looking, spreads like clay.</li>
            <li> Less redness and irritation.</li>
            <li> Less black heads.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, it has a slight flower scent after applying it on you don&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> This BB is a 60ml tube and costs about half of what I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> In addition to that, it has a slight tacky finishing on the skin even after application and oxidation.</li>
            <li> With Etude house BB cream I just use toner before (Etude Wonder Pore Freshener) and apply it on, all within less than 10 mins.</li>
            <li> A little gives you a lot of coverage.</li>
            <li> and I do get a little shiny in the t-zone</li>
            <li> And a little product goes along way</li>
            <li> A little bit of this takes care of it.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a little too watery for my liking too.</li>
            <li> but I do get a little oily around my nose and t-zone</li>
            <li> it works but is heavily tinted.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want the heavy feeling of foundation.</li>
            <li> Some reasons, I felt it was too heavy, too oily.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break me out and it to does not feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> and I use this product almost everyday.</li>
            <li> and I like to look pale rather than tanned.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would mention is that I do see very subtle pinkish undertones which makes it not perfectly match my Asian skin.</li>
            <li> Just overall, not impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually stay away from all liquids and just use powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if maybe it&#x27;s a difference in skin types</li>
            <li> A couple small pumps and</li>
            <li> Although one downside is is that the pump is hard to control.</li>
            <li> But then again it&#x27;s hard for you to get it if you&#x27;re not in</li>
            <li> would recommend everyone at least give this product a try.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t wear this for a few days, my face gets worse.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m anxious to try it out and see how it is!</li>

            <li> It is a creamy base, it has an odor of SPF which I like personally.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my first advemture with BB cream.  A friend of mine let me use her expensive brand, but said a lot of companies were coming out with it. So I googled and found a review that liked this brand. It wasn&#x27;t expensive so I decided to try it.  I really like it.  A little gives you a lot of coverage. It may be a little light, but nothing crazy noticeable. I didn&#x27;t want it to be too dark.  I think I chose the right shade.  I am a Caucasian woman with a medium sn tone.  I tan easily so I don&#x27;t have fair skin...just to give those wanting to know what shade to buy an idea.  To me it feels light on the skin and I didn&#x27;t even put any powder on though you could.  All in all I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is an ok bb cream. it works but is heavily tinted. If put on the wrong skin tone, may make you look orange.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is just perfect. It has a medium coverage, a light and pleasant scent, and SPF. Lately, I have gravitated toward this BB cream over my Holika Holika Pore Clearing Petit BB cream because I can just slap it on really quickly in the morning, even though it doesn&#x27;t fully cover all the redness and I do get a little shiny in the t-zone (nothing an extra minute of concealing and powdering can&#x27;t fix), BUT it looks really natural once it sets (the length of my commute!). My skin&#x27;s been a bit drier this year and I have found that this BB cream doesn&#x27;t settle and cling to the dry spots like some foundations do. Bottom line: it doesn&#x27;t make my skin perfect, but it makes it looks natural with little effort. I recommend this for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are comparisons to other BB creams in terms of consistency, coverage, and color):&lt;br /&gt;Skin79&#x27;s pink label BB cream has a heavier consistency, offers slightly less coverage, and has one color option.&lt;br /&gt;Skin79&#x27;s Gold label BB cream has a heavier consistency, offers slightly less coverage, and has one color options.&lt;br /&gt;Missha&#x27;s M Perfect Cover BB cream has a heavier consistency, offers more coverage, and has 5 color options, closest is #23 Natural Beige (I use #23, which is still a tad light and is heavily scented!!).&lt;br /&gt;Skinfood&#x27;s Peach Sake BB cream has a similar consistency, offers lighter coverage, and has 5 color options (I think, the website only shows 2 but I have #2 and #3), closest is #2 Natural Beige (I use a mix of #2 and 3 to get the perfect shade).&lt;br /&gt;Skinfood&#x27;s Mushroom BB cream has a heavier consistency, offers more coverage, and has 2 color options, closest is #2 Natural Skin(I use #2 Natural Skin, which is still a bit light).</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this after reading the reviews. However, the first day I used it, I broke out all over my face. I tried to give this a second try, but I broke out again. The natural beige was also still too light for me.. I&#x27;m a NC 35 in MAC.</li>
            <li> No need for anything else. Eraser for your face. Begin with a blank slate every day.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed with this product.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the product has pretty great coverage, but I may have chosen either the wrong shade where it comes off TOO light.  It can be a bit chalky/cakey looking on my face.. and I also don&#x27;t like the pump on this.  The pump doesnt work well and is never consistent with each pump.</li>
            <li> It has whitening element that makes your skin look ghastly and pasty.  (I&#x27;m Asian so I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s a matter of skin tone).  Hate it.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out badly after awhile using Mary Kay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought it was my diet, toners I was using, cleansers, makeup brush, sponge... etc. I thoguht it was everything minus the Mary Kay foundation. But the foundation was the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I swtiched it over to this foundation, my skin was in a bad shape. But 30% in to using this foundation, my skin cleared up rapidly and stopped breaking out. Less redness and irritation. Less black heads. Covers well too if you use a stipple brush. I&#x27;m extremely oily complexion so I use a face primer to control the oil. Then apply this over a facial cream and it gives a good coverage. Would I buy it again? YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is highly sensitive to most lotions and creams and I have never been able to use face products for more than a few days in a row. However, I have not had any problem using this BB cream. Gives nice even coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily. Also matches skin tone nicely. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The product is very light and airy. It feels like you&#x27;re not wearing anything at all. It lasts all day without cracking or flaking, problem is that it doesn&#x27;t cover a lot. It covers light blemishes, but nothing else. Good product, seller was a fast shipper, got the product around a week later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited because i finally got my bb cream. I ordered it about 5 or 6 days ago so it was really fast! i&#x27;m anxious to try it out and see how it is! definitely reliable and will purchase more from them in the future. (:</li>
            <li> This product was a bit too light for me. It&#x27;s like any other tinted moisturizer. I used it for about two weeks and didn&#x27;t see any changes in my skin. I&#x27;m disappointed. The transaction was very smooth. Thanks.</li>
            <li> One of the best BB creams ever. Literally I have a strange yellow undertone skin tone and no makeup a make me. Either too orange or too pink or too pale but this one is a great match ( I got honey beige ) and it finishes Dewey but with some matte primer it&#x27;s finishes really natural. And a little product goes along way, it&#x27;s medium to full coverage as well. even after trying cover fx, urban decay, tarte, skin food, too faced, I&#x27;m back to using Etide House.</li>
            <li> I originally received a trial size of this BB cream and loved it so ordered the larger size.  I ordered through Amazon prime and received it within two days.  Great packaging.  Super fast delivery.  Product is great as it gives me a nice natural look and I like to look pale rather than tanned.  Lasts well all day and has an SPF of 30.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace my well-worn &amp;#34;Sheer Silky Skin&amp;#34; Mineral BB Cream from Etude House. This isn&#x27;t at all like the other one, but it does the job. It dries semi-matte and has medium coverage. I put it on when I have to go into the sun and I don&#x27;t want the heavy feeling of foundation.</li>
            <li> This was a good product but it didn&#x27;t match my skin color, but it is still usable. It is good.</li>
            <li> I have been very interested in trying Korean BB creams for a very long time. I am big into makeup, and lately it seems that Korean beauty products are incredibly talked about. I have two BB creams at the moment, this Etude House one and the Holika Holika Petit BB Cream with Sebum control. Both of these creams are great, personally I prefer my Holika Holika one but I have very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for this Etude House cream, here is the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;This bb cream provides easily buildable light/medium coverage, and the shades worked perfectly with my skin. I was worried they would be too light, as I have light, but olive toned, skin. I am caucasian, but as soon as sun gets on my skin I begin to tan. With about 2 minutes of oxidation time, this cream settles more into your actual skin tone. It feels very lightweight on the skin, and hasn&#x27;t caused any major breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product does have SPF, so when I skype someone or take pictures I do appear much more white-ish, and slightly washed out. It&#x27;s nothing major though. I don&#x27;t look like a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longevity of this cream is probably about 4-5 hours. However, if used with a primer, and properly set then it&#x27;s length of wear can be improved. Blotting is something I have to do with any makeup though, as I tend to have a very oily T-Zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sheer amount of product one gets with the Etude House bb cream is the best part. I was iffy on the price for a product I wasn&#x27;t sure I would truly like, but 50mL of product is a ton. I normally use Revlon Colorstay, which has 30mL of product. A little bit of this bb cream goes a long way as well. I tend to use pea-sized amounts on my brush, and build up to medium/fuller coverage. Any spots that the cream doesn&#x27;t cover so well, such as acne, are easily covered by concealer. Set it with a powder, and BAM completely full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product, and my only reason for giving 4 stars is that my Holika Holika cream does a better job of managing my oily skin, and has slightly better longevity.</li>
            <li> I bought this bb cream 2 months ago and I really love it. The coverage is great and the color matches, so I am pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this BB cream with my purchase of Missha&#x27;s Super Aqua Cleansing Foam.  I have used other BB creams (mostly Missha BB products) and found them OK, but a bit greasy and heavy.  The other BB creams I have used do not provide adequate coverage or the SPF protection claimed.  Not only does this Etude House BB cream provide great coverage, it REALLY protects against the sun! I have very fair skin and need extra protection. This BB cream is light and has a pleasant scent. It also looks more natural than the other BB creams I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those needing SPF protection and want a good foundation cover for fair skin, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> A guy that uses BB Cream? Hey, if it works, why not! I have a few leftover teenage blemishes. A little bit of this takes care of it.</li>
            <li> This works amazing, has great coverage, and it&#x27;s super lightweight. It only takes a little bit to cover my face as well.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is my absolute favorite. Moisturizing without being greasy, lovely consistency, blends awesome. I really reccomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great make up for a sensitive skin, I&#x27;m very allergic to so many things and these product helped me to keep my skin fresh and looking young. I just love it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many BB creams before this but this is by far my favorite so far. It has a nice full coverage that covers most of my imperfections and it doesn&#x27;t feel too thick on the skin. Since my skin type is combo/dry, I like that this is moisturizing so it doesn&#x27;t dry up and get cakey on the skin. I bought the Natural Beige color and even though it&#x27;s a bit light for my skin, it blends pretty well, I even substitute it as my foundation sometimes when I go out at night.</li>
            <li> CC and BB creams promise everything!  Nope, I ended up w/ a dead white face and I am a fair skinned blonde.  Not for me.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four because my skin is a bit oily to begin with and already has the natural shine, but this BB cream also has a glowing to it. I do love it and recommend it, just maybe during winter time. It is a creamy base, it has an odor of SPF which I like personally.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy! I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the coverage and the smooth, soft finish. This BB cream has surpassed a lot of the American BB creams sold in the market and I am so happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This was offered at a great price, even coming from Korea.  I love this make up and am so happy I can continue to buy it here in the United States.  Great price, shipping as expected.</li>
            <li> I really do like the product, however the shade didn&#x27;t match my skintone. It leans towards white or grayish and i have yellowish skin. I think this product is good for people who have NC20-NC25 skintone or cool tone, but you can always use a bronzer to make it match the right skintone. I would use this product more in the winter time than summer, however I used this product while playing tennis and it didn&#x27;t melt! Of course i would set it with powder and I have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product is buildable medium to full but if you have a lot of acne it sort of covers it especially when its red, I still think I would buy this product but in a different shade. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, it has a slight flower scent after applying it on you don&#x27;t smell it anymore. Shipping: I thought I would get this product in a month, but I got it in 2 weeks so its not that bad.</li>
            <li> it has all the qualities that one can ever expect from a bb cream.would buy it again.,,most importantly very reasonable</li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream.  It&#x27;s not too strong and looks natural.  It blends with my skin.  I would definitely buy it again.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this product - I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for years and any time I had gone back to using any other product it would cause terrible break outs in less than 24 hours - after reading about this cream I decided to try it - it&#x27;s perfect. I still use BM, but on occasion when I have used this product, I&#x27;ve received nothing but praise for my &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; skin - at 55 that is a wonderful compliment - as I&#x27;ve never considered myself to have beautiful skin although using Bare Minerals has definitely improved my skin. Now using this BB cream steps it up!! I have no problem with coverage - it&#x27;s perfect, in fact I don&#x27;t look like or feel like I am wearing any product at all, and don&#x27;t agree with those that says it comes off easy - I&#x27;ve worn in all day, and still had to wash off, and I don&#x27;t even really use that much. Please keep this formula - make no changes and I will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> So in order to find the perfect korean bb cream I have been trying all the popular cheaper brands. So far I have tried, Missha, Skin79 (hotpink one), skin79 diamond, and  skinfood aloe bbcream AND i have tried several american brands such as garnier, loreal, and maybelline  This one is about average-ish. I am korean with a medium complexion, and i tan very easily. I found that after I put this bbcream on my skin looked a little dry and oddish. The consistency is a little too watery for my liking too. I didn&#x27;t really get the &amp;#34;awesome perfect skin&amp;#34; look that I desire.&lt;br /&gt;So far among the cheaper bbcreams I think skinfood is the best so far.  Next I will try Hanskin and Dr. Jart, which are definitely more expensive, but I want to see if they are worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the product an average review because although it was not right for my skin, I felt that it may work better for Caucasian skin possibly.  Also I felt that it works better than Loreal, garnier, and maybelline.</li>
            <li> This is a great make-up. It gives great coverage without a heavy feeling. I don&#x27;t have to continuously reapply throughout the day like with other make-ups. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> great build-able coverage for a BB, natural beige is a good color for my skin (fair with pink undertones) and blends well, it actually dries unlike a lot of other BBs, fresh smelling, makes makeup application super fast in the morning, long wearing, doesn&#x27;t make my acne worse and camouflages quite a bit, i would recommend it and would buy it again</li>
            <li> Product was as described.</li>
            <li> My friend went to Korea on vacation and brought me back a ton of samples of this BB cream. I fell IN LOVE with it instantly! It&#x27;s amazing, really. If you love BB creams, this needs to be in your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s way better than American BBs in that it&#x27;s nice and thick and covers like a foundation vs a tinted moisturizer. A little goes a long way so this will last you forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though, Korean makeup is very pale, and while I am usually a FAIR in American makeup, I am a MEDIUM in Korean, so make sure you take that into account when ordering and go a shade darker.</li>
            <li> So far, i love it! :) I actually ordered a bright fit version W13 though but somehow i received the Blooming Fit version instead.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure what were the differences but the Natural Beige W13, at first, i was worried since it didn&#x27;t look that fit with my skin tone, it kinda a little bit light in color (when i first applied) but then when the bb cream started to blend in, it looks nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have quite a dry skin, so i&#x27;m just kinda glad that this BB cream Blooming Fit actually makes my skin more even  (not oily though, but maybe because my skin are already dry, so it&#x27;s not oily lol)&lt;br /&gt;although i need to add Shiseido refining moisturizer on top... just to help my skin not looking too dry.&lt;br /&gt;So far, i didn&#x27;t have breakout from the bb cream either.&lt;br /&gt;Natural beige works for me.... I started to really like using Etudes House bb cream. The coverage is just nice... :)</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample when I bought Etude House&#x27;s moistfull cream. I&#x27;ve been using Dr.Jart&#x27;s silver BB for so many years and I wasn&#x27;t able to find anything to replace it. This BB doesn&#x27;t give you any darkening. I have acne prone skin. It doesn&#x27;t break me out and gives me the perfect coverage that I need. The price that I pay for Dr.Jart&#x27;s silver BB is around $25 for 50ml tude. They last about a year and I use it everyday, but I was looking for something economical. This BB is a 60ml tube and costs about half of what I&#x27;ve been using. I&#x27;m pretty much satisfied with this purchase. I like Etude House&#x27;s products in general. Keep up the good work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* 4/4/15&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost a year. And I was really dissapointed when I learned that Etude House discontinued &amp;#34;bright fit&amp;#34; version of this BB. They&#x27;ve introduced this same Precious Mineral line but with different name like &amp;#34;cotton fit&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;bright fit&amp;#34;. I bought both with same W13 Beige and they aren&#x27;t just the same!! It makes me wonder why they would stop making the one that&#x27;s been a great hit. I know they&#x27;re eager to produce new lines constantly but sometimes they gotta learn to have that signature product to stay long in business. It looks like I need to start looking for a new BB cream... Bring this back!!</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail.  I have been trying different BB creams.  This one gives great coverage and has a 30 SPF.  The color is not too bad, I apply with a couple drops of my foundation..</li>
            <li> Its wonderful on the skin... its goes on smooth... just lightly dust powder over it cuz it can get oily at times...</li>
            <li> Love this bb cream, its light, feels great on the skin and has spf. After applying it you will need to wait  a few minutes until it settles in, the result is a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> &#x27; PROS: I appreciate the aesthetics of the bottle, the scent, and the shine/pearl-look it gives my face. It does help my face to stay a little moisturized as the day goes by and adds that nice dewiness I favor. I also like the SPF factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27; CONS: However, I have dry skin with some dry patches and larger pores around my nose. This cream accentuates every flaw while somehow making my skin look dewy. It&#x27;s a truly odd combination that I&#x27;m chalking up to my extremely dry skin. I&#x27;m not a fan of this BB Cream. My skin looks better with just some moisturizer. This is not what I wanted or expected going in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I&#x27;m going to try the Nymph Aura Volumer or a primer for dry skin (any recommendations?) and see if that helps. If not, I&#x27;ll continue to use this as a concealer and for some spots of hyper pigmentation on my face (chin). :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Note: If anyone is experiencing this issue, take a look at this post I found. I&#x27;m hoping the Nymph Aura Volumer acts like real sebum and that I finally can achieve the look I have seen this give to others!&lt;br /&gt;http://chichibanban.blogspot.com/2014/04/etude-house-nymph-aura-volumer-3-dry.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 2/2/15: I would like to add that, for us dry skin gals, the [[ASIN:B007BYPCPG Etude House Nymph Aura Volumer #3 Transparent Nymph Aura 25g]] does help the look of this BB Cream in CERTAIN areas (as you can see in chichibanban blogspot listed above). It also helps in photos if you are going for that dewy look but does not look good in person if you have dry skin and visible pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 5/11/15: I ended up giving this to my sister who has more sebum/oil than I and does better with her skin than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;- Not for use if you have very oily or very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used on oily skin in the winter time when your skin is more dry.&lt;br /&gt;- Does give a dewy look, but will emphasize pores and dry patches.</li>
            <li> Came right on time! And the product was the perfect shade for my skin :)&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall was that I thought it would have better coverage and after wearing it for a while (I would say 8 hours) your skin gets really oily. But I expected that. Overall, it&#x27;s really easy to blend and it feels like a waterbase texture.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great, but in humidity weather it feels a little bit greasy</li>
            <li> So I wanted to try this BB cream since I heard good things about it on hauls, but was disappointed with the outcome. It leaves a very fake, unnatural finish. You can basically scrape it off your face with your nails after application. Gross. And it smells alright at first but afterwards kind of starts to smell like.. well, ass :|&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a more of a liquid than cream, and it&#x27;s hard to control the amount you get with the pump. Just overall, not impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m liking the Missha Signature one, or my original go-to: Skin 79 Gold.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves this BB cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching eatyourkimchi&#x27;s Martina review it (also after seeing SHINee endorse it, haha), and it pretty much works! It does leave my skin with a slightly desaturated undertone, though, but overall the coverage only makes me slightly lighter than my normal skin tone. It&#x27;s amazing at covering blemishes without oddly caking up around them like foundation tends to do. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a couple of weeks now, but I do have two problems with the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I dislike how easily it comes off. Like another reviewer said, you can pretty much scrape it off with your nails if you scratch your face (and I&#x27;m not used to wearing makeup so maybe I haven&#x27;t learned how to not touch my face yet/repress the urge to scratch itches) it&#x27;ll come off. It&#x27;s easy to smooth back, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. After I started using this my forehead started breaking out. It&#x27;s calming down now, and honestly it may be just that finals stress kicked in, or maybe a combination of new shit on my face + finals stress &#x3D; breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the pluses are great:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. perfect-looking skin! and when I say perfect, I don&#x27;t fool myself into thinking I look natural- I feel like I can clearly tell I look slightly plasticine because that&#x27;s what bb cream does, really- it makes you look slightly unreal with its coverage, and since I don&#x27;t have time to contour my face with fancy shadows and powders I just live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. this blends super-well with the liquid/cream concealer that I use under my eyes and on darker blemishes as concealer. I wait half a minute after putting on the concealer, and then I put 1 squeeze of this stuff on my face by dotting it on various areas and then blending- it doesn&#x27;t disturb the concealer at all, it just smoothes on top perfectly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use or try it yet, but I according to.my review its a good Bb cream.I will try it next time.</li>
            <li> I was originally using Banila Co&#x27;s Be Touched BB cream in Yellow Beige, but they discontinued the color. Then began my search for the next BB cream that would match my skin tone. I&#x27;m around NC25 and I have a yellow undertone. From the pictures I thought Natural Beige (W13) would match for me, but the actual cream product has a pink undertone. In addition to that, it has a slight tacky finishing on the skin even after application and oxidation. It stays tacky for the rest of the day. I have to use a tinted powder that matches my natural skin tone as a finishing powder to get rid of the tacky-ness and adjust the color. Even then its still noticeably pinkish on me in comparison to my neck. The product does seem to improve the texture of my skin over time and usage of the product though so its not a bad quality BB cream at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows a different BB cream I should try for yellow undertones, please let me know!</li>
            <li> I was so in love with this product, until the warmer season came. For me, my skin becomes oily in warmer season and with combination of this BB Cream and warmer weather I started to breakout! I was so upset that I threw the bottle away. I started using Mineral Powders and my skin is slowly starting to go back to the way it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it 1 or 2 stars because I did like the product initally.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the right color, but I gave it to a friend &amp; she loved it.</li>
            <li> Originally I&#x27;ve been with Etude House for a while, except I&#x27;ve been using their older BB Cream - - they never fail to make my skin look great. The product does exactly what it says it does which is my favorite part. I&#x27;ve switched to this BB Cream &amp; have not been disappointed yet. Would definitely buy again &amp; I love the Sanitary feature of the pump!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, not gonna lie, but it&#x27;s too pale for my skin (which is probAbly my fault) and it feels and looks dusty on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have never tried BB Creams before because my skin is very sensitive. I am super prone to breakouts and I have combination skin. I usually stay away from all liquids and just use powder. But I&#x27;ve heard really great things about this BB cream and decided to try it. It is super cheap which I like, most high quality BB Creams in America are expensive. It also delivered superrrr fast which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I put on any make up I wash my face with Juice Beauty and then I use Acure moisturizer. When I first put on this BB Cream You don&#x27;t need to much, I put three tiny pea sized dots and it covered my entire face. It has medium coverage.  I was a little worried at first because it created this super &amp;#34;oily shine&amp;#34; across my ENTIRE face. I first thought maybe I put on too much of my moisturizer or maybe I shouldn&#x27;t use any moisturizer with this BB Cream. But once I put powder on, the shine completely went away. It also feels very light which I love because a lot of liquids feel heavy and looks cakey/flakey. But it is super light and it does not clump around my dry spots or blemishes. The color is really nice and blends very easily. Through out the day it stays on fairly well but I do get a little oily around my nose and t-zone (it could just be my type of skin). Also, it has not created any blemishes so far which is a good sign since my skin is super sensitive. Overall I am pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased Lioele Beyond the Solution BB Cream at the same time to try it out but it takes about a month to ship/deliver -.-&lt;br /&gt;so I will see if I like that one better.</li>
            <li> Too dark, unnatural looking, spreads like clay. Does not color correct, I will be going back to loreal for BB cream, which does spread well and will color correct. Now have to scrape this off my face.</li>
            <li> I was really scared at first to try bb cream, but this product was totally worth it. i have acne prone face so buying bb cream gave me second thoughts. It turned out to be such a great product. it have a light scent and it covered all the redness in my face. It gives my face a flawless coverage... amazing!</li>
            <li> Works really well, and color correction is great. Gets a bit too oily looking if too much is used (and by too much, I mean like 5/8 of a pump instead of 1/2 of a pump, so it&#x27;s difficult to control), but otherwise good!</li>
            <li> I bought this shade and the honey beige to use together and I love them! The product smells so clean and feels light on my skin... it provides semi-sheer coverage when spread thinly and almost opaque coverage when concentrated on \\&quot;problem areas.\\&quot; Great product for gals (and guys) with uneven and blemished skin. I bought this from SeoulGlamor and they were nice enough to add in freebies (such as the nymph aura volumizer by etude house - a liquid applied with bb cream or foundation to give that coveted \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; glow) which made my Korean cosmetic experience all the better!</li>
            <li> It really does what it says and it is well worth it. We will be purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li> Face products can be really difficult because it&#x27;s a matter of finding the right one that gives you the look you want without totally jacking up your face.&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is the one and only. I don&#x27;t like foundation but my face has never been clear or one color. This stuff not only gives me enough coverage without being too heavy, but it also actually helps my face to not have as much acne. I&#x27;ve used prescribed medication that has not worked as well as this stuff has for my face. When I don&#x27;t wear this for a few days, my face gets worse. I really just cannot stress how much this stuff has helped my face while also giving me better coverage than any foundation could.&lt;br /&gt;The shades they have are very light, they&#x27;re lightest shade made me look like a porcelain doll. So it wouldn&#x27;t be wild if you got a shade that seemed too dark for you. Part of the beauty of BB cream is that it oxidizes to match your skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;The BB cream can also highlight any dryness on your face, but some days I just mix in a little of my favorite moisturizer and it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Other than those few drawbacks, this stuff has really worked for my face. If you&#x27;ve tried lots of others that haven&#x27;t worked and are looking to try something different than what is on the North American market, I highly you suggest you give this a try.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, but extremely fair in color. I ordered Natural. I&#x27;m a light-medium shade with yellow undertones normally. This is far to pale for me. I mix it with my foundation to fix the color and the coverage is nice. It did ship and arrive quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> It is okay but not my favorite bb cream</li>
            <li> Very nice quality and price! Easy to use and last long. Exactly what I need. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product was a lot more moisturizing than other reviews had led me to believe.  I&#x27;ve got oily skin so I would probably use this product alone instead of over a moisturizer.  I would also recommend against this if you live in a hot/humid climate.  As for the shade: I&#x27;ve got fair-medium skin tone that&#x27;s got a yellow undertone and initially this product appeared way too pink for me (Shade W13).  But after a couple of minutes it blended into my skin tone and didn&#x27;t look so pink. Next time I might get one shade darker and play around with both of them to see what works best.</li>
            <li> Not too thick or thin.  Has a good selection of shades, which some BB creams don&#x27;t do.  Liked the light feel of this cream.  Covers nicely without big buildup.  arrived timely too.</li>
            <li> Few months ago, after all the hype about BB creams, I bought Missha Perfect BB Cream #23, Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream #13, and Skin 79 pink label BB Cream (Ebay seller in Korea).  Also bought Smash Box BB cream and tried many other American brands BB creams (Dior, Boscia, Too Face, Tarte).  I have combination, normal to oil skin, thus, make-up only lasts about 4 hours, even though I work indoor (I am a once-a-day make-up kindda girl). B/c of popularity of Missha, I used it first.  Some reasons, I felt it was too heavy, too oily.  Then I switched to Skin 79 and Etude House.  They all go on every smooth and easy to blend (I use stippling brush).  Skin 79 pink label only comes in 1 color and it&#x27;s sheer/light coverage.  It&#x27;s even out my skin but it does not cover capillary red spots or black spots due to acnes.  It lasts 4-5 hours.  Etude House Precious Mineral #13 is a bit light for me.  It is medium coverage.  However, I found that it&#x27;s a bit dry.  It makes me flaky around the nose area.  I decided to use Etude House as concealer.  Not the best but it works.  It also works when I mix Skin 79 and Etude House together.  Neither one of these products have any fragant to it.  Missha BB cream does have fragrant.  It smells like baby powder-ish.  It&#x27;s not bad (it eventually goes away after after few hours); however, I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.  Some people actually like the fragrant (on youtube). That was also one other reason I stopped using Missha.  After months, I decided to \\&quot;re-visit\\&quot; Missha BB cream again.  Still don&#x27;t care for the fragrant; however, it gives a medium coverage.  My skin is very clear except for the capillary red spots around the nose and occasional black acne spots.  So I don&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; coverage (I used Laura Bare Mineral and Mercier tinted moisturizure for a long time).  However, with a bit of setting powder, Missha BB cream lasts almost all day.  Plus of Missha BB cream, high SPF (maybe that why it seems more oily).&lt;br /&gt;In summary, for medium coverage Missha (if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrant), Etude House (if you don&#x27;t have dry skin).  For light coverage, Skin 79.  Tips: even though, BB creams are all in one products, always wear moisturizures (&#x3D;/- additional sun block) and setting powder.  Even though, you can build for more coverage, but I&#x27;d not recommended b/c it will look very heavy.  Also, buy from a reputable Ebay sellers.  It is cheaper than amazon, around $11-13.  Beware, fake products are out there (I do not understand this either b/c it&#x27;s not every expensive, why do people make/sell fake products).  I suspect that these products are \\&quot;drug-store\\&quot; brands in Korea.  But since we can&#x27;t get our hands on, we are paying a bit more.  Next, I want to try Tony Molly CC cream.&lt;br /&gt;As for American brands, Smash Box is heavy, almost like foundation.  Dior BB creams are more of yellow tone and dark.  Tarte is too powdery for my liking.  Boscia is water base so it&#x27;s nice; however, it&#x27;s one shade and not recommended for darker than NC-35.  Too Face gives a dewy/sheer/natural look and good for yellow tone skin.&lt;br /&gt;Hope you will find a right products.</li>
            <li> Really good. The last time I ordered one the shade was lighter than my skin tone but this one matches better. I also like how a sample packet of foundation came in the package.</li>
            <li> I am Korean and I&#x27;ve tried almost every brand&#x27;s BB cream so far. THere&#x27;s one thing i don&#x27;t like about most BB cream is their dryness. IT&#x27;s not applied smoothly, and sometimes it gets too dry you can&#x27;t even put powder on it.&lt;br /&gt;Well the thing is, it gets soooo much better if you mix it with some liquid foundation / moisturizer when you apply it. I have been doing that with this one as well because I love how this BB cream can hide blotchy spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 3 starts because i chose the wrong color ( Had to mix it with darker foundation, i&#x27;m THE rare, dark-skinned Korean if you can believe. ) and it was a bit.. dry. that&#x27;s all. (So far BB ? CC? cream of Origins was the best for my combination skin. In case you were wondering.. lol )</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. The coverage is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t break me out and it to does not feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best thing I have ever done for my skin and complexion. I LOVE this stuff. I used to never wear anything during work weeks because I&#x27;m not a morning person and I didn&#x27;t see it as feasible to spend a lot of time getting ready in the morning (I normally use Bare Minerals as my makeup and while I like it there are a lot of steps before I get the look I want.) With Etude house BB cream I just use toner before (Etude Wonder Pore Freshener) and apply it on, all within less than 10 mins. It&#x27;s a seriously fast process and the results are amazing. My skin tone instantly looks even, I have beautiful color and I&#x27;m left with an awesome glow from the pearl extract. The best part is because it is a BB cream I am now moisturizing my face every morning and getting the SPF protection I need. At 25 these two things are both really important to me. As for those that say it comes off easily I can&#x27;t agree. I&#x27;m not sure if maybe it&#x27;s a difference in skin types (I don&#x27;t have much oil) or if it&#x27;s how much they&#x27;re using (you really only need a little!) This stuff soaks the moisture into my skin and the color stays ALL day. We&#x27;re talking 12+ hour days here, I never have to touch up. I can even go to the gym and sweat and still look good. I really don&#x27;t know if I can express how much I love this stuff and how grateful I am to have found it. I hope I&#x27;m able to keep purchasing it (since I&#x27;m in the US) for a long time coming!</li>
            <li> I prefer BB creams so much more than foundations and I use this product almost everyday. The scent is extremely light and this is something I really appreciate. I never smell it throughout the day and you really have to put it right under your nose and sniff to take a smell out of it. I bought this here in Korea and the natural beige almost perfectly matches my skin tone; maybe very suitable since I&#x27;m Korean. The only thing I would mention is that I do see very subtle pinkish undertones which makes it not perfectly match my Asian skin. The lady at the shop told me that this color (W13) was the color that ran the most \\&quot;natural.\\&quot; I feel that this shade would work well for both pink-toned and yellow-toned skin. The bb cream isn&#x27;t super dewey nor is it super matte. I would say it&#x27;s definitely more dewier than demi-matte though; leans more towards glowy than matte, basically. In terms of coverage, it cancels out the redness I have in my face and almost all of the time it looks like I&#x27;m not wearing anything. It&#x27;s the perfect enhancer but not necessarily a heavy duty coverager/concealer... I would say about a solid/good medium coverage (build-able). I am very very acne prone and have quite a bit of redness and I have some kind of blemish everyday. As long as your face isn&#x27;t dry or patchy I feel that this product will sit on top of your face very very naturally and really reduce the appearance of your pores. I really love wearing this!! Although one downside is is that the pump is hard to control. I love love the packaging (except the pump of course) it&#x27;s so durable and extremely cute. It looks like a really fancy girly type of cute and not like a cheap kind of cute if you know what I mean. The packaging is suitable for the product to not dry out. This product has lasted me a veryyy long time. 60 grams is a lot of product. You get double the amount of an average high-end foundation at a much more wallet-friendly price. It has an okay SPF (SPF 30 PA+++) but definitely less than a lot of other BB creams out there. One other thing is that (and this goes for most BB creams) it does have a tendency to transfer which is often a factor in makeup than leans more dewey. In Korea, the product is sold as 13,000 Won (around $12.30) so it definitely is more expensive here on Amazon. $15.50 is definitely reasonable but if you add the shipping it&#x27;d be basically $20 bucks so in total, your paying 7 or 8 more bucks for it. But then again it&#x27;s hard for you to get it if you&#x27;re not in Korea.^^ So its up to you on how you see it :). In comparison with the famous Missha Perfect Cover BB cream: The Missha one is a bit more thick (hence the better coverage) and is quite nice but I&#x27;m not a fan of the strong smell and grey undertones.. Sometimes I mix the two but if I were to just wear one of the two, I would most likely reach for the Etude House one. All in all, I really really really recommend this product and you should definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about this great quality product that is reasonable priced.  It is a great product.</li>
            <li> amazing. high coverage. light texture.</li>
            <li> This is the best BB cream/ foundation I have ever worn. Not only does it match my skin tone perfectly, it leaves my skin looking like a Hollywood makeup artist applied my makeup and then the my face has been photoshopped. It lasts all day, brightens my skin and I general makes me feel like a million bucks!</li>
            <li> its a miracle formula! i love the satin finish it gives my skin, it gives me a very natural glow, and as pale as I am it gives me a bit of a tint. If only it came in a bigger size because I will use it up very quickly!</li>
            <li> This product works great, I will be using this brand of BB cream from now on. This product works better for me than the American BB creams.</li>
            <li> Everything is okay&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> the shipment was very fast, especially its come from south korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bb cream was pretty good. i have pretty oil face, i used maybelline before, it just make it worse, but this one at least wont make your face look shinny, and the SPF was pretty awesome! the only thing is i wish it has better coverage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for a couple months so I think I can confidently write a review. Overall, I absolutely LOVE this stuff. Just as others have said before me, this stuff comes off easily. However, I have found that a light dusting of translucent powder helps it stay in place. I have REALLY really dry skin and I love how dewy this makes me look without settling into fine lines. I also feel that this is the perfect product for people who don&#x27;t feel like spending a lot of time on makeup. This has enough coverage to cover up my dark undereye circles as well as the severe redness I have on the center of my face.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend everyone at least give this product a try. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this in my life!</li>
            <li> My skin is very pale and this blends in very nicely. Does a great job of giving my face a nice glow and covering up my acne scars. Loved it right away, and it&#x27;s a big amount for the price. A couple small pumps and I was able to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t cover my pigmented dark spot! &#x3D;( It also makes my skin feel sticky and I don&#x27;t like that feeling even if I have dry skin I still prefer having dry skin vs sticky sensation. Some ppls may like it but I don&#x27;t.</li>
