            <li>I came across this leave in conditioner a few years ago and it is the best!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice change from the more sophisticated scents marketed in the last 30 years.</li>

            <li>This stuff has never disappointed me.  </li>
            <li>I usually buy about 5 at a time lol!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever got a letter with my product dripping all over my hands  they need to learn to package things in a better way</li>
            <li>, I also love the smell, it&#x27;s very pleasant and subtle</li>
            <li>I think it is a good product overall</li>
            <li>Everything about Salerm is true to the name.</li>
            <li>I will try later:) and also because it has like 6 parabens in the ingredients and cones!</li>
            <li>Even if I use too much, if I brush it through and put on my makeup, my hair soaks it in and looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It works much better and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and smooth with no frizz!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be boasting about this product if it wasn&#x27;t worth trying or spending your money on.</li>
            <li>nothing left to use, the people that mailed it should have put it into some kind of box.</li>
            <li>I am always trying new hair products, particularly conditioners-I&#x27;m becoming a product junkie!</li>
            <li>so grateful it arrived right at my door.</li>
            <li>I used this time for the first time last Sunday and my hair still feels amazing</li>
            <li>It repairs dry, damaged hair and keeps it in tip top shape!</li>
            <li>the best thing is I can use it in with my hair wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy transaction, very sarisfied with product.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and strong.  </li>
            <li>perfect for de-tangling for thin straight hair</li>
            <li>This products moisturizes and smooths my cuticles, it is the best product I have ever used,I have been using it for at least 2 years!!</li>
            <li>I have to give credit to my Mother-In-Law for this one, she gave me my first tube.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Mom!</li>
            <li>I use it every week when I wash my hair and it never fails.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used this</li>
            <li>first time I purchase it online.</li>
            <li>, i highly recommend this product yay!!</li>
            <li>First use</li>
            <li>While I sort of agree with one reviewer that Lacio Lacio is \\&quot;better\\&quot;, I must say that while LL doesn&#x27;t have many contenders in the shine department, Salerm silk protein B5 actually is actually the better conditioner which deeply penetrates and softens.</li>
            <li>This product turned my hair into silk literaly with the first application.</li>
            <li>it is a first aid kit for hair.</li>
            <li>I first used it when a Brazilian hair dresser did my hair.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the smell and the way it left my hair.</li>
            <li>it made my hair soft and my curls were smooth.</li>
            <li>Gives hair a nice healthy glossy look with out it being oily or scalp irritating.</li>
            <li>, this makes my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair still feels super soft.</li>
            <li>I decided to stop using the curling tag so much but 4 times a year.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>too much conditioning.</li>
            <li>This products works very well.</li>
            <li>Very content with this product, it arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Very content two thumbs up.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair with long lasting shine and feeling and looking super healthy.</li>
            <li>I proceeded to flat iron and my hair was silky smooth like butter.</li>
            <li>but I dont think it is special enough to continue purchasing online.</li>
            <li>and I must say it makes my hair look moisturized but not weighed down and healthy.</li>
            <li>The reason why I use the product and fell in love with it is because the first time I used it and left my hair to airdry it left my hair looking shiny, silky and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This product really did make my hair so very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s totally smooth and super shiny, and I&#x27;m quite blonde with very dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Now what do I do with all my high price salon products, which I will no longer need???</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and smooth without making it look flat and oily.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and use this product when blow-drying straight my hair.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s too early for me to say if it really helps with that</li>
            <li>but all of the above plus the strange smell makes me not feel like buying more.</li>
            <li>Also, can be used on chemically treated hair and on normal hair.</li>
            <li>I use this product everyday and i love it.</li>
            <li>See that Salerm has a new product that is called \\&quot;A Touch of Silk\\&quot;..maybe they changed the product..</li>
            <li>I used it on clean wet hair</li>
            <li>It has the scent of the products in the classic barber shops of the 1950&#x27;s which is kin to Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Over the past year, I have discovered Salerm and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>OMG, this makes my hair so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and luxurious and like silk.  </li>
            <li>It did not leave the hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and I like the feel of it.</li>
            <li>I use it on my kid&#x27;s hair too and her hair is soooo soft.</li>
            <li>I have no chemicals in my hair which is natural curly.</li>
            <li>, it feeds my color treated relaxed hair and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>but it did leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>so silky soft</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair, it also works well keeping my curl moisturized.</li>
            <li>but I am so far it seems so</li>
            <li>It did not weigh my hair down and it was full of body.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for a not-too-heavy conditioner for fine, but thick hair.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to get pretty dry at times, and after trying product after product, a friend gave me some Salerme 21.  </li>
            <li>I love this product I originally bought it while in California and afraid I was not going to find it in Texas</li>
            <li>The only difference from previous purchases is that the consistency of the product was different, it was more liquid-y</li>
            <li>Overall this product was decent.</li>
            <li>but its not good on keeping your hair moisturized, I think Giovanni Direct Leave in did a better job with that.</li>
            <li>I applied this product to my wet hair after washing, while it made me hair easy to comb through this product caused my hair to feel and look very dry after blow drying.</li>
            <li>But if you do that wow, major softness for all hair types.</li>
            <li>Also highly recommended Salerm 21 Essential Conditioning Oil with silk protein.  </li>
            <li>, it conditions my hair so over time I generally saw an improvement, and</li>
            <li>I find it awesome on bad hair days when I need to slick my hair back into a ponytail.</li>

            <li> I came across this leave in conditioner a few years ago and it is the best!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice change from the more sophisticated scents marketed in the last 30 years.</li>
            <li> I would by fromthis vendor again for future products....very happy with iteam.</li>
            <li> AND SHE FEEL COMFORTABLE.  </li>
            <li> and since I love amazon I came to look for it here and its the same thing it smells good and works well</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy my own to use at home when i wash my own hair and let it air dry....</li>
            <li> This stuff has never disappointed me.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy about 5 at a time lol!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever got a letter with my product dripping all over my hands  they need to learn to package things in a better way</li>
            <li> , I also love the smell, it&#x27;s very pleasant and subtle</li>
            <li> I think it is a good product overall</li>
            <li> Everything about Salerm is true to the name.</li>
            <li> I will try later:) and also because it has like 6 parabens in the ingredients and cones!</li>
            <li> Even if I use too much, if I brush it through and put on my makeup, my hair soaks it in and looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It works much better and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and smooth with no frizz!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be boasting about this product if it wasn&#x27;t worth trying or spending your money on.</li>
            <li> nothing left to use, the people that mailed it should have put it into some kind of box.</li>
            <li> I am always trying new hair products, particularly conditioners-I&#x27;m becoming a product junkie!</li>
            <li> so grateful it arrived right at my door.</li>
            <li> I used this time for the first time last Sunday and my hair still feels amazing</li>
            <li> It repairs dry, damaged hair and keeps it in tip top shape!</li>
            <li> the best thing is I can use it in with my hair wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy transaction, very sarisfied with product.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and strong.  </li>
            <li> perfect for de-tangling for thin straight hair</li>
            <li> This products moisturizes and smooths my cuticles, it is the best product I have ever used,I have been using it for at least 2 years!!</li>
            <li> I have to give credit to my Mother-In-Law for this one, she gave me my first tube.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Mom!</li>
            <li> I use it every week when I wash my hair and it never fails.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used this</li>
            <li> first time I purchase it online.</li>
            <li> , i highly recommend this product yay!!</li>
            <li> First use</li>
            <li> While I sort of agree with one reviewer that Lacio Lacio is \\&quot;better\\&quot;, I must say that while LL doesn&#x27;t have many contenders in the shine department, Salerm silk protein B5 actually is actually the better conditioner which deeply penetrates and softens.</li>
            <li> This product turned my hair into silk literaly with the first application.</li>
            <li> it is a first aid kit for hair.</li>
            <li> I first used it when a Brazilian hair dresser did my hair.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the smell and the way it left my hair.</li>
            <li> it made my hair soft and my curls were smooth.</li>
            <li> Gives hair a nice healthy glossy look with out it being oily or scalp irritating.</li>
            <li> , this makes my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair still feels super soft.</li>
            <li> I decided to stop using the curling tag so much but 4 times a year.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> too much conditioning.</li>
            <li> This products works very well.</li>
            <li> Very content with this product, it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Very content two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair with long lasting shine and feeling and looking super healthy.</li>
            <li> I proceeded to flat iron and my hair was silky smooth like butter.</li>
            <li> but I dont think it is special enough to continue purchasing online.</li>
            <li> and I must say it makes my hair look moisturized but not weighed down and healthy.</li>
            <li> The reason why I use the product and fell in love with it is because the first time I used it and left my hair to airdry it left my hair looking shiny, silky and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This product really did make my hair so very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s totally smooth and super shiny, and I&#x27;m quite blonde with very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Now what do I do with all my high price salon products, which I will no longer need???</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and smooth without making it look flat and oily.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and use this product when blow-drying straight my hair.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s too early for me to say if it really helps with that</li>
            <li> but all of the above plus the strange smell makes me not feel like buying more.</li>
            <li> Also, can be used on chemically treated hair and on normal hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and i love it.</li>
            <li> See that Salerm has a new product that is called \\&quot;A Touch of Silk\\&quot;..maybe they changed the product..</li>
            <li> I used it on clean wet hair</li>
            <li> It has the scent of the products in the classic barber shops of the 1950&#x27;s which is kin to Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Over the past year, I have discovered Salerm and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> OMG, this makes my hair so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and luxurious and like silk.  </li>
            <li> It did not leave the hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It made my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and I like the feel of it.</li>
            <li> I use it on my kid&#x27;s hair too and her hair is soooo soft.</li>
            <li> I have no chemicals in my hair which is natural curly.</li>
            <li> , it feeds my color treated relaxed hair and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> but it did leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> so silky soft</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair, it also works well keeping my curl moisturized.</li>
            <li> but I am so far it seems so</li>
            <li> It did not weigh my hair down and it was full of body.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for a not-too-heavy conditioner for fine, but thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to get pretty dry at times, and after trying product after product, a friend gave me some Salerme 21.  </li>
            <li> I love this product I originally bought it while in California and afraid I was not going to find it in Texas</li>
            <li> The only difference from previous purchases is that the consistency of the product was different, it was more liquid-y</li>
            <li> Overall this product was decent.</li>
            <li> but its not good on keeping your hair moisturized, I think Giovanni Direct Leave in did a better job with that.</li>
            <li> I applied this product to my wet hair after washing, while it made me hair easy to comb through this product caused my hair to feel and look very dry after blow drying.</li>
            <li> But if you do that wow, major softness for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Also highly recommended Salerm 21 Essential Conditioning Oil with silk protein.  </li>
            <li> , it conditions my hair so over time I generally saw an improvement, and</li>
            <li> I find it awesome on bad hair days when I need to slick my hair back into a ponytail.</li>
            <li> After I blew dry my hair it felt soft but I cant say that it was anything too far from the ordinary.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair soft &amp; curly, I&#x27;m half jamaica &amp; Paraguayan and this works for my hair</li>
            <li> If I want it straightened, apply a smaller amount and blow dry.</li>
            <li> It does feels a little greasy when you put it on, but after a couple of minutes, your hair feels soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> This one leaves my hair looking like it was dry when left to air dry...</li>
            <li> I have curly, dry, color treated hair</li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s what is causing the dry hair..</li>
            <li> I recommend it for dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> For those of you who suffer from frizzy and dry hair.</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry, it won&#x27;t be after this.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well with the salerm mask and made flat ironing a breeze.</li>
            <li> If you want to blow dry your hair to achieve straightless, done!</li>
            <li> You only need a small drop, so the 6.9 oz lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> After washing and deep conditioning over night, I applied salerm 21 and blow dried my hair.</li>
            <li> It does have silk protein in it, so I would be careful in not over indulging.</li>
            <li> If you use a minimal amount then it will do it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> just spent my money for nothing.  </li>
            <li> If i intend to keep my hair wet, i apply about a quarter amount and leave the house.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so careful with the amount you use.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> the one I chose on this other website did not say it.</li>
            <li> Not much is needed to bring down the frizz</li>
            <li> but the amount of slip it provided for the amount I put in (about a quarter sized amoutn) was less than expected.</li>
            <li> It replaces all the vitaminB5 that your hair loses during different chemical processing.</li>
            <li> I can wear my hair down without worrying that my curls are going to get frizzy as I go through the day.  </li>
            <li> While in college my hair started to get dry and frizzy, mainly due to the hard water in the dorms.</li>
            <li> the split ends are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> hair type is dark, dry and thick.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell of this leave-in bothers me a little bit.</li>
            <li> I also use a flat-iron everyday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday since I received it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as heavy and it leaves my hair nicer than this product</li>
            <li> Heavily recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have gray roots and extremely coarse, thick thick hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes the ends of my hair feel stronger and less prone to breakage which I need as I have thick, relaxed Afro-Caribbean hair.</li>
            <li> I can slick my hair or make it wild and crazy and the curls will stay together and not frizz up.</li>
            <li> I usually do rollers on my hair</li>
            <li> Usually after a couple of days after washing my hair feels greasy but not with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Garnier anti-frizz cream in that small roundish container, but it does not compare to this.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to add any other hair product for heat protection or for cutting down my blow drying time.</li>
            <li> and I have really thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I can take my hair down from a pony tail or wake up with crazy hair, squeeze out a nickel size dollop of this stuff and run it through my shoulder length hair and my hair calms down and gets these fat curls and waves.  </li>
            <li> I had breaking , and weak hair.</li>
            <li> Lacio lacio sucks!</li>
            <li> The crap was mailed in a post office envelope PAPER, no box only the plastic tube</li>
            <li> It smells bad though and it is quite thick</li>
            <li> The Smell is so disturbing.  </li>
            <li> My hair have been in bad condition for over 1 year.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Try salerm 21, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am in love with the smell of this stuff. It&#x27;s like a geranium floral scent or something. It also does a great job of keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li> This product really did make my hair so very soft. It&#x27;s not greasy and very easy to apply. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Leaves my hair feeling soft and smelling good!</li>
            <li> I have curly, dry, color treated hair and I work out in the Sun. This stuff has never disappointed me.  I can take my hair down from a pony tail or wake up with crazy hair, squeeze out a nickel size dollop of this stuff and run it through my shoulder length hair and my hair calms down and gets these fat curls and waves.  Even if I use too much, if I brush it through and put on my makeup, my hair soaks it in and looks fantastic.  I have turned on several of my friends to this product.  I have to give credit to my Mother-In-Law for this one, she gave me my first tube.  Thanks Mom!</li>
            <li> My hair seems to get pretty dry at times, and after trying product after product, a friend gave me some Salerme 21.  After trying, I ordered it on line. It does feels a little greasy when you put it on, but after a couple of minutes, your hair feels soft and manageable.  I do recomment this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff going on a year and it has been a godsend!!!  It makes my hair feel soft and luxurious and like silk.  Even when I need a relaxer.  I use it every week when I wash my hair and it never fails.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have chin length relaxed hair that is in failry healthy condition. I bought this product after I saw so many people talking about it on a couple of online forums.  Overall this product was decent. I used it on clean wet hair and it made it easier to comb but the amount of slip it provided for the amount I put in (about a quarter sized amoutn) was less than expected. After I blew dry my hair it felt soft but I cant say that it was anything too far from the ordinary. I think it is a good product overall but I dont think it is special enough to continue purchasing online. I&#x27;ll probably just go to the beauty supply store or salon and see what I can find. Also, the smell of this leave-in bothers me a little bit. Honeslty, if it smelled better I&#x27;d consider continuing to get it online but all of the above plus the strange smell makes me not feel like buying more.</li>
            <li> I have gray roots and extremely coarse, thick thick hair.This products moisturizes and smooths my cuticles, it is the best product I have ever used,I have been using it for at least 2 years!!</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.  My hair have been in bad condition for over 1 year.  I am going to the hair dressers and she used this with my roller set.  I decided to stop using the curling tag so much but 4 times a year.  My just wouldn&#x27;t grow.  I have gained about 6 inches in about 5 months.  I can&#x27;t explain but my hair is proof.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It did not work as good as the Lacio Lacio Leave in Hair Conditioner. It did not leave the hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used this and it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li> I totally love this product - I use it once a week and it keeps my hair in very good shape.I use it after conditioner and then roller set. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Its AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I am an african american woman transitioning to texlaxed. I am always trying new hair products, particularly conditioners-I&#x27;m becoming a product junkie! This leave in will definitely be a part of my arsenal. After washing and deep conditioning over night, I applied salerm 21 and blow dried my hair. A dab will do ya with this product! I proceeded to flat iron and my hair was silky smooth like butter. It did not weigh my hair down and it was full of body. It looked like I had been to the Dominican salon and had a blow out done. I could not keep my hands out of my hair. It has a light pleasant scent and a nice semi creamy texture. It does have silk protein in it, so I would be careful in not over indulging. For beautiful, silky hair or for anyone who enjoys wearing wraps/roller sets, this is a must have! Try salerm 21, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this it I use it my hair every day it makes your hair shiny and when you blow dry it looks the best</li>
            <li> Love this product on my colored hair. Easy to use, no greasy at all. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Over the past year, I have discovered Salerm and fell in love.  My favorite&#x27;s this Salerm 21 Silk Protein.  I use prior to blowing/ironing.  Also highly recommended Salerm 21 Essential Conditioning Oil with silk protein.  These two products keep my hair in tip top shape.  My hair&#x27;s totally smooth and super shiny, and I&#x27;m quite blonde with very dry hair.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Salerm 21...first time I purchase it online. It looks like it is not the same product.  This one leaves my hair looking like it was dry when left to air dry...when I blowdry my hair it looks good. The reason why I use the product and fell in love with it is because the first time I used it and left my hair to airdry it left my hair looking shiny, silky and feeling soft. Noticed when I received this product it said \\&quot;leave in conditioner\\&quot;..the others I&#x27;ve used never said \\&quot;leave in conditioner\\&quot; it was some type of silicone...so maybe that&#x27;s what is causing the dry hair..too much conditioning. Have to go to my salon where I purchased the product before and see if it is the same product..See that Salerm has a new product that is called \\&quot;A Touch of Silk\\&quot;..maybe they changed the product..but something is different. I purcahsed another one online again  thinking that it was not leave in conditioner..made sure it did not say \\&quot;Leave in Conditioner\\&quot;, but when I received it..it said \\&quot;Leave in Conditioner\\&quot;...the image online does not say \\&quot;Leave in Conditioner\\&quot;..some do and some don&#x27;t..the one I chose on this other website did not say it. But it did...it was leave in conditioner when I received it again. If it turns out its not the same..I will stop purchasing it online.</li>
            <li> Salerm 21 is great for the hair. I use it every time I wash my hair. Is great I always leave it in my hair</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite product for sure!!!! keeps my hair soft &amp; curly, I&#x27;m half jamaica &amp; Paraguayan and this works for my hair, i highly recommend this product yay!!</li>
            <li> I applied this product to my wet hair after washing, while it made me hair easy to comb through this product caused my hair to feel and look very dry after blow drying. I will not continue to use this product, but will continue to use  my Lacio Lacio. It works much better and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Like how it leaves hair looking. Good to have and smells good.</li>
            <li> I was alittle hesitant to buy, just because I was comparing this to the Lacio Lacio(which I will try later:) and also because it has like 6 parabens in the ingredients and cones! It made my hair really soft. but its not good on keeping your hair moisturized, I think Giovanni Direct Leave in did a better job with that.</li>
            <li> This along with Kanechom and silicon mix leave my rollersets looking great and moisturized! The silk protein help makes the hair look it&#x27;s best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2007 and is my hair&#x27;s best friend. I&#x27;m latin so I have curly dry hair and this product is the best for my hair, I love it.</li>
            <li> I have all over color w/blonde highlights on african american hair.  I also use a flat-iron everyday.  This product is excellent for thermal protection and has prevented any breakage or damage to my hair!  I love, love, love this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday since I received it. It keeps my hair soft and I like the feel of it.</li>
            <li> Great leave in conditioner.  Keeps my hair soft and strong.  Even my boyfriend uses it on his hair.</li>
            <li> Great price. Arrived very quick. Leaves my hair with long lasting shine and feeling and looking super healthy.</li>
            <li> I love salerm products except their hair dye. But this product is really good. I had breaking , and weak hair. this made it strong and so silky after i use my rollers. I use it on my kid&#x27;s hair too and her hair is soooo soft. Lacio lacio sucks! I like this brand better than that. And u dont have to use a lot to feel the difference. I use it after i wash my hair then put my rollers on and when im dont my hair is soft and great.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was reluctant to try this product. Now that I&#x27;ve gone blond my hair lost it&#x27;s luster and looked faded. This product is wonderful!  First use I noticed a BIG difference in my hair.  Shinier, healthier looking, color was brighter, and it tamed the \\&quot;old\\&quot; lady frizzes.  2nd day of use the girls in the office noticed the difference.  I had to share my great find.  Now we are all going to start using this product!  Now what do I do with all my high price salon products, which I will no longer need???</li>
            <li> This products works very well. It replaces all the vitaminB5 that your hair loses during different chemical processing. Its a great buy.</li>
            <li> I like the Salerm better than the Lacio Lacio, this makes my hair super soft and manageable. The only thing is this does not go well with curling irons. If you want to blow dry your hair to achieve straightless, done! Lacio, Lacio does not go well with everyone hair, I guess it depends try both. I am sold on Salerm 21.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works great on my hair!</li>
            <li> Works extremely well with the salerm mask and made flat ironing a breeze. With the combination of both products, my hair actually felt like a wig (no seriouly, it felt like a wig). Very satisfied with this product!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I will not straighten my hair without it. Leaves hair soft and smooth with no frizz! Love it!</li>
            <li> Everything about Salerm is true to the name. I will ALWAYS purchase their products.</li>
            <li> This product is AWSOME! It repairs dry, damaged hair and keeps it in tip top shape! I use it every day!</li>
            <li> This is great for when you straighten your hair. Leaves it shinny, smooth and zero frizz. Great stuff wish they had bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair smooth after blowing my hair.</li>
            <li> perfect for de-tangling for thin straight hair</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner smells good and leave my hair nice and soft. I have no chemicals in my hair which is natural curly. In the Dominican salon I go to they use this so I decided to buy my own to use at home when i wash my own hair and let it air dry....hair still soft and smell great</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Salerm!! It makes my hair healthy and great price :) i have been using it for many years !! I will recommend this product 100% :) and the delivery was on time and no issues at all!</li>
            <li> I came across this leave in conditioner a few years ago and it is the best! I can slick my hair or make it wild and crazy and the curls will stay together and not frizz up. I usually buy about 5 at a time lol!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair product for a couple of years. It leaves my hair soft and smooth without making it look flat and oily. A little goes a long way, so careful with the amount you use.</li>
            <li> I usually do rollers on my hair and I like to put in a leave-in conditioner before I do.  I recently tried this and I am very pleased with the results.  My hair feels stronger, silkier and the split ends are less noticeable.  Will def. continue using this.</li>
            <li> Works very great with bleached hair and gives your hair shine and leaves it very soft</li>
            <li> For me it is the best leave in ive used till now. Smells nice hair feels silky and helps me to disentangle hair plus has vitamin. So happy with it.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it feeds my color treated relaxed hair and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good. It smells bad though and it is quite thick but it did leave my hair soft and shiny. I like Lacio Lacio  much better. It&#x27;s not as heavy and it leaves my hair nicer than this product but I would still use it though... sometimes. Most of the time I will use the Lacio Lacio.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful leave in treatment- Selerm products def. do not ever disappoint and this one is no different. While I sort of agree with one reviewer that Lacio Lacio is \\&quot;better\\&quot;, I must say that while LL doesn&#x27;t have many contenders in the shine department, Salerm silk protein B5 actually is actually the better conditioner which deeply penetrates and softens. I think the key to getting all of B5&#x27;s benefits only happen if you put it on when hair is wet/after washing and conditioning. But if you do that wow, major softness for all hair types. Try it! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awesome.... love the texture of my hair after just a few applications of using this product. I recommend it for dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> This vendor has one of the fastest deliveries I&#x27;ve experienced. Always go back to them when I need Salerm products.</li>
            <li> This product turned my hair into silk literaly with the first application. I will never go without it. I use it as a daily moisturizer and detangler. The is wonderful for the product but it is worth so much more. I was about to cut off my hair because of breakage whenever I combed my hair until I found this product it is a first aid kit for hair.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. My hair holds its curls and does not frizz. I leave it in and dont wash it out.  I also don&#x27;t have to reapply For days. Only thing is I do have to apply some sheen to my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves my hair smooth and silky with great shine.</li>
            <li> I can see why they use this stuff in some salons. My daughter and I both use this and I must say it makes my hair look moisturized but not weighed down and healthy. I think it is even helping my daughter&#x27;s hair to grow along with another product we recently bought. Very happy with Salerm.</li>
            <li> For those of you who suffer from frizzy and dry hair. This is the best product ever to use. If you use a minimal amount then it will do it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and use it every time I wash my hair. It smells wonderful and I love the way it leaves my hair. I first used it when a Brazilian hair dresser did my hair. I fell in love with the smell and the way it left my hair. I highly recommend it for a not-too-heavy conditioner for fine, but thick hair.</li>
            <li> Love this !! Amazing results and I have really thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love love love the way this product leaves my hair. I don&#x27;t have to add any other hair product for heat protection or for cutting down my blow drying time. This is just perfect! I have naturally curly hair and use this product when blow-drying straight my hair. This works wonders! Believe me, you&#x27;ve got to try it. It beats: It&#x27;s a 10, Redken, Joico, Healthy Sexy Hair and the rest....in quality and result! I wouldn&#x27;t be boasting about this product if it wasn&#x27;t worth trying or spending your money on.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel soft and silky and works good on frizz, the best part is it smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> You only need a small drop, so the 6.9 oz lasts a long time. It has the scent of the products in the classic barber shops of the 1950&#x27;s which is kin to Old Spice. It&#x27;s a nice change from the more sophisticated scents marketed in the last 30 years.</li>
            <li> It is a nice pruduct i was recomende it at a salon and it realy works</li>
            <li> oh my god this product is the greatest im amazed it leaves da hair so silky soft i use this when i do rollers and it works wonders  salerm 21 is great!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for your hair, it really does well. It helped me a lot to have a better good looking hair.</li>
            <li> The crap was mailed in a post office envelope PAPER, no box only the plastic tube no box to protectit, it was crusted and dripping out of the package nothing left to use, the people that mailed it should have put it into some kind of box. just spent my money for nothing.  I will get the Salerm 21 silk from someone else the product is great I have used it for years. This is the first time I ever got a letter with my product dripping all over my hands  they need to learn to package things in a better way</li>
            <li> Best leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever put in my hair!</li>
            <li> While in college my hair started to get dry and frizzy, mainly due to the hard water in the dorms. After much complaining to my mother, she went out and found this product for me, and I Love It! Not much is needed to bring down the frizz, it conditions my hair so over time I generally saw an improvement, and the best thing is I can use it in with my hair wet or dry. If i intend to keep my hair wet, i apply about a quarter amount and leave the house. If I want it straightened, apply a smaller amount and blow dry. Gives hair a nice healthy glossy look with out it being oily or scalp irritating. Has a pleasant mild scent. Have been using this product now for 8 year.  Also, can be used on chemically treated hair and on normal hair. Heavily recommend it.</li>
            <li> the iteam is as desribed.....it also arrived on time.......I would by fromthis vendor again for future products....very happy with iteam.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner. It works well when detangling my tresses. I find it awesome on bad hair days when I need to slick my hair back into a ponytail. I need another bottle soon! I have natural curly hair, it also works well keeping my curl moisturized. A little goes a long way. Its great protection when heat styling as well.</li>
            <li> Wife uses this and no complaints</li>
            <li> I used this time for the first time last Sunday and my hair still feels amazing (it&#x27;s now the following Saturday). Usually after a couple of days after washing my hair feels greasy but not with this product. My hair still feels super soft. This will be a staple in my hair regimen. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
            <li> MY WIFE USE IT AND IT SOFTEN HER HAIR.  SHE USE IT TWICE A WEEK, AND SHE FEEL COMFORTABLE.  SHE WOULD KEEP BUYING IT.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and i love it. My hair is more managable. I use Salerm as a leave in and it works the best for my hair. Great product.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my hairdresser.... I have color treated hair and highlights..... It&#x27;s a great product, detangles in a breeze and it smells amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> OMG, this makes my hair so soft and shiny!  I can wear my hair down without worrying that my curls are going to get frizzy as I go through the day.  I&#x27;ve tried the Garnier anti-frizz cream in that small roundish container, but it does not compare to this.  This was recommended to me by a salon stylist, and I am sold on it. Definitely give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is dark, dry and thick.</li>
            <li> I got this from my hairstylist and loved it and since I love amazon I came to look for it here and its the same thing it smells good and works well</li>
            <li> I love it!  Excellent product</li>
            <li> This stuff makes the ends of my hair feel stronger and less prone to breakage which I need as I have thick, relaxed Afro-Caribbean hair. Will continue to repurchase!</li>
            <li> Very content with this product, it arrived on time. I have used it both as a leave in and also for only 5 min and then rinsed it out. Perfection!! it made my hair soft and my curls were smooth. I applied it before entering the dryer and when I came out my hair was shiny and very soft, my ends looked great also. It could have been the coconut oil treatment I left in for a couple of min but I believe this helped a lot too it just felt great on my hair. The smell is decent and I think the price is good too. Very content two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Nice product and awesome price I was very satisfied with everything the shipping and handling  I give it a thumbs up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 4 years and I can&#x27;t  get enough of it. It leaves my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> Was shipped on time as promised! Love this product!</li>
            <li> Fast and easy transaction, very sarisfied with product. Love this hair product leaves my hair silky smooth and healthy. Give hydration and protein that your hair needs.</li>
            <li> USE IT AS A DETANGLER FOR MY DAUGHTERS BEAUTIFUL CULRS</li>
            <li> I love this product, I bought it a month ago, I use it in my ends to help protect them from heat and prevent split ends (a friend of mine recommended it for that purpose), It&#x27;s too early for me to say if it really helps with that but I am so far it seems so, I also love the smell, it&#x27;s very pleasant and subtle</li>
            <li> I use this after each and every wash. I love this product! It leaves my hair feeling soft, silky, manageable and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product. The only difference from previous purchases is that the consistency of the product was different, it was more liquid-y</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT! If your hair is dry, it won&#x27;t be after this.</li>
            <li> The Smell is so disturbing.  A total nightmare.  It doesn&#x27;t seem an option to send back according to the drop menu.  Even if this is a miracle product I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Loved this product.  Definitely what I was looking for.  Will order again soon.  This is the same product at a reduction of the price at the Dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I love this product I originally bought it while in California and afraid I was not going to find it in Texas so grateful it arrived right at my door.</li>
