            <li>The ingredient list is awesome (Novamin!</li>
            <li>I chose to give this toothpaste 4-stars because although it is one of the best toothpastes I have found, it is a tad pricey.</li>
            <li>All around an excellent product for tooth care.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That makes me a happy camper.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Rash has resolved, toothpaste works great.</li>
            <li>Great item that does not contain SLS.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can have wonderful products without all the chemicals and additives found in some of today&#x27;s health and beauty items.  </li>
            <li>Love the way my teeth feel after each use and the taste is wonderful as well</li>
            <li>It tastes good</li>
            <li>It has a good flavor as well.   </li>
            <li>Nothing can take the place of good oral care.   </li>
            <li>I like this toothpaste and am hoping it is as good as I have read.</li>
            <li>Tastes good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for months and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>It has a nice minty flavor and does not give you that burning sensation that Colgate does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a dentist or doctor-</li>
            <li>Liked the packaging of 4 to a pack.  </li>
            <li>Kind of pricy for the amount in the tube but recommend.</li>
            <li>and I experienced a pleasantly clean mouth.   </li>
            <li>It is mild and does a great job without burning my mouth.  </li>
            <li>If your teeth are strong and whitening is your goal, then this is good.</li>
            <li>However, the bottom line is that no toothpaste brand is any better than another one.   </li>
            <li>Free shipping incentive sealed the deal!</li>
            <li>and I needed to add more paste.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars since this review is for the fluoride version and gave 5 stars for the non-fluoride version for its better taste.  </li>
            <li>Since my dentist says I don&#x27;t need the added fluoride I&#x27;ll go for better taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I loved this at first</li>
            <li>I have not yet noticed any whitening effect, but mouth feels fresh!!</li>
            <li>This is a very good toothpaste (even when compared with regular, non-natural toothpastes).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whitening: I&#x27;ve used the non-fluoride version for 6 months and noticed a remarkable whitening - much more whitening than with Tom&#x27;s of Maine Whitening or Jason Natural Sea</li>
            <li>It did a great job with breath, sensitive teeth and whitening.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best there is!</li>
            <li>I received my items quickly, and am pleased with the follow-up.</li>
            <li>I used this after receiving a tube in the mail as part of a free promotion.   </li>
            <li>This was the one toothpaste that fit all of our needs.</li>
            <li>We tried this toothpaste (because it&#x27;s sulfide free but also has fluoride) and the canker sores cleared up.</li>
            <li>clean - probably the glycerin in the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different natural toothpaste, and this is the best yet.</li>
            <li>Nice minty taste, feels natural when u brush it.</li>
            <li>so toothpaste is ready to come out the top.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is free of sodium lauryl sulfate and contains no artificial colors, flavors, preservatives, or sweeteners.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For those who experience the tube splitting, I have found that unscrewing the whole cap instead of using the flip top helps prevent the splitting.  </li>
            <li>, it tastes good, and even though there are minor problems with packaging and its a bit goopy and, I would have been loyal to this forever - except for the HUGE problem</li>
            <li>It is minty and fresh, and I feel my teeth get plenty clean despite the lack of grit and foam.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not overly sweet and the right amount of peppermint.</li>
            <li>Botot is a a french brand available here that is probably the best one I have used as far as commercial brands go.   </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling fresh or minty at all.</li>
            <li>Fresh</li>
            <li>The tube isn&#x27;t plastic that pops back out to a rounded shape, but rather is the kind that stays smashed where you squeeze it.  </li>
            <li>I went through the tube pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I like this kind of tubing as I don&#x27;t have to work at squeezing out the remaining toothpaste each time, rather the tube stays flat</li>
            <li>The toothpaste tastes ok and seems to clean our teeth, but it is very gooey (like melted cheese), sticks to the cap and gets all over the sink if not careful.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Multicare Toothpaste is marketed as a minty-fresh, natural, and effective toothpaste that has been clinically proven to improve dental health.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel as clean and smooth as with any other toothpaste, so I can&#x27;t imagine what the reviewers complaining about grit and not feeling clean are talking about.  </li>
            <li>With regular brushing, this toothpaste is supposed to reduce plaque, whiten teeth, promote healthy gums, and freshen breath.  </li>
            <li>The peppermint taste was OK, similar to what I remember Crest Toothpaste tasting like when I was a kid.  </li>
            <li>he spearmint taste really leaves a fresh feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Toothpaste can be cheaper than a dollar per 6-ounces, but this is much higher.</li>
            <li>My 4 year-old was getting consistent canker sores.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth feeling clean, naturally and without flouride or sulfates!</li>
            <li>I can not speak to the whitening aspect of this natural multicare toothpaste, as I did not use it for 2 weeks to see any significant results.  </li>
            <li>The product is wonderful but the price is absurd so as much as I like the product, I would not purchase it through the web again.</li>
            <li>I loved this toothpaste as it is the only one that actually has a decent taste.</li>
            <li>certainly longer than with Tom&#x27;s or Jason toothpastes mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s one real problem</li>
            <li>but really this does not purport to be a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to Jason&#x27;s Powersmile toothpaste (fluoride- and SLS-free) and really like it.</li>
            <li>They feel cleaner longer than expected with most toothpastes and</li>
            <li>It is made with real cranberry extract which is known to block bacteria from adhering to teeth and gums, so it helps prevent plaque formation before it starts.  </li>
            <li>These products work by gently polishing away surface stains.  </li>
            <li>: It made my whole family&#x27;s teeth so ultra-sensative.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Xylitol - Non-digestible by bacteria, and yet some studies show that bacteria attempt to consume it, thus starving them and &#x27;distracting&#x27; them from real sugars.</li>
            <li>However, I purchased this toothpaste primarily because it was one of the only toothpastes that contains calcium sodium phosphosilicate (aka NovaMin), that was affordable.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is a lot more runny than other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>At $4.99 suggested retail for a 4 ounce tube, the Burt&#x27;s Bees also has a higher price point than other Multicare toothpastes, but I would have been willing to pay more for this natural product if it had met my expectations as far as cleaning my teeth.    </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is also the first toothpaste brand to be certified by the Natural Products Association.      </li>
            <li>Bottom line, stick with baking soda and your teeth will be just as healthy for a lot less money.       </li>
            <li>After initially reviewing this company and noting that my order hadn&#x27;t arrive and that the company wasn&#x27;t answering their phones, I was contacted quickly and told that they&#x27;d send my order out immediately.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for people with SLS allergies.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I ordered the fluoride containing version of this toothpaste by accident and found it has a chemically (new word?)</li>
            <li>I stocked up for awhile, but need to start researching a new brand to purchase.</li>
            <li>Those of you who get canker sores that last 1-2 weeks know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a desensitizer; the gums of one of my molars has receded slightly over the years, and I basically get Sensodyne for free while remineralizing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The flip top is hard to snap off on some tubes</li>
            <li>This is clearly because of the cranberry extract--plaque is caused by bacteria that sticks to the teeth.  </li>
            <li>It uses Calcium Carbonate (chalk) as the natural whitening ingredient.  </li>
            <li>The old adage \\&quot;you are what you</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s was the only one I could readily find.</li>
            <li>It does seem to have something abrasive in it which surprised me.</li>
            <li>It contains 100% natural whitening agents (calcium sodium phosphosilicate and silica).  </li>
            <li>My teeth have never been so sensitive, even with whitening treatments.</li>
            <li>: 3 out of 4 tubes so far have spotnaneously split on the side before being used up even two-thirds and leaked toothpaste all over the counter, which is a real waste.  </li>
            <li>I love the peppermint flavor as it is subtle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>But in the last few years, I got them much more frequently and they lasted longer so it was getting to be a big problem.</li>
            <li>For many years, because I get a huge amount of unsightly plaque on my lower front teeth, I will hand-scrape those teeth with a dental scraper every week or two between frequent, painful cleanings.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Check out the other ingredients as well -- in addition to the promoted cranberry stuff, xylitol is pretty beneficial for a toothpaste to have as well.  </li>
            <li>If your teeth are weak, make sure you use an extra soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We bought this as a natural alternative to the current toothpastes that have all kinds of additives.  </li>
            <li>We could barely brush our teeth with water.</li>
            <li>On the other hand if you have the money to spend, or really care for your oral health, then this is probably your product..</li>
            <li>Compared to Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpastes, which I normally use, I found this runny in consistency and it didn&#x27;t foam or lather as I brushed, which was strange.</li>
            <li>After using two tubes (one in the kids&#x27; bathroom, one in the adults&#x27;), the kids were crying when we brushed their teeth and all of us had so much pain especially near our gums, we couldn&#x27;t eat anything salty, sour, sweet, cold or hot.</li>
            <li>I got this as a free sample, and I was more than a little shocked by the price listed here.</li>

            <li> : 3 out of 4 tubes so far have spotnaneously split on the side before being used up even two-thirds and leaked toothpaste all over the counter, which is a real waste.  </li>
            <li> I love the peppermint flavor as it is subtle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> But in the last few years, I got them much more frequently and they lasted longer so it was getting to be a big problem.</li>
            <li> For many years, because I get a huge amount of unsightly plaque on my lower front teeth, I will hand-scrape those teeth with a dental scraper every week or two between frequent, painful cleanings.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Check out the other ingredients as well -- in addition to the promoted cranberry stuff, xylitol is pretty beneficial for a toothpaste to have as well.  </li>
            <li> If your teeth are weak, make sure you use an extra soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We bought this as a natural alternative to the current toothpastes that have all kinds of additives.  </li>
            <li> We could barely brush our teeth with water.</li>
            <li> On the other hand if you have the money to spend, or really care for your oral health, then this is probably your product..</li>
            <li> Compared to Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpastes, which I normally use, I found this runny in consistency and it didn&#x27;t foam or lather as I brushed, which was strange.</li>
            <li> After using two tubes (one in the kids&#x27; bathroom, one in the adults&#x27;), the kids were crying when we brushed their teeth and all of us had so much pain especially near our gums, we couldn&#x27;t eat anything salty, sour, sweet, cold or hot.</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample, and I was more than a little shocked by the price listed here.</li>
            <li> It actually felt like it was going flat as I brushed</li>
            <li> I get frequent canker sores, and while I can&#x27;t say I get them less often, I CAN say that when I do get them, with this toothpaste I can brush my teeth without experiencing the burning of the SLS in regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> This has happened with previous tubes and I alerted the manufacturer, who replaced those, but there&#x27;s a problem here that still hasn&#x27;t been fixed.</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m ordering in bulk so that it will be a long time before I have to go without this product again.  </li>
            <li> Finally found this toothpaste that is without sodium laurel sulphate which is in 99% of all other toothpastes and makes them foam.</li>
            <li> In fact, I discontinued using it after 3 days because I could not get past the gritty, unclean feeling it left on my teeth.</li>
            <li> This product takes a little getting used to (like a day or 2) if you&#x27;ve been using all the different varieties of the&lt;br /&gt;heavily marketed brands.  </li>
            <li> So when I saw this Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Multicare Fluoride Peppermint Flavor Toothpaste, I could hardly wait to get home a brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Most processed foods are bad for oral health regardless of the number of times you brush.   </li>
            <li> I found nothing unsatisfactory about this toothpaste, it tastes and looks like old-fashioned plain white Crest I used as a child.</li>
            <li> When he ran out, and or grocery store no longer carries it, we tried a regular toothpaste again, and he quickly got a bad sore.</li>
            <li> Finally, there&#x27;s something wrong with the cap design b/c it didn&#x27;t flip open easily and the tube-cap junction was awkward.</li>
            <li> : I don&#x27;t think the lid is hard to open like some others have noted.  </li>
            <li> But my biggest complaint was that my teeth did not feel any cleaner after I brushed them, than they did before I started.  </li>
            <li> My family and I were really sad when they discontinued their whole toothpaste line.</li>
            <li> As you can see from my previous reviews, I am a Burt&#x27;s Bees groupie.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is that it tends to get firm after a few uses and is hard to squeeze out of the tube.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t store it with the cap pointing up, I end up with a gooey mess at the opening.</li>
            <li> No huge gushes of unwanted and wasted toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> We stopped using it a few days ago and our pain is reducing.</li>

            <li> Now I check every two weeks and there is almost none, along with no more gum problems, and I delayed my cleaning six months and even then, the dentist said he found very little buildup.  </li>
            <li> I now put some of this toothpaste in a small cosmetic container when I</li>
            <li> The toothpaste was gritty and difficult to rinse out.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use toothpaste with SLS and most others taste horrific.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also less expensive than other SLS-free toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> But I do see how it would be hard for the elderly or small kids.</li>
            <li> That means brushing at least 2-3 times a day and watching the foods you eat.   </li>
            <li> I wanted floride free and my husband can&#x27;t have SLS or he gets terrible canker sores.</li>
            <li> And since the toothpaste texture is so thick, it doesn&#x27;t rush out when the lid is opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product: The toothpaste is very thick and has to be squeezed a bit hard to come out of the tube - which I like.  </li>
            <li> find this toothpaste a little weird</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used Novamin on and off for years and never experienced this.</li>
            <li> It starts out thick and sticky but soon it becomes very thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive though at 8 dollars a tube.   </li>
            <li> Expensive though..........</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I have to warn everyone against it.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just sad it has been discontinued!</li>
            <li> We are very sad to lose this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sad about it.</li>
            <li> My reaction to this SLS ingredient has been bad.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed that it has been discontinued.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I found nothing unsatisfactory about this toothpaste, it tastes and looks like old-fashioned plain white Crest I used as a child. It has a nice minty flavor and does not give you that burning sensation that Colgate does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a dentist or doctor- so I have no idea about its health value. I got this as a free sample, and I was more than a little shocked by the price listed here.</li>
            <li> I used this after receiving a tube in the mail as part of a free promotion.   I do like it alot.   It tastes good and I experienced a pleasantly clean mouth.   \\&quot;White\\&quot; toothpaste is made for whitening.   Gels are not.   However, the bottom line is that no toothpaste brand is any better than another one.   They all contain the same basic ingredients.   You can save alot of money by simply brushing with baking soda and using mouthwash or flavored water after brushing.    Botot is a a french brand available here that is probably the best one I have used as far as commercial brands go.   It uses Calcium Carbonate (chalk) as the natural whitening ingredient.  It has a good flavor as well.   It&#x27;s expensive though at 8 dollars a tube.   Bottom line, stick with baking soda and your teeth will be just as healthy for a lot less money.       Nothing can take the place of good oral care.   That means brushing at least 2-3 times a day and watching the foods you eat.   Most processed foods are bad for oral health regardless of the number of times you brush.   The old adage \\&quot;you are what you eat\\&quot; applies here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this about 6 months.  For many years, because I get a huge amount of unsightly plaque on my lower front teeth, I will hand-scrape those teeth with a dental scraper every week or two between frequent, painful cleanings.  All these years there&#x27;s been plenty to remove each time, until I started using this toothpaste.  Now I check every two weeks and there is almost none, along with no more gum problems, and I delayed my cleaning six months and even then, the dentist said he found very little buildup.  This is clearly because of the cranberry extract--plaque is caused by bacteria that sticks to the teeth.  The cranberry extract prevents it sticking.  Plus, it has xylitol, which has multiple benefits for enamel retention and rebuilding and gum health.  My grocery store stopped carrying it, so now I&#x27;m here stocking up.  My teeth feel as clean and smooth as with any other toothpaste, so I can&#x27;t imagine what the reviewers complaining about grit and not feeling clean are talking about.  Maybe they are using the gel, which I also tried and did not like.  EDIT:  I bought the 4-pack and there&#x27;s one real problem: 3 out of 4 tubes so far have spotnaneously split on the side before being used up even two-thirds and leaked toothpaste all over the counter, which is a real waste.  You have to throw them out. This has happened with previous tubes and I alerted the manufacturer, who replaced those, but there&#x27;s a problem here that still hasn&#x27;t been fixed.</li>
            <li> I have always gotten the occasional canker sore, no big deal. But in the last few years, I got them much more frequently and they lasted longer so it was getting to be a big problem. I couldn&#x27;t account for the change, except perhaps menopause. Through Googling I found that some people got relief by switching to a SLS-free toothpaste so I thought I would give it a try. Burt&#x27;s was the only one I could readily find. It worked! I made the switch over a year ago and have only gotten two canker sores and one was immediately after a trip where I thought I could get by with regular toothpaste (the price with shipping to buy a travel size was prohibitive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That makes me a happy camper. I now put some of this toothpaste in a small cosmetic container when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this toothpaste a little weird but I&#x27;ll use anything that keeps the canker sores at bay. The consistency is a lot more runny than other toothpastes. If I don&#x27;t store it with the cap pointing up, I end up with a gooey mess at the opening. I haven&#x27;t had any noticeable whitening effect but really this does not purport to be a whitening toothpaste. Burt&#x27;s has another toothpaste that whitens.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t give me sores and cracks on the corner of my lips.  I&#x27;m so disappointed that it has been discontinued.  I hope that Burt&#x27;s Bees reconsiders and starts making it again.</li>
            <li> This product takes a little getting used to (like a day or 2) if you&#x27;ve been using all the different varieties of the&lt;br /&gt;heavily marketed brands.  However, i ran out of Burt&#x27;s Bees and started using some Colgate breath strips toothpaste I had left in my medicine cabinet and after about a week I already started developing a canker sore which is something that the Burt&#x27;s Bees eliminated (that and avoiding acidic foods - lemons, vinagrette&#x27;s, etc.).  So now I&#x27;m ordering in bulk so that it will be a long time before I have to go without this product again.  Those of you who get canker sores that last 1-2 weeks know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.  I&#x27;ve found that preventing them is way easier than treating them.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Product was as described on line.  Was just what I was looking for.  Liked the packaging of 4 to a pack.  Price was great!!!!!  Free shipping incentive sealed the deal!</li>
            <li> Nice minty taste, feels natural when u brush it. I have not yet noticed any whitening effect, but mouth feels fresh!! Expensive though..........</li>
            <li> I used a tube of this (Burt&#x27;s Bees Multicare Toothpaste w/Fluoride, Peppermint) last year and wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Compared to Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpastes, which I normally use, I found this runny in consistency and it didn&#x27;t foam or lather as I brushed, which was strange. It actually felt like it was going flat as I brushed and I needed to add more paste. I went through the tube pretty quickly. It didn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling fresh or minty at all. Finally, there&#x27;s something wrong with the cap design b/c it didn&#x27;t flip open easily and the tube-cap junction was awkward. (Dec. 16, 2011)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (Nov. 24, 2012): I&#x27;ve stopped using Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpastes because I was getting rashes (perioral dermatitis) around my mouth, probably from the fluoride and/or SLS in the ToM toothpaste. I&#x27;ve switched to Jason&#x27;s Powersmile toothpaste (fluoride- and SLS-free) and really like it. Rash has resolved, toothpaste works great.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste and am hoping it is as good as I have read. It does seem to have something abrasive in it which surprised me. It starts out thick and sticky but soon it becomes very thin. You almost need a bib when brushing. But, I do like the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I ordered the fluoride containing version of this toothpaste by accident and found it has a chemically (new word?) taste. I gave it 4 stars since this review is for the fluoride version and gave 5 stars for the non-fluoride version for its better taste.  Since my dentist says I don&#x27;t need the added fluoride I&#x27;ll go for better taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product: The toothpaste is very thick and has to be squeezed a bit hard to come out of the tube - which I like.  No huge gushes of unwanted and wasted toothpaste.  I love the peppermint flavor as it is subtle and not overpowering. This toothpaste leaves my teeth silky (versus squeaky) clean - probably the glycerin in the product.  They feel cleaner longer than expected with most toothpastes and certainly longer than with Tom&#x27;s or Jason toothpastes mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitening: I&#x27;ve used the non-fluoride version for 6 months and noticed a remarkable whitening - much more whitening than with Tom&#x27;s of Maine Whitening or Jason Natural Sea Fresh Toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tube: I don&#x27;t think the lid is hard to open like some others have noted.  But I do see how it would be hard for the elderly or small kids. The tube isn&#x27;t plastic that pops back out to a rounded shape, but rather is the kind that stays smashed where you squeeze it.  I like this kind of tubing as I don&#x27;t have to work at squeezing out the remaining toothpaste each time, rather the tube stays flat so toothpaste is ready to come out the top.  And since the toothpaste texture is so thick, it doesn&#x27;t rush out when the lid is opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste. Not overly sweet and the right amount of peppermint. Leaves your mouth feeling clean, naturally and without flouride or sulfates!</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful but the price is absurd so as much as I like the product, I would not purchase it through the web again.</li>
            <li> Finally found this toothpaste that is without sodium laurel sulphate which is in 99% of all other toothpastes and makes them foam. My reaction to this SLS ingredient has been bad.  It made the inside of my mouth burn and swell.  Burt&#x27;s Bees does not have SLS. The only problem I have with it is that it tends to get firm after a few uses and is hard to squeeze out of the tube.</li>
            <li> As you can see from my previous reviews, I am a Burt&#x27;s Bees groupie.  I love the fact that I can have wonderful products without all the chemicals and additives found in some of today&#x27;s health and beauty items.  Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Multicare Toothpaste is marketed as a minty-fresh, natural, and effective toothpaste that has been clinically proven to improve dental health.  With regular brushing, this toothpaste is supposed to reduce plaque, whiten teeth, promote healthy gums, and freshen breath.  It is made with real cranberry extract which is known to block bacteria from adhering to teeth and gums, so it helps prevent plaque formation before it starts.  This toothpaste is free of sodium lauryl sulfate and contains no artificial colors, flavors, preservatives, or sweeteners.  It contains 100% natural whitening agents (calcium sodium phosphosilicate and silica).  These products work by gently polishing away surface stains.  Burt&#x27;s Bees is also the first toothpaste brand to be certified by the Natural Products Association.      So when I saw this Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Multicare Fluoride Peppermint Flavor Toothpaste, I could hardly wait to get home a brush my teeth.  I was very disappointed.  The toothpaste was gritty and difficult to rinse out.  The peppermint taste was OK, similar to what I remember Crest Toothpaste tasting like when I was a kid.  But my biggest complaint was that my teeth did not feel any cleaner after I brushed them, than they did before I started.  At $4.99 suggested retail for a 4 ounce tube, the Burt&#x27;s Bees also has a higher price point than other Multicare toothpastes, but I would have been willing to pay more for this natural product if it had met my expectations as far as cleaning my teeth.    I can not speak to the whitening aspect of this natural multicare toothpaste, as I did not use it for 2 weeks to see any significant results.  In fact, I discontinued using it after 3 days because I could not get past the gritty, unclean feeling it left on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best there is! Helps with my cold sensitive teeth and the flavor is not overpowering! Just sad it has been discontinued! Don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;ll do when I run out!</li>
            <li> My family and I were really sad when they discontinued their whole toothpaste line. This was the one toothpaste that fit all of our needs. I wanted floride free and my husband can&#x27;t have SLS or he gets terrible canker sores. It did a great job with breath, sensitive teeth and whitening. We are very sad to lose this product.</li>
            <li> My husband can only use this brand of tootpaste and we cannot get it anywhere! This product was just as described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> We bought this as a natural alternative to the current toothpastes that have all kinds of additives.  Tastes good. Kind of pricy for the amount in the tube but recommend.</li>
            <li> I loved this at first but unfortunately I have to warn everyone against it. The ingredient list is awesome (Novamin! Xylitol! no SLS! no saccharine!), it tastes good, and even though there are minor problems with packaging and its a bit goopy and, I would have been loyal to this forever - except for the HUGE problem: It made my whole family&#x27;s teeth so ultra-sensative. I am NOT reviewing the whitening version - it was the regular Multicare with Fluoride. After using two tubes (one in the kids&#x27; bathroom, one in the adults&#x27;), the kids were crying when we brushed their teeth and all of us had so much pain especially near our gums, we couldn&#x27;t eat anything salty, sour, sweet, cold or hot. We could barely brush our teeth with water. My teeth have never been so sensitive, even with whitening treatments. We stopped using it a few days ago and our pain is reducing. I can only think it must be too abrasive? Don&#x27;t know what else could be causing it, especially since Novamin is supposed to decrease sensitivity. I&#x27;ve also used Novamin on and off for years and never experienced this. I&#x27;m very sad about it. If Burt&#x27;s Bees ever makes a low-abrasion formula, I will buy a case of it.</li>
            <li> Great item that does not contain SLS.  Too bad they stopped making it.  Highly recommend it for people with SLS allergies.</li>
            <li> I bouught a tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees toothpaste in a drugstore.  To my delight it has been the only tooth paste I have used to this day that does not burn my mouth, I could not find  it anymore so  went on-line and found I could order it.  I ordered 4 tubes and will reorder when this is gone.  It is mild and does a great job without burning my mouth.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After initially reviewing this company and noting that my order hadn&#x27;t arrive and that the company wasn&#x27;t answering their phones, I was contacted quickly and told that they&#x27;d send my order out immediately.  I received my items quickly, and am pleased with the follow-up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She had a problem with angular chelitis and this is the only product that keeps it under control.</li>
            <li> I loved this toothpaste as it is the only one that actually has a decent taste. I cannot use toothpaste with SLS and most others taste horrific. I stocked up for awhile, but need to start researching a new brand to purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is SLS-free.  I get frequent canker sores, and while I can&#x27;t say I get them less often, I CAN say that when I do get them, with this toothpaste I can brush my teeth without experiencing the burning of the SLS in regular toothpaste.  It is minty and fresh, and I feel my teeth get plenty clean despite the lack of grit and foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who experience the tube splitting, I have found that unscrewing the whole cap instead of using the flip top helps prevent the splitting.  The flip top is hard to snap off on some tubes anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also less expensive than other SLS-free toothpastes.  That&#x27;s been my observation, anyway.</li>
            <li> No aspartame in the product!! Love the way my teeth feel after each use and the taste is wonderful as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different natural toothpaste, and this is the best yet. It works well, and he spearmint taste really leaves a fresh feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I chose to give this toothpaste 4-stars because although it is one of the best toothpastes I have found, it is a tad pricey. Toothpaste can be cheaper than a dollar per 6-ounces, but this is much higher. On the other hand if you have the money to spend, or really care for your oral health, then this is probably your product..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride - Long implicated in improving tooth strength (reduces cavities)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xylitol - Non-digestible by bacteria, and yet some studies show that bacteria attempt to consume it, thus starving them and &#x27;distracting&#x27; them from real sugars. A type of sugar alcohol used to sweeten and to prevent bacterial growth. May cause mineralization of the saliva, increasing the strength of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;calcium sodium phosphosilicate (AKA NovaMin) - Decreases sensitivity and increases remineralization of teeth through release of calcium and phosphate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silica, hydrated silica - Used for abrasive purposes to help remove bacteria and to help whiten teeth. If your teeth are strong and whitening is your goal, then this is good. If your teeth are weak, make sure you use an extra soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cranberry - Potentially helpful for preventing gingivitis/cavities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for months and am very satisfied. This is a very good toothpaste (even when compared with regular, non-natural toothpastes).</li>
            <li> one word: fluoride. I suggest the Jason fluoride-free toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Colgate Total for years and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it.  However, I purchased this toothpaste primarily because it was one of the only toothpastes that contains calcium sodium phosphosilicate (aka NovaMin), that was affordable.  For those unfamiliar with calcium sodium phosphosilicate, it is the _only_ material that research has shown to help remineralize teeth.  It&#x27;s also a desensitizer; the gums of one of my molars has receded slightly over the years, and I basically get Sensodyne for free while remineralizing my teeth.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the other ingredients as well -- in addition to the promoted cranberry stuff, xylitol is pretty beneficial for a toothpaste to have as well.  All around an excellent product for tooth care.</li>
            <li> My 4 year-old was getting consistent canker sores. We tried this toothpaste (because it&#x27;s sulfide free but also has fluoride) and the canker sores cleared up. When he ran out, and or grocery store no longer carries it, we tried a regular toothpaste again, and he quickly got a bad sore. Thank goodness Amazon carries this product!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste tastes ok and seems to clean our teeth, but it is very gooey (like melted cheese), sticks to the cap and gets all over the sink if not careful.</li>
