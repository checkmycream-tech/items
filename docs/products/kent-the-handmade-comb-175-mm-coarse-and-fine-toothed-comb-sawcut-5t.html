            <li>I just hoped it would be better than the Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And the teeth are soooooo smooth!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I went with this one.</li>
            <li>Handsome.</li>
            <li>soon as I opened the package and held the comb, I knew I got a top notch product.</li>
            <li>, the comb is fabulous!</li>
            <li>What more can I say.  </li>
            <li>I really love the way these feel.</li>
            <li>I have never had a manufactured comb feel as smooth and nice as the ones claiming to be hand made.</li>
            <li>Outstanding quality.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>love the Kent</li>
            <li>That way I can keep the 175 mm home safe without the danger of losing it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad that I bought this</li>
            <li>I also have an water buffalo comb that I like a lot, but this one may be my favorite of the two.</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be writing a rave review about a comb, but here I am: This is the best comb that I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands including Mason Pearson but this is the one for me.  </li>
            <li>excellent product, product lasts LONG time, will purchase again IF needed</li>
            <li>It came in a very nice packagind with a magazine that lists mens hair grooming products, mostly high quality.</li>
            <li>I ordered the combo model and am glad I did because I find myself using the fine teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, I haven&#x27;t been able to find a decent comb at the drugstore since Ace made good combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being able to do a side by side comparison convinced to put the Layrite comb into storage probably never to see the light of day again.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, though, it works well with my hair.</li>
            <li>Shipping/delivery was super fast, if your looking for an great comb either for beard or head hair</li>
            <li>This comb works perfectly and so much better than my previous cheap-o comb.</li>
            <li>He likes it because it is easy to use and hold onto and glides through his hair.</li>
            <li>The material is strong but flexible.  </li>
            <li>These combs are nice quality and actually feel good on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality and very appropriate for beards.</li>
            <li>I liked the Conair comb at first.  </li>
            <li>And at first I liked it.  </li>
            <li>I have rather fine</li>
            <li>Does not snag even when using the fine side of the comb (which I can&#x27;t believe).</li>
            <li>, you can buy a dozen cheap combs for the price of this one, but for me, that isn&#x27;t the point.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my son who has very curly hair and needed his own comb (instead of using mine and gunking it up with his hair stuff).</li>
            <li>but now I realize it was because the comb was cheap.</li>
            <li>Smooth on the scalp.</li>
            <li>This was a &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; to bring the purchase amount to qualify for free delivery.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size for an everyday comb</li>
            <li>I wish they were available in pocket size.</li>
            <li>Great comb, if your looking for a larger size comb.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t really mind as the comb itself is just amazing.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s heavier than cheap rubber-plastic) onto a rock hard surface from great heights!  </li>
            <li>The material is also the easiest to clean I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>The teeth on the Kent comb were not sharp but the tips nicely rounded and smooth.</li>
            <li>Both the Original and the Super Hold.  </li>
            <li>This is a comb - I like it best among the combs I&#x27;ve had, but it&#x27;s hard to justify the expense if you are just trying to keep your hair neat.</li>
            <li>Wow, I didn&#x27;t think this comb was so amazing.</li>
            <li>Great for back combing very sturdy!</li>
            <li>but if anything buy it and frame it because it is soo cool.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price compared to the cheap drug store combs that I was using.</li>
            <li>All the hipe is true.</li>
            <li>This comb really does comb your hair better.</li>
            <li>Its claim of not scratching your scalp is true.</li>
            <li>I love them so much, in fact, that I bought their comb.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find anything this good in local stores.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, well made item with the feel of a quality tool.</li>
            <li>Generally I put my comb away with my hair styling tools, but if I forget to put this one away, well, it just happens to look nice even though it&#x27;s out of</li>
            <li>The teeth don&#x27;t have much flex either which makes combing my hair so easily.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize all this years how much I&#x27;ve missed out by using a cheap comb.</li>
            <li>I had no idea that this kind of quality could be put into a simple comb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very smooth feeling on the scalp, doesn&#x27;t scratch it at all like many other combs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not a super pocket friendly comb, but there&#x27;s other sizes if you need that kind.</li>
            <li>Good for medium length hair, if you have very long hair a larger comb may be better.</li>
            <li>This brand was new to me but looked exactly like my last brand and felt every bit as good in use.</li>
            <li>I sport a medium hair length on top and short on the side and combing is just a breeze with this comb.</li>
            <li>Ten more words</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted &amp; ordered.</li>
            <li>It goes through a ruff beard like a hot knife through butter leaving it very well groomed.</li>
            <li>I like to use the fine teeth for the sides and the coarse teeth for the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion</li>
            <li>The comb&#x27;s smooth surface allows my damp hair to glide freely adding a little bit of shine (don&#x27;t ask me how).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never seen a Kent comb in real life, so</li>
            <li>This is a very good-looking comb, too.  </li>
            <li>This is a very hefty, sturdy comb.</li>
            <li>You can tell it is very well made</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t pay much attention to beauty products but</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and has not broken (yet).  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much it scratched my scalp before using the Kent.  </li>
            <li>, glides through my very course beard hair with ease.</li>
            <li>Nothing to really knock off here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Who would have thought that a Kent Comb would feel so much better than a regular old plastic comb.  </li>
            <li>Overall, my favorite comb I have every used thus far.</li>
            <li>This comb is very sturdy, doesn&#x27;t cause static or damage the hair like other combs that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is my second one and the only reason I had to buy a second one is because someone STOLE my first one from my own bathroom.</li>
            <li>I never realized combing could be a decent experience rather than scrapes, courseness, and tangles.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I always thought that to be normal</li>
            <li>One a bit smaller that I can easily keep in my back pocket when I go out.  </li>
            <li>As with all my good combs I wash them in cold running water, never soak use an old toothbrush to clean the teeth of the combs with that method</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good, quality comb that will last for years and don&#x27;t mind paying a little extra for it, this is it.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Pretty simple device, but these are done well.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to pay a price like this for a comb, but really, it&#x27;s something I use multiple times a day.  </li>
            <li>No scalp scratching, and it&#x27;s not heavy, either.  </li>
            <li>This comb will last me a lifetime and makes combing my hair so much easier and effortless.</li>
            <li>so much that I recently purchased another one.  </li>
            <li>It is much heavier than your traditional plastic drug store combs.</li>
            <li>so when I purchased this comb, I expected to be of quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li>It also detangles easily and with very little pain.</li>
            <li>I went shopping when my old plastic comb finally gave up the ghost, and I figured I would look for as high quality as I could find.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this comb, and will likely be buying another like it soon.</li>
            <li>The only downside of this quality is that the maker must use a highly dense plastic to make the smoothness.  </li>
            <li>It cost very little, but the teeth were smooth and didn&#x27;t break off.  </li>
            <li>This comb had favorable reviews, and certainly wasn&#x27;t the most expensive.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s back to new and shiny.</li>
            <li>But it is kind of small and not really worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement comb, this should be a long term classic.</li>
            <li>The feel of it was different from the cheap combs I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is a clear and definite step-up from anything you&#x27;d buy in a pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Wow, such a difference!  </li>
            <li>little information to help those of you who might be wondering if this comb is right for you</li>
            <li>The next one broke, too, and they all broke just slightly off the center, on the fine side.  </li>
            <li>I almost ordered one with only coarse teeth because that was the end I used with my old comb.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair, my boy has thin hair, and it works great for both of us.</li>
            <li>so when i say a comfortable weight, I don&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s heavy but balanced in the sense that it&#x27;s not too heavy or too light but feels just right.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li>Good comb for my bad hair.</li>

            <li> This was a &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; to bring the purchase amount to qualify for free delivery.  </li>
            <li> Perfect size for an everyday comb</li>
            <li> I wish they were available in pocket size.</li>
            <li> Great comb, if your looking for a larger size comb.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t really mind as the comb itself is just amazing.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s heavier than cheap rubber-plastic) onto a rock hard surface from great heights!  </li>
            <li> The material is also the easiest to clean I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> The teeth on the Kent comb were not sharp but the tips nicely rounded and smooth.</li>
            <li> Both the Original and the Super Hold.  </li>
            <li> This is a comb - I like it best among the combs I&#x27;ve had, but it&#x27;s hard to justify the expense if you are just trying to keep your hair neat.</li>
            <li> Wow, I didn&#x27;t think this comb was so amazing.</li>
            <li> Great for back combing very sturdy!</li>
            <li> but if anything buy it and frame it because it is soo cool.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price compared to the cheap drug store combs that I was using.</li>
            <li> All the hipe is true.</li>
            <li> This comb really does comb your hair better.</li>
            <li> Its claim of not scratching your scalp is true.</li>
            <li> I love them so much, in fact, that I bought their comb.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find anything this good in local stores.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, well made item with the feel of a quality tool.</li>
            <li> Generally I put my comb away with my hair styling tools, but if I forget to put this one away, well, it just happens to look nice even though it&#x27;s out of</li>
            <li> The teeth don&#x27;t have much flex either which makes combing my hair so easily.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize all this years how much I&#x27;ve missed out by using a cheap comb.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that this kind of quality could be put into a simple comb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very smooth feeling on the scalp, doesn&#x27;t scratch it at all like many other combs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a super pocket friendly comb, but there&#x27;s other sizes if you need that kind.</li>
            <li> Good for medium length hair, if you have very long hair a larger comb may be better.</li>
            <li> This brand was new to me but looked exactly like my last brand and felt every bit as good in use.</li>
            <li> I sport a medium hair length on top and short on the side and combing is just a breeze with this comb.</li>
            <li> Ten more words</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted &amp; ordered.</li>
            <li> It goes through a ruff beard like a hot knife through butter leaving it very well groomed.</li>
            <li> I like to use the fine teeth for the sides and the coarse teeth for the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion</li>
            <li> The comb&#x27;s smooth surface allows my damp hair to glide freely adding a little bit of shine (don&#x27;t ask me how).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never seen a Kent comb in real life, so</li>
            <li> This is a very good-looking comb, too.  </li>
            <li> This is a very hefty, sturdy comb.</li>
            <li> You can tell it is very well made</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t pay much attention to beauty products but</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and has not broken (yet).  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much it scratched my scalp before using the Kent.  </li>
            <li> , glides through my very course beard hair with ease.</li>
            <li> Nothing to really knock off here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that a Kent Comb would feel so much better than a regular old plastic comb.  </li>
            <li> Overall, my favorite comb I have every used thus far.</li>
            <li> This comb is very sturdy, doesn&#x27;t cause static or damage the hair like other combs that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is my second one and the only reason I had to buy a second one is because someone STOLE my first one from my own bathroom.</li>
            <li> I never realized combing could be a decent experience rather than scrapes, courseness, and tangles.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I always thought that to be normal</li>
            <li> One a bit smaller that I can easily keep in my back pocket when I go out.  </li>
            <li> As with all my good combs I wash them in cold running water, never soak use an old toothbrush to clean the teeth of the combs with that method</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a good, quality comb that will last for years and don&#x27;t mind paying a little extra for it, this is it.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Pretty simple device, but these are done well.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to pay a price like this for a comb, but really, it&#x27;s something I use multiple times a day.  </li>
            <li> No scalp scratching, and it&#x27;s not heavy, either.  </li>
            <li> This comb will last me a lifetime and makes combing my hair so much easier and effortless.</li>
            <li> so much that I recently purchased another one.  </li>
            <li> It is much heavier than your traditional plastic drug store combs.</li>
            <li> so when I purchased this comb, I expected to be of quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li> It also detangles easily and with very little pain.</li>
            <li> I went shopping when my old plastic comb finally gave up the ghost, and I figured I would look for as high quality as I could find.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this comb, and will likely be buying another like it soon.</li>
            <li> The only downside of this quality is that the maker must use a highly dense plastic to make the smoothness.  </li>
            <li> It cost very little, but the teeth were smooth and didn&#x27;t break off.  </li>
            <li> This comb had favorable reviews, and certainly wasn&#x27;t the most expensive.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s back to new and shiny.</li>
            <li> But it is kind of small and not really worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement comb, this should be a long term classic.</li>
            <li> The feel of it was different from the cheap combs I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is a clear and definite step-up from anything you&#x27;d buy in a pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Wow, such a difference!  </li>
            <li> little information to help those of you who might be wondering if this comb is right for you</li>
            <li> The next one broke, too, and they all broke just slightly off the center, on the fine side.  </li>
            <li> I almost ordered one with only coarse teeth because that was the end I used with my old comb.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, my boy has thin hair, and it works great for both of us.</li>
            <li> so when i say a comfortable weight, I don&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s heavy but balanced in the sense that it&#x27;s not too heavy or too light but feels just right.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> Good comb for my bad hair.</li>
            <li> This comb is light years ahead of the typical plastic or nylon combs usually found in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have a very thick, long and coarse beard and this glides through it as smooth as possible.</li>
            <li> ladies will come running when you pull this sucker out of your pocket ;)</li>
            <li> Feels sturdy and will probably last me a long time.</li>
            <li> After suffering through several of those rubbery imitation &amp;#34;Ace&amp;#34; combs that you find in buckets at the local drug store, I figured I&#x27;d cough up a few extra duckets and try one of these highly touted &amp;#34;Kent&amp;#34; combs.  </li>
            <li> The teeth seem to be a little further apart than my old Acme comb which some people may want to take into consideration when ordering.</li>
            <li> Simple and not so rough on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle on my scalp, and seems to be unlikely to break off any teeth due to the high quality of the material it is made of.</li>
            <li> Showed up earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> The Kent Sawcut 5T is glass-smooth along every surface and between every single tooth.  </li>
            <li> A few months later, it broke.  </li>
            <li> So as a user, you must be careful not to drop the comb</li>
            <li> The size is not really one for travel, rather a one to keep at home.</li>
            <li> Put down that regular everyday Joe comb....</li>
            <li> It feels expensive and very high quality when you hold it in your hands.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m a mid 20&#x27;s male with short, thick (read: THICK), wavy hair that is quite hard to tame.</li>
            <li> My wife, who has always used a brush to yank through her long, thick hair, is now using this product, as well.</li>
            <li> The previous combs I use had sharp teeth that after a while go dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the comb for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s sturdy enough to get the tangles out of my beard in the morning without getting tangled up and making it worse.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased an Ace comb, it felt like it was cutting me.</li>
            <li> Rugged thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s darn frustrating to have one break during morning ablutions.  </li>
            <li> and, sorry to say, thinning hair.</li>
            <li> It feels like I&#x27;m holding an expensive comb.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be mad trust me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good comb for my bad hair. I apply pomade to my hair and then part it to the side. This comb works perfectly and so much better than my previous cheap-o comb.</li>
            <li> Used to be, I could buy an Ace comb and use it till I lost it, and the quality was good.  The last time I bought an Ace comb, it scratched my scalp.  So I tried Conair.  I liked the Conair comb at first.  It cost very little, but the teeth were smooth and didn&#x27;t break off.  But after a while, my Conair broke.  So I bought another one.  A few months later, it broke.  The next one broke, too, and they all broke just slightly off the center, on the fine side.  Obviously there is a quality issue with Conair combs.  In fact, I haven&#x27;t been able to find a decent comb at the drugstore since Ace made good combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I looked around here at Amazon.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting to pay a price like this for a comb, but really, it&#x27;s something I use multiple times a day.  This comb had favorable reviews, and certainly wasn&#x27;t the most expensive.  I&#x27;d never seen a Kent comb in real life, so I didn&#x27;t know what I was getting when I ordered.  I just hoped it would be better than the Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report it is!  It&#x27;s the perfect size for me.  The material is strong but flexible.  It&#x27;s not going to snap or lose teeth.  And the teeth are soooooo smooth!  No scalp scratching, and it&#x27;s not heavy, either.  This is a very good-looking comb, too.  Generally I put my comb away with my hair styling tools, but if I forget to put this one away, well, it just happens to look nice even though it&#x27;s out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can buy a dozen cheap combs for the price of this one, but for me, that isn&#x27;t the point.  Combs shouldn&#x27;t break.  It&#x27;s darn frustrating to have one break during morning ablutions.  This won&#x27;t, so you don&#x27;t need to store a bunch of cheapies as backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most excellent quality.</li>
            <li> This is a very hefty, sturdy comb. I bought it for my son who has very curly hair and needed his own comb (instead of using mine and gunking it up with his hair stuff). He likes it because it is easy to use and hold onto and glides through his hair. I highly recommend this comb, and will likely be buying another like it soon.</li>
            <li> This is just an awesome comb, the best I&#x27;ve ever had. I went shopping when my old plastic comb finally gave up the ghost, and I figured I would look for as high quality as I could find. I am so glad I went with this one. The material they use in the combs is just sublimely smooth and it feels good going through your hair. I never realized combing could be a decent experience rather than scrapes, courseness, and tangles. The material is also the easiest to clean I have ever seen. You can just even run your hands over it when you&#x27;re done and it&#x27;s back to new and shiny. What a comb, that&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
            <li> Well made. Handsome. I bought this for myself and my wife started using and she uses it on our boys as well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Put down that regular everyday Joe comb....you&#x27;re a Kent man.</li>
            <li> Rugged thick and sturdy. What else can you say about a comb. You can tell it is very well made</li>
            <li> get it.. dont think twice i use it to for my sidepart but if anything buy it and frame it because it is soo cool. ladies will come running when you pull this sucker out of your pocket ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many combs and brushes in my life, and this is the best. My wife, who has always used a brush to yank through her long, thick hair, is now using this product, as well. It gets your hair where it needs to be, and it feels like a massage on your scalp. And no abuse to your hair, because there&#x27;s no plastic seam from the moulding process--this is hand cut. Just bought another for my mother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that does extensive research before buying a product. I read the specs, reviews and do my best to compare pricing and quality with the information at hand so when I purchased this comb, I expected to be of quality and worth the price. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. For years I&#x27;ve been using a comb that I had purchased from the grocery store&#x27;s beauty section. Being a guy I really don&#x27;t pay much attention to beauty products but ever since I got married, my wife insists that I always look my best since she goes through all the trouble to look her best for me. So I started a journey into improving everything and building up quality beauty products beginning with the basics such as shaving products and hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I opened the package and held the comb, I knew I got a top notch product. The feel of it was different from the cheap combs I&#x27;ve used in the past. The surface was very smooth and polished, gripped nicely and had a nice comfortable weight to it. I don&#x27;t always associate heaviness with quality so when i say a comfortable weight, I don&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s heavy but balanced in the sense that it&#x27;s not too heavy or too light but feels just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combing my hair with the Kent comb is so relaxing. The previous combs I use had sharp teeth that after a while go dull. I always thought that to be normal but now I realize it was because the comb was cheap. The teeth on the Kent comb were not sharp but the tips nicely rounded and smooth. The teeth don&#x27;t have much flex either which makes combing my hair so easily. I sport a medium hair length on top and short on the side and combing is just a breeze with this comb. I&#x27;ve been using the comb for a few weeks now and I can see how different my hair looks and feels. The comb&#x27;s smooth surface allows my damp hair to glide freely adding a little bit of shine (don&#x27;t ask me how). I like to use the fine teeth for the sides and the coarse teeth for the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the comb is fabulous! I didn&#x27;t realize all this years how much I&#x27;ve missed out by using a cheap comb. This comb will last me a lifetime and makes combing my hair so much easier and effortless. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Smooth on the scalp. I recently purchased an Ace comb, it felt like it was cutting me. This is very nice.</li>
            <li> I have used this comb for the last 8 months or so. Its great !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and has not broken (yet).  My wife loves it. What more can I say.  After all a comb is just a comb.</li>
            <li> Great comb. My wife loves it. Very attractive. A keeper. Ten more words so it puts all the hair in place so I can let it dry naturally. Feels substantial in the hand.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick, long and coarse beard and this glides through it as smooth as possible. It is definitely worth the price compared to the cheap drug store combs that I was using. This comb is very sturdy, doesn&#x27;t cause static or damage the hair like other combs that I&#x27;ve used. And it&#x27;s sturdy enough to get the tangles out of my beard in the morning without getting tangled up and making it worse.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy. I have thick hair, my boy has thin hair, and it works great for both of us. Works great for his pompadour and great for just styling, making parts, and cleans off well.</li>
            <li> Best comb I&#x27;ve ever bought. This is my second one and the only reason I had to buy a second one is because someone STOLE my first one from my own bathroom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comb.  This was a &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; to bring the purchase amount to qualify for free delivery.  In retrospect, I should have ordered the pocket size.</li>
            <li> if you are considering this, just get it.&lt;br /&gt;one of the best combs you&#x27;ll ever possess.&lt;br /&gt;it is a clear and definite step-up from anything you&#x27;d buy in a pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Great comb! Perfect size for an everyday comb</li>
            <li> Wow, I didn&#x27;t think this comb was so amazing. All the hipe is true. It goes through a ruff beard like a hot knife through butter leaving it very well groomed. It came in a very nice packagind with a magazine that lists mens hair grooming products, mostly high quality. It feels expensive and very high quality when you hold it in your hands. Very high quality and very appropriate for beards.</li>
            <li> This comb really does comb your hair better. You can feel and see the difference.</li>
            <li> I really love the way these feel. I have never had a manufactured comb feel as smooth and nice as the ones claiming to be hand made. This brand was new to me but looked exactly like my last brand and felt every bit as good in use.</li>
            <li> This comb is light years ahead of the typical plastic or nylon combs usually found in stores.  Outstanding quality.  I wish they were available in pocket size.</li>
            <li> This comb feels well made and it does do the job.  But it is kind of small and not really worth the price.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this comb as it doesn&#x27;t scratch is scalp.  It also is made from sturdy plastic....does not look like the 5&amp;10 brands.</li>
            <li> Great comb, if your looking for a larger size comb. Excellent quality as always.</li>
            <li> Awesome comb, a buddy of mine had one like this and I decided to get the larger version to keep at home (not in the pocket) and im really pleased KENT combs all the way! Plus they are hand made great product thanks again!</li>
            <li> This is a great comb. But then again, for the price it should be. Its claim of not scratching your scalp is true. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the short time I&#x27;ve been using it. The teeth seem to be a little further apart than my old Acme comb which some people may want to take into consideration when ordering. I have rather fine and, sorry to say, thinning hair. I almost ordered one with only coarse teeth because that was the end I used with my old comb. I ordered the combo model and am glad I did because I find myself using the fine teeth.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good, quality comb that will last for years and don&#x27;t mind paying a little extra for it, this is it.</li>
            <li> Well made comb. Feels sturdy and will probably last me a long time. I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s not like I comb my hair during the day. So, I likely won&#x27;t need another comb unless I lose this one.</li>
            <li> The comb was actually for my husband.  He likes the feel of sturdiness as he uses it.....to quote him, &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t feel wimpy.&amp;#34;  Also, the teeth don&#x27;t scratch his head.  I&#x27;m sure we will order again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Layrite pomades for my hair for years now and I love them.  Both the Original and the Super Hold.  I love them so much, in fact, that I bought their comb.  I figured the quality they put into their pomades would carry over to their combs.  And at first I liked it.  But that was before I bought the Kent handmade comb.  Wow!  What a difference!  Being able to do a side by side comparison convinced to put the Layrite comb into storage probably never to see the light of day again.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much it scratched my scalp before using the Kent.  I had no idea that this kind of quality could be put into a simple comb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Kent so much that I recently purchased another one.  One a bit smaller that I can easily keep in my back pocket when I go out.  That way I can keep the 175 mm home safe without the danger of losing it.  I&#x27;m now a customer for life.</li>
            <li> This is a comb - I like it best among the combs I&#x27;ve had, but it&#x27;s hard to justify the expense if you are just trying to keep your hair neat.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Excellent quality!</li>
            <li> This comb is awesome I&#x27;m really glad that I bought this, glides through my very course beard hair with ease. Does not snag even when using the fine side of the comb (which I can&#x27;t believe). I also have an water buffalo comb that I like a lot, but this one may be my favorite of the two. Also like the amber color of it. Seems well made an sturdy mite even carry it in my pocket. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll break unless dropped or thrown! As with all my good combs I wash them in cold running water, never soak use an old toothbrush to clean the teeth of the combs with that method you&#x27;re good too go. Shipping/delivery was super fast, if your looking for an great comb either for beard or head hair you won&#x27;t be mad trust me.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple device, but these are done well.  Now if it just holds up for twenty years like my last comb...</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, well made item with the feel of a quality tool. I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement comb, this should be a long term classic.</li>
            <li> Love this comb! Couldn&#x27;t find anything this good in local stores. It is very gentle on my scalp, and seems to be unlikely to break off any teeth due to the high quality of the material it is made of.</li>
            <li> The quality is something that you feel instantly while holding in your hand. It is much heavier than your traditional plastic drug store combs. The polished feature is suppose to prevent split ends and improve the health of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 4 days of use i have noticed the gold foil coated lettering is fading away but i don&#x27;t really mind as the comb itself is just amazing. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Exactly what I wanted &amp; ordered. Showed up earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be writing a rave review about a comb, but here I am: This is the best comb that I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life. It&#x27;s masterfully crafted and the old-school tortoiseshell look is a beautiful addition to anyone&#x27;s bathroom counter or dopp kit. Most importantly, though, it works well with my hair. Rather than buying a cheaply-made comb from the drugstore every two months, why not just invest in something that&#x27;ll last a lifetime?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little information to help those of you who might be wondering if this comb is right for you: I&#x27;m a mid 20&#x27;s male with short, thick (read: THICK), wavy hair that is quite hard to tame. Because it is sawcut the comb never gets stuck in my hair, nor does it pull out any hair.</li>
            <li> After suffering through several of those rubbery imitation &amp;#34;Ace&amp;#34; combs that you find in buckets at the local drug store, I figured I&#x27;d cough up a few extra duckets and try one of these highly touted &amp;#34;Kent&amp;#34; combs.  Wow, such a difference!  The Kent Sawcut 5T is glass-smooth along every surface and between every single tooth.  It glides through untangled hair like you&#x27;d applied butter to your hair by mistake.  The only downside of this quality is that the maker must use a highly dense plastic to make the smoothness.  So as a user, you must be careful not to drop the comb (it&#x27;s heavier than cheap rubber-plastic) onto a rock hard surface from great heights!  Otherwise you may chip a tooth.  So just don&#x27;t comb your tangled locks while leaning over a freeway overpass while stoned out of your mind, and your Kent comb will last forever until your kid steals it!</li>
            <li> Great for back combing very sturdy!</li>
            <li> Comb over made the girl come over.</li>
            <li> excellent product, product lasts LONG time, will purchase again IF needed</li>
            <li> No problem,met my expectations</li>
            <li> Excellent Comb. Very high quality and a great medium size. Also doesn&#x27;t scratch your head or hurt when combing like some tend to do. Nothing to really knock off here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a super pocket friendly comb, but there&#x27;s other sizes if you need that kind.</li>
            <li> This is a a great quality comb definitely worth the price, 10x better than purchasing the 1.00 comb at the drugstore. You can feel the quality through the thickness of the handle and the bristles. Would recommend this purchase the quality is just about the same as a Mason Pearson.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands including Mason Pearson but this is the one for me.  It feels like I&#x27;m holding an expensive comb.  I now have several Kent combs (and a brush.)</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that a Kent Comb would feel so much better than a regular old plastic comb.  These combs are nice quality and actually feel good on the scalp.  I will only buy Kent Combs in the future but based on the reviews I may not ever have to do that with such a quality product.</li>
            <li> Great quality and easy to use</li>
            <li> Great comb!  Simple and not so rough on my scalp.  Great buy and bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> Excellent comb. It is very smooth feeling on the scalp, doesn&#x27;t scratch it at all like many other combs. It also detangles easily and with very little pain. It is sturdy, and well built. The size is not really one for travel, rather a one to keep at home. Good for medium length hair, if you have very long hair a larger comb may be better. Overall, my favorite comb I have every used thus far.</li>
