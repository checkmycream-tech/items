            <li>Highly recommend, very happy</li>
            <li>The scent of this product is good, but it wears off very quickly.</li>

            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>If you love the lilac scent, you will love this spray.  </li>
            <li>Very clean and have had many compliments.  </li>
            <li>Smells exactly like what I was hoping!!!</li>
            <li>Lilac is my favorite flower, but since it blooms for a very short amount of time, I was happy to find this perfume.</li>
            <li>I smell a bit more Hyacinth than Lilac, which is a bit sweet for my taste.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s cheap, so for me that&#x27;s not a deal-breaker.</li>
            <li>This perfume is fantastic.</li>
            <li>just a light scent; but remains lilac.  </li>
            <li>It burns when you apply it and it smells really cheap.</li>
            <li>Light scent?</li>
            <li>It confirmed what I had already noticed.  </li>
            <li>It smells exactly like lilacs!!  </li>
            <li>would recommend it to anyone who loves the scent of fresh lilacs!  </li>
            <li>I wear it on special occasions, and sometimes when I want to &amp;#34;attract my honey to the bee&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, it&#x27;s hard to find lilac-scented perfume, but this one it a great product!  </li>
            <li>SHE LOVED IT, BRINGS BACK THE SMELLS OF OUR LILAC TREE THAT BLOOMS IN THE SPRING.&lt;br</li>
            <li>True lilac scent will buy again</li>
            <li>I had the solid perfume, which I loved but wanted the spray.  </li>
            <li>The lilac fragrance was so true to the flower that I just couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>It is just so light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I really thought it would be better because of the reviews</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPER QUALITY PRODUCT LOVE</li>
            <li>The rollerball smells so good and stays true to the french lilac scent.</li>
            <li>Best natural perfume I&#x27;ve used in a very long time.  </li>
            <li>scent lasts throughout the day, it doesn&#x27;t fade quickly.</li>
            <li>I have tried many lilac perfumes but most don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>when she passed away, the aroma brings back so many memories of her love...</li>
            <li>Its a soft lovely scent and not too over powering and smells exactly like fresh cut lilacs which are my favorite flower/shrub.  </li>
            <li>wonderful fresh lilac fragrance, short lasting though.</li>
            <li>Im alergic to many synthetic perfumes, this product is made from natural ingredients and does not seem to cause me any allergic symptoms.  </li>
            <li>Finally a perfume that really smells so good and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>It smells like fresh lillacs cut from my Grandma&#x27;s flower garden.</li>
            <li>If you love soft floral scents, this is the perfume for you.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume, and have had many compliments from other people</li>
            <li>Yesterday, I blended it with a spritz of the Indian Coconut which makes it a little less floral and a lot more delicious!  </li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>This perfume is wonderful and have bought this several times before and will continue down the road.</li>
            <li>I am a Lilac Scent nut as just the smell sends me time traveling back and reminds me of my Great Grandmother who raised me for most of my young life back in the 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>my new spring scent!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this bottle from Amazon and loved it so much I went to their website as they have tons of other products that go with this scent.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells *exactly* like my childhood memories of picking lilacs to bring home.</li>
            <li>I just wish that the concentration was a bit higher and that the skin could absorb it better so the scent would last.  </li>
            <li>the fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Pacifica &amp; Amazon!</li>
            <li>My current favorite.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with the French lilac spray.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I have been hunting for.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with Highland Lilac and Pacifica French Lilac</li>
            <li>really pretty lilac scent.  </li>
            <li>The beauty of this product is that, unlike many perfumes, it&#x27;s not trying to be something--it simply is that thing.</li>
            <li>Also, my first one leaked during shipping.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how much it smells like the lilacs that grew in my yard growing up!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go too well on me, but that&#x27;s a problem I have with quite a few gorgeous perfumes.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was fast, the price was very competative and the product rocks!  </li>
            <li>Very nice subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is not complex, but smells very much like Lilacs.</li>
            <li>...not much sillage.</li>
            <li>My mom loves lilacs and this scent is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>but it really is nothing like the lilac I had before.</li>
            <li>Just like real lilacs.</li>
            <li>I really like this scent, but it doesn&#x27;t have staying power.  </li>
            <li>I had suspected as much, but decided to test it.  </li>
            <li>Nice everyday perfume.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely buy again and hope that the \\&quot;smell of this Grandma\\&quot; will have the same affect on my own grandchildren as well.</li>
            <li>( Bath wash, Air Fresheners, Perfume solids, Roll ons and more) they also sent me several free samples of other scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Generally, they smell super perfumey and not at all like the flower they are trying to immitate</li>
            <li>And when it comes down to it, you only get 1 oz in this bottle, so it does not seem like THAT MUCH of a good value compared to all the designer fragrances.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love how is lasts and is not too heavy; i get lots of compliments; i wish they had a body lotion to go with it.</li>
            <li>Good perfume, only disappointment is that it goes on strong and then seems to wear off really fast.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy at all and lasts most of the day, though not heavily...</li>
            <li>All natural, no harmful stuff on your liver!</li>
            <li>I have bought the same perfume (at higher cost) in retail stores.  </li>
            <li>I originally wanted to buy the Aerin Lilac Path perfume, but the price made me look for other alternatives.</li>
            <li>This cologne has clean ingredients compared to all the other colognes and purfumes on the market.</li>
            <li>Considering how much I&#x27;ve paid for very expensive designer fragrance that doesn&#x27;t last but 30 minutes, this Pacifica was incredible.  </li>
            <li>Virtually the only pure lilac I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>It is so natural and heavenly.</li>
            <li>A soft feminine smell.</li>
            <li>Also, I prefer natural scents which are healthier than the synthetic scents that are overused in body wash, shampoos and conditioners as well as detergents.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that I would really like a cap.</li>
            <li>I found this brand at a local, high priced gift shop, but not in Lilac.  </li>
            <li>Ingredients are lilac fresh green and jasmine blended with helitrope and nectarine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a delicate scent, which never overwhelms a person negatively (like some perfumes can do) but it has good staying-power, too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and has natural ingredients.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Light scent?</li>
            <li> It confirmed what I had already noticed.  </li>
            <li> It smells exactly like lilacs!!  </li>
            <li> would recommend it to anyone who loves the scent of fresh lilacs!  </li>
            <li> I wear it on special occasions, and sometimes when I want to &amp;#34;attract my honey to the bee&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, it&#x27;s hard to find lilac-scented perfume, but this one it a great product!  </li>
            <li> SHE LOVED IT, BRINGS BACK THE SMELLS OF OUR LILAC TREE THAT BLOOMS IN THE SPRING.&lt;br</li>
            <li> True lilac scent will buy again</li>
            <li> I had the solid perfume, which I loved but wanted the spray.  </li>
            <li> The lilac fragrance was so true to the flower that I just couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> It is just so light and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I really thought it would be better because of the reviews</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPER QUALITY PRODUCT LOVE</li>
            <li> The rollerball smells so good and stays true to the french lilac scent.</li>
            <li> Best natural perfume I&#x27;ve used in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> scent lasts throughout the day, it doesn&#x27;t fade quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lilac perfumes but most don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> when she passed away, the aroma brings back so many memories of her love...</li>
            <li> Its a soft lovely scent and not too over powering and smells exactly like fresh cut lilacs which are my favorite flower/shrub.  </li>
            <li> wonderful fresh lilac fragrance, short lasting though.</li>
            <li> Im alergic to many synthetic perfumes, this product is made from natural ingredients and does not seem to cause me any allergic symptoms.  </li>
            <li> Finally a perfume that really smells so good and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> It smells like fresh lillacs cut from my Grandma&#x27;s flower garden.</li>
            <li> If you love soft floral scents, this is the perfume for you.  </li>
            <li> I love this perfume, and have had many compliments from other people</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I blended it with a spritz of the Indian Coconut which makes it a little less floral and a lot more delicious!  </li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> This perfume is wonderful and have bought this several times before and will continue down the road.</li>
            <li> I am a Lilac Scent nut as just the smell sends me time traveling back and reminds me of my Great Grandmother who raised me for most of my young life back in the 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> my new spring scent!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this bottle from Amazon and loved it so much I went to their website as they have tons of other products that go with this scent.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells *exactly* like my childhood memories of picking lilacs to bring home.</li>
            <li> I just wish that the concentration was a bit higher and that the skin could absorb it better so the scent would last.  </li>
            <li> the fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Thanks, Pacifica &amp; Amazon!</li>
            <li> My current favorite.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with the French lilac spray.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been hunting for.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Highland Lilac and Pacifica French Lilac</li>
            <li> really pretty lilac scent.  </li>
            <li> The beauty of this product is that, unlike many perfumes, it&#x27;s not trying to be something--it simply is that thing.</li>
            <li> Also, my first one leaked during shipping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how much it smells like the lilacs that grew in my yard growing up!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go too well on me, but that&#x27;s a problem I have with quite a few gorgeous perfumes.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was fast, the price was very competative and the product rocks!  </li>
            <li> Very nice subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It is not complex, but smells very much like Lilacs.</li>
            <li> ...not much sillage.</li>
            <li> My mom loves lilacs and this scent is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> but it really is nothing like the lilac I had before.</li>
            <li> Just like real lilacs.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent, but it doesn&#x27;t have staying power.  </li>
            <li> I had suspected as much, but decided to test it.  </li>
            <li> Nice everyday perfume.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely buy again and hope that the \\&quot;smell of this Grandma\\&quot; will have the same affect on my own grandchildren as well.</li>
            <li> ( Bath wash, Air Fresheners, Perfume solids, Roll ons and more) they also sent me several free samples of other scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Generally, they smell super perfumey and not at all like the flower they are trying to immitate</li>
            <li> And when it comes down to it, you only get 1 oz in this bottle, so it does not seem like THAT MUCH of a good value compared to all the designer fragrances.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love how is lasts and is not too heavy; i get lots of compliments; i wish they had a body lotion to go with it.</li>
            <li> Good perfume, only disappointment is that it goes on strong and then seems to wear off really fast.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy at all and lasts most of the day, though not heavily...</li>
            <li> All natural, no harmful stuff on your liver!</li>
            <li> I have bought the same perfume (at higher cost) in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> I originally wanted to buy the Aerin Lilac Path perfume, but the price made me look for other alternatives.</li>
            <li> This cologne has clean ingredients compared to all the other colognes and purfumes on the market.</li>
            <li> Considering how much I&#x27;ve paid for very expensive designer fragrance that doesn&#x27;t last but 30 minutes, this Pacifica was incredible.  </li>
            <li> Virtually the only pure lilac I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> It is so natural and heavenly.</li>
            <li> A soft feminine smell.</li>
            <li> Also, I prefer natural scents which are healthier than the synthetic scents that are overused in body wash, shampoos and conditioners as well as detergents.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I would really like a cap.</li>
            <li> I found this brand at a local, high priced gift shop, but not in Lilac.  </li>
            <li> Ingredients are lilac fresh green and jasmine blended with helitrope and nectarine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a delicate scent, which never overwhelms a person negatively (like some perfumes can do) but it has good staying-power, too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Considering that the picture on Amazon is close to actual size, that&#x27;s far too little product for the cost, anyway.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts a long time after you put it on.</li>
            <li> Very strange</li>
            <li> the cap of the bottle was not attached, just loose in the box, it never fit back on, i can&#x27;t get any of the perfume out...</li>
            <li> Would like a tiny bit lighter scent for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I have done this with other perfumes, and the scent was quite noticeable, sometimes lingering for weeks.  </li>
            <li> that sad thing is that I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> Found this at Whole Foods, but less expensive on here.</li>
            <li> the possibilities are endless!  </li>
            <li> The bottle is small (1 FL OZ) and comes in a box with no cap &amp; is a little pricey for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> have been using it for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> It really smells bad and I can&#x27;t wait to wash it off of my wrists.</li>
            <li> I usually go for lilac oil, for perfume usually makes me feel ill.</li>
            <li> I DID THINK IT WAS A LITTLE ON THE EXPENSIVE SIDE.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a fake &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li> sorry i had to return it.</li>
            <li> it sits, unable to be sprayed, on my desk..</li>
            <li> I tried this and one other perfume from this company and both gave me horrible headaches....</li>
            <li> This perfume is lilacs--not an overdone replica or an artificial interpretation.</li>
            <li> was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought for my Mom, she loves it.</li>
            <li> ...not much sillage. Be prepared to re-apply this every couple of hours. However, it&#x27;s cheap, so for me that&#x27;s not a deal-breaker.</li>
            <li> The French Lilac smells wonderful!! It&#x27;s not too heavy and smells just like the real thing. Why don&#x27;t these bottles have lids on them? Very strange but it won&#x27;t stop me from ordering again when needed.</li>
            <li> There is no smell that I love more than lilacs. I look forward to spring every year for the chance to smell them. This perfume smells *exactly* like my childhood memories of picking lilacs to bring home. I also love that this product it vegan and not tested on animals. I will definitely be buying this perfume again!</li>
            <li> This makes me feel soooo feminine and girly the moment I spray it on... my new spring scent!!!  Yesterday, I blended it with a spritz of the Indian Coconut which makes it a little less floral and a lot more delicious!  I love blending all of their scents... the chocolate with blood orange, the coconut with lemon.... the possibilities are endless!  LOVE everything about this... the quality and the price!  And I concur with another writer... spray on clothing, and the scent will last and last!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this and one other perfume from this company and both gave me horrible headaches....like have to leave work and go to bed headaches.  I must be allergic to some ingredient...that sad thing is that I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> This perfume is fantastic. I usually go for lilac oil, for perfume usually makes me feel ill. Not this stuff! It&#x27;s great &amp; I wear it every day!</li>
            <li> Im alergic to many synthetic perfumes, this product is made from natural ingredients and does not seem to cause me any allergic symptoms.  The scent is also wonderfully lite and pleasant not overbearing like so many perfumes out on the market.</li>
            <li> The scent of this perfume is just like a lilac.  Generally, they smell super perfumey and not at all like the flower they are trying to immitate but that is not the case with this perfume, it is very nice and not overpowering.  Will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is a really lovely lilac fragrance.  Its very strong and lasts for hours.  Its an aersol spray and comes without a cap.  Ingredients are lilac fresh green and jasmine blended with helitrope and nectarine.  Its a soft lovely scent and not too over powering and smells exactly like fresh cut lilacs which are my favorite flower/shrub.  Very nice.  I wish it came with a fancy cap but I still rate this 5 stars as its wonderful.  The best part of all is that this is gluten free for people allergic to gluten and its 100% vegan.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this at all, I have lots of lilacs in my yard and I know how they smell, this smells more like fly spray to me.</li>
            <li> I wore Lilac Perfume for years until I could no longer get it.  I found this brand at a local, high priced gift shop, but not in Lilac.  It was delivered timely and well protected from breakage.  I just wish that the concentration was a bit higher and that the skin could absorb it better so the scent would last.  I will probably order again from this supplier just to have the scent of Lilac again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume becauase I love lilac. The scent of this product is good, but it wears off very quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I receive so many compliments when wearing this scent. It is so natural and heavenly. It also lasts and lasts. You will hear a lot of, &amp;#34;What is that beautiful scent!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> GAVE TO WIFE FOR XMAS SHE LOVED IT, BRINGS BACK THE SMELLS OF OUR LILAC TREE THAT BLOOMS IN THE SPRING.&lt;br /&gt;WILL ORDER MORE  FOR SURE.</li>
            <li> Good perfume, only disappointment is that it goes on strong and then seems to wear off really fast. Otherwise love it, smells just like the flowers.</li>
            <li> True lilac scent will buy again</li>
            <li> I had the solid perfume, which I loved but wanted the spray.  I love the smell!!  It smells like lilac.  It isn&#x27;t heavy at all and lasts most of the day, though not heavily...just a light scent; but remains lilac.  great scent!!</li>
            <li> Great service, price and merchandise.  I wear my perfume daily.  Love the scent of it.  Thank you and keep up the great job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already bought two different scents from Pacifica after trying this one. The lilac fragrance was so true to the flower that I just couldn&#x27;t believe it. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Finally a perfume that really smells so good and lasts all day.  Considering how much I&#x27;ve paid for very expensive designer fragrance that doesn&#x27;t last but 30 minutes, this Pacifica was incredible.  I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on a perfume before.  From now on this is the only brand I will buy.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like what I was hoping!!! Love lilacs!!</li>
            <li> Nice everyday perfume.  It was as described and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Wear this perfume if you want to feel like you are surrounded by lilacs.  The scent lasts a long time after you put it on.</li>
            <li> He loves lilacs fragrance, and says this is the truest essence of lilacs he&#x27;s found.  I wear it on special occasions, and sometimes when I want to &amp;#34;attract my honey to the bee&amp;#34;.  Great perfume!</li>
            <li> I love this frangrance.  It is just so light and fresh.  It smells like fresh lillacs cut from my Grandma&#x27;s flower garden.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance.  Smells just like lilacs!</li>
            <li> Best natural perfume I&#x27;ve used in a very long time.  It doesn&#x27;t have a fake &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; smell.  It smells like I&#x27;m in a garden with lilacs.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely smell.  I feel that it is a linear fragrance.  I can detect lilac and hyacinth.  I smell a bit more Hyacinth than Lilac, which is a bit sweet for my taste.  But, all in all it&#x27;s a good fragrance.</li>
            <li> love it. Awesome smelling perfume</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love the fast delivery! This perfume is wonderful and have bought this several times before and will continue down the road.</li>
            <li> I got 1oz but wish they had bigger bottle of perfume. I have been looking around lilac perfume forever and found this one. Smells so wonderful</li>
            <li> I ordered the fragrance and the body butter. My niece loved the items. They arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This smelled great and just like lilacs, loved it!</li>
            <li> This smells so lovely. Found this at Whole Foods, but less expensive on here. All natural, no harmful stuff on your liver!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this scent- have been using it for a few months now.  It&#x27;s a delicate scent, which never overwhelms a person negatively (like some perfumes can do) but it has good staying-power, too.  It&#x27;s just so &amp;#34;springy&amp;#34; and makes me feel happy whenever I smell it.  It brings me back to those times I&#x27;ve stuck my nose in a bunch of lilac flowers out growing in the yard.  For some reason, it&#x27;s hard to find lilac-scented perfume, but this one it a great product!  Thanks, Pacifica &amp; Amazon!</li>
            <li> Lilac is my favorite flower, but since it blooms for a very short amount of time, I was happy to find this perfume. It&#x27;s long lasting and has natural ingredients. I&#x27;m very pleased with my bottle.</li>
            <li> It has the aroma of May.</li>
            <li> Very nice subtle fragrance.  I had purchased this before on my California vacation and was hoping to find it.  My current favorite.  This one was purchased as a gift for my sister.</li>
            <li> Great lilac smell, every time I wear it I receive compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent lasts throughout the day, it doesn&#x27;t fade quickly.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells just like lavender lilacs, I get complements on it all the time.  It smells great and is definately worth the money</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product from BBeauty2U and I could not have been happier.  The delivery was fast, the price was very competative and the product rocks!  If you love soft floral scents, this is the perfume for you.  I have always loved all of Pacifica&#x27;s products and this seller has the best prices by far.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother and she loved it. Smells like the flower she said.</li>
            <li> A great compliment to the lotion. A soft feminine smell.</li>
            <li> This is one of the all time best cologne&#x27;s for those who enjoy lilacs!  Many compliments when I wear it and this is my third bottle I have purchased!  AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product--it has a wonderfully refreshing scent--just like lilacs--and I&#x27;m wearing it almost every day now!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone who loves the scent of fresh lilacs!  Good service, good delivery too.</li>
            <li> My mom loves lilacs and this scent is the real deal.  She&#x27;s very happy with it whenever I send it to her.</li>
            <li> I have bought the same perfume (at higher cost) in retail stores.  I really love it because it is a very nice every day perfume that is discreet yet lasts throughout the day.  Also, I prefer natural scents which are healthier than the synthetic scents that are overused in body wash, shampoos and conditioners as well as detergents.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great, that is of course after the nauseating alcohol smell dissipates.  But if you love Lilac then you&#x27;ll get over it!  The bottle is small (1 FL OZ) and comes in a box with no cap &amp; is a little pricey for such a small amount. It is packaged well and protected. The perfume&#x27;s box came wrapped in a leopard wrapping paper, it looked nice.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the French lilac spray. It&#x27;s so crisp and refreshing!!</li>
            <li> This is a true beautiful lilac scent.  Virtually the only pure lilac I&#x27;ve found. It doesn&#x27;t go too well on me, but that&#x27;s a problem I have with quite a few gorgeous perfumes.  If you love lilac give this a try for yourself.  The price is right.</li>
            <li> Tiny bottle of the loveliest smelling lilac perfume. I didn&#x27;t realize I was ordering such a tiny bottle considering the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a Lilac perfume for awhile now, this one is spot on. I also noticed that it lasts ALL DAY. I get a lot of compliments on it. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lilac perfumes but most don&#x27;t last.  As a last resort I bought Pacifica French Lilac Spray Perfume.  It smells just like lilac and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been hunting for.</li>
            <li> It burns when you apply it and it smells really cheap. I really thought it would be better because of the reviews but it really is nothing like the lilac I had before.</li>
            <li> didn.t smell at all like lilacs.  was very disappointed. esecially after reading the feed backs. sorry i had to return it.</li>
            <li> Light scent? Try almost NO scent. You may as well splash yourself with water. Considering that the picture on Amazon is close to actual size, that&#x27;s far too little product for the cost, anyway. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> wonderful fresh lilac fragrance, short lasting though.</li>
            <li> Oh my God...it&#x27;s like spring all the time!!  It smells exactly like lilacs!!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves the smell of lilacs!!</li>
            <li> I use this perfume almost every day. I fell in love with Highland Lilac and Pacifica French Lilac is almost comparable. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This, too, smells just like lilacs that are my favorite flower and fragrance. I have been getting lots of compliments and my daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPER QUALITY PRODUCT LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I originally wanted to buy the Aerin Lilac Path perfume, but the price made me look for other alternatives. I think that this is a solid perfume for the price. It is not complex, but smells very much like Lilacs. It also lasts me several hours. The only problem is that I would really like a cap. And when it comes down to it, you only get 1 oz in this bottle, so it does not seem like THAT MUCH of a good value compared to all the designer fragrances. But still nice if you like florals.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE IN THE WORLD IS THAT OF THE LILAC! I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I COULD PURCHASE IT. IT&#x27;S VERY NICE. I DID THINK IT WAS A LITTLE ON THE EXPENSIVE SIDE.</li>
            <li> This smells incredible!  I love how is lasts and is not too heavy; i get lots of compliments; i wish they had a body lotion to go with it.</li>
            <li> really pretty lilac scent.  My sister-in-law recommended it.  Would like a tiny bit lighter scent for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> The beauty of this product is that, unlike many perfumes, it&#x27;s not trying to be something--it simply is that thing. This perfume is lilacs--not an overdone replica or an artificial interpretation. I am seriously impressed. Kudos.</li>
            <li> best smelling perfume ever. lilacs are my favorite scent, it captivated it perfectly..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however the cap of the bottle was not attached, just loose in the box, it never fit back on, i can&#x27;t get any of the perfume out... so  i have a beautiful bottle of unusable perfume on my desk... my mom wore this scent, when she passed away, the aroma brings back so many memories of her love... i remember her in a physical way.. i miss that..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it sits, unable to be sprayed, on my desk.. as i dont know what else to do with it.... it breaks my heart</li>
            <li> Smells great. Just like real lilacs.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent, but it doesn&#x27;t have staying power.  I had suspected as much, but decided to test it.  I sent myself a letter in which I had liberally sprayed the perfume all over a tissue and inserted it in the envelope while still damp.  I have done this with other perfumes, and the scent was quite noticeable, sometimes lingering for weeks.  In this case, I couldn&#x27;t smell a thing.  It confirmed what I had already noticed.  I still like the perfume, but feel like I must reapply occasionally.</li>
            <li> This cologne has clean ingredients compared to all the other colognes and purfumes on the market. Makes a great gift too.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this!  Very clean and have had many compliments.  Also, my first one leaked during shipping.  I informed the company I ordered through and they immediately sent me another one.  They responded to my e-mail within an hour!  You just don&#x27;t see customer service like this too often.  Would definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent in the rollerball..but this perfume in this form does not smell like the rollerball version. It really smells bad and I can&#x27;t wait to wash it off of my wrists. I am very disappointed! The rollerball smells so good and stays true to the french lilac scent. But this smells like a scented bathroom cleaner.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for someone who loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, and have had many compliments from other people how great it smells. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I am a Lilac Scent nut as just the smell sends me time traveling back and reminds me of my Great Grandmother who raised me for most of my young life back in the 1960&#x27;s. She had a lilac bush by her front steps and I would sit on the porch swing and read and get the waft of Lilacs. A moment I relive every time I smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this bottle from Amazon and loved it so much I went to their website as they have tons of other products that go with this scent. ( Bath wash, Air Fresheners, Perfume solids, Roll ons and more) they also sent me several free samples of other scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again and hope that the \\&quot;smell of this Grandma\\&quot; will have the same affect on my own grandchildren as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I&#x27;m amazed at how much it smells like the lilacs that grew in my yard growing up!  If you love the lilac scent, you will love this spray.  Highly recommend, very happy I found it on Amazon!</li>
