    <ol>
            <li> Smells like code. I wear code daily, sometimes twice depending on my plans, this bottle usually last me about a year.</li>
            <li> product was good but shipping was 2 days late</li>
            <li> while this is more expensive than all of my colognes I wear,I gladly spend the money because of the quality,and of course the scent. While it smells fantastic,it also lasts all day,unlike cheaper colognes. I have been wearing this for years and I will continue to. I get complimented on it very frequently</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this was legit, it had a very weak and none lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Great deal!!!!  It&#x27;s real too.</li>
            <li> Exquisite! Wealth and the high life are represented by this scent. James Bond would wear it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this cologne. I was originally given this cologne as a gift, many years back... and I still love it to this day.</li>
            <li> My favorite.  Great price for the large spray bottle.</li>

            <li> I am very skeptical when i order fragrances over the net, even though I pay a bit more at the mall, I know its 100% real.&lt;br /&gt;Just commenting on my experiences. I recently discovered the scent, is very pleasing, not overbearing, and stays on for a while, but&lt;br /&gt;expensive yes. It is a very nice clean fresh scent for men. Bought at macys for 90 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Problem with my skin is, no matter what cologne or what I do, it goes away very fast unless I dump the whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Literally gotta pump aboout 6-8 times just for it to stay on a few hours, but again great scent and thats my skin&#x27;s nature I guess, absorbs&lt;br /&gt;instead of permeates the cologne scents.</li>
            <li> My son and husband loved it</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s Favorite. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price, and free shipping with prime.</li>
