            <li>And my hands look gorgeous and feel gorgeous too.</li>
            <li>However, this time I ordered on Amazon and opted for the listing that featured 3 lotions for a good price.  </li>

            <li>I ordered 3 more tubes.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for years, now, the lilac scent is even better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s suppose it be for your hands but works well as an all purpose skin lotion it is not&lt;br /&gt;greasy and absorbs into your skin like magic.</li>
            <li>thank goodness for being Able to get on amazon:)</li>
            <li>I love using this for my hands.</li>
            <li>after just one time, my nails feel much better and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Have to admit, this is the best Lotion I&#x27; have used for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Plus the protein in it helps my nails remain healthy and strong.  </li>
            <li>I used to have to buy it at a farm supply store, but now it&#x27;s more widely available, thank goodness.  </li>
            <li>if you wear perfume or industry, this really isn&#x27;t going to affect it, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It is very nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>It can break easily.</li>
            <li>My fingernails have never been so strong.</li>
            <li>Helga W.&lt;br /&gt;Already shared the lotion with my Husband, he had chapped hands for some time, he found relieve with Mane&#x27;n Tail Hand &amp; Nail Therapy with first aplication, amazing product.</li>
            <li>Using it every day keeps my nails long, strong and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>It massages into the skin and leaves a grease free feeling.</li>
            <li>Thank you again amazon, for having it available on your web, since I&#x27;am a AMAZON shopper.</li>
            <li>Very soothing, nice scent, works as advertised.</li>
            <li>Price for 3 tubes was fantastic.</li>
            <li>After using this product, I have silky, smooth hands.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Wonderful hand and nail cream...absorbs quickly, not greasy, lightly scented...will certainly buy again</li>
            <li>So I was seeking a product that would make my hands nice and soft while giving my nails the boost they needed.</li>
            <li>When I opened package, one of the lotions had the product smeared on the outside of container and a good amount squirted all over the inside of box.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hands and feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave hands greasy.</li>
            <li>I am not good at using rubber gloves and this keeps my hands and nails their best.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>in addition to sensitive skin, i have a sensitive nose and this product has a pleasant, extremely mild odor that does not linger.  </li>
            <li>Product exactly as promised!</li>
            <li>Have to say thanks Amazon, for having this lotion available on your web.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very creamy and rich.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel right without my nails</li>
            <li>I used the cream specially for hands and it is very moisturising.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know why this stuff is hard to find, but glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The first application made my hands feel silky smooth, the cream isn&#x27;t super thick and rubs in nicely.</li>
            <li>It soaks in the skin very fast, does not leave oily skin and smell very nicely, unlike other natural products.</li>
            <li>i have my hands in water many, many times a day, so they get very dry and break out in ezema frequently.  </li>
            <li>(I use this on my feet too), because the nails are so pretty.</li>
            <li>The  Mane &#x27;n Tail Hoofmaker lotion is an excellent product which I have used for the past several years and have purchased in stores.</li>
            <li>The handcream itself is absorbed reasonably well without being too greasy, but I find the smell somewhat obnoxious and for this reason would not buy it again.</li>
            <li>well, someone really treats horses well!  </li>
            <li>this is an update from 2 1/2 years later:  still using this product and still completely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if everyone will get the same results, but it sure as heck works for me.</li>
            <li>Though I suspect that most of the strengthening is because of Hoofmaker since I&#x27;ve been taking that vitamin since December of last year and it hasn&#x27;t done much in the way of helping my nails.</li>
            <li>This product is good for all hand conditions, male or female.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the fact it really is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have found this much more effective at handling weak nails as I grow older.  </li>
            <li>To give you an idea of how strong my nails have become with the twice daily use of Hoofmaker, they feel like acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>Soaks in very well, for instant smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>My nails drink in this product and it makes them grow so fast</li>
            <li>smooths and strengthens the nails, nails grow fast.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d try this product, nails are very brittle.  </li>
            <li>Price very reasonable,&lt;br /&gt;packaged  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes the Mane &#x27;n Tail product for his hands.  </li>
            <li>The cover is another issue, it is very flimsy.</li>
            <li>I have always had long, strong nails.</li>
            <li>i have even created my own refillable small tube of this to carry in my purse (and on flights)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Better results at far less cost.</li>
            <li>My hands have always been super dry and my nails??</li>
            <li>It smells just like the shampoo, so it&#x27;s a clean scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower or clash with other scents, so</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very sensitive to most lotions however this one hardly has any smell</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products and have come away dissatisfied as they take way to long to absorb or leave a greasy film.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of this lotion - it absorbs fast and can be used on both hands and body.</li>
            <li>I can frequently shape them.  </li>
            <li>You may have to continue using it; my nails got soft and chipped as before whenever I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>Rubs in completely and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>No longer smells like an old horse.</li>
            <li>I have naturally brittle nails, which split and misbehave if I don&#x27;t use Mane n&#x27; Tail.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and find it helps keep rough gardening hands in reasonable shape.  </li>
            <li>The other two were fine, just needed a little wiping.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The other two were fine, just needed a little wiping.  </li>
            <li> As far as nail strengthening, it does make them noticeably stronger, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s due entirely to this product or that I take a daily hair skin and nails vitamin.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding this cream where I live, so thank goodness for Amazon</li>
            <li> I have two fingers that are always splitting open when dry, and it seems they are almost always dry.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It soothes pain and discomfort caused by dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have faily dry hands</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too, which means this set will last me for a while.</li>
            <li> I think it looked purposeful since the lid of the smeared lotion bottle was closed.  </li>
            <li> It also works wonders on rough chapped hands.</li>
            <li> It is not available locally.</li>
            <li> carefully &amp; arrived promptly.  </li>
            <li> My hands still feels dry and tight after application of this location.</li>
            <li> - it works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always kept them trimmed way down because they would break and peel.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I had a high hopes when I bought this brand, but it failed.</li>
            <li> this is a thick lotion, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> All the others that say they help your nails grow and strengthen are just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It also keeps my hands from looking all dried out.</li>
            <li> I used to have dry skin and thin, brittle nails.  </li>
            <li> Have spend plenty of money on lotions and cream for hands, also feet in the past.</li>
            <li> After every hand washing I apply a small amount all over hands and rub into nails.  </li>
            <li> so I remember to apply it at least once a day.  </li>

            <li> This is the greatest hand lotion I have ever used.  I have been using it faithfully since I received it and there is such a difference in my hands - and nails - it&#x27;s incredible.  None of that sticky, left-over feeling even with multiple applications.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin cream.  It massages into the skin and leaves a grease free feeling.</li>
            <li> I used the cream specially for hands and it is very moisturising. It soaks in the skin very fast, does not leave oily skin and smell very nicely, unlike other natural products. I like my lotions natural, but I hate the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; smells asociated with them. I don&#x27;t have to stink in order to have nice hands.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail strengthening lotion out there. All the others that say they help your nails grow and strengthen are just a waste of money. It absorbs quickly, is not greasy. It leaves your hands feeling moisturized but not coated. I honestly don&#x27;t know why this stuff is hard to find, but glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have to admit, this is the best Lotion I&#x27; have used for dry skin.  Have spend plenty of money on lotions and cream for hands, also feet in the past. This takes care of all my problems. Glad I&#x27; ordered 3 tubes, will re-order when needed. Have to say thanks Amazon, for having this lotion available on your web. Helga W.&lt;br /&gt;Already shared the lotion with my Husband, he had chapped hands for some time, he found relieve with Mane&#x27;n Tail Hand &amp; Nail Therapy with first aplication, amazing product. Thank you again amazon, for having it available on your web, since I&#x27;am a AMAZON shopper. Sincerely H.Welch</li>
            <li> I have always had long, strong nails. That is, until I had my daughter, then, as often happens to women postpartum, my glorious nails became brittle and flimsy. I don&#x27;t feel right without my nails, it&#x27;s like having my fingertips cut off since I feel with them also. So I was seeking a product that would make my hands nice and soft while giving my nails the boost they needed. I was already using the Mane n Tail shampoo and conditioner, so I knew their products were good. I ordered this and as soon as it arrived, I opened a tube and tried it out. It smells just like the shampoo, so it&#x27;s a clean scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower or clash with other scents, so if you wear perfume or industry, this really isn&#x27;t going to affect it, which is a good thing. The first application made my hands feel silky smooth, the cream isn&#x27;t super thick and rubs in nicely. A little goes a long way too, which means this set will last me for a while. As far as nail strengthening, it does make them noticeably stronger, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s due entirely to this product or that I take a daily hair skin and nails vitamin. Though I suspect that most of the strengthening is because of Hoofmaker since I&#x27;ve been taking that vitamin since December of last year and it hasn&#x27;t done much in the way of helping my nails. To give you an idea of how strong my nails have become with the twice daily use of Hoofmaker, they feel like acrylic nails. And my hands look gorgeous and feel gorgeous too. I am reluctant to paint my nails or toenails, for that matter (I use this on my feet too), because the nails are so pretty. My husband likes it too, he used it on his sunburn and the burning went away. So, this is a great product and I am making this my go to lotion. Five stars!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, nice scent nit greasy</li>
            <li> Product works wonders! Would recommend it to anyone with dry skin.  It soothes pain and discomfort caused by dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very soothing, nice scent, works as advertised. The skin on my hands has improved and my nails are slowly improving.</li>
            <li> The  Mane &#x27;n Tail Hoofmaker lotion is an excellent product which I have used for the past several years and have purchased in stores. However, this time I ordered on Amazon and opted for the listing that featured 3 lotions for a good price.  When I opened package, one of the lotions had the product smeared on the outside of container and a good amount squirted all over the inside of box.  I think it looked purposeful since the lid of the smeared lotion bottle was closed.  The other two were fine, just needed a little wiping.  Why would this be sent this way? Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and find it helps keep rough gardening hands in reasonable shape.  Always use it after washing hands.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this lotion - it absorbs fast and can be used on both hands and body.</li>
            <li> I love this hand lotion.  It has a very pleasant scent and absorbs quickly with no sticky, greasy feel.  Plus the protein in it helps my nails remain healthy and strong.  In addition -- the price was very good!</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding this cream where I live, so thank goodness for Amazon&lt;br /&gt;It is great for your feet and hands. It absorbs well and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Someone gave me a Mane &#x27;n tail hoofmaker to try.  I am getting older and my nails are terrible.  This brought my nails back to life.  I ordered 3 more tubes.  I am on my last one and will be ordering it again.  It is great stuff.  It also keeps my hands from looking all dried out.</li>
            <li> The three tubes arrived well packed in snapwrap to avoid any danger of leakage.  The handcream itself is absorbed reasonably well without being too greasy, but I find the smell somewhat obnoxious and for this reason would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very sensitive to most lotions however this one hardly has any smell and it&#x27;s very creamy and rich.  Quickly absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave hands greasy.</li>
            <li> I used to have dry skin and thin, brittle nails.  My nails drink in this product and it makes them grow so fast I can frequently shape them.  After every hand washing I apply a small amount all over hands and rub into nails.  Finally found a product that actually works for me.</li>
            <li> smooths and strengthens the nails, nails grow fast. You may have to continue using it; my nails got soft and chipped as before whenever I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Rubs in completely and is non-greasy.  I have faily dry hands and this keeps them from cracking during the winter months.  Price for 3 tubes was fantastic.</li>
            <li> After using this product, I have silky, smooth hands.  They used to look snake skin!  Soaks in very well, for instant smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;Love it - ordered more.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I injoye this hand lotion.  It is very nice and soft.  your hands and nails thank you after using this.</li>
            <li> This product is good for all hand conditions, male or female. Been using it for years, now, the lilac scent is even better. No longer smells like an old horse.</li>
            <li> Mane and tail hand lotion is the best skin cream it&#x27;s suppose it be for your hands but works well as an all purpose skin lotion it is not&lt;br /&gt;greasy and absorbs into your skin like magic. It leaves your skin feeling silky. It also works wonders on rough chapped hands. This stuff is grreat can&#x27;t get it locally thank goodness for being Able to get on amazon:)</li>
            <li> I love using this for my hands. I am not good at using rubber gloves and this keeps my hands and nails their best.</li>
            <li> Love This Product! Feels so great on hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I have found this much more effective at handling weak nails as I grow older.  It is not available locally.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this product, nails are very brittle.  Price very reasonable,&lt;br /&gt;packaged  carefully &amp; arrived promptly.  Been using it for about 2 weeks &amp; it seems to be strengthening my nails.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying it!!!</li>
            <li> when i read the background on this product, i thought, horse stuff?  well, someone really treats horses well!  this is a thick lotion, so a little goes a long way.  i have my hands in water many, many times a day, so they get very dry and break out in ezema frequently.  this lotion absolutly halts that cycle!  in addition to sensitive skin, i have a sensitive nose and this product has a pleasant, extremely mild odor that does not linger.  i have even created my own refillable small tube of this to carry in my purse (and on flights) so i can always have it when i need it.  do try this product - it works extremely well.  this is an update from 2 1/2 years later:  still using this product and still completely satisfied with it.  I have been through 2 rough-on-hands winters now and would not trade this lotion for anything!</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the Mane &#x27;n Tail product for his hands.  Has used it for a good 2 years now.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  after just one time, my nails feel much better and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;used it on my feet, and just one application made a big difference.</li>
            <li> This is truly a great product, A co worker gave me my first tube of it and it is really a good product, however, it is not an over night cure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my nails for years.  I used to have to buy it at a farm supply store, but now it&#x27;s more widely available, thank goodness.  I have naturally brittle nails, which split and misbehave if I don&#x27;t use Mane n&#x27; Tail.  Using it every day keeps my nails long, strong and beautiful.  I keep a container on my desk so I remember to apply it at least once a day.  This is an amazing product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Seriously!  I use this one myself &#x27;cause I have two fingers that are always splitting open when dry, and it seems they are almost always dry.  I particularly like the fact it really is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  I have tried many other products and have come away dissatisfied as they take way to long to absorb or leave a greasy film.  Not this one.  I don&#x27;t know if everyone will get the same results, but it sure as heck works for me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hand and nail cream...absorbs quickly, not greasy, lightly scented...will certainly buy again</li>
            <li> My fingernails have never been so strong. Also, my wife was using for years a skin cream imported from Hungary, but she has changed to using Mail &#x27;n Tail. Better results at far less cost.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be moisturizing. I washes my hands at least hundred times a day from  the nature of my work. My hands still feels dry and tight after application of this location. The cover is another issue, it is very flimsy. It can break easily. I had a high hopes when I bought this brand, but it failed.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery!  Product exactly as promised!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I have a bottle in every purse and one in my car</li>
            <li> Good for skin recovery for climbing.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hands and feet nice and soft. I love the smell too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and cleaning with my  hands. My hands have always been super dry and my nails?? What nails? I&#x27;ve always kept them trimmed way down because they would break and peel.&lt;br /&gt;But now I have beautiful hands and lovely nails! I use this hand lotion all the time and no lie, it grows your nails out stronger!</li>
