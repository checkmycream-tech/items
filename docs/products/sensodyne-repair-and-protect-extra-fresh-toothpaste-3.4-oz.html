            <li>Also, very pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>Great deal.</li>

            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>i AM HAPPY WITH ALL OF THE SENSODYNE TOOTHPASTE</li>
            <li>It works very effectively</li>
            <li>the best toothpaste in the world, even better than Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li>On top of this it also is one of the best defenses against teeth sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A jolt that lasts a good 10, 15 seconds</li>
            <li>Sensodyne has too many varieties on the shelf.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, if that&#x27;s your thing.</li>
            <li>Tastes OK too</li>
            <li>In fact it worked wayyy better than the pronamel.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is great for those with sensitive teeth and it does the job.</li>
            <li>and I love the flavor, fresh mint.</li>
            <li>This product is very effective in keeping cavities off your teeth if you use regularly.</li>
            <li>love the seller but the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t work and my teeth are even more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste seems to clean well.</li>
            <li>&amp; my mouth became very sensitive more like burning...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The whole point of this toothpaste is to combine the fluoride and important reparative ingredients found in saliva into one.</li>
            <li>but I do notice a distinct &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; sensation -</li>
            <li>Something isn&#x27;t right with this &amp;#34;toothpaste&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Make sure use is consistent, pain will dissipate, but keep using for complete relief.</li>
            <li>I grabbed this, &amp;#34;Sensodyne Repair &amp; Refresh Extra Fresh&amp;#34;, thinking it was &amp;#34;Sensodyne Pronamel Fresh Breath&amp;#34;, which I had been happily using and has a similar packaging color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the only one that has experienced this--I thought I was going bonkers (or had 20 cavaties my dentist somehow missed during my last check up).</li>
            <li>First let me say, I didn&#x27;t purchase this product through Amazon.....</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>For the price paid I surely thought I was getting the larger tube.</li>
            <li>It is just a fluoride toothpaste, which is still good, but definately not worth the high price.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is pretty much the cause of what it claims to cure</li>
            <li>My teeth also became super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel the electric jolts or intense burning others complain of -</li>
            <li>You never realize how much of a life saver</li>
            <li>However, as soon as I brushed my teeth with Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect, I was surprised by the overwhelming burning sensation this toothpaste; as a result, I will not be using this particular product -  although it created an extremely fresh feeling after a thorough rinsing, it is not an option for overly sensitive teeth!  </li>
            <li>Sensodyne Repair and Protect is one of the only toothpastes to include an unique ingredient called Novamin.</li>
            <li>As usual, I am pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use the Sensodyne products that I can tolerate for however long they are available, just not not this particular product!</li>
            <li>I decided to try this new Repair and Protect version and yikes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sensodyne Whitening formula for a few years now and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks</li>
            <li>However, with the US release, they have completely omitted this new novamin technology!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is nothing special and is definately not worth the price.</li>
            <li>If your teeth and gums are already sensitive I cannot recommend this.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think my teeth were THAT sensitive...</li>
            <li>I had a really bothersome tooth, but there was no specific problem with it.</li>
            <li>Like Sensodyne because of sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Novamin combines the molecules found in saliva which naturally help to rebuild and repair enamel.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a coating on my tongue, and I&#x27;ve developed a sore on my tongue too.  </li>
            <li>Use for those sensitive teeth up front...</li>
            <li>I have been using Sensodyne products (mainly Pronamel and Full Protection Whitening) since their initial release with positive results; my teeth are noticeably less sensitive than prior to use...  </li>
            <li>, it worked within 4 days, I was able to withstand hot and cold on my teeth and the ache was gone.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my old toothpaste yesterday and hope I can reverse it.  </li>
            <li>It got to the point where I could barely move my mouth without it being in pain.</li>
            <li>I figured maybe this was normal chemistry of the &amp;#34;repairing&amp;#34; process, but it&#x27;s been getting increasingly &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; and harder to ignore.</li>
            <li>My teeth themselves are not any more or less sensitive, but then my problem was not sensitive teeth in the first place - it was weak enamel due to childhood scarlet fever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Might be due to the fact this toothpaste contains high percentage of stanus</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this version of Sensodyne for 4 days now and will be discontinuing usage due to a metallic taste in my mouth that never subsides and my teeth have become increasingly sensitive and tingly.  </li>
            <li> the past few years this toothpaste has been available in Europe.</li>
            <li> The next day my guns was so dry and irritated and fell like it was burned.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this Repair &amp; Protect version makes the inner lining of my mouth peel off unless I brush quickly and rinse thoroughly.</li>
            <li> After reading several other complaints about this product on the web, I don&#x27;t feel alone in my problem.</li>
            <li> Immediately after starting to brush my teeth, I experienced terrible sensitivity as if someone were applying ice to my gums and teeth!</li>
            <li> The underside of my tongue and the spot where your cheek meet your gums feel so badly dry.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and for the past 10 years I&#x27;ve been using Sensadyne products, which have helped immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using it and didn&#x27;t have any problem except my previously and naturally white teeth</li>
            <li> God bless Amazon subscription for keeping my teeth pain free and my addled brain on a timeline!</li>
            <li> That way even people with dry mouth syndrome or other tooth disorders can immediately start to benefit.</li>
            <li> I think the people who rated this 1 star must be hypersensitive because most people do not have a bad reaction to this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> turned DARK YELLOW over the last few weeks!  </li>
            <li> I just love it, i had such a horrible toothache and didn&#x27;t know if I should go to the dentist, but then i remembered that Sensodyne ad where it shows clogging the tiny holes in the dentin and I thought to try it.  </li>
            <li> My mouth is full of sores and I have 2 cold sores.</li>
            <li> It only got worse over the next few days.</li>
            <li> so that was $6 bucks down the drain....</li>
            <li> Dentist suggested this and within a few days of using this twice a day, the sensitivity subsided noticeably.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain any chemicals that are currently on the unhealthy list.</li>
            <li> My tongue was so sore and raw.</li>
            <li> You know that feeling when you&#x27;ve seriously burned the inside of your mouth, like with hot beverage or pizza,  and everything is painful to eat for a few days?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> No more problems with sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Also I heard there is already a recall on at least one lot of this stuff, so buyer beware.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s not what I ordered and Amazon should ban this product as it is not as advertised, at least not in the U.S!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I figured it would go away after a few days, but it just got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the worst toothpaste I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The Canadian version of this toothpaste has the novamin tech, but sadly the US version does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li> this product is until you run out of it and bite into something cold.</li>
            <li> I have used both this one, the whitening one and the pronamel one and have never had a bad reaction to any of them, and I&#x27;ve had a lot of cavities in my day, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> An insane jolt of sensitivity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great deal. It works very effectively</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does what it says it does. I alternate between this toothpaste and the regular Sensodyne</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product</li>
            <li> Sensodyne has too many varieties on the shelf. I grabbed this, &amp;#34;Sensodyne Repair &amp; Refresh Extra Fresh&amp;#34;, thinking it was &amp;#34;Sensodyne Pronamel Fresh Breath&amp;#34;, which I had been happily using and has a similar packaging color. Unfortunately, this Repair &amp; Protect version makes the inner lining of my mouth peel off unless I brush quickly and rinse thoroughly. It&#x27;s OK, if that&#x27;s your thing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine from Amazon - I got it at Walgreens. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past couple of weeks. You know that feeling when you&#x27;ve seriously burned the inside of your mouth, like with hot beverage or pizza,  and everything is painful to eat for a few days? I&#x27;ve been experiencing this - but I couldn&#x27;t remember burning my mouth on anything. I figured it would go away after a few days, but it just got worse and worse. When I brush my teeth I don&#x27;t feel the electric jolts or intense burning others complain of - but I do notice a distinct &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; sensation - I figured maybe this was normal chemistry of the &amp;#34;repairing&amp;#34; process, but it&#x27;s been getting increasingly &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; and harder to ignore. Today I finally put the 2 things together and realized it was the toothpaste burning my mouth and tongue all along. My teeth themselves are not any more or less sensitive, but then my problem was not sensitive teeth in the first place - it was weak enamel due to childhood scarlet fever. I don&#x27;t know if this has anything to do with it - but I&#x27;m also allergic to PFOAs and there are several procedures that trigger my allergy in the dentist office (ie. the stuff the dentist uses to make tooth impressions also burns my mouth.) Also I heard there is already a recall on at least one lot of this stuff, so buyer beware.</li>
            <li> First let me say, I didn&#x27;t purchase this product through Amazon.....HOWEVER! when I purchased this &amp; used it -it was like the skin inside of my mouth was melting away &amp; my mouth became very sensitive more like burning...I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for a dog let alone a human- Something isn&#x27;t right with this &amp;#34;toothpaste&amp;#34;. If your teeth and gums are already sensitive I cannot recommend this. The Pro Enamel toothpaste however is great. I wound up giving this to a cousin but he then told me it did the same thing to him....so that was $6 bucks down the drain....never again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like it. I have sensitive teeth and for the past 10 years I&#x27;ve been using Sensadyne products, which have helped immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not this toothpaste. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;extra fresh&amp;#34; in this or what, but I literally feel a jolt of sensitivity all over my teeth as soon as this paste touches them. An insane jolt of sensitivity. A jolt that lasts a good 10, 15 seconds--it&#x27;s enough for me to want to throw my toothbrush across the room. It&#x27;s terrible. I&#x27;m somewhat relieved to know I&#x27;m not the only one that has experienced this--I thought I was going bonkers (or had 20 cavaties my dentist somehow missed during my last check up). And even though the sensitivity lasts only 15 seconds or so and then subsides, those 15 seconds or torture. I had to throw this one in the trash. I didn&#x27;t think my teeth were THAT sensitive...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sensodyne Whitening formula for a few years now and love it. No more problems with sensitivity. I decided to try this new Repair and Protect version and yikes! Immediately after starting to brush my teeth, I experienced terrible sensitivity as if someone were applying ice to my gums and teeth! After reading several other complaints about this product on the web, I don&#x27;t feel alone in my problem. Plus, the warning label states this product can stain your teeth?!?!? Definitely tossing this in the trash!</li>
            <li> This really works! I had a really bothersome tooth, but there was no specific problem with it. Dentist suggested this and within a few days of using this twice a day, the sensitivity subsided noticeably. Still using it to maintain protection of tooth. Also, very pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> I just love it, i had such a horrible toothache and didn&#x27;t know if I should go to the dentist, but then i remembered that Sensodyne ad where it shows clogging the tiny holes in the dentin and I thought to try it.  I tell you it saved my Christmas holiday, it worked within 4 days, I was able to withstand hot and cold on my teeth and the ache was gone.  I swear by this and I love the flavor, fresh mint.</li>
            <li> I have ground my teeth well below the enamel level and when I am not using sensodyne, they hurt all the time.  Sensodyme greatly decreases the pain. Tastes OK too</li>
            <li> Sensodyne is the only brand I use. Dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> You never realize how much of a life saver this product is until you run out of it and bite into something cold. And that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s ALWAYS out of stock at your local drug store. God bless Amazon subscription for keeping my teeth pain free and my addled brain on a timeline!</li>
            <li> My hygienist gave me a tube of this 4 months ago.  I started using it and didn&#x27;t have any problem except my previously and naturally white teeth turned DARK YELLOW over the last few weeks!  It took me awhile to figure out what was going on because I had not done anything different and have never been a coffee drinker.  Finally googled it and found all the complaints.  I went back to my old toothpaste yesterday and hope I can reverse it.  I&#x27;ll be letting my dentist know.  P.S.  The dentist&#x27;s office told me the stain should come off with a cleaning by them, thank God.</li>
            <li> For the price paid I surely thought I was getting the larger tube.</li>
            <li> This product is very effective in keeping cavities off your teeth if you use regularly. Great product.  the best toothpaste in the world, even better than Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> i AM HAPPY WITH ALL OF THE SENSODYNE TOOTHPASTE THAT I HAVE ORDERED.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is great for those with sensitive teeth and it does the job. It doesn&#x27;t contain any chemicals that are currently on the unhealthy list. I like that.</li>
            <li> love the seller but the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t work and my teeth are even more sensitive.  I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks but</li>
            <li> Like Sensodyne because of sensitive teeth. This toothpaste seems to clean well.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne Repair and Protect is one of the only toothpastes to include an unique ingredient called Novamin. Novamin combines the molecules found in saliva which naturally help to rebuild and repair enamel. Novamin is simply a combination of silica, calcium, phosphorus, and sodium. Toothpastes that just contain fluoride simply remove plaque through mechanical brushing, then deposit fluoride on the tooth&#x27;s surface. After brushing, the saliva will then mix with the fluoride and create a stronger barrier against acid&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole point of this toothpaste is to combine the fluoride and important reparative ingredients found in saliva into one. That way even people with dry mouth syndrome or other tooth disorders can immediately start to benefit. On top of this it also is one of the best defenses against teeth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past few years this toothpaste has been available in Europe. However, with the US release, they have completely omitted this new novamin technology! This toothpaste is nothing special and is definately not worth the price. It is just a fluoride toothpaste, which is still good, but definately not worth the high price. The Canadian version of this toothpaste has the novamin tech, but sadly the US version does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the type of fluoride that is included in this toothpaste (Stannous Fluoride) has the ability to stain the teeth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the worst toothpaste I have ever used.  I have been using sensory be for about 10 years now. I grabbed this one by mistake. The next day my guns was so dry and irritated and fell like it was burned. My teeth also became super sensitive. It only got worse over the next few days. It got to the point where I could barely move my mouth without it being in pain. The underside of my tongue and the spot where your cheek meet your gums feel so badly dry. My mouth is full of sores and I have 2 cold sores. I will NEVER make this mistake again. Hopefully this goes away soon!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this version of Sensodyne for 4 days now and will be discontinuing usage due to a metallic taste in my mouth that never subsides and my teeth have become increasingly sensitive and tingly.  It also leaves a coating on my tongue, and I&#x27;ve developed a sore on my tongue too.  This toothpaste is pretty much the cause of what it claims to cure</li>
            <li> Do not use toothpaste with stannous fluoride! My tongue was so sore and raw. My throat started to hurt as well. I stopped using this toothpaste and immediately my pain went away.</li>
            <li> This product was supposed to contain Novamin - the tooth regrowing ingredient.  When I received, I saw it did not contain this ingredient at all.  It is just a flouride toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not what I ordered and Amazon should ban this product as it is not as advertised, at least not in the U.S!&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have to go order something else while this goes in the trash!</li>
            <li> Toothpaste heats up as you brush your teeth. Never had this happen.&lt;br /&gt;Might be due to the fact this toothpaste contains high percentage of stanus flouride.&lt;br /&gt;No longer use this product.</li>
            <li> Use for those sensitive teeth up front... Make sure use is consistent, pain will dissipate, but keep using for complete relief.</li>
            <li> I think the people who rated this 1 star must be hypersensitive because most people do not have a bad reaction to this toothpaste. I have used both this one, the whitening one and the pronamel one and have never had a bad reaction to any of them, and I&#x27;ve had a lot of cavities in my day, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;I actually like the warming sensation from this toothpaste and it had the same effect as the others in regards to sensitivity. In fact it worked wayyy better than the pronamel. I&#x27;d still have sensitivity flare ups with that one. So i don&#x27;t buy it at all anymore. I prefer this to the whitening formula. They&#x27;re practically the same thing anyway.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sensodyne products (mainly Pronamel and Full Protection Whitening) since their initial release with positive results; my teeth are noticeably less sensitive than prior to use...  However, as soon as I brushed my teeth with Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect, I was surprised by the overwhelming burning sensation this toothpaste; as a result, I will not be using this particular product -  although it created an extremely fresh feeling after a thorough rinsing, it is not an option for overly sensitive teeth!  I will continue to use the Sensodyne products that I can tolerate for however long they are available, just not not this particular product!</li>
            <li> As usual, I am pleased with my purchase!</li>
