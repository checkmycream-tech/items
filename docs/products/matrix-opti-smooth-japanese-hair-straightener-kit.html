            <li>YOU MUST HAVE A GOOD CERAMIC IRON!</li>
            <li>My wife loved it, worked well!</li>
            <li>and you can get beautiful hair in 2-4 hours, depending on the length of your hair.</li>
            <li>This is the best product to use if you are looking for a really good straightener.</li>
            <li>I have never been so happy with my hair or the results.  </li>
            <li>And my hair looked great for almost 8 months.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see great results.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Hair looks great within one week after the straightening.</li>
            <li>So, my reason for writing the review is to let users know that it is a great product, but the directions must be followed to the letter.  </li>
            <li>lol.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it!!!!  </li>
            <li>Works really good on my wife&#x27;s hair, which is unmanageable without this.</li>
            <li>wife loved it it worked</li>
            <li>It looks as good as when she did it.</li>
            <li>The product is really good</li>
            <li>I trusted Matrix because I&#x27;ve loved their Biolage conditioner.</li>
            <li>you will probably be very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price and the best product so far that she has used.</li>
            <li>Be sure you choose the product for hair texture!</li>
            <li>I was using Loreal X-Tenso until it was discontinued, but I like the Opti Smoothe even better!  </li>
            <li>The first two times I used this product, I would have given it an excellent, 5-star review.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product will def order more packaged great and arrived in time specified thanks heaps for a great buy</li>
            <li>This product is amazing i wish i could get friends to do it for me, it would save me the $360 i pay in the salon for it to be done...</li>
            <li>my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I think my hairdresser did an amazing job, and had I done it myself</li>
            <li>My hair is perfectly pin straight, no frizz and no damage.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t understand how this product has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>Beware, use at your own risk.</li>
            <li>I have used BioIonic ReTex many, many times and always had great results, whether it was done in a salon or at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just watch for the timing and read instructions thoroughly  and have it  handy.</li>
            <li>honest</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results: my hair is smooth and still healthy.  </li>
            <li>What I am most pleased about is that it didn&#x27;t damage my hair, oh, and also, my hair doesn&#x27;t stink!  </li>
            <li>My best friend is a beautician and said she could turn my hair so straight and smooth as if I was born with it.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, I am pretty damn happy.  </li>
            <li>the PRE-treatment spray is very important... overdo it if you must to protect your hair.</li>
            <li>i LOVE this</li>
            <li>What I love about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair like most straighteners do.  </li>
            <li>I know that many people read these reviews before making their purchase and here&#x27;s my experience</li>
            <li>, I am better at this than she is.     </li>
            <li>it WILL RUIN your hair when using Opti Smooth!</li>
            <li>It may take more than 3x.   </li>
            <li>As my hairdresser put it \\&quot;this is the best straightener for &#x27;white girl&#x27; hair.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>and i love the outcome.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did my research.  </li>
            <li>sure the stylist performing this process has done it before.  </li>
            <li>Love your hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read all the material that comes with the product and start the knot test after 20 mins.</li>
            <li>Longer you leave the step 1 chemical in, more are the chances of you frying your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried some straighteners that were sold in drug stores and they worked better than this.</li>
            <li>have tried many straightening kits before.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Way better that keratin.</li>
            <li>I spend $$ on nice hair products like Alterna, Sleek n Smooth, and do my weekly oil treatments</li>
            <li>The problem is a top layer of frizz that drives me nuts.  </li>
            <li>So, finally decided to spend a bit more for a better result: it worked wonderfully in my case....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This process was better than ANY salon treatment I have had.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Matrix for making such a wonderful product for people like me.</li>
            <li>I get this applied to my hair twice a year for more than five years now.</li>
            <li>Make sure the person who is applying this knows how to do it correctly.</li>
            <li>I say this is better than your drug store perm.</li>
            <li>I had NO damage with this product and am insanely pleased.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your curls!  </li>
            <li>if you are good with your GO FOR IT,, but if you dont know how to handle it,, dont try it,, cuz it can damage your hair if you dont do it right..</li>
            <li>Those are my success tips:} I do my own w/out help:}</li>
            <li>Be sure you use the right kind for your type of hair...</li>
            <li>Nice straight hair!!  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll find a great instructional video that I followed that explains the instructions in professional detail.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Easy to follow directions</li>
            <li>It was fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>But there are rules that must be followed for it to work effectively, both directly from the manufacturer and my own</li>
            <li>My hair turned out great and now I barely have to use any product on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>Fine with medium to strong curl.</li>
            <li>they are spelled out very clearly, and if you do the patch test first and have a good result, then you will LOVE this product and be glad you spend the money.</li>
            <li>You are taking a HUGE risk if you do.</li>
            <li>It took us almost 7 hours and most of the product but the result is worth it.  </li>
            <li>You absolutely NEED another person to slave away with you, this can&#x27;t be done on your own.</li>
            <li>I have smooth wavy hair</li>
            <li>and it takes FOREVER to smooth out that frizz.</li>
            <li>I used to use lye relaxers and then in 2006 tried Matrix Opti Smooth.</li>
            <li>GENTLY smooth your hair a bit with the palms of your handswhile</li>
            <li>I comb and smooth.</li>
            <li>and she used the matrix opti smooth on my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny (not greasy) and smooth.  </li>
            <li>If I were to get that done why would I go for Opti Smooth?</li>
            <li>You will have to use a sulfate free product to cleanse your hair or you&#x27;ll end up stripping your hair of the process you just paid for and your hair will be mad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my hair frizz free and maintenance free.</li>
            <li>Did not make hair smooth</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I bought the Matrix Shampoo/Conditioner, and over conditioned my hair a week before I used Opti Smooth....</li>
            <li>I never had a product work so well on my hair until I tried this matrix smooth.  </li>
            <li>I actually went to a professioonal salon to get this done and the stylist took a good look at my hair and told me it was ok to do.  </li>
            <li>The process takes a long time, and for best results you need to comb your hair straight.  </li>
            <li>The look on my daughter&#x27;s face as she ran her hair through her very silky, soft and straight hair was priceless!  </li>
            <li>Worth it!  </li>
            <li>I originally 7 months ago had a perm put in for curls.</li>
            <li>I am not sure it would have turned out so perfect.  </li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>You need a good ceramic flat iron, i have CHi and it worked fine..   </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always used the full, heat process.</li>
            <li>: You MUST comb it through for the full 10 min.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this product is that it doesnt make your hair too straight.</li>
            <li>I still have a good amount of curl in the back</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it, as it has been a real time-saver for me for many years.</li>
            <li>A full 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>I wanted to take the time to write a full review regarding this product....</li>
            <li>I used it and my hair was looking good but did not stay long to be smooth and straight!!.</li>
            <li>Now that we are back in the US, I&#x27;m doing it on myself and have had great, silky smooth successful results for the past two times I have used it.  </li>
            <li>should go to youtube and watch the videos on this with Matrix artistic director Nick Stenson.</li>
            <li>Ask them questions such as how many times have they used the product, what were the results, were their customers satisfied,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the same person now for the last 5 years giving me a perfect treatment, but the person before her didn&#x27;t apply this correctly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would have come out even better if I were a little more patient</li>
            <li>Before using the opti smooth my hair was very healthy and shiny with minimal frizz.</li>
            <li>First time I used results were great, second time I didn&#x27;t see so much...</li>
            <li>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do a swatch test first!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is silkier, smoother and the best part is that I only have to blow or air dry</li>
            <li>The newer versions with black boxes leave an incredible burning sensation on the scalp and smell absolutely horrendous.</li>
            <li>have really curly hair and this product maked it smooth and non frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and blow dries so much faster now.  </li>
            <li>and I had it professionally done at the top salon in town.  </li>
            <li>and I don´t have to use the flat iron any more!  </li>
            <li>But, when I went to get a keratin treatment to fix this at a salon on Newbury St in Boston, the stylist told me he really didn&#x27;t care much for Biloate, calling Matrix&#x27;s products just ok, and</li>
            <li>hours on it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have normal, strong hair</li>
            <li>but if used by the right person.</li>
            <li>Air drying out of the question, and even a perfect straight blow dry is ruined the second I encounter ANY rain or humidity.  </li>
            <li>(luckily there are two applications in the package, possibly more if you just do touch ups), and may even try to go straighter next time.</li>
            <li>Not bad if you have very wavy hair though.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my friend&#x27;s super curly and it really worked..</li>
            <li>If you fine hair even if it is virgin hair use sensitive formula.</li>
            <li>Do not use barretts, clips or headbands of any kind during the first 48 hours (I do use a loose clip and head band for 2 minutes while washing my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives me smooth, straight results even in Florida&#x27;s high humidity.</li>
            <li>The process takes hours and hours-about 6-7 hours to be exact.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made things so much easier for me!</li>
            <li>I used to pay hundreds of dollars to have this done in a salon and that is where I first discovered this product</li>
            <li>The first time I did it by myself, my hair got 80% straightened...</li>
            <li>I got my first straightening done in India.</li>
            <li>I have had it done enough times now and am confident that I can do it myself, maybe with a friends help.</li>
            <li>Hair does not look or feel damaged afterwards, and the smell goes away with the first shampoo.</li>
            <li>to make sure the hair is not spring back into place and at it remains In a knot.  </li>
            <li>The first formula is where they basically deconstruct your cuticle.</li>
            <li>After she did everything, my hair looked pin straight!</li>
            <li>literally, the best stuff on the planet for this and its not that expensive.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Is it safe to redo the treatment to my entire hair?  </li>
            <li>Soft, silky, smooth.</li>
            <li>But the time this product has saved me, and the way my hair looks ten times better without me spending</li>
            <li>And there was more than enough product to do myhair at that length.</li>
            <li>Sleep for the first night with a silk scarf wrapped around hair (babushka) off to the side with no</li>
            <li>I just finished trying out this product for the first time and wanted to give some advice for people considering using Matrix Opti Smooth.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>It makes my ahir PIN straight, baby soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>but this product definitely makes straightening easier and it makes it a silkier, smoother straight when I do straighten it (which is most of the time).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to use a bit to much of this than not enough.          </li>
            <li>It is wavy, but straightens easily with a quick blow dry.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not Pin straight now,, but it is VERY straight.</li>
            <li>but I thought since you guys are reviewing you pretty much know how it works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy and definitely recommend it, but I would definitely have a professional put it in.</li>
            <li>i have Long medium wavy hair, so i followed the instructions, but the most crucual thing is the straightning iron.  </li>
            <li>My hair is however, pretty straight.</li>
            <li>While that may not be politically correct, it is true!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes there will be an instructional DVD with the product (depending on the vendor) but the instructions are easy enough to follow without the DVD.  </li>
            <li>It is very time consuming and deffinitley need one more person if u have long hair..  </li>
            <li>It certainly can be DONE alone.    </li>
            <li>If so, should I wait a certain period of time before doing so?  </li>
            <li>I blow-dried and ironed my hair VERY diligently, making sure I didn&#x27;t miss a single strand.</li>
            <li>This process takes another 30 minutes (more if your hair is very long!).</li>
            <li>Maybe you want completely straight hair, there&#x27;s a certain process for that.  </li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s hair came out great except for a little part in the back that I messed up.</li>
            <li>and it is still pin straight.</li>
            <li>It DOES make your hair straight-but a frizzy straight.</li>
            <li>Now my hair dries up straight.  </li>
            <li>or if I want to straighten it, this product allows me to do so much easier than without any chemical straightening.  </li>
            <li>a)Apply the straight creme.</li>
            <li>Did it still stay straight after you take a shower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gonna be so much easier to work with now.</li>
            <li>I can walk out of the shower or pool and my hair will be straight and frizz-free, or I can use a blowdryer and add body and waves.</li>
            <li>I used lye products before Japanese straightening and keratin was available and this product reminds me of the results I&#x27;d get from those lye products.</li>
            <li>My strongest and unruliest curl pattern is on my crown and around my face, and that seems to be much improved.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned with removing too much curl, because I don&#x27;t want stick straight hair all the time.  </li>
            <li>it worked very well.</li>
            <li>My hair is pin-straight and the time that I save not straightening my hair is absolutely price-less.  </li>
            <li>i really believe this made a difference.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really straighten my hair....</li>
            <li>Did not work very well.  </li>
            <li>So I used the heat straigtening on Saturday you cant twll the real results until you was it in 3 days...  </li>
            <li>I would suggest to have everything ready and nearby ( gloves, plastic wrap, timer, bathroom....)</li>
            <li>It takes me 3 minutes to get my hair stick straight now.</li>
            <li>and my hair is not pin straight.  </li>
            <li>I really would appreciate any advice.  </li>
            <li>Plz tell me this product is permanent straight hair?</li>
            <li>My hair blow dries straight, but I still take 5 minutes to run an iron over it to get that polished look.</li>
            <li>I am REALLY REALLY REALLY</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I ordered, Brand New in the box and all the packaging included.</li>
            <li>I use a straightener to just soften the curl and make it easy to blow dry straight or wavy without having to pull it so much withe the brush.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long and fine, but I have a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>It was my first time seeing a perm in action.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly (Julia Roberts Pretty Woman Curly)</li>
            <li>I have been using this product on my clients for several years with amazing results but this last time I used it the entire top of her hair broke off 1/2 inch long!</li>
            <li>review said it&#x27;s better to use too much of the spray rather than to little.  </li>
            <li>STRONGLY suggesting to follow directions to the letter (finishing a couple of minutes earlier is even better!!)It has been 2 weeks for me, and I have not touched the flat iron, hair is strong, frizzy-free and still looking the same from 14 days ago....</li>
            <li>i you have bleached in the past DONT use this or any hot straightening methods unless most of your bleached hair has grown out.  </li>
            <li>start to finish) but they are charging an outragous hourly rate in my opinion because the main  time is the processing which takes an hour</li>
            <li>It was able to be applied directly to the scalp with absolutely no burn.</li>
            <li>I am only a few days post treatment, but I do wash my hair every day, so I am hopeful the result is fairly permanent.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to spend the right amount of time on the processing and rinse the product out each time for at least 5-10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>You can try to do this yourself but you should really have a professional apply this.  </li>
            <li>I use normal.</li>
            <li>well I know that the full, heat process does not completely straighten anyway</li>
            <li>I used the normal formula because my hair was course, but \\&quot;virgin.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>A curling iron can still be used to add curl, and my hair retains its normal body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to save up and get a keratin treatment or something to look normal again.</li>
            <li>The old optismooth that I was using was fantastic in it&#x27;s performance, although it took a long time to process (2 hours).</li>
            <li>VERY thin sections of hair and make sure it looks straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell you the last time that I was able to let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li>Comb w/one hand and smooth with the other.</li>
            <li>I needed a touch up for my new grown hair.</li>
            <li>(keratin does NOT affect my new growth/virgin hair).&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I have normal to wavy hair and bought this product because I thought that it would make my hair silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have been a matrix optismooth user for the past eight years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>We tested a small section first and my mother was amazed at how soft and smooth my hair was.</li>
            <li>leave the neutralizer in the full 10 min and comb the entire time is also crutial to being perfectly straight as well as rinsing the product the full ten minutes without making your hair a mess.</li>
            <li>nothing really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has different hair and different experiences with products - my hair is different all over - fairly smooth and loose/</li>
            <li>Only a professional who is familiar with this product can tell you what you actually need.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I have very short hair on the sides, and several inches long on top....</li>
            <li>I used a Babybliss flat iron and blow dryer with a concentrator for the hot application.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Has never damaged my hair, even if the product overlaps on previously-smoothed hair and stays permanently straight (obviously the new growth is curly).</li>
            <li>I have brown naturally curly highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>This product completely damaged my hair.</li>
            <li>The keratin complex smoothing treatment is a much better product.</li>
            <li>have a professional use this on you</li>
            <li>If you want straight hair I suggest that you look at your local beauty school and see if they have this.  </li>
            <li>After using this product it was like I had natural soft hairs.</li>
            <li>) curl when I want to wear it natural or curly......</li>
            <li>I use sensitive formula.</li>
            <li>Another use a professional iron.</li>
            <li>the second time I enlisted the help of my daughter and my hair is now pin straight.  </li>
            <li>After having my hairdresser apply this product to my hair, I finally have straight hair.  </li>
            <li>The product is only $50ish, but I paid $200 to have my hairdresser do the whole process...</li>
            <li>Many of the reviewers have complained about this product</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very unruly, I kept the formula in there for the longest amount possible (listed in the directions).</li>
            <li>Overall, it works of your planning to always have straight hair and not ever change  your hair color.</li>
            <li>It takes a little longer, but we&#x27;ll worth it!</li>
            <li>It took us roughly 5 hours to do my hair and do it right</li>
            <li>My hair dries straight, flat, and frizzy</li>
            <li>I guess now I understand Why the new ones were on sale in Salon Centric while the old ones weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t leave it on long because I don&#x27;t want my hair bone straight, but you can get that result too if that&#x27;s what you want.  </li>
            <li>Then gradually back to normal...</li>
            <li>No, I don&#x27;t have curl, but I have the most horrendous horrible looking friz on top of my head right now.  </li>
            <li>I can literally let my normal very wavy coarse hair AIR DRY..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this - just be aware you need a few hours and patience to get it done.  </li>
            <li>i dont need to put any thing in it any more to calm my crazy curls and friz...  </li>
            <li>I can just let my hair air dry and still have silky straight hair.  </li>
            <li>: if you don&#x27;t do hair professionally and try and do this yourself, it MAY not come out the same as when a professional does.</li>
            <li>I know it costs more but just get this professionally done and save your poor hair the DAMAGE.</li>
            <li>Please pay attention to the fact that it is VERY clear that you test this product AFTER it has been on your hair for only 10 minutes and</li>
            <li>It (of course) has been rainy the last few days, and it does sort of re-frizz my blown dry hair, but not NEARLY the tragedy it was prior to the treatment, and a quick brushing smooths it most of the way back</li>
            <li>no regrets!  </li>
            <li>May not make yours brittle, but I get major, major breakage on my opti-smoothed hair if I use something with keratin in it</li>
            <li>(I am a rare Japanese with VERY thick, super curly</li>
            <li>curlier as you move toward the middle but still soft, then coarse and very curly in back.</li>
            <li>The knot test works, and when your hair is fully processed, the knot will stay tight and not come loose easily.</li>
            <li>I have considered the Brazilian Keratin treatment, but in general my hair does not respond well to protein, and of course there is the cost.  </li>
            <li>The tip like everyone says is you MUST use small small sections to comb the product in, must not move while the chemical is processing, your hair must remain straight.. also use vertical strips of saran wrap to lay on top of your head</li>
            <li>My advice would be to go to a professional and follow the directions to achieve the same results.  </li>
            <li>Or maybe you want your natural curl without frizz, there a different process for that.  </li>
            <li>now my hair looks like pubes hopefully it can be fixed by deep conditionings.  </li>
            <li>It took several hours to complete</li>
            <li>I just had it done for the third time (just a touch-up), by a professional (whom I paid to do this), and it is a nightmare.  </li>
            <li>Coarse hair will need the normal or coarse.</li>
            <li>Just as the other reviews said, I am now lettiing my very fine and normally tight spiral curled hair air dry.  </li>
            <li>Like many other reviews I have thick, dry hair that could barely get straight with flat iron.</li>
            <li>This last time...the third time I personally applied it, I don&#x27;t think I processed it long enough, which led to ok results...a little frizz in the back and on the sides...</li>
            <li>It tamed my hair a little, but not what I was expecting for so much money!</li>
            <li>(my hair is long, to the middle of my back), won&#x27;t know how much until I let it dry natural.  </li>
            <li>2 weeks before you straighten deep condition your hair 4x with Redken extreme CAT.This is a pure protein product and will prevent your hair from frying.</li>
            <li>Actually you need a professional stylist to determine what is too much or too little.  </li>
            <li>If you are realistic about your expectations for this product......and realize that you will still have to blow dry and use a flat iron to straighten......</li>
            <li>After rinsing out the formula, I was a little bit optimistic as the hair seemed a bit more relaxed than usual.</li>
            <li>think the heat process would have made my hair too flat and thin looking, and damaged it more than necessary.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/loose curl, FRIZZY, DRY hair.  </li>
            <li>For some reason when you color your hair after having this done, the hair color will stick to your hair so good that it will be nearly impossible to lighten it unless your cut it off.</li>
            <li>I will warn you, don&#x27;t expect your hair to necessarily look like it&#x27;s been flat-ironed by a professional after you wash and style it yourself if you just blow dry.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what you want as long as you don&#x27;t mind putting a little elbow-grease into it.</li>

            <li> Hair looks great within one week after the straightening.</li>
            <li> So, my reason for writing the review is to let users know that it is a great product, but the directions must be followed to the letter.  </li>

            <li> Be sure you choose the product for hair texture!</li>

            <li> This product is amazing i wish i could get friends to do it for me, it would save me the $360 i pay in the salon for it to be done...</li>
            <li> my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I think my hairdresser did an amazing job, and had I done it myself</li>
            <li> My hair is perfectly pin straight, no frizz and no damage.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t understand how this product has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> Beware, use at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I have used BioIonic ReTex many, many times and always had great results, whether it was done in a salon or at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just watch for the timing and read instructions thoroughly  and have it  handy.</li>
            <li> honest</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results: my hair is smooth and still healthy.  </li>
            <li> What I am most pleased about is that it didn&#x27;t damage my hair, oh, and also, my hair doesn&#x27;t stink!  </li>
            <li> My best friend is a beautician and said she could turn my hair so straight and smooth as if I was born with it.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, I am pretty damn happy.  </li>
            <li> the PRE-treatment spray is very important... overdo it if you must to protect your hair.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this</li>
            <li> What I love about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair like most straighteners do.  </li>
            <li> I know that many people read these reviews before making their purchase and here&#x27;s my experience</li>
            <li> , I am better at this than she is.     </li>
            <li> it WILL RUIN your hair when using Opti Smooth!</li>
            <li> It may take more than 3x.   </li>
            <li> As my hairdresser put it \\&quot;this is the best straightener for &#x27;white girl&#x27; hair.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> and i love the outcome.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did my research.  </li>
            <li> sure the stylist performing this process has done it before.  </li>
            <li> Love your hair.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read all the material that comes with the product and start the knot test after 20 mins.</li>
            <li> Longer you leave the step 1 chemical in, more are the chances of you frying your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried some straighteners that were sold in drug stores and they worked better than this.</li>
            <li> have tried many straightening kits before.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Way better that keratin.</li>
            <li> I spend $$ on nice hair products like Alterna, Sleek n Smooth, and do my weekly oil treatments</li>
            <li> The problem is a top layer of frizz that drives me nuts.  </li>
            <li> So, finally decided to spend a bit more for a better result: it worked wonderfully in my case....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This process was better than ANY salon treatment I have had.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Matrix for making such a wonderful product for people like me.</li>
            <li> I get this applied to my hair twice a year for more than five years now.</li>
            <li> Make sure the person who is applying this knows how to do it correctly.</li>
            <li> I say this is better than your drug store perm.</li>
            <li> I had NO damage with this product and am insanely pleased.</li>
            <li> Enjoy your curls!  </li>
            <li> if you are good with your GO FOR IT,, but if you dont know how to handle it,, dont try it,, cuz it can damage your hair if you dont do it right..</li>
            <li> Those are my success tips:} I do my own w/out help:}</li>
            <li> Be sure you use the right kind for your type of hair...</li>
            <li> Nice straight hair!!  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll find a great instructional video that I followed that explains the instructions in professional detail.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Easy to follow directions</li>
            <li> It was fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> But there are rules that must be followed for it to work effectively, both directly from the manufacturer and my own</li>
            <li> My hair turned out great and now I barely have to use any product on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> Fine with medium to strong curl.</li>
            <li> they are spelled out very clearly, and if you do the patch test first and have a good result, then you will LOVE this product and be glad you spend the money.</li>
            <li> You are taking a HUGE risk if you do.</li>
            <li> It took us almost 7 hours and most of the product but the result is worth it.  </li>
            <li> You absolutely NEED another person to slave away with you, this can&#x27;t be done on your own.</li>
            <li> I have smooth wavy hair</li>
            <li> and it takes FOREVER to smooth out that frizz.</li>
            <li> I used to use lye relaxers and then in 2006 tried Matrix Opti Smooth.</li>
            <li> GENTLY smooth your hair a bit with the palms of your handswhile</li>
            <li> I comb and smooth.</li>
            <li> and she used the matrix opti smooth on my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny (not greasy) and smooth.  </li>
            <li> If I were to get that done why would I go for Opti Smooth?</li>
            <li> You will have to use a sulfate free product to cleanse your hair or you&#x27;ll end up stripping your hair of the process you just paid for and your hair will be mad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my hair frizz free and maintenance free.</li>
            <li> Did not make hair smooth</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I bought the Matrix Shampoo/Conditioner, and over conditioned my hair a week before I used Opti Smooth....</li>
            <li> I never had a product work so well on my hair until I tried this matrix smooth.  </li>
            <li> I actually went to a professioonal salon to get this done and the stylist took a good look at my hair and told me it was ok to do.  </li>
            <li> The process takes a long time, and for best results you need to comb your hair straight.  </li>
            <li> The look on my daughter&#x27;s face as she ran her hair through her very silky, soft and straight hair was priceless!  </li>
            <li> Worth it!  </li>
            <li> I originally 7 months ago had a perm put in for curls.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it would have turned out so perfect.  </li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> You need a good ceramic flat iron, i have CHi and it worked fine..   </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always used the full, heat process.</li>
            <li> : You MUST comb it through for the full 10 min.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this product is that it doesnt make your hair too straight.</li>
            <li> I still have a good amount of curl in the back</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it, as it has been a real time-saver for me for many years.</li>
            <li> A full 50 minutes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to take the time to write a full review regarding this product....</li>
            <li> I used it and my hair was looking good but did not stay long to be smooth and straight!!.</li>
            <li> Now that we are back in the US, I&#x27;m doing it on myself and have had great, silky smooth successful results for the past two times I have used it.  </li>
            <li> should go to youtube and watch the videos on this with Matrix artistic director Nick Stenson.</li>
            <li> Ask them questions such as how many times have they used the product, what were the results, were their customers satisfied,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same person now for the last 5 years giving me a perfect treatment, but the person before her didn&#x27;t apply this correctly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would have come out even better if I were a little more patient</li>
            <li> Before using the opti smooth my hair was very healthy and shiny with minimal frizz.</li>
            <li> First time I used results were great, second time I didn&#x27;t see so much...</li>
            <li> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do a swatch test first!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is silkier, smoother and the best part is that I only have to blow or air dry</li>
            <li> The newer versions with black boxes leave an incredible burning sensation on the scalp and smell absolutely horrendous.</li>
            <li> have really curly hair and this product maked it smooth and non frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and blow dries so much faster now.  </li>
            <li> and I had it professionally done at the top salon in town.  </li>
            <li> and I don´t have to use the flat iron any more!  </li>
            <li> But, when I went to get a keratin treatment to fix this at a salon on Newbury St in Boston, the stylist told me he really didn&#x27;t care much for Biloate, calling Matrix&#x27;s products just ok, and</li>
            <li> hours on it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have normal, strong hair</li>
            <li> but if used by the right person.</li>
            <li> Air drying out of the question, and even a perfect straight blow dry is ruined the second I encounter ANY rain or humidity.  </li>
            <li> (luckily there are two applications in the package, possibly more if you just do touch ups), and may even try to go straighter next time.</li>
            <li> Not bad if you have very wavy hair though.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my friend&#x27;s super curly and it really worked..</li>
            <li> If you fine hair even if it is virgin hair use sensitive formula.</li>
            <li> Do not use barretts, clips or headbands of any kind during the first 48 hours (I do use a loose clip and head band for 2 minutes while washing my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives me smooth, straight results even in Florida&#x27;s high humidity.</li>
            <li> The process takes hours and hours-about 6-7 hours to be exact.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made things so much easier for me!</li>
            <li> I used to pay hundreds of dollars to have this done in a salon and that is where I first discovered this product</li>
            <li> The first time I did it by myself, my hair got 80% straightened...</li>
            <li> I got my first straightening done in India.</li>
            <li> I have had it done enough times now and am confident that I can do it myself, maybe with a friends help.</li>
            <li> Hair does not look or feel damaged afterwards, and the smell goes away with the first shampoo.</li>
            <li> to make sure the hair is not spring back into place and at it remains In a knot.  </li>
            <li> The first formula is where they basically deconstruct your cuticle.</li>
            <li> After she did everything, my hair looked pin straight!</li>
            <li> literally, the best stuff on the planet for this and its not that expensive.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Is it safe to redo the treatment to my entire hair?  </li>
            <li> Soft, silky, smooth.</li>
            <li> But the time this product has saved me, and the way my hair looks ten times better without me spending</li>
            <li> And there was more than enough product to do myhair at that length.</li>
            <li> Sleep for the first night with a silk scarf wrapped around hair (babushka) off to the side with no</li>
            <li> I just finished trying out this product for the first time and wanted to give some advice for people considering using Matrix Opti Smooth.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> It makes my ahir PIN straight, baby soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> but this product definitely makes straightening easier and it makes it a silkier, smoother straight when I do straighten it (which is most of the time).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to use a bit to much of this than not enough.          </li>
            <li> It is wavy, but straightens easily with a quick blow dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not Pin straight now,, but it is VERY straight.</li>
            <li> but I thought since you guys are reviewing you pretty much know how it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy and definitely recommend it, but I would definitely have a professional put it in.</li>
            <li> i have Long medium wavy hair, so i followed the instructions, but the most crucual thing is the straightning iron.  </li>
            <li> My hair is however, pretty straight.</li>
            <li> While that may not be politically correct, it is true!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes there will be an instructional DVD with the product (depending on the vendor) but the instructions are easy enough to follow without the DVD.  </li>
            <li> It is very time consuming and deffinitley need one more person if u have long hair..  </li>
            <li> It certainly can be DONE alone.    </li>
            <li> If so, should I wait a certain period of time before doing so?  </li>
            <li> I blow-dried and ironed my hair VERY diligently, making sure I didn&#x27;t miss a single strand.</li>
            <li> This process takes another 30 minutes (more if your hair is very long!).</li>
            <li> Maybe you want completely straight hair, there&#x27;s a certain process for that.  </li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair came out great except for a little part in the back that I messed up.</li>
            <li> and it is still pin straight.</li>
            <li> It DOES make your hair straight-but a frizzy straight.</li>
            <li> Now my hair dries up straight.  </li>
            <li> or if I want to straighten it, this product allows me to do so much easier than without any chemical straightening.  </li>
            <li> a)Apply the straight creme.</li>
            <li> Did it still stay straight after you take a shower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gonna be so much easier to work with now.</li>
            <li> I can walk out of the shower or pool and my hair will be straight and frizz-free, or I can use a blowdryer and add body and waves.</li>
            <li> I used lye products before Japanese straightening and keratin was available and this product reminds me of the results I&#x27;d get from those lye products.</li>
            <li> My strongest and unruliest curl pattern is on my crown and around my face, and that seems to be much improved.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned with removing too much curl, because I don&#x27;t want stick straight hair all the time.  </li>
            <li> it worked very well.</li>
            <li> My hair is pin-straight and the time that I save not straightening my hair is absolutely price-less.  </li>
            <li> i really believe this made a difference.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really straighten my hair....</li>
            <li> Did not work very well.  </li>
            <li> So I used the heat straigtening on Saturday you cant twll the real results until you was it in 3 days...  </li>
            <li> I would suggest to have everything ready and nearby ( gloves, plastic wrap, timer, bathroom....)</li>
            <li> It takes me 3 minutes to get my hair stick straight now.</li>
            <li> and my hair is not pin straight.  </li>
            <li> I really would appreciate any advice.  </li>
            <li> Plz tell me this product is permanent straight hair?</li>
            <li> My hair blow dries straight, but I still take 5 minutes to run an iron over it to get that polished look.</li>
            <li> I am REALLY REALLY REALLY</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I ordered, Brand New in the box and all the packaging included.</li>
            <li> I use a straightener to just soften the curl and make it easy to blow dry straight or wavy without having to pull it so much withe the brush.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and fine, but I have a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> It was my first time seeing a perm in action.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly (Julia Roberts Pretty Woman Curly)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my clients for several years with amazing results but this last time I used it the entire top of her hair broke off 1/2 inch long!</li>
            <li> review said it&#x27;s better to use too much of the spray rather than to little.  </li>
            <li> STRONGLY suggesting to follow directions to the letter (finishing a couple of minutes earlier is even better!!)It has been 2 weeks for me, and I have not touched the flat iron, hair is strong, frizzy-free and still looking the same from 14 days ago....</li>
            <li> i you have bleached in the past DONT use this or any hot straightening methods unless most of your bleached hair has grown out.  </li>
            <li> start to finish) but they are charging an outragous hourly rate in my opinion because the main  time is the processing which takes an hour</li>
            <li> It was able to be applied directly to the scalp with absolutely no burn.</li>
            <li> I am only a few days post treatment, but I do wash my hair every day, so I am hopeful the result is fairly permanent.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to spend the right amount of time on the processing and rinse the product out each time for at least 5-10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> You can try to do this yourself but you should really have a professional apply this.  </li>
            <li> I use normal.</li>
            <li> well I know that the full, heat process does not completely straighten anyway</li>
            <li> I used the normal formula because my hair was course, but \\&quot;virgin.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> A curling iron can still be used to add curl, and my hair retains its normal body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to save up and get a keratin treatment or something to look normal again.</li>
            <li> The old optismooth that I was using was fantastic in it&#x27;s performance, although it took a long time to process (2 hours).</li>
            <li> VERY thin sections of hair and make sure it looks straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you the last time that I was able to let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li> Comb w/one hand and smooth with the other.</li>
            <li> I needed a touch up for my new grown hair.</li>
            <li> (keratin does NOT affect my new growth/virgin hair).&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I have normal to wavy hair and bought this product because I thought that it would make my hair silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have been a matrix optismooth user for the past eight years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> We tested a small section first and my mother was amazed at how soft and smooth my hair was.</li>
            <li> leave the neutralizer in the full 10 min and comb the entire time is also crutial to being perfectly straight as well as rinsing the product the full ten minutes without making your hair a mess.</li>
            <li> nothing really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has different hair and different experiences with products - my hair is different all over - fairly smooth and loose/</li>
            <li> Only a professional who is familiar with this product can tell you what you actually need.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I have very short hair on the sides, and several inches long on top....</li>
            <li> I used a Babybliss flat iron and blow dryer with a concentrator for the hot application.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Has never damaged my hair, even if the product overlaps on previously-smoothed hair and stays permanently straight (obviously the new growth is curly).</li>
            <li> I have brown naturally curly highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> This product completely damaged my hair.</li>
            <li> The keratin complex smoothing treatment is a much better product.</li>
            <li> have a professional use this on you</li>
            <li> If you want straight hair I suggest that you look at your local beauty school and see if they have this.  </li>
            <li> After using this product it was like I had natural soft hairs.</li>
            <li> ) curl when I want to wear it natural or curly......</li>
            <li> I use sensitive formula.</li>
            <li> Another use a professional iron.</li>
            <li> the second time I enlisted the help of my daughter and my hair is now pin straight.  </li>
            <li> After having my hairdresser apply this product to my hair, I finally have straight hair.  </li>
            <li> The product is only $50ish, but I paid $200 to have my hairdresser do the whole process...</li>
            <li> Many of the reviewers have complained about this product</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very unruly, I kept the formula in there for the longest amount possible (listed in the directions).</li>
            <li> Overall, it works of your planning to always have straight hair and not ever change  your hair color.</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer, but we&#x27;ll worth it!</li>
            <li> It took us roughly 5 hours to do my hair and do it right</li>
            <li> My hair dries straight, flat, and frizzy</li>
            <li> I guess now I understand Why the new ones were on sale in Salon Centric while the old ones weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave it on long because I don&#x27;t want my hair bone straight, but you can get that result too if that&#x27;s what you want.  </li>
            <li> Then gradually back to normal...</li>
            <li> No, I don&#x27;t have curl, but I have the most horrendous horrible looking friz on top of my head right now.  </li>
            <li> I can literally let my normal very wavy coarse hair AIR DRY..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this - just be aware you need a few hours and patience to get it done.  </li>
            <li> i dont need to put any thing in it any more to calm my crazy curls and friz...  </li>
            <li> I can just let my hair air dry and still have silky straight hair.  </li>
            <li> : if you don&#x27;t do hair professionally and try and do this yourself, it MAY not come out the same as when a professional does.</li>
            <li> I know it costs more but just get this professionally done and save your poor hair the DAMAGE.</li>
            <li> Please pay attention to the fact that it is VERY clear that you test this product AFTER it has been on your hair for only 10 minutes and</li>
            <li> It (of course) has been rainy the last few days, and it does sort of re-frizz my blown dry hair, but not NEARLY the tragedy it was prior to the treatment, and a quick brushing smooths it most of the way back</li>
            <li> no regrets!  </li>
            <li> May not make yours brittle, but I get major, major breakage on my opti-smoothed hair if I use something with keratin in it</li>
            <li> (I am a rare Japanese with VERY thick, super curly</li>
            <li> curlier as you move toward the middle but still soft, then coarse and very curly in back.</li>
            <li> The knot test works, and when your hair is fully processed, the knot will stay tight and not come loose easily.</li>
            <li> I have considered the Brazilian Keratin treatment, but in general my hair does not respond well to protein, and of course there is the cost.  </li>
            <li> The tip like everyone says is you MUST use small small sections to comb the product in, must not move while the chemical is processing, your hair must remain straight.. also use vertical strips of saran wrap to lay on top of your head</li>
            <li> My advice would be to go to a professional and follow the directions to achieve the same results.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe you want your natural curl without frizz, there a different process for that.  </li>
            <li> now my hair looks like pubes hopefully it can be fixed by deep conditionings.  </li>
            <li> It took several hours to complete</li>
            <li> I just had it done for the third time (just a touch-up), by a professional (whom I paid to do this), and it is a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> Coarse hair will need the normal or coarse.</li>
            <li> Just as the other reviews said, I am now lettiing my very fine and normally tight spiral curled hair air dry.  </li>
            <li> Like many other reviews I have thick, dry hair that could barely get straight with flat iron.</li>
            <li> This last time...the third time I personally applied it, I don&#x27;t think I processed it long enough, which led to ok results...a little frizz in the back and on the sides...</li>
            <li> It tamed my hair a little, but not what I was expecting for so much money!</li>
            <li> (my hair is long, to the middle of my back), won&#x27;t know how much until I let it dry natural.  </li>
            <li> 2 weeks before you straighten deep condition your hair 4x with Redken extreme CAT.This is a pure protein product and will prevent your hair from frying.</li>
            <li> Actually you need a professional stylist to determine what is too much or too little.  </li>
            <li> If you are realistic about your expectations for this product......and realize that you will still have to blow dry and use a flat iron to straighten......</li>
            <li> After rinsing out the formula, I was a little bit optimistic as the hair seemed a bit more relaxed than usual.</li>
            <li> think the heat process would have made my hair too flat and thin looking, and damaged it more than necessary.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/loose curl, FRIZZY, DRY hair.  </li>
            <li> For some reason when you color your hair after having this done, the hair color will stick to your hair so good that it will be nearly impossible to lighten it unless your cut it off.</li>
            <li> I will warn you, don&#x27;t expect your hair to necessarily look like it&#x27;s been flat-ironed by a professional after you wash and style it yourself if you just blow dry.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you want as long as you don&#x27;t mind putting a little elbow-grease into it.</li>
            <li> Not only is my hair straight, but the frizz seems to have left, also my hair actually feels LESS dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair was fried, stiff, frizzy, and not even that straight, and I followed the directions</li>
            <li> i did it myself, and though a bit cumbersome i don&#x27;t want to pay $200 to someone when last few times i went to a decent salon they ended up frying my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used cheap chemical straighteners in the past that made my hair flat but took less time to flat iron.</li>
            <li> I did it alone because I have short hair, so help with long hair is definitely recommended....</li>
            <li> I still have to go over it with my straighetener if I want it slick straight and styled a certian wait</li>
            <li> i was hoping that by using this i could avoid the flat iron.</li>
            <li> She took her time with the flat iron</li>
            <li> Though I may not need to flat iron it every day now, it did not give me those results I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> also have a ceramic flat iron....</li>
            <li> I think I did not process the hair long enough.  </li>
            <li> However if you have wavy hair like mine that you straighten with the flat iron all the time you should go with the keratin comolex.</li>
            <li> You will still have to flat iron it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white with long, frizzy, wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> At the time, I also got my dyed with a soft black glaze.</li>
            <li> I can air dry, and have a teeny bit of wave and frizz, if I use some serum, that is enough to reduce the frizz to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li> How long does this last or how long</li>
            <li> She still has to use a flat iron to achieve the desired straightness but atleast it doesn&#x27;t take her too long to do it now..</li>
            <li> I used the cold method instead of the hot treatment as I was doing this alone and to be quite honest, was getting tired as this process takes a while.  </li>
            <li> Now, if I do a finger comb blow dry, my hair looks flat ironed.  </li>
            <li> But really thing hard before doing it yourself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it dried completely straight butttt its extremely frizzy And dry.  </li>
            <li> Usually by this stage, the hair will remain straight even when wet.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves her hair which is almost waist long.  </li>
            <li> Not nearly as close to the results that a salon would have produced</li>
            <li> but this is a really long process</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT completely straighten my hair</li>
            <li> It is a long process (2 hrs</li>
            <li> have long hair (up to my waist)</li>
            <li> Be careful the boxes look very similar.</li>
            <li> and I have to tell you that I wish that I would have done this long ago.  </li>
            <li> I had my mom help me with this because my hair is so long.</li>
            <li> I have thick, very wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Even when air dried, it is just slightly wavy in the middle part where it was harder to keep perfectly straight.  </li>
            <li> I left it in for the least amount of time it suggested and it completely fried my hair!</li>
            <li> the only place you can get it without a license is adiscountbeauty.com  Other than that</li>
            <li> I read the guideline several times, and also watched the tutorial video but with the other product, so decided to follow the guideline instead....</li>
            <li> My guess is a big part of the problem with hair loss and other issues</li>
            <li> air dry</li>
            <li> I allowed my hair to air dry</li>
            <li> My har is course, dry and color treated.  </li>
            <li> I let it air dry to see how it would dry,  </li>
            <li> I can let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> make my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I will DEFINITELY buy this product again to do a retouch in the next few months.</li>
            <li> thin, but straight!  </li>
            <li> Normally I have thick, curly, frizzy, and unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> After talking with a high end hair stylist about my daughters&#x27;s very thick and curly hair, she felt my daughter&#x27; hair would not maintain the straightness we desired with the brazilian blow out and recommended the japanese straightening method.  </li>
            <li> This product ruined my hair everywhere, making the front limp and the back frazzled.</li>
            <li> The video will show you how you should really not be doing this at home.  </li>
            <li> Also, I used clips to hold my wet hair during the ironing and may not have ironed as well as I should have.  </li>
            <li> If you are skeptical to try at home definitely go to a salon that offers this!  </li>
            <li> and you WON&#x27;T be disappointed. :)</li>
            <li> so you just sit there while they work on other client&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> Do not wet or wash your hair for at least 48 hours after treatment; and</li>
            <li> when flat ironing you must again use very very small sections and NO CLIPS, have a friend or two help hold your hair loosly while it is being flat ironed.. this process is crutial to pin straightness!!!!</li>
            <li> but I noticed that my ends kept breaking, looked really stiff, and dry.  </li>
            <li> If I let it air dry, it will dry with hardly a wave.</li>
            <li> I think the cold process can be redone in 6 months, probably producing an even better result.&lt;br /&gt;There was no damage with the cold process, my hair is still very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Soooo not worth it.</li>
            <li> - I am praying that he can fix it (at least salvage what is left of my hair).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian, black and not so thick hair.</li>
            <li> I went with the cold process since I am lazy, and I didn&#x27;t have significant curl to remove.</li>
            <li> It took about an hour and a half.  </li>
            <li> (my hair is almost to my waist and VERY thick - took over an hour to dry my hair and you will dry it twice).</li>
            <li> but i have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed race, with hair that is caucasian in texture, but very thick and kinky curly.  </li>
            <li> With the help of my husband, I applied the Matrix Opti Smooth Straightener using the Matrix YouTube Cold application technique (which is different from the Cold technique in the included instructions.)  </li>
            <li> and I just thought I could skip the process of flat-ironing everyday by using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen people with Japanese Straightening that had hair worse than mine and it worked miracles on them.</li>
            <li> She cried when her hair dried.</li>
            <li> I go to the gym 5-6 times a week, so I need to wash my hair almost everyday..</li>
            <li> but it was also no where near as expensive as what the salon would have charged me.  </li>
            <li> Follow with a heavy moisturizing conditioner like Chi organics olive paste.</li>
            <li> Keep a few damp paper towels by you just in case your ends over process.   </li>
            <li> Basically wastes about 3 hours of your time and makes your hair smell for a few days.</li>
            <li> It looks stiff and when I run my hands through it I feel like i&#x27;m running my hands on a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> There a few tips I have learned over the past 4 yrs of using this.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult getting to the back of my head</li>
            <li> So after much googling and research i decided to give it a shot,, and i thinks its not too bad.</li>
            <li> If they don&#x27;t I say buy it and see if they&#x27;ll apply it for a small fee.</li>
            <li> The product stinks like rotten eggs and completely fries your hair.</li>
            <li> I have gotten it done every 8 months for the past 3 years and have never been happier with my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past 7 years and had problem once when I overprocessed my hair a tad bit</li>
            <li> And as usual, it is a 3 step process.</li>
            <li> MY USUAL CURLY UNRULY HAIR.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am not sure about it</li>
            <li> When I dye my hair, I expect to miss a spot or two and expect a small amount of split ends.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, curly, frizzy hair but really long.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply solution by yourself.</li>
            <li> and it got too hard with my curly, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> so why bother with the lesser, cold processing version??)    </li>
            <li> The product was just an utter disappointment.</li>
            <li> Again, PLEASE do as the instructions say and rinse for AT LEAST 7-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have thick, unruly, curly hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> (the cold process claims to reduce frizz and not completely straighten.....</li>
            <li> I finally got so tired of my frizzy, crazy hair that I did it</li>
            <li> Matrix should really care about the technicians coz because of technicians like this the product can get very bad reviews.</li>
            <li> In the past, all the other products I used had damaged my hair really bad.  </li>
            <li> I first got the product applied when we were living on a military base in Italy and continued when we were on another base in Japan.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and wiry hair to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Since I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I was not initially happy as the product was not as described in the ad....</li>
            <li> I had kinky, unhealthy hair that always felt like hay.  </li>
            <li> I set up a mirror behind my bathroom mirror</li>
            <li> Went to my hairdresser who opted for the cold process without the flat iron as we were afraid about damaging my hair.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> With it being early spring and the weather warming up the humidity has been awful....</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need serious curl reduction, I would try the cold process.</li>
            <li> After putting in the last formula which neutralizes the cuticles, I was VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> my stylist made, wrong formula.</li>
            <li> Sorry girls</li>
            <li> There are two processing choices (cold and heat)</li>
            <li> disappointing -</li>
            <li> I used this product for the cold smoothing treatment, not even the japenese straightening.</li>
            <li> My hair is badly damaged.</li>
            <li> Once again a bad idea.  </li>
            <li> but I would blame their bad results on their inexperience with this product.</li>
            <li> And it does not smell bad at all</li>
            <li> I went to my sytlist in Feb to have this done and was disappointed</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful -</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was awful.</li>
            <li> My hair looks disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I also had a similar experience. I have brown naturally curly highlighted hair. This product completely damaged my hair. Before using the opti smooth my hair was very healthy and shiny with minimal frizz. i was hoping that by using this i could avoid the flat iron. I now have frizzy straw like hair because of this product. The keratin complex smoothing treatment is a much better product. I would recommend it over this any day.  Avoid this product it will fry processed hair. I will never use it again.</li>
            <li> My hair is badly damaged. won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I have used this system for around 5 years now, and had the heat version done in the salon about 7 times already. My hair is perfectly pin straight, no frizz and no damage. I can literally let my normal very wavy coarse hair AIR DRY.. yes girls... air dry and it is still pin straight. The tip like everyone says is you MUST use small small sections to comb the product in, must not move while the chemical is processing, your hair must remain straight.. also use vertical strips of saran wrap to lay on top of your head will help it take quicker... the PRE-treatment spray is very important... overdo it if you must to protect your hair. when flat ironing you must again use very very small sections and NO CLIPS, have a friend or two help hold your hair loosly while it is being flat ironed.. this process is crutial to pin straightness!!!! and a ceramic iron like Chi or Babyliss should be used, no cheapies! leave the neutralizer in the full 10 min and comb the entire time is also crutial to being perfectly straight as well as rinsing the product the full ten minutes without making your hair a mess. This product is amazing i wish i could get friends to do it for me, it would save me the $360 i pay in the salon for it to be done... but i have long thick hair. good luck ladies!     If you are skeptical to try at home definitely go to a salon that offers this!  Be sure you use the right kind for your type of hair... i you have bleached in the past DONT use this or any hot straightening methods unless most of your bleached hair has grown out.  It will break it.  You may use this is your hair is color treated, just get the milder version.  I use normal. and if you hair is resistent to procedures, try the one for resilient hair.</li>
            <li> This is definately the best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever had  and I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for over 30 years. FINALLY ! Technology has caught up with my hair!</li>
            <li> After talking with a high end hair stylist about my daughters&#x27;s very thick and curly hair, she felt my daughter&#x27; hair would not maintain the straightness we desired with the brazilian blow out and recommended the japanese straightening method.  However for $1,000 dollars, I had to say no.  However after some online research and reading the reviews on this product, we decided to take the risk.  And the results are amazing!!!  My daughter loves her hair which is almost waist long.  It took us almost 7 hours and most of the product but the result is worth it.  I have never done anything like this before but followed the directions on the packaging and in the reviews.  The look on my daughter&#x27;s face as she ran her hair through her very silky, soft and straight hair was priceless!  Even when air dried, it is just slightly wavy in the middle part where it was harder to keep perfectly straight.  Well with the money and time!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I ordered, Brand New in the box and all the packaging included. Works really good on my wife&#x27;s hair, which is unmanageable without this.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this, my hair stylist uses this product on me when she does the japanese chemical straightening on my hair. she just did it for me today! my hair looks amazing. this is the third time i&#x27;ve done it and both she and i will never use another type of product, this is simply the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION: if you don&#x27;t do hair professionally and try and do this yourself, it MAY not come out the same as when a professional does. just telling you because some people rated it a 1 or 2 stars and they probably did it themselves and aren&#x27;t hair stylists... so just take what i&#x27;m saying into consideration. have a professional use this on you and you WON&#x27;T be disappointed. :)</li>
            <li> I went to the local beauty school and had this done last night.  Normally I have thick, curly, frizzy, and unruly hair.  Not anymore since they used this product on my hair.  I have never been so happy with my hair or the results.  It is a bit time consuming, but who cares I got the result I&#x27;ve wanted all my life.  Nice straight hair!!  What I love about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair like most straighteners do.  You do have to wait 48 hours (so I&#x27;m told) before you can wash it and it doesn&#x27;t leave any overpowering chemical smell to it.  If you want straight hair I suggest that you look at your local beauty school and see if they have this.  If they don&#x27;t I say buy it and see if they&#x27;ll apply it for a small fee. I paid $45 for the entire process to have this done and my husband was as amazed as I was about the results.  It&#x27;s totally worth it!!!!  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I used it on my friend&#x27;s super curly and it really worked..She still has to use a flat iron to achieve the desired straightness but atleast it doesn&#x27;t take her too long to do it now..</li>
            <li> If I could rate this zero stars, I would. I honestly don&#x27;t understand how this product has so many good reviews. After using it, I learned that you just can&#x27;t bypass the salon with things like this. I know it costs more but just get this professionally done and save your poor hair the DAMAGE. The process takes hours and hours-about 6-7 hours to be exact. You absolutely NEED another person to slave away with you, this can&#x27;t be done on your own. The product stinks like rotten eggs and completely fries your hair. I have normal, strong hair so this is in no way my hair&#x27;s fault. I also followed the intructions perfectly. I have smooth wavy hair and I just thought I could skip the process of flat-ironing everyday by using this product. Now my hair takes LONGER to straighten. It DOES make your hair straight-but a frizzy straight. My hair dries straight, flat, and frizzy and it takes FOREVER to smooth out that frizz. Such a dissappointment for all the work put into the process. And I would like to clarify that nowhere on the box does it state that this is \\&quot;Japanese Straightening\\&quot;. It isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve seen people with Japanese Straightening that had hair worse than mine and it worked miracles on them. This is just a chemical relaxing system that sells itself as Japanese Straightening. I used the second application on my sister thinking that maybe since her hair is a different texture it would come out differently but nope-same thing. She cried when her hair dried. Beware, use at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Awesome n works great! Easy to follow directions</li>
            <li> I go to the gym 5-6 times a week, so I need to wash my hair almost everyday.. and it got too hard with my curly, thick hair.  So I turned to this! Now my hair dries up straight.  I still have to go over it with my straighetener if I want it slick straight and styled a certian wait but that takes like 15 min.  It&#x27;s made things so much easier for me!</li>
            <li> Worth it!  Not nearly as close to the results that a salon would have produced but it was also no where near as expensive as what the salon would have charged me.  I&#x27;m sure it would have come out even better if I were a little more patient but this is a really long process and I may have rushed through it a bit.</li>
            <li> wife loved it it worked</li>
            <li> Like many other reviews I have thick, dry hair that could barely get straight with flat iron. After using this product it was like I had natural soft hairs. This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  I have thick, very wavy/curly hair.  It DOES NOT completely straighten my hair but it rather relaxes it so that it has a looser (and prettier in my opinion) curl when I want to wear it natural or curly......or if I want to straighten it, this product allows me to do so much easier than without any chemical straightening.  I don&#x27;t believe there is any product that will totally straighten my type of curly hair......but this product definitely makes straightening easier and it makes it a silkier, smoother straight when I do straighten it (which is most of the time).  I used to pay hundreds of dollars to have this done in a salon and that is where I first discovered this product but I think that salons WAY overcharge for any straightener application. (Japanese or others)   It is a long process (2 hrs min. start to finish) but they are charging an outragous hourly rate in my opinion because the main  time is the processing which takes an hour so you just sit there while they work on other client&#x27;s hair and you&#x27;re paying for that time.  I can do it at home in an afternoon.  It is a little difficult getting to the back of my head (so a friend would be helpful but not necessary).  It certainly can be DONE alone.    There are two processing choices (cold and heat) and I&#x27;ve always used the full, heat process. (the cold process claims to reduce frizz and not completely straighten.....well I know that the full, heat process does not completely straighten anyway so why bother with the lesser, cold processing version??)    Sometimes there will be an instructional DVD with the product (depending on the vendor) but the instructions are easy enough to follow without the DVD.  If you are realistic about your expectations for this product......and realize that you will still have to blow dry and use a flat iron to straighten......you will probably be very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for 30 yrs. I used to use lye relaxers and then in 2006 tried Matrix Opti Smooth. I will NEVER use anything else again! It makes my ahir PIN straight, baby soft and silky smooth. I just redid my hair last week with Matrix OptiSmooth.I know that many people read these reviews before making their purchase and here&#x27;s my experience and how I do it to ensure the best results. I went to my sytlist in Feb to have this done and was disappointed, I am better at this than she is.     Hair Type: Fine with medium to strong curl. Be sure you choose the product for hair texture! If you fine hair even if it is virgin hair use sensitive formula. Coarse hair will need the normal or coarse. DO not use if you have used a lye relaxer or if your hair is bleached. You are taking a HUGE risk if you do. I use sensitive formula. Mistake 1 my stylist made, wrong formula. She fried my hair and didn&#x27;t take out the curls!      Tools:    YOU MUST HAVE A GOOD CERAMIC IRON! DO YOUR RESEARCH ON THIS!! It will make all the difference. I got a Bablyiss Pro on Amazon.[...]   Cheaper irons or the titanium irons. Titanium is metal it WILL RUIN your hair when using Opti Smooth! Mistake 2 my hairdresser made!     PRE STRAIGHTENING: 2 weeks before you straighten deep condition your hair 4x with Redken extreme CAT.This is a pure protein product and will prevent your hair from frying. The CAT will strengthen your hair by 65% after 4 treatments. They used to print on the label. Follow with a heavy moisturizing conditioner like Chi organics olive paste. You want your hair to be over conditioned!    Straightening: There a few tips I have learned over the past 4 yrs of using this. If you have never done this before do a strand test to determine your processing time.   1)Pre treat per directions Don&#x27;t forget the pre treat spray! It&#x27;s better to use a bit to much of this than not enough.          a)Apply the straight creme. GENTLY smooth your hair a bit with the palms of your handswhile it is processing. Keep a few damp paper towels by you just in case your ends over process.   2) Set your Iron to 450 degrees F or as close to it as your iron will go. Another use a professional iron. This is CRITICAL! VERY thin sections of hair and make sure it looks straight and smooth. It may take more than 3x.   3)Neutralizing: You MUST comb it through for the full 10 min. I comb and smooth. Comb w/one hand and smooth with the other. Mistake 3 my stylist made    Those are my success tips:} I do my own w/out help:}</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know where else to ask this but I thought since you guys are reviewing you pretty much know how it works. How long does this last or how long did this last you? Would this last me 3 months? Is this different from the Japanese hair straightening? Did this damage your hair? Did it still stay straight after you take a shower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair (up to my waist) it&#x27;s wavy/curly and its puffy/frizzy.</li>
            <li> I went to the hair dresser on wed and she used the matrix opti smooth on my hair. I washed it today. It looks as good as when she did it. I allowed my hair to air dry and it is almost perfect without doing anything to it! I may style it some, but I&#x27;m so impressed.  I originally 7 months ago had a perm put in for curls. I didn&#x27;t really like it so I went back for hair straightening.  It&#x27;s gonna be so much easier to work with now. I&#x27;m so happy and definitely recommend it, but I would definitely have a professional put it in.</li>
            <li> So after much googling and research i decided to give it a shot,, and i thinks its not too bad. It is very time consuming and deffinitley need one more person if u have long hair..  i have Long medium wavy hair, so i followed the instructions, but the most crucual thing is the straightning iron.  You need a good ceramic flat iron, i have CHi and it worked fine..   My hair is not Pin straight now,, but it is VERY straight. i dont need to put any thing in it any more to calm my crazy curls and friz...  Hey its perfect for 40$.. versus 600 in a salon.. if you are good with your GO FOR IT,, but if you dont know how to handle it,, dont try it,, cuz it can damage your hair if you dont do it right..</li>
            <li> Terrible product. This fried my hair and I had it professionally done at the top salon in town.  It made my hair so frizzy and gave me split ends which I have never had before.  Soooo not worth it. I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star.</li>
            <li> I use to have the beauty shop do it for 300.00$ I found it on amazon and  ordered it for approx. 45$ and did it myself. followed excellent directions and my hair came out great. I will do it again next year</li>
            <li> I have very thick and wiry hair to begin with.  The first time I did it by myself, my hair got 80% straightened... the second time I enlisted the help of my daughter and my hair is now pin straight.  She took her time with the flat iron and I can´t believe the results.  My hair is silkier, smoother and the best part is that I only have to blow or air dry and I don´t have to use the flat iron any more!  Just follow the instructions to a T and you can get beautiful hair in 2-4 hours, depending on the length of your hair.</li>
            <li> As my hairdresser put it \\&quot;this is the best straightener for &#x27;white girl&#x27; hair.\\&quot;  While that may not be politically correct, it is true!  I have naturally wavy/loose curl, FRIZZY, DRY hair.  After having my hairdresser apply this product to my hair, I finally have straight hair.  Not only is my hair straight, but the frizz seems to have left, also my hair actually feels LESS dry.  It&#x27;s shiny (not greasy) and smooth.  I used the normal formula because my hair was course, but \\&quot;virgin.\\&quot;  The product is only $50ish, but I paid $200 to have my hairdresser do the whole process... no regrets!  The process takes a long time, and for best results you need to comb your hair straight.  I think my hairdresser did an amazing job, and had I done it myself I am not sure it would have turned out so perfect.  I would suggest everyone and anyone currently straightening their hair daily to try this product!  I hope this review helps!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used it twice and i love the outcome. i did it myself, and though a bit cumbersome i don&#x27;t want to pay $200 to someone when last few times i went to a decent salon they ended up frying my hair. But having done it professionaly to me , has shown me the steps so i basically replicate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really curly hair and this product maked it smooth and non frizzy. i hope they dont stop selling it</li>
            <li> The product is really good and I would say awesome but if used by the right person. I got my first straightening done in India. And my hair looked great for almost 8 months. I needed a touch up for my new grown hair. So I went to a salon and the lady totally screwed up my hair. It looks stiff and when I run my hands through it I feel like i&#x27;m running my hands on a cleaning brush. I feel so embarrassed with this hair. Matrix should really care about the technicians coz because of technicians like this the product can get very bad reviews. I tried calling the support guys for this product and all they recommended was to go for hair deep conditioning. If I were to get that done why would I go for Opti Smooth?</li>
            <li> Sorry girls I ordered Japanese hair relaxer and received a pro keratine instead. Be careful the boxes look very similar. The keratin turned out okay but I should have sent it back for the Japanese relaxer, idid not realize the mistake until after.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see great results. It tamed my hair a little, but not what I was expecting for so much money!</li>
            <li> I have thick, unruly, curly hair, and a lot of it. I have tried all different types of straightenings from relaxing to keratin and nothing worked. Then I found a stylist in NYC who told me about this. I have gotten it done every 8 months for the past 3 years and have never been happier with my hair. I can walk out of the shower or pool and my hair will be straight and frizz-free, or I can use a blowdryer and add body and waves. My favorite part about this product is that it doesnt make your hair too straight. A curling iron can still be used to add curl, and my hair retains its normal body. The only problem is that in the city i would pay 600 dollars per treatment! Ridiculous! I have had it done enough times now and am confident that I can do it myself, maybe with a friends help. I will be purchasing this from Amazon! It is the best straightening system out there!</li>
            <li> I have normal to wavy hair and bought this product because I thought that it would make my hair silky and soft.  Not so.  Though I may not need to flat iron it every day now, it did not give me those results I had hoped for.  Not bad if you have very wavy hair though.  It was fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have had my hair straightened off and on for 30 years. I used lye products before Japanese straightening and keratin was available and this product reminds me of the results I&#x27;d get from those lye products. It&#x27;s awful - I have used BioIonic ReTex many, many times and always had great results, whether it was done in a salon or at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was awful. My hair was fried, stiff, frizzy, and not even that straight, and I followed the directions exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing - I trusted Matrix because I&#x27;ve loved their Biolage conditioner. But, when I went to get a keratin treatment to fix this at a salon on Newbury St in Boston, the stylist told me he really didn&#x27;t care much for Biloate, calling Matrix&#x27;s products just ok, and nothing really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has different hair and different experiences with products - my hair is different all over - fairly smooth and loose/no curl in front, curlier as you move toward the middle but still soft, then coarse and very curly in back. This product ruined my hair everywhere, making the front limp and the back frazzled.</li>
            <li> With the help of my husband, I applied the Matrix Opti Smooth Straightener using the Matrix YouTube Cold application technique (which is different from the Cold technique in the included instructions.)  It took about an hour and a half.  I&#x27;m happy with the results: my hair is smooth and still healthy.  I still have a good amount of curl in the back (my hair is long, to the middle of my back), won&#x27;t know how much until I let it dry natural.  My strongest and unruliest curl pattern is on my crown and around my face, and that seems to be much improved.  I was concerned with removing too much curl, because I don&#x27;t want stick straight hair all the time.  What I am most pleased about is that it didn&#x27;t damage my hair, oh, and also, my hair doesn&#x27;t stink!  I will definitely use it again (luckily there are two applications in the package, possibly more if you just do touch ups), and may even try to go straighter next time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I used it at home with my friends appling it, there would be no way you could do yourself. I save $300 and have finally put my straightening iron away. Excellent product, excellent seller.</li>
            <li> Did my wife&#x27;s hair with it. Untrained and a men. ha ha. it worked very well. just watch for the timing and read instructions thoroughly  and have it  handy.</li>
            <li> If this is the regular Matrix used in salons, don&#x27;t use it if you color your hair with Clairol.  It turned my hair rubbery during the process and trashed my hair.  It&#x27;s been 6 mths and I still haven&#x27;t recovered.  My hair is however, pretty straight.</li>
            <li> I have put off using this because I was so scared that it would fry my hair (no bleach or color).  With it being early spring and the weather warming up the humidity has been awful.... and so has my hair.  I finally got so tired of my frizzy, crazy hair that I did it and I have to tell you that I wish that I would have done this long ago.  Just as the other reviews said, I am now lettiing my very fine and normally tight spiral curled hair air dry.  I couldn&#x27;t tell you the last time that I was able to let my hair air dry.  I almost cryed.  My hair is pin-straight and the time that I save not straightening my hair is absolutely price-less.  This is the best product to use if you are looking for a really good straightener.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and went online and saw the YouTube video from matrix.  My har is course, dry and color treated.  I had a relaxer about two years ago.  Went to my hairdresser who opted for the cold process without the flat iron as we were afraid about damaging my hair.  It turned out great! My hair is smooth and blow dries so much faster now.  My advice would be to go to a professional and follow the directions to achieve the same results.  Make sure to spend the right amount of time on the processing and rinse the product out each time for at least 5-10 minutes.  i really believe this made a difference. I&#x27;m so glad I did my research.  So worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair straightening solution I&#x27;ve ever use!  It takes a little longer, but we&#x27;ll worth it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my clients for several years with amazing results but this last time I used it the entire top of her hair broke off 1/2 inch long! We are both devastated! I called the company and they were no help at all! I will never use it again they had to have changed there product for this to have happened!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, I had my stylist do it.  You can try to do this yourself but you should really have a professional apply this.  If you decide to do it yourself prepare for disaster.&lt;br /&gt;One review said it&#x27;s better to use too much of the spray rather than to little.  Actually you need a professional stylist to determine what is too much or too little.  You could potentially end up frying your hair.  The same reviewer said you needed to comb it thru your hair for 10 minutes.  Once again a bad idea.  Remember this is what works for HER hair not yours.  Only a professional who is familiar with this product can tell you what you actually need.&lt;br /&gt;You should go to youtube and watch the videos on this with Matrix artistic director Nick Stenson. The video will show you how you should really not be doing this at home.  Maybe you want completely straight hair, there&#x27;s a certain process for that.  Or maybe you want your natural curl without frizz, there a different process for that.  Starting to get the picture now?&lt;br /&gt;Another thing no one has mentioned is after care.  What type of shampoo and conditioner to use.  You will have to use a sulfate free product to cleanse your hair or you&#x27;ll end up stripping your hair of the process you just paid for and your hair will be mad.&lt;br /&gt;When I had the process done I opted for curl with no frizz.  My hair turned out great and now I barely have to use any product on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure the stylist performing this process has done it before.  Ask them questions such as how many times have they used the product, what were the results, were their customers satisfied,  do they have any pictures, etc.  Don&#x27;t assume, protect your hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to buy this product and take it to your stylist to have him or her apply it to your hair that&#x27;s great.  But really thing hard before doing it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Remember what works for some people might not work for you and could possibly end up damaging your crowning glory.Food for thought.  Love your hair.</li>
            <li> Optismooth makes my hair awesome. Many of the reviewers have complained about this product but I would blame their bad results on their inexperience with this product. I have been using this for the past 7 years and had problem once when I overprocessed my hair a tad bit but I took care of the overprocessed strands with a leave in conditioner till it grew out. I use it once it year to touchup.  It makes my hair frizz free and maintenance free.I can just let my hair air dry and still have silky straight hair.  Make sure you read all the material that comes with the product and start the knot test after 20 mins. My hair takes about 30 minutes to process.I set the timer when I start applying step 1 and I start from the nape of the neck. Longer you leave the step 1 chemical in, more are the chances of you frying your hair.  Give it a try. Its awesome.</li>
            <li> Hair looks great within one week after the straightening. Then gradually back to normal... I&#x27;m Asian, black and not so thick hair.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the cold smoothing treatment, not even the japenese straightening. I left it in for the least amount of time it suggested and it completely fried my hair! I had to cut 6 inches off and I still have split ends from this. Did not make hair smooth AT ALL!! My hair looks disgusting. I&#x27;m going to have to save up and get a keratin treatment or something to look normal again. Please think twice before trying this product!!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you want as long as you don&#x27;t mind putting a little elbow-grease into it. My wife&#x27;s hair came out great except for a little part in the back that I messed up. It was my first time seeing a perm in action. You definitely need a helper for this job as it is not an individual task. My wife has used this 2 or 3 times now and has perfected the technique. It&#x27;s a great price and the best product so far that she has used. It also beats spending a couple hundred dollars at the shop to do the same thing.</li>
            <li> The old optismooth that I was using was fantastic in it&#x27;s performance, although it took a long time to process (2 hours). It was able to be applied directly to the scalp with absolutely no burn. The newer versions with black boxes leave an incredible burning sensation on the scalp and smell absolutely horrendous. I guess now I understand Why the new ones were on sale in Salon Centric while the old ones weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> takes time but awesome results.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 or 4 times (each order will do my hair twice - about 6-8 months apart).  Highly recommend this - just be aware you need a few hours and patience to get it done.  Will save you a ton of $$ doing it yourself</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really straighten my hair....just took the frizz</li>
            <li> My wife loved it, worked well!</li>
            <li> Been straightening my hair for 40 years, so I should know!  I&#x27;m mixed race, with hair that is caucasian in texture, but very thick and kinky curly.  I use a straightener to just soften the curl and make it easy to blow dry straight or wavy without having to pull it so much withe the brush.  I was using Loreal X-Tenso until it was discontinued, but I like the Opti Smoothe even better!  I don&#x27;t leave it on long because I don&#x27;t want my hair bone straight, but you can get that result too if that&#x27;s what you want.  Hair does not look or feel damaged afterwards, and the smell goes away with the first shampoo.</li>
            <li> Did what it what supposed to do, results were not like at the salon but nonetheless made styling easier.</li>
            <li> Did not work very well.  After 3 shampoos and it wears off.  Hard to apply solution by yourself.</li>
            <li> Very nice product will def order more packaged great and arrived in time specified thanks heaps for a great buy</li>
            <li> I have been a matrix optismooth user for the past eight years, and I love it.  I first got the product applied when we were living on a military base in Italy and continued when we were on another base in Japan.  Now that we are back in the US, I&#x27;m doing it on myself and have had great, silky smooth successful results for the past two times I have used it.  This last time...the third time I personally applied it, I don&#x27;t think I processed it long enough, which led to ok results...a little frizz in the back and on the sides...So, my reason for writing the review is to let users know that it is a great product, but the directions must be followed to the letter.  Next time, I&#x27;m going to use the knot pictures as a marker for timing the processing correctly...to make sure the hair is not spring back into place and at it remains In a knot.  I will continue to use it, as it has been a real time-saver for me for many years.</li>
            <li> When i got this. The product was not sealed! The spray bottle was not working, so i have to used my hand to get the pre treat work!. I used it and my hair was looking good but did not stay long to be smooth and straight!!.</li>
            <li> So I used the heat straigtening on Saturday you cant twll the real results until you was it in 3 days...  I washed my hair yesterday I&#x27;m going to b honest I let it air dry to see how it would dry,  it dried completely straight butttt its extremely frizzy And dry.  And i did deep conditioning treatments before the process. .  now my hair looks like pubes hopefully it can be fixed by deep conditionings.  I wish there as no frizz then I&#x27;d give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> The product was just an utter disappointment. I have tried some straighteners that were sold in drug stores and they worked better than this. Basically wastes about 3 hours of your time and makes your hair smell for a few days. DO NOT BUY. A brazillian keratin 48 hour will cost you about $140 at a salon. Save the $45 from this to invest in that instead!  (I am a rare Japanese with VERY thick, super curly hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many straightening kits before. And as usual, it is a 3 step process. The first formula is where they basically deconstruct your cuticle. Since I have very thick hair that&#x27;s very unruly, I kept the formula in there for the longest amount possible (listed in the directions). A full 50 minutes. After rinsing out the formula, I was a little bit optimistic as the hair seemed a bit more relaxed than usual. I blow-dried and ironed my hair VERY diligently, making sure I didn&#x27;t miss a single strand. This process takes another 30 minutes (more if your hair is very long!). After putting in the last formula which neutralizes the cuticles, I was VERY disappointed. Usually by this stage, the hair will remain straight even when wet.  I saw no such results here. Obviously by then time my time was up for the neutralizer and my hair was rinsed, I knew what to expect in the mirror. MY USUAL CURLY UNRULY HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to shorten my hair styling time in the morning, but this just stole 3 hours out of my weekend and didn&#x27;t change my daily routine one bit.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s the best hair treatment ever. Way better that keratin. And it does not smell bad at all</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as much as I would have liked. There are still bumps from the curls.</li>
            <li> I actually went to a professioonal salon to get this done and the stylist took a good look at my hair and told me it was ok to do.  I have very thin, curly, frizzy hair but really long. At the time, I also got my dyed with a soft black glaze. After she did everything, my hair looked pin straight! thin, but straight!  I spend $$ on nice hair products like Alterna, Sleek n Smooth, and do my weekly oil treatments but I noticed that my ends kept breaking, looked really stiff, and dry.  I would trim it every two months and each month was the same. I eventually grew it all out and decided never to use MATRIX anything, again. lol.   The straightening system I used before is by Jherri Redding. literally, the best stuff on the planet for this and its not that expensive. the only place you can get it without a license is adiscountbeauty.com  Other than that, I missed my curls so I stuck to Keratin treatments now and then because I dont have to wait til my hair grows out to get my curls back</li>
            <li> My hair is long and fine, but I have a lot of it.  It is wavy, but straightens easily with a quick blow dry.  The problem is a top layer of frizz that drives me nuts.  Air drying out of the question, and even a perfect straight blow dry is ruined the second I encounter ANY rain or humidity.  This is a BIG problem being from Seattle.  I have considered the Brazilian Keratin treatment, but in general my hair does not respond well to protein, and of course there is the cost.  So I decided to give this a whirl.  I went with the cold process since I am lazy, and I didn&#x27;t have significant curl to remove. I have to say, I am pretty damn happy.  I can air dry, and have a teeny bit of wave and frizz, if I use some serum, that is enough to reduce the frizz to almost nothing.  Now, if I do a finger comb blow dry, my hair looks flat ironed.  It (of course) has been rainy the last few days, and it does sort of re-frizz my blown dry hair, but not NEARLY the tragedy it was prior to the treatment, and a quick brushing smooths it most of the way back out.&lt;br /&gt;I think the heat process would have made my hair too flat and thin looking, and damaged it more than necessary. I am only a few days post treatment, but I do wash my hair every day, so I am hopeful the result is fairly permanent.  I will update if things go sideways in a month or two.  I think the cold process can be redone in 6 months, probably producing an even better result.&lt;br /&gt;There was no damage with the cold process, my hair is still very soft and shiny.  If you don&#x27;t need serious curl reduction, I would try the cold process.</li>
            <li> I wanted to take the time to write a full review regarding this product.... I am a male with curly, coarse hair....I have very short hair on the sides, and several inches long on top....I was not initially happy as the product was not as described in the ad.... I read the guideline several times, and also watched the tutorial video but with the other product, so decided to follow the guideline instead....I had been using a 10 dollar product to straighten my hair for the past 10 years, it will go frizzy and back to curly after a couple of days along with scalp burning;).... So, finally decided to spend a bit more for a better result: it worked wonderfully in my case.... I bought the Matrix Shampoo/Conditioner, and over conditioned my hair a week before I used Opti Smooth....also have a ceramic flat iron....I would suggest to have everything ready and nearby ( gloves, plastic wrap, timer, bathroom....) STRONGLY suggesting to follow directions to the letter (finishing a couple of minutes earlier is even better!!)It has been 2 weeks for me, and I have not touched the flat iron, hair is strong, frizzy-free and still looking the same from 14 days ago....been using the Matrix Shampoo/conditioner and I believe it does wonders as well.... to those who are still undecided, buy the product....I did it alone because I have short hair, so help with long hair is definitely recommended....But, if you have always wanted hair that does not need to be straightened after washing it, this is the item for you....</li>
            <li> I sent it back cause my hairstylist says she was worried it would damage my hair. That it was for African american hair not white person hair.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I read ALL the reviews on this item before I purchased it.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I used the cold method instead of the hot treatment as I was doing this alone and to be quite honest, was getting tired as this process takes a while.  But the results were awesome.  My hair is naturally curly (Julia Roberts Pretty Woman Curly) and I&#x27;ve had it straightened approx. 4 times in my life.  The last time my hair was straightened was well over 3 years, only because I couldn&#x27;t afford to go back to the salon and have it done.  This process was better than ANY salon treatment I have had.  I love it!!!!  You will not be disappointed.  It takes me 3 minutes to get my hair stick straight now.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I did the treatment on myself and still have still have some frizz in the back and my hair is not pin straight.  I think I made several mistakes.  I think I did not process the hair long enough.  I only processed 10 mins.  Also, I used clips to hold my wet hair during the ironing and may not have ironed as well as I should have.  Is it safe to redo the treatment to my entire hair?  If so, should I wait a certain period of time before doing so?  I really would appreciate any advice.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I never had a product work so well on my hair until I tried this matrix smooth.  I had kinky, unhealthy hair that always felt like hay.  My best friend is a beautician and said she could turn my hair so straight and smooth as if I was born with it.  I will never use anything else but this product!  In the past, all the other products I used had damaged my hair really bad.  Thank you Matrix for making such a wonderful product for people like me.</li>
            <li> First time I used results were great, second time I didn&#x27;t see so much...so I am not sure about it</li>
            <li> I had my mom help me with this because my hair is so long. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do a swatch test first! This is a chemically based product and, just like dyes and perms, has the potential to damage your hair. And the damage is irreversible. We tested a small section first and my mother was amazed at how soft and smooth my hair was. We processed the rest of my hair, and it was the same result. Soft, silky, smooth. I will warn you, don&#x27;t expect your hair to necessarily look like it&#x27;s been flat-ironed by a professional after you wash and style it yourself if you just blow dry. But the time this product has saved me, and the way my hair looks ten times better without me spending hours on it was well worth it. My hair is manageable and not a frizzball. I can let my hair air dry and it doesn&#x27;t frizz out like before. And trust me, I have coarse, natually frizzy hair and we have well water with iron in it, so this product was a godsent. Please follow the direction to the letter. they are spelled out very clearly, and if you do the patch test first and have a good result, then you will LOVE this product and be glad you spend the money. Please pay attention to the fact that it is VERY clear that you test this product AFTER it has been on your hair for only 10 minutes and then every 5 minutes after that by tying a knot in about 50 strands of your hair. The knot test works, and when your hair is fully processed, the knot will stay tight and not come loose easily. Once that happens, rinse thoroughly. Again, PLEASE do as the instructions say and rinse for AT LEAST 7-10 minutes. My guess is a big part of the problem with hair loss and other issues is that people might not have rinsed thoroughly enough. If you&#x27;re going to do the process, take the time to do it correctly. It took us roughly 5 hours to do my hair and do it right (my hair is almost to my waist and VERY thick - took over an hour to dry my hair and you will dry it twice). And there was more than enough product to do myhair at that length.</li>
            <li> I get this applied to my hair twice a year for more than five years now. I have curly, Italian hair that is medium in thickness and above-average in health. It gives me smooth, straight results even in Florida&#x27;s high humidity. If I let it air dry, it will dry with hardly a wave. Has never damaged my hair, even if the product overlaps on previously-smoothed hair and stays permanently straight (obviously the new growth is curly). But there are rules that must be followed for it to work effectively, both directly from the manufacturer and my own that I&#x27;ve come up with since I have been using it for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mfg&#x27;s rules:&lt;br /&gt;1) Do not wet or wash your hair for at least 48 hours after treatment; and&lt;br /&gt;2) Do not use barretts, clips or headbands of any kind during the first 48 hours (I do use a loose clip and head band for 2 minutes while washing my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rules:&lt;br /&gt;1) Stay away from anything with keratin in it. Keratin-infused oils, shampoos, etc. make my hair dry and brittle. May not make yours brittle, but I get major, major breakage on my opti-smoothed hair if I use something with keratin in it (keratin does NOT affect my new growth/virgin hair).&lt;br /&gt;2) Make sure the person who is applying this knows how to do it correctly. I&#x27;ve had the same person now for the last 5 years giving me a perfect treatment, but the person before her didn&#x27;t apply this correctly and I was left with a frizzy mess.&lt;br /&gt;3) Sleep for the first night with a silk scarf wrapped around hair (babushka) off to the side with no bend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a review that it isn&#x27;t for a Caucasian person&#x27;s hair, this is incorrect. It may not work for every hair type, but for me it&#x27;s a life changer.</li>
            <li> Plz tell me this product is permanent straight hair?</li>
            <li> I used this product for a couple of years before the keratin products came on the market. It works on straightening your hair. I you are African American I say this is better than your drug store perm. However if you have wavy hair like mine that you straighten with the flat iron all the time you should go with the keratin comolex. This is a permanent procedure that will damage your hair regardless and you will have to grow it out and cut the hair eventually especially if you want to change your hair color. For some reason when you color your hair after having this done, the hair color will stick to your hair so good that it will be nearly impossible to lighten it unless your cut it off. Overall, it works of your planning to always have straight hair and not ever change  your hair color. You will still have to flat iron it but it will be easier. If you like to lighten your hair in the summer like I do or like changing hair colors this will fry your hair and you will have to cut it off.</li>
            <li> I just finished trying out this product for the first time and wanted to give some advice for people considering using Matrix Opti Smooth.&lt;br /&gt;1. I&#x27;m white with long, frizzy, wavy/curly hair. I dye it every couple of a months and am prone to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;2. Search the product name on YouTube and you&#x27;ll find a great instructional video that I followed that explains the instructions in professional detail.&lt;br /&gt;3. I used a Babybliss flat iron and blow dryer with a concentrator for the hot application.&lt;br /&gt;4. I used the Matrix leave-in conditioner for several days before using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will DEFINITELY buy this product again to do a retouch in the next few months. When I dye my hair, I expect to miss a spot or two and expect a small amount of split ends. I had NO damage with this product and am insanely pleased. I have used cheap chemical straighteners in the past that made my hair flat but took less time to flat iron. Not this time. My hair blow dries straight, but I still take 5 minutes to run an iron over it to get that polished look. It took several hours to complete and I did it by myself. I set up a mirror behind my bathroom mirror so I could watch what I was doing. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> The first two times I used this product, I would have given it an excellent, 5-star review.  I just had it done for the third time (just a touch-up), by a professional (whom I paid to do this), and it is a nightmare.  My hair is breaking - I can&#x27;t comb through it.  No, I don&#x27;t have curl, but I have the most horrendous horrible looking friz on top of my head right now.  I have an appointment in an hour or so to have him look it over - I am praying that he can fix it (at least salvage what is left of my hair).  A lot of my hair has fallen out this time.  I am REALLY REALLY REALLY upset!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this product.  Enjoy your curls!  Find a way to manage them - don&#x27;t make the same mistake I just made!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years; works every time.</li>
