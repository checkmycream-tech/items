            <li> This bag was a lot nicer than I expected. Very big and spacious with so many pocket! The shoulder strap is very comfortable as well!</li>
            <li> I love it! The size is perfect and I get a lot of girls asking where I got it. It&#x27;s better than paying $60 for it else where it&#x27;s exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> love it. can care a lot of things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wardrobe stylist in film and I use this as a set bag on shoots.  It&#x27;s the perfect size and very durable.  I love the magnetic snaps, they make it easy to grab things in a hurry and they seal themselves when you put things back, but don&#x27;t have time to worry about snapping the compartment closed.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for all my henna supplies. I really like the snap closures and all the separate outside pockets. Being clear, I can see what I have inside so I don&#x27;t have to search through to see where the items are. Great handle and strap.</li>
            <li> I love this bag! Fits all the essentials for doing makeup at test shoots. The plastic material seems very sturdy and I pack it up pretty full most of the time. Love that it has a shoulder strap and the shorter sturdier handles which makes it super easier to carry when it starts to get heavy. Overall really happy with this bag!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and got a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this bag at first. However, it is perfect for travel and excellent quality!  I keep it packed with ALL of my travel toiletries and that saves so much time when packing! Can&#x27;t say enough positive comments about this bag!  Imagine traveling and all toiletries, makeup &amp; medical supplies in one bag that you can clearly see &amp; find!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for to keep all my nail care products.</li>
            <li> Holds everything I need &amp; my place of employment requires a clear purse it&#x27;s perfect</li>

            <li> Great big set bag for my makeup! One star off for not having a defined place for brushes, it&#x27;s just has all the pockets on the side but I&#x27;d love to see an elastic brush holder instead of a couple of pockets. The plastic smell is overwhelming straight from the packaging but I&#x27;m sure after it off gasses for a week or so it will be fine. Great price :)</li>
            <li> above and beyond what i expected. good price too.</li>
            <li> Fits everything and anything love it</li>
            <li> Perfect size, great pockets.  it doesn&#x27;t pass sensitive metal detectors</li>
            <li> I ordered this bag because my makeup bag was over flowing. When this bag came in, it is way bigger than it looks in the picture. I love all of the extra pockets on the outside and there are 2 extra zippered pockets on the inside as well. All my makeup is in 5 medium sized zippered cosmetic bags and i have 2 roll up makeup brush holders plus a large contouring palette and it all fits inside this bag along with my extra makeup sponges and bigger eye shadow palettes and there is still room for more.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase. I needed it expedited because I had a television show I would be working on. This is the ideal set bag for makeup and/or hair! I knew I made the right decision when I saw all of the makeup and hair stylists on set with this bag! I own about 4 set bags and this is the only one that has really worked for me!</li>
            <li> I love itüòç. At first I was concern about the size cause it seemed small but, when I got it, totally fits all the makeup I need. It was well worth $34;)</li>
            <li> Really nice size!  Its pockets are good sized too, This will really come in handy for my stuff on set.  Very excited to put it in action.  It seems well made, so I hope it lasts a long time.  Also love the rubber grips on the handles and on the shoulder strap, thats a nice touch.</li>
