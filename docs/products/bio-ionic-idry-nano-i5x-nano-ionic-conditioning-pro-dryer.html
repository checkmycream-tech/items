    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent dryer.  </li>
            <li>the best hairdryer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Best buy ever.</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>Works great although heavier than I like.</li>
            <li>Great product.....</li>
            <li>This may be a good hair dryer, but mine stopped working after 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this!  </li>
            <li>AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>in case you&#x27;re the kind of person who gets bothered by stuff like that.</li>
            <li>wish it had a stronger setting otherwise love it</li>
            <li>but it seems like my cheaper $30 hair dryer does a better job.  </li>
            <li>Much better deal to purchase on Amazon instead of through the beauty salon.</li>
            <li>I had to buy more than one.</li>
            <li>SIMPLY THE BEST.</li>
            <li>My hair is no longer frizzy and more conditioned than before.</li>
            <li>I love it .......</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I just hope this one lasts more than a year.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this dryer over others for sure.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that easily breaks...</li>
            <li>My hair is no longer frizzy after drying and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>concentrator stays in place and can easily rotate to adjust.</li>
            <li>Very light weight , which is what I needed , dries hair amazingly quick.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is light and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine for me</li>
            <li>I hope they enjoy the FIFTY dollars they stole from me and Amazon should be ashamed for doing business with them.</li>
            <li>this hairdryer is light and not noisy.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair getting significantly thinner</li>
            <li>had originally bought this dryer based on a recommendation from my stylist at the time.  </li>
            <li>after tons of research I finally decided on this one which seemed like a good brand</li>
            <li>i love it sooooo much .</li>
            <li>I do think it dries your hair more gently</li>
            <li>Drys quickly and efficiently and even though I have split ends, it really keeps my hair healthy looking and shiny.</li>
            <li>light and quieter than most professional dryers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>The Bio Ionic does reduce drying time by almost half which is great</li>
            <li>this hairdryer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to try any product that might help my fine, straight and thinning hair look like it has some body.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely more quiet than normal hair dryers which is great, and it does a better job than others, but I&#x27;m not sure it is worth $120</li>
            <li>Overall, it was just okay, and I don&#x27;t think it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer dries hair very fast.</li>
            <li>ok enough about my search for this dryer lets talk about it.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Ok the positive reviewers weren&#x27;t kidding, this thing has made it possible for me to go without conditioner and the flatiron.</li>
            <li>Now, no matter what stuff I put on my hair, I&#x27;m able to dry in some body for the first time.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is very light weight, which is very important to me as my wrist is in tough shape</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer because my hair stylist (who is very particular about the products and supplies she uses) was using it and my $200</li>
            <li>it is very high maintenance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my hair soft and with hardly any fly aways.  </li>
            <li>The Bio Ionic iDry not only meets that need, it&#x27;s also light weight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a high profile hairdresser and this is my go to hair dryer!</li>
            <li>Dries lightning fast and reduces my frizzies to almost nothing.</li>
            <li>Makes blow drying my hair so much faster.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and light weight.</li>
            <li>Smooth and quiet.</li>
            <li>However, the low wasn&#x27;t very powerful.  </li>
            <li>I had originally purchased this dryer at my local professional only store when I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I was charged a 15% restocking fee, $13 to send it back plus the original shipping.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that it conditions my hair or that it&#x27;s a miracle blow dryer, but it is better than other high end dryers.  </li>
            <li>Dry times are quick without any problems!</li>
            <li>You sometimes see this item for less money but make sure the seller is an authorize dealer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used high end hair dryers</li>
            <li>It is every bit as good as the far more expensive ionic dryers, of which I have owned several.  </li>
            <li>( I have carpal tunnel ) and very quiet and quick to dry even the thickest and most coarse and curly hair!</li>
            <li>It is well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>but I guess most items don&#x27;t last hat long these days anyways.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by my hairdresser a couple of years ago and have purchased a few more along the way.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She paid a lot more for her Nano at a local beauty supply shop and was pretty irritated when she learned how little I had paid through Amazon.    </li>
            <li>The dryer only has one heat setting which is WAY too hot.  </li>
            <li>I just pulled out my old Conair ion shine dryer (from 6 or 7 years ago!)</li>
            <li>Plus, my Conair is much smaller, the Bio Ionic was pretty big.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did have the dryer for two and a half years before the original cracking happened, though.  </li>
            <li>It does have a button to turn off the heat completely.    </li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned they are crooks and should be ashamed of themselves.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft after blow drying and no frizz....</li>
            <li>There is a switch button for cool shot making it convenient to blow dry without holding the blue button.</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair everyday and still have healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>it makes it so much easier to dry and style my hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely a nice hair dryer, but I don&#x27;t know about other reviews saying you won&#x27;t need to use conditioner anymore and that it cuts dry time in half.</li>
            <li>and I had a lot more broken pieces.  </li>
            <li>I am still using one that is 10 years old, but I bought another as a back up just in case of sudden death.</li>
            <li>This dryer is heavier and took longer to dry my hair than the 15 year old dryer I was replacing.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair straight and frizz less....</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it leaves my hair straight and frizz less....</li>
            <li> Also, the on/off button is right where you hold the dryer, so it&#x27;s hard to use it without turning it off by mistake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dries hair faster and smoother than other professional dryers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The two settings (high and low) were annoying because the high was much too high</li>
            <li> Just wasn&#x27;t long enough</li>
            <li> Will definite do the same in the future for other purchases.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but at least Amazon offered it at a great price (compared to other sources).  </li>
            <li> but I paid a lot less money for this dryer than my old one.</li>
            <li> I think this dryer would only work for people with super thick hair that&#x27;s not easily damaged.</li>
            <li> My fingers are crossed that it will be reliable for a long time.    </li>
            <li> However,&lt;br /&gt;it took twice as long.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that the drier is quite heavy.</li>
            <li> The prongs are too askew to go into the outlet, and the plastic part fully came off.  </li>
            <li> The Ionic feature does seem to dry the hair faster and with less frizz.</li>
            <li> Not able to return or exchange since I had it over 30 days for Amazon, and the company only gives 15 days for return.  </li>
            <li> Quieter than any other dryer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my other one quit.  </li>
            <li> I had to be very careful with it and not unplug it</li>
            <li> and it takes me half the time as other hairdriers to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a horrible defect, just a bit annoying at times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;About a year and a half ago the plastic cover for the part that goes into the outlet cracked on my bio ionic.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses</li>
            <li> This dryer is like the one they use in the salons so it is not light weight.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble styling or manipulating a hair dryer that is heavier</li>
            <li> Babyliss ProTT was broken for the third time in two years.  </li>
            <li> and I need to use a round brush while blowdrying.</li>
            <li> Since this dryer is so expensive, I dedided not to keep it, sent it back after one use.  </li>
            <li> i have thick, wavy, sometimes unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> As hairdryers go, this one isn&#x27;t very expensive (at least not at the time of this writing)</li>
            <li> Otherwise your warranty will be useless.</li>
            <li> and I always felt like my face was being blasted off.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from fibromyalgia and needed those two options desperately.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me as a gift after another brand (also very expensive) kept breaking on me.  </li>
            <li> I was completely disappointed with this hair dryer..</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> A very expensive dryer for one month!</li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> wish it had a stronger setting otherwise love it</li>
            <li> This may be a good hair dryer, but mine stopped working after 5 weeks.  Not able to return or exchange since I had it over 30 days for Amazon, and the company only gives 15 days for return.  A very expensive dryer for one month!</li>
            <li> I was completely disappointed with this hair dryer..after tons of research I finally decided on this one which seemed like a good brand but it seems like my cheaper $30 hair dryer does a better job.  The Bio Ionic does reduce drying time by almost half which is great but it leaves my hair frizzy and damaged.  I have curly hair and I needed a hair dryer that wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair or cause it to break.  The dryer only has one heat setting which is WAY too hot.  After a few uses I noticed my hair getting significantly thinner and I had a lot more broken pieces.  I think this dryer would only work for people with super thick hair that&#x27;s not easily damaged.</li>
            <li> Works great although heavier than I like.</li>
            <li> I had a dryer almost identical to this for several years and the heat just stopped working. This is almost identical but I paid a lot less money for this dryer than my old one. Much better deal to purchase on Amazon instead of through the beauty salon. Will definite do the same in the future for other purchases. This dryer is like the one they use in the salons so it is not light weight. If you have trouble styling or manipulating a hair dryer that is heavier this is not for you. I am use to it and know how to style my hair so it is no problem for me. The Ionic feature does seem to dry the hair faster and with less frizz.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer dries hair very fast. The hair is not puffy or frizzy. There is a switch button for cool shot making it convenient to blow dry without holding the blue button. The only downside is that the drier is quite heavy.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is light and easy to hold. It was recommended by my hair stylist. My hair is no longer frizzy after drying and dries very quickly. My hair is now silky even without conditioner. It is well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Not only am I&#x27;m not a hairstylist, but I&#x27;m a bit challenged when it comes to doing my hair.  I&#x27;m willing to try any product that might help my fine, straight and thinning hair look like it has some body.  After all the goops, sprays and foams I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s this drier that does the trick.  Now, no matter what stuff I put on my hair, I&#x27;m able to dry in some body for the first time.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but at least Amazon offered it at a great price (compared to other sources).  BTW, I do use the same brand brush in tandem with the drier.</li>
            <li> my hair stylist recommended this. i have thick, wavy, sometimes unruly hair. this hairdryer is well worth the money. it makes it so much easier to dry and style my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer about four years ago when I was still in college, and I just finally threw it away today.  Overall, it was just okay, and I don&#x27;t think it was worth the price. The two settings (high and low) were annoying because the high was much too high and I always felt like my face was being blasted off.  However, the low wasn&#x27;t very powerful.  I just pulled out my old Conair ion shine dryer (from 6 or 7 years ago!) and it dried my bangs much faster this morning.  Plus, my Conair is much smaller, the Bio Ionic was pretty big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had originally bought this dryer based on a recommendation from my stylist at the time.  I have very fine hair that easily breaks...it is very high maintenance.  There was no noticeable difference in breakage using this dryer, and eventually I stopped blow drying the majority of my hair altogether.  Now I just do the bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year and a half ago the plastic cover for the part that goes into the outlet cracked on my bio ionic.  I had to be very careful with it and not unplug it or else the connection would break and the dryer wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  However, yesterday I finally had to unplug it and it fell apart.  The prongs are too askew to go into the outlet, and the plastic part fully came off.  I did have the dryer for two and a half years before the original cracking happened, though.  Just wasn&#x27;t long enough considering what I paid for it overall, but I guess most items don&#x27;t last hat long these days anyways.</li>
            <li> As a stylist I need a dryer that adds shine and does not remove moisture from my clients hair, especially colour processed and permed hair! The Bio Ionic iDry not only meets that need, it&#x27;s also light weight ( I have carpal tunnel ) and very quiet and quick to dry even the thickest and most coarse and curly hair!</li>
            <li> I thought about giving this dryer a 4-star review instead of a 5-star review because the on-off switch is placed so that I tend to accidently turn off the dryer in mid-use.  It&#x27;s not a horrible defect, just a bit annoying at times.  Even with that design flaw, I would still buy this dryer again.  Just warning you . . . in case you&#x27;re the kind of person who gets bothered by stuff like that. It also has only one heat and two speed settings.  That&#x27;s fine for me but, if you like to micro-manage your dryer, it might not be enough for you.  It does have a button to turn off the heat completely.    It&#x27;s an excellent dryer.  It is every bit as good as the far more expensive ionic dryers, of which I have owned several.  I bought this dryer because my hair stylist (who is very particular about the products and supplies she uses) was using it and my $200+ Babyliss ProTT was broken for the third time in two years.  She paid a lot more for her Nano at a local beauty supply shop and was pretty irritated when she learned how little I had paid through Amazon.    This dryer is very light weight, which is very important to me as my wrist is in tough shape and I need to protect it.  It is also reasonably quiet.  I&#x27;ve been using it about six months and it has continued to work well.  My fingers are crossed that it will be reliable for a long time.    You sometimes see this item for less money but make sure the seller is an authorize dealer.  Otherwise your warranty will be useless. As hairdryers go, this one isn&#x27;t very expensive (at least not at the time of this writing) so bite the bullet and pay the extra for a warranty that will be honored, just in case.</li>
            <li> Ok the positive reviewers weren&#x27;t kidding, this thing has made it possible for me to go without conditioner and the flatiron. This saves me a ton of time! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Drys quickly and efficiently and even though I have split ends, it really keeps my hair healthy looking and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a high profile hairdresser and this is my go to hair dryer! I had originally purchased this dryer at my local professional only store when I fell in love with it. After years of using it and it finally going out on me, I tried buying another one in the store only to find it they had been discontinued. :-( of course I knew I had to come on Amazon to find my replacement. Scored! I had to buy more than one. (Just in case)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok ok enough about my search for this dryer lets talk about it.&lt;br /&gt;Very light and quieter than most professional dryers.&lt;br /&gt;Dries hair faster and smoother than other professional dryers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;The concentrator stays in place and can easily rotate to adjust.</li>
            <li> Dries lightning fast and reduces my frizzies to almost nothing. I am still using one that is 10 years old, but I bought another as a back up just in case of sudden death.</li>
            <li> Makes blow drying my hair so much faster. I love it!</li>
            <li> This dryer is heavier and took longer to dry my hair than the 15 year old dryer I was replacing. I hate it. Also, the on/off button is right where you hold the dryer, so it&#x27;s hard to use it without turning it off by mistake. Very annoying. I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> the best hairdryer I have ever owned.  It was recommended by my hairdresser a couple of years ago and have purchased a few more along the way.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair soft and with hardly any fly aways.  AMAZING.  SIMPLY THE BEST.</li>
            <li> Definitely a nice hair dryer, but I don&#x27;t know about other reviews saying you won&#x27;t need to use conditioner anymore and that it cuts dry time in half. It is definitely more quiet than normal hair dryers which is great, and it does a better job than others, but I&#x27;m not sure it is worth $120</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!  Dry times are quick without any problems!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer expecting it would save drying time based on the various reviews I read prior to purchasing.  However,&lt;br /&gt;it took twice as long.  I have very thick, wavy hair and I need to use a round brush while blowdrying. Since this dryer is so expensive, I dedided not to keep it, sent it back after one use.  I was not refunded my money.  I was charged a 15% restocking fee, $13 to send it back plus the original shipping.  So, when all was said and done it cost me FIFTY dollars for the privilege of trying this dryer.  I will NEVER order anything from this seller again.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned they are crooks and should be ashamed of themselves.  I hope they enjoy the FIFTY dollars they stole from me and Amazon should be ashamed for doing business with them.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! My hair stylist uses this dryer and recommended it to me. My hair is no longer frizzy and more conditioned than before. It&#x27;s quiet and light weight.</li>
            <li> Smooth and quiet. Only  2 speeds and heat settings. Just didn&#x27;t care for the dryer at all.</li>
            <li> Great product..... I love it ....... My hair has never felt so soft after blow drying and no frizz....I would recommend this product .</li>
            <li> this hairdryer is light and not noisy. i love it sooooo much . my hair is a lot fuller and healthier eversince i use it. i also dont have any splitt ends anymore and it takes me half the time as other hairdriers to straighten my hair. it leaves my hair straight and frizz less.... a definite must have</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. Very light weight , which is what I needed , dries hair amazingly quick. Quieter than any other dryer I&#x27;ve owned. I suffer from fibromyalgia and needed those two options desperately. Best buy ever.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my other one quit.  Just quit, no 3 weeks&#x27; notice or anything.  I do think it dries your hair more gently and I can tell a difference between using this and a regular ConAir.  I just hope this one lasts more than a year.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me as a gift after another brand (also very expensive) kept breaking on me.  I&#x27;ve always used high end hair dryers so the price didn&#x27;t deter my husband.  I&#x27;ve had this one for over a year and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.  I blow dry my hair everyday and still have healthy hair.  It dries quickly.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it conditions my hair or that it&#x27;s a miracle blow dryer, but it is better than other high end dryers.  I still use conditioner daily.  I would recommend this dryer over others for sure.</li>
