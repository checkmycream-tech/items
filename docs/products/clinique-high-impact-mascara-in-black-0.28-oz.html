            <li>This really is the best mascara ever.</li>
            <li>This mascara didn&#x27;t disappoint - goes on even, extends lash nicely</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump them and it washes off very easily.</li>
            <li>The tapered brush is perfect for inner and outer corners and lengthens beautifully, which is important for me.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My eyes get irritated really easily</li>
            <li>Stays on all day, washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Black mascara and applies great !</li>
            <li>Important note: do NOT buy this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rip off and doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have full or long lashes, but this mascara gives me naturally beautiful lashes that don&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>I was excited because I like Clinique products, however this was lacking.</li>
            <li>Perfect everyday mascara!</li>
            <li>but yet still have a good daily look.</li>
            <li>I splurge on a LOT of things...moisturizer, handbags, the ocassional designer clothing spree...but when it comes to mascara, or any of my makeup really, I tend to get what&#x27;s most conveinent</li>
            <li>It washes off easily, which is nice, but overall, is just another mascara.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super picky about my mascara.  </li>
            <li>My first one came as a free sample as part of a special make-up gift, but now I am willing to spend the money on just this one.</li>
            <li>Will use this on days where I want a more natural look.</li>
            <li>this was a good one, so I was curious to try it out.  </li>
            <li>It has a really good brush that holds enough mascara to really coat the lashes but doesn&#x27;t clump them together.</li>
            <li>Also, the packaging didn&#x27;t look quite right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering right after I publish this review....</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara and will be the only one I will every wear.</li>
            <li>I most definitely prefer Clinique Lash Doubling mascara.</li>
            <li>It is only okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mascara for the last 3 years, I love it.</li>
            <li>thanks for the reminder Amazon!</li>
            <li>I am very particular about mascara.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>It costs $15 at Sephora, Macy&#x27;s, etc., and is actually often given away for free in a gift with purchase.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Really like this mascara</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife because she refuses to pay this much for makeup.</li>
            <li>I just started using Clinique&#x27;s High Impact mascara!</li>
            <li>The thing is, it&#x27;s actually, MARKEDLY better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever seen her wear.</li>
            <li>This goes on great..  if you do touch your lashes or mess with them (as I have a bad habit of touching my lashes) they will flake, but I think that it happens with most mascaras.  </li>
            <li>When I go out, I add another mascara and sacrifice possible irritation, headache or heaviness for the night, but this is wonderful for any other occasion when I am not willing to sacrifice pain for beauty!!</li>
            <li>fiercely maintain that every woman is different, and therefore every woman&#x27;s eyelashes are different, and therefore one person&#x27;s favorite mascara doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, someone gave me a sample of the Clinique High Impact mascara</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;ve never had a mascara make my eyelashes look as lush as this one does.</li>
            <li>She has somewhat sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive eyes&lt;</li>
            <li>This mascara is old and clumpy.  </li>
            <li>It has been the only mascara I have used for the past 3-4 years and will be the only kind I buy.</li>
            <li>So, my one qualm with the regular is that it isn&#x27;t particularly smudge proof in high-sweat or high-condensation situations.</li>
            <li>and its only $10 for the small one. :)</li>
            <li>Needless to say, she came in the next day with a bottle of her own!</li>
            <li>High Impact falls short of lengthening.</li>
            <li>A little dry and not as easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I was ready to splurge on an expensive mascara if that&#x27;s what it took to get really beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>This is a decent &amp;#34;brunch&amp;#34; mascara for someone who wants a subtle look, but I prefer a more dramatic look since my lashes are pretty short to begin with.</li>
            <li>Not most of the day, part of the day, just the important middle of the day, ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>I spent too much money for makeup that had to be discarded.</li>
            <li>Again, this is a particular problem for me because my eyelashes are long enough to touch my brow bone when curled, so I often have to make sure I don&#x27;t have a black mess above my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But,</li>
            <li>Not irritating &amp; doesn&#x27;t smudge or leave black marks below lower lid.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old, or what, but its nothing like the last tube of the same product that I purchased a few months ago.</li>
            <li> My boss actually said \\&quot;I never realized your lashes were that long - did you get lash extensions?\\</li>
            <li> and I was completely addicted from the first use!</li>
            <li> The label is not complete.</li>
            <li> but this tube seemed to dry out pretty quick :(</li>
            <li> This tiny tube stays useable long after lesser brands have dried out and become unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally very long eyelashes</li>
            <li> I will warn you - you MUST wait for lashes to dry between applications.</li>
            <li> but since it didn&#x27;t enhance High Impact,  I&#x27;m not sure if it would enhance any other mascara.</li>
            <li> I would rather use one from a regular store and save a few dollars.  </li>
            <li> No more burning, red, blood-shot eyes.</li>
            <li> Red eyes, not sexy.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Important, because I&#x27;m always running 10 minutes late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t use the waterproof stuff (so bad for your lashes unless you actually remove your makeup thoroughly every day, but who does that?)</li>
            <li> This one is not really worth the price.</li>
            <li> It could be that it was not a fresh mascara?</li>
            <li> Received dried out,,,,should have returned,  Very aggravated needless to say.</li>
            <li> Black is very black.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mascara that would not make my eyes feel heavy</li>
            <li> The mascara was dried out when I received it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is how small the brush is and how thick the stuff is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can usually put this stuff on without having to wipe off excess from my cheeks / brow line.</li>
            <li> so if she gets a weird brand she just goes around looking like she&#x27;s been ripping massive bong hits al day.</li>
            <li> A bottle of visene to combat your mascara irritation, not a winning combination.</li>
            <li> I just try hard and not touch them, although it&#x27;s a habit :/</li>
            <li> and and you can&#x27;t get it all no matter how hard you try.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s thick thick thick but not goopy, waxy, or drippy.</li>
            <li> I was in a hurry one day and learned this the hard way!</li>
            <li> You know why Clinique is so expensive?</li>
            <li> Ever since using this one, I&#x27;ve been disappointed whenever I try any of the others.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this mascara! Been using it for years! All others make my eyes itch or water.</li>
            <li> This mascara smears so by the end of the day I look like a racoon...I&#x27;ll never buy it again.</li>
            <li> Quality for a good price.</li>
            <li> My eyes have been burning and always looking bloodshot. I thought it was my contact lenses. It was the Cover Girl, Loreal, Maybelline mascaras. My daughter gave me a sample of Clinique and what a difference!!!! No more burning, red, blood-shot eyes. I will only wear Clinique from now on. It does not flake off or rub off under your eyes. Black is very black. Not clumpy.  Seller shipped it in a beautiful gift wrapped box with a handwritten thank-you note.(See pics)  I will be ordering from SUNNYDBEAUTY from now on.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara and will be the only one I will every wear. It looks good on my eye lashes. Doesn&#x27;t clump them and it washes off very easily. I can&#x27;t stand wearing mascara that is a pain to wash and and you can&#x27;t get it all no matter how hard you try. I splash my face times to loosen it up then wash it off in seconds. My eyes get irritated really easily and this doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all. It has been the only mascara I have used for the past 3-4 years and will be the only kind I buy. I have recommended this product to a lot of people.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. I am a makeup snob and I say it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li> This was included in Sephora&#x27;s Lash Stash kit. I was excited because I like Clinique products, however this was lacking. It came double ended with primer, so I did one eye with primer + mascara and one eye alone with just mascara. Literally could not tell the difference between the two eyes and neither could my husband. This is a decent &amp;#34;brunch&amp;#34; mascara for someone who wants a subtle look, but I prefer a more dramatic look since my lashes are pretty short to begin with. I most definitely prefer Clinique Lash Doubling mascara. The tapered brush is perfect for inner and outer corners and lengthens beautifully, which is important for me. High Impact falls short of lengthening. I have yet to couple primer with another mascara but since it didn&#x27;t enhance High Impact,  I&#x27;m not sure if it would enhance any other mascara. Will update if I can. Doesn&#x27;t smudge however, which IS a plus. Will use this on days where I want a more natural look.</li>
            <li> Being a male, I can&#x27;t say that I use this product but my wife does and she swears by it.  It&#x27;s long lasting, doesn&#x27;t smear, and doesn&#x27;t irritate her eyes or skin.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day, washes off easily.</li>
            <li> This is the clumpiest tube of mascara I have ever owned. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old, or what, but its nothing like the last tube of the same product that I purchased a few months ago. Not purchasing from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Received dried out,,,,should have returned,  Very aggravated needless to say.</li>
            <li> Important note: do NOT buy this on Amazon. It costs $15 at Sephora, Macy&#x27;s, etc., and is actually often given away for free in a gift with purchase. I&#x27;m just trying to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fiercely maintain that every woman is different, and therefore every woman&#x27;s eyelashes are different, and therefore one person&#x27;s favorite mascara doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. I HATE Maybelline Great Lash (too waxy - made my eyelashes stick together) and Benefit They&#x27;re Real didn&#x27;t really work for me either (the big brush just clumped up at my roots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff, though, is my kinda stuff. I have naturally very long eyelashes but they&#x27;ve thinned out with age (and 15 years of contact lens usage), so my number one goal in mascara is to thicken. The brush on this stuff ensures an even application, and the formula is magical - it&#x27;s thick thick thick but not goopy, waxy, or drippy. I can usually put this stuff on without having to wipe off excess from my cheeks / brow line. Important, because I&#x27;m always running 10 minutes late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t use the waterproof stuff (so bad for your lashes unless you actually remove your makeup thoroughly every day, but who does that?) So, my one qualm with the regular is that it isn&#x27;t particularly smudge proof in high-sweat or high-condensation situations. Again, this is a particular problem for me because my eyelashes are long enough to touch my brow bone when curled, so I often have to make sure I don&#x27;t have a black mess above my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, to be fair, I probably shouldn&#x27;t be putting on mascara before the gym.</li>
            <li> Thank you good product great service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super picky about my mascara.  I head this was a good one, so I was curious to try it out.  It is only okay.  It washes off easily, which is nice, but overall, is just another mascara.  I would rather use one from a regular store and save a few dollars.  This one is not really worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love it! I was looking for a mascara that would not make my eyes feel heavy but yet still have a good daily look. This Is perfect for daily wear. When I go out, I add another mascara and sacrifice possible irritation, headache or heaviness for the night, but this is wonderful for any other occasion when I am not willing to sacrifice pain for beauty!!</li>
            <li> The mascara was dried out when I received it. I spent too much money for makeup that had to be discarded.</li>
            <li> Black mascara and applies great ! Love it</li>
            <li> This goes on great..  if you do touch your lashes or mess with them (as I have a bad habit of touching my lashes) they will flake, but I think that it happens with most mascaras.  I just try hard and not touch them, although it&#x27;s a habit :/</li>
            <li> This really is the best mascara ever. I&#x27;ve tried so many that say they add volume and length. Well I&#x27;ve never had a mascara make my eyelashes look as lush as this one does. Ever since using this one, I&#x27;ve been disappointed whenever I try any of the others. My first one came as a free sample as part of a special make-up gift, but now I am willing to spend the money on just this one.</li>
            <li> Always, used another product but just too pricey.  This mascara didn&#x27;t disappoint - goes on even, extends lash nicely</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not Clinique. The label is not complete. It&#x27;s a rip off and doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth. It&#x27;s clumpy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for the last 3 years, I love it. I don&#x27;t have full or long lashes, but this mascara gives me naturally beautiful lashes that don&#x27;t clump. This mascara has never irritated my eyes, which was something that used to be a problem with drugstore mascaras. Perfect everyday mascara!</li>
            <li> Love would recomend to everyone. Washes off easliy and does not pullblashes out woulg not usr any ither mascara after using this</li>
            <li> Always use it... For years and years.</li>
            <li> Not irritating &amp; doesn&#x27;t smudge or leave black marks below lower lid.  I&#x27;ve had others that do.</li>
            <li> Made my lashes look big! The only complaint is how small the brush is and how thick the stuff is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****Boxham from Sephora is a million times better!!!!!!!!! and its only $10 for the small one. :)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent mascara. It has a really good brush that holds enough mascara to really coat the lashes but doesn&#x27;t clump them together. It defines and volumizes! The mascara is high-quality and is almost a &amp;#34;one-coat&amp;#34; mascara. Seriously, I was ready to splurge on an expensive mascara if that&#x27;s what it took to get really beautiful lashes. This is a great mascara, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> A little dry and not as easy to put on. It could be that it was not a fresh mascara?</li>
            <li> Ladies, if your looking for the best mascara this is it.  This formula never clumps and if you use a eyelash curler b4 using the mascara you lashes will look amazing.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara but this tube seemed to dry out pretty quick :(</li>
            <li> You know why Clinique is so expensive? Because it works. I bought this for my wife because she refuses to pay this much for makeup. The thing is, it&#x27;s actually, MARKEDLY better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever seen her wear. She has somewhat sensitive eyes so if she gets a weird brand she just goes around looking like she&#x27;s been ripping massive bong hits al day. Red eyes, not sexy. A bottle of visene to combat your mascara irritation, not a winning combination. The other thing is that it lasts all day. Not most of the day, part of the day, just the important middle of the day, ALL DAY. It doesn&#x27;t get clumpy either. This tiny tube stays useable long after lesser brands have dried out and become unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to recap&lt;br /&gt;1) It doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive eyes&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t take a sandblaster to get off at night&lt;br /&gt;3) Lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;4) Stays liquid until you hit the bottom&lt;br /&gt;5) Helps give my beautiful wife sexy, smokey eyes</li>
            <li> This mascara is old and clumpy.  Wish I had bought it from Clinique.com or at my local department store.  Also, the packaging didn&#x27;t look quite right.</li>
            <li> This is great mascara!  It does not clump or flake.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I splurge on a LOT of things...moisturizer, handbags, the ocassional designer clothing spree...but when it comes to mascara, or any of my makeup really, I tend to get what&#x27;s most conveinent (think grocery shopping and pick it up!) and moderately priced. HOWEVER, someone gave me a sample of the Clinique High Impact mascara and I was completely addicted from the first use! My boss actually said \\&quot;I never realized your lashes were that long - did you get lash extensions?\\&quot; Nope! I just started using Clinique&#x27;s High Impact mascara! Needless to say, she came in the next day with a bottle of her own! I will warn you - you MUST wait for lashes to dry between applications. If not, they will look clumpy and matted. I was in a hurry one day and learned this the hard way!</li>
            <li> I have forgotten to order this again and don&#x27;t know how  could forget. This is the greatest mascara! No clumping, perfect brush, fantastic coverage and definition. I&#x27;ll be ordering right after I publish this review....thanks for the reminder Amazon!</li>
            <li> I am very particular about mascara.  I work out a lot and therefore sweat a lot and this one stays on all day and night!</li>
