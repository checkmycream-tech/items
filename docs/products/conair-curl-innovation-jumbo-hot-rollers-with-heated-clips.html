    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Shame too because the size is perfect.</li>
            <li>So this size is perfect for me and there are plenty of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These curlers work great, but I am not a fan of the clips that come with them.  </li>
            <li>They work great for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>She has used it twice and is happy with it.</li>
            <li>These rollers are the perfect size for my purpose and heat very quickly.  </li>
            <li>These hot rollers work great for me!</li>
            <li>I LOVE that it has a built-in storage area for the clips!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love that feature!    </li>
            <li>These rollers are the perfect size for large, wavy curls.</li>
            <li>My hair came out with nice waves and LOTS of body.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, but they leave creases in your hair that don&#x27;t brush out.</li>
            <li>but if you wait 4 or 5 minutes for it to heat up, it will get even hotter and will give you a nice, strong curl that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>How is this &#x27;innovative&#x27;?</li>
            <li>I love Conair products but not this one.</li>
            <li>The longer you let it heat up, the better it will hold your curl.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad for it ...</li>
            <li>Also my hair does not hold a curl easily.</li>
            <li>With this Conair set, there is a nice, clean storage area built right into the front, so everything stays organized and neat on my countertop.</li>
            <li>I have chin length, fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like huge rollers</li>
            <li>I use all 12 rollers and my hair is smooth, shiny and has a lot of volume that lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li>the last clip I put on would fly off and the roller would fall out.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!   :)</li>
            <li>It heats up quick</li>
            <li>however that said I tried them this morning and the roller heats up nicely and the top is not hot to the touch-</li>
            <li>thee rollers do not get very hot.</li>
            <li>its great if you like having half curls on your head</li>
            <li>First these are not heat clips!</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t touch them and they still smooth and curl my hair really well.  </li>
            <li>It was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried using hot rollers that utilize the clips, instead of wire pins.</li>
            <li>They became so hot they burned my scalp and the clips they give you to hold the rollers in your hair don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I gave this one away as I did not want to pay the shipping to return it and went out and bought the conair more big curls and got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>The clips seem to hold well, and my hair comes out soft and smooth.    </li>
            <li>how on earth would I handle hot clips on hot rollers??</li>
            <li>I like the product though I&#x27;ve never owned hot rollers before</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s jumbo hot roller set stopped working after 10 years.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get so hot</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find it anymore when the heating element finally gave out.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly, big hair, so when I need it to look more professional, I use hot rollers to smooth is out and shape it.  </li>
            <li>I bought these because all same size and clips made easy to use but didn&#x27;t curl hair at all.</li>
            <li>I bought these to give my hair volume and smooth it out without frying it on a flat iron.</li>
            <li>Also, the rollers don&#x27;t get hot enough to make a nice, tight curl, even after letting them cool completely.</li>
            <li>I had an earlier model of this product that came with wire holders that worked much better, albeit less comfortable.</li>
            <li>I used an old model of Conair hot rollers for years.  </li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned, the rollers heat up plenty fast.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this hot roller set.</li>
            <li>It was very hard to find a unit with only jumbo 1 1/2 inch rollers, this does a great job.</li>
            <li>so she takes 4 rollers from the second unit and uses those in the first unit as she is doing her hair.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and you can get a great tight hair on the roller, but the clip isnt big enough to actually grab on to your head</li>
            <li>There are twelve rollers which is enough for me, and while large are not jumbo.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited about getting these after my previous Conair rollers stop heating after 10 plus years-</li>
            <li>Her old unit had 16 - 1 1/2 inch rollers</li>
            <li>and I give the product 3â€“4 stars with the only negative being that the clips could be better at holding the hair.</li>
            <li>They do not get as hot as the other ones that I have.</li>
            <li>They left my hair frizzy and dry and often the rollers were so hot they would burn my fingers.</li>
            <li>So apparently even the description writer was deceived by the photo.  </li>
            <li>:  my hair is past shoulder-length, fine but extremely thick, naturally wavy but not curly, tends to be dry and frizzy on the ends and easily damaged, especially as it is highlighted.</li>
            <li>I tried other brands, such a a pearl ceramic, but the brands that have extra-fast heat-ups or get really hot are just damaging to my hair, no matter what the claims otherwise.  </li>
            <li>I have medium long, very thick hair, so I had to purchase 2 sets of these rollers in order to be able to put all of my hair into rollers.</li>

            <li> I have to dry and blow it out somewhat to tame the curl first.  </li>
            <li> I do see a bit of an indention from the top front curler that is annoying but it isn&#x27;t very noticeable and goes away.  </li>
            <li> My individual hair strands are very thin and fine, but I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> The case is large and would be hard to take if you travel.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and have been looking for 2&amp;#34; rollers, but can&#x27;t find a set of them.</li>
            <li> They carry plenty of heat to curl my hair, and I have noticed they carry heat for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> Really time sufficient when in a rush but doesn&#x27;t work for long thick hair...</li>
            <li> I also thought the clips were heated because the other version of this with various roller sizes have heated clips.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I have always disliked having to find separate storage for my hot roller clips, which usually end up just being thrown in a big storage bag of some type that takes up additional space and looks messy.</li>
            <li> I called Conair to complain and the operator was rude, asked me for my number and said someone would call me back to set up a return, I never received a call.</li>
            <li> like I have with previous units</li>
            <li> Not a favorite.</li>
            <li> and I have no use for the small ones.  </li>
            <li> but the clips - cheap little plastic clips that are horrible!</li>
            <li> Also, with thick hair, I have had a hard time with the clips that come with curlers; they just don&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li> it takes about 2 hours to at least achieve a wavy hair style</li>
            <li> The clips will not hold thick hair.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> so thats why I was confused.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, the plastic cover was broken so</li>
            <li> I had to completely re-curl my hair with a curling iron to get rid of the awful marks.</li>
            <li> Sadly I am returning today.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these they are worthless.  </li>
            <li> THE CLIPS ARE HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

            <li> Won&#x27;t curl hair. Does not heat up enough. The clips leave marks on the hair</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried using hot rollers that utilize the clips, instead of wire pins. THE CLIPS ARE HORRIBLE! Very easy to use, but they leave creases in your hair that don&#x27;t brush out. Seriously? How is this &#x27;innovative&#x27;? I had to completely re-curl my hair with a curling iron to get rid of the awful marks. Also, the rollers don&#x27;t get hot enough to make a nice, tight curl, even after letting them cool completely. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Did not like these at all. They became so hot they burned my scalp and the clips they give you to hold the rollers in your hair don&#x27;t work. I love Conair products but not this one. I gave this one away as I did not want to pay the shipping to return it and went out and bought the conair more big curls and got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The clips don&#x27;t hold the hair well at all.  I rolled my hair put the clip on several ways and the rollers just fell off.  I did not roll a lot of hair. Don&#x27;t buy these they are worthless.  I called Conair to complain and the operator was rude, asked me for my number and said someone would call me back to set up a return, I never received a call.</li>
            <li> My wife seems to like the product.</li>
            <li> First these are not heat clips! Second they leave my hair frizzy and with dents. Shame too because the size is perfect.</li>
            <li> These curlers work great, but I am not a fan of the clips that come with them.  They leave kinks in your hair.  I had an earlier model of this product that came with wire holders that worked much better, albeit less comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have chin length, fine, curly hair.  I bought these to give my hair volume and smooth it out without frying it on a flat iron. They work great for that purpose.  I have to dry and blow it out somewhat to tame the curl first.  I use all 12 rollers and my hair is smooth, shiny and has a lot of volume that lasts for hours.  I do see a bit of an indention from the top front curler that is annoying but it isn&#x27;t very noticeable and goes away.  That is my only complaint except the unit is very large.  I also thought the clips were heated because the other version of this with various roller sizes have heated clips.  The units look just alike so thats why I was confused. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.  It was worth the money.  I also like the clip storage.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, big hair, so when I need it to look more professional, I use hot rollers to smooth is out and shape it.  These rollers are the perfect size for my purpose and heat very quickly.  However, the clips leave marks on the hair--I have to use skinny clips from a different roller set to avoid the hair marks.  I have medium long, very thick hair, so I had to purchase 2 sets of these rollers in order to be able to put all of my hair into rollers.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers work great for me! I have shoulder length, fine, straight hair. And lots of it. My individual hair strands are very thin and fine, but I have a lot of hair. Also my hair does not hold a curl easily. These rollers are the perfect size for large, wavy curls. The longer you let it heat up, the better it will hold your curl. I know the box says it heats up in a minute or two, and it does .... but if you wait 4 or 5 minutes for it to heat up, it will get even hotter and will give you a nice, strong curl that lasts all day. I have no problem with the clips holding my hair or leaving dents. The clips seem to hold well, and my hair comes out soft and smooth.    I LOVE that it has a built-in storage area for the clips! The clips are NOT heated. And I&#x27;m glad for it ... how on earth would I handle hot clips on hot rollers?? Anyway, I have always disliked having to find separate storage for my hot roller clips, which usually end up just being thrown in a big storage bag of some type that takes up additional space and looks messy. With this Conair set, there is a nice, clean storage area built right into the front, so everything stays organized and neat on my countertop. Absolutely love that feature!    Overall, I really like this hot roller set. Thanks!   :)</li>
            <li> Really time sufficient when in a rush but doesn&#x27;t work for long thick hair...it takes about 2 hours to at least achieve a wavy hair style</li>
            <li> They do not get as hot as the other ones that I have. Not a favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought these because the picture made it look like the clips are heated. Well they&#x27;re not. I looked on the box and the box doesn&#x27;t say anything about heated clips so maybe it was my fault for making assumptions. However, the Amazon description DOES say that the clips are heated, but they&#x27;re not! So apparently even the description writer was deceived by the photo.  I like the product though I&#x27;ve never owned hot rollers before so I don&#x27;t have any comparison, but it does it&#x27;s job and I give the product 3â€“4 stars with the only negative being that the clips could be better at holding the hair. However, this product gets a one star for inaccurate description.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting these after my previous Conair rollers stop heating after 10 plus years- however that said I tried them this morning and the roller heats up nicely and the top is not hot to the touch- but the clips - cheap little plastic clips that are horrible! no they do not heat up - I have shoulder length hair and you can get a great tight hair on the roller, but the clip isnt big enough to actually grab on to your head so you end up with them hanging in your face! its great if you like having half curls on your head becuase they would not hold up closer to your head.. Sadly I am returning today.</li>
            <li> She still has hair so I ordered it for her. Cheaper than in Harmons and we got it 48 hours later. She has used it twice and is happy with it. I can tell she likes it because I am not finding the rollers all aroud the house like I have with previous units</li>
            <li> I bought these because all same size and clips made easy to use but didn&#x27;t curl hair at all.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s jumbo hot roller set stopped working after 10 years.  I purchased this unit and she loves it, the only problem was there is only 12 rollers.  Her old unit had 16 - 1 1/2 inch rollers so I had to purchase two units. It heats up quick so she takes 4 rollers from the second unit and uses those in the first unit as she is doing her hair.  The second unit and extra 8 rollers sit in a box as a backup. It was very hard to find a unit with only jumbo 1 1/2 inch rollers, this does a great job.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have been looking for 2&amp;#34; rollers, but can&#x27;t find a set of them. I ordered these 1.5 inch rollers expecting to get the amount of rollers I need.  When I opened the box, the plastic cover was broken so thee rollers do not get very hot. It looked like some one had kicked the box.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get so hot you can&#x27;t touch them and they still smooth and curl my hair really well.  The case is large and would be hard to take if you travel.  But they work well.</li>
            <li> I used an old model of Conair hot rollers for years.  I wasn&#x27;t able to find it anymore when the heating element finally gave out.  I tried other brands, such a a pearl ceramic, but the brands that have extra-fast heat-ups or get really hot are just damaging to my hair, no matter what the claims otherwise.  They left my hair frizzy and dry and often the rollers were so hot they would burn my fingers. Also, with thick hair, I have had a hard time with the clips that come with curlers; they just don&#x27;t stay on.  So I would be in the middle of rolling the next section of hair and the last clip I put on would fly off and the roller would fall out.  What I like about this model:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It does not over-heat.  As far as I am concerned, the rollers heat up plenty fast.  They carry plenty of heat to curl my hair, and I have noticed they carry heat for quite a long time.  This helps set the curl in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I don&#x27;t find my fingers getting burned by the rollers&lt;br /&gt;3.  The clips ACTUALLY STAY IN!!&lt;br /&gt;4.  My hair came out with nice waves and LOTS of body.&lt;br /&gt;5.  There are twelve rollers which is enough for me, and while large are not jumbo.  I don&#x27;t like huge rollers and I have no use for the small ones.  So this size is perfect for me and there are plenty of them.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Price isn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;7.  Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but my hair feels softer after using these.&lt;br /&gt;For information:  my hair is past shoulder-length, fine but extremely thick, naturally wavy but not curly, tends to be dry and frizzy on the ends and easily damaged, especially as it is highlighted.</li>
            <li> The clips will not hold thick hair. Terrible. I am returning it</li>
