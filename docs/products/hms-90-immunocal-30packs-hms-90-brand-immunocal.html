            <li>a cheap good try out and its actually the best type</li>
            <li>This item was purchased for a child with severe autism,and we did not get the results we were hoping for, which was better communication, eye contact, improved mood...</li>
            <li>I also checked for the ingredients in both Immuncal and Immunocal Whey Protein Isolate Powder Supplement but mostly have done research on Glutathione.&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the way make sure it&#x27;s UNDENATURED WHEY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all safe to take, I&#x27;ve done the research.</li>
            <li>His and my health and stomach/gastro tract,are SO much better.</li>
            <li>but glutamine took our stomach/gastro health to a MUCH better level.</li>
            <li>so because my gut is so much better and making serotonin...</li>
            <li>I am enjoying using this project.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>She has taken it before and the results now seem to be better.</li>
            <li>Very nice, thanks.</li>
            <li>For all of the amazing benefits it touts, I was willing to try it, even for the price.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and product speaks for itself!</li>
            <li>/&gt;5 - 6 days 1/8 tsp Glutamine in room temp water&lt;br /&gt;Take 3 to 4 times a day...1/2 hour before meal or 1 hour after meals.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll notice huge difference by end of 5</li>
            <li>I use light vanilla soy milk with which to mix it.</li>
            <li>Whey protein is important for our health</li>
            <li>I noticed a significant boost of energy.</li>
            <li>In order to blend this stuff &amp;#34;correctly&amp;#34; you have to purchase a special blender that will not &amp;#34;denature&amp;#34; the proteins in the mixture.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, not so much the shipping time.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products for my nails and hair have spend Soooo MUCH money</li>
            <li>Remember, the ingredients in Immunocal and Immunocal Whey Protein Isolate Powder Supplement are all precursors of Glutathione.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried looking into first about products that have Lipsomes surrounding Glutathione....survives gut &amp; transfers easily to blood instead of going through liver.</li>
            <li>My daughter discussed her great response with her pain doctor who is looking into Immunocal for his other fibromyalgia patients.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in Immunocal and Immunocal Whey Protein Isolate Powder Supplement are all precursors to the super antioxidant Glutathione!&lt;br /&gt;Google DR.Oz</li>
            <li>The shipment came quickly.</li>
            <li>For leaky gut, Crohn&#x27;s, Celiac disease (go on gluten free diet, but this really helps)</li>
            <li>BUT WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>Nothing is worth your health.</li>
            <li>Nothing is worth poisoning yourself into stress, anxiety, and fear.</li>
            <li>Eventually I just started putting it in my cereal so as to leave it in the most natural state.  </li>
            <li>My understanding is that she doesn&#x27;t make enough glutathione on her own and the Immunical is giving her precursors that she needs to correct this deficiency.  </li>
            <li>and you do have to get the right ones...</li>
            <li>but i have noticed a significant improvement in my energy level, particularly in the afternoon.</li>
            <li>first thing when you go into hospital as it helps body to heal severe burns, injuries, etc.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>We really didn&#x27;t know about it or ever heard of it.  </li>
            <li>We used the product for two straight months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Immunocal IS an all-natural non-prescription health product available worldwide and is medically recognized in the Physicians&#x27; Desk Reference.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper to get the precusors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s micronized and MUCH easier to dissolve in water.</li>
            <li>A LOT FOR THE YEAR IS STAYING AWAY FROM FAST FOOD,PASTRIES (PIES,CAKES,COOKIES,DONUTS)WHITE SUGAR AND</li>
            <li>My wife is using it as well, and she feels very well</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I am otherwise quite healthy and active.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too high maintenance for me.</li>
            <li>I really have to say unless I get the Exact same thing from somewhere else.  </li>
            <li>While I am yet to see their full results, I can tell you that the product has help me suppress my hunger and hold me on my long days at work.</li>
            <li>This is a new product for me to experience.</li>
            <li>For fast GENERAL info about health products, vitamins, supplements etc AND reviewed by consumers who tried them GO TO AMAZON.COM</li>
            <li>Even after following directions in mixing a little and then adding more liquid, it still has some lumps.</li>
            <li>By June 2013 and since then his lungs are clear.</li>
            <li>On top of the bad taste, it is possible to get fresh Immunocal from Immunotec for more than a 20% or 30% discount, relative to this price.</li>
            <li>Immunocal contains Cysteine which helps your body to naturally produce the amino acid Glutathione.</li>
            <li>/CHEAPEST/MOST NATURAL WAY TO GET GLUTATHIONE IN YOUR SYSTEM!&lt;br</li>
            <li>You Tube videos of cures for Lukemia and cancer seem a bit far reaching,but hope is still there.</li>
            <li>, we will see the real results in her next doctor&#x27;s appointment.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my relative that is having dialysis everyday &amp; this helps her get more energy.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would love to take it longer, will be purchasing more, but the cost makes it a little hard to purchase regularly.</li>
            <li>Not happy high, just super healthy,happy feelings!</li>
            <li>and I lost 3 ponds the first two weeks with very little effort.</li>

            <li> and I lost 3 ponds the first two weeks with very little effort.</li>
            <li> Delivery timely, product effectiveness cannot be determined this soon but have tried it in the past and was really helpful.</li>
            <li> The taste is not great but not bad either, it feels like a shake when you mix it with a juice.</li>
            <li> All went as expected; didn&#x27;t have to give it a second thought.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of gradually increasing her daily intake of Immunocal from 1 tsp to 1 pkg per day, she has reduced her oxycodone and other pain meds by two thirds and is feeling much less pain.  </li>
            <li> some of the sites...and take the precursors...(we can&#x27;t take Whey powder because of lactose intolerance), but the other things we can.</li>
            <li> I started a diet with Immnocal as well as other Immunotec products (supplements, not the diet shakes)</li>
            <li> and i would rather purchase a purer brand than all the ones that have other added ingredients.</li>
            <li> It needs to be hand-mixed to avoid breaking down the whey product and is quite foamy to drink.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey for me.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to go to all the trouble of buying the precursors&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has also strengthened the skin around my nails that were previously peeling pretty bad.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, I didn&#x27;t get sick from it, and it was a learning experience, buy from the source when buying Immunocal.</li>
            <li> However, after getting some fresh Immunocal from Immunotec which did not taste bad, I realize that this guy is stocking slightly old or badly kept Immunocal.</li>
            <li> I thought the terrible taste from this vendor&#x27;s Immunocal was due to Immunocal being a powerful medical-grade whey product.</li>
            <li> At least of this writing, taking a packet is like taking a mellow pill.  </li>
            <li> we are creating ourselves all the time, then it is never too late to begin creating the bodies we want instead of the ones we mistakenly assume we are stuck</li>
            <li> He had been diagnosed with respiratory failure in January 2013 and was on O2 for the rest of his life as per the Pulmonologist.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it was a bit less expensive.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit expensive, but I got at a discount as I sign up as a consultant</li>
            <li> All in all, this was not a good deal.</li>
            <li> we weren&#x27;t looking for a miracle cure, but unfortunately we have seen no change.</li>
            <li> Heals villi in gastro tract so nutrients go where they should instead of leaking to wrong places and causing damage...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s too finicky for my ultra-fast lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> This product very expensive</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this for my relative that is having dialysis everyday &amp; this helps her get more energy. I think the price is great compared to others!</li>
            <li> Happy with fast delivery and quality of product that I am taking to improve my health, immunity and longevity! This is a new product for me to experience.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for several years and don&#x27;t go without it!  It has helped us conquer colds, flu, shingles, ehrlichiosis and sundry others.  So simple and no side effects.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased immunocal on the recommendation of a friend while I go through some health challenges.  Another product with lots of additives made me bounce off walls. At least of this writing, taking a packet is like taking a mellow pill.  Will continue it as a part of my health program.  Just wish it was a bit less expensive.</li>
            <li> My husband used immunocal from March 2013. He started 3 regular and 3 plantinum for his sarcoidosis. He had been diagnosed with respiratory failure in January 2013 and was on O2 for the rest of his life as per the Pulmonologist.  We really didn&#x27;t know about it or ever heard of it.  By June 2013 and since then his lungs are clear. And the sarcoid nodules on his face and arms along with the back are now as of today gone.  It is a little pricey for me.  But I honestly can&#x27;t deny the benefits. I really have to say unless I get the Exact same thing from somewhere else.  I will take the immunocal for my husband&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> I have been on Immunocal for two weeks now, since I have strated taking it, my energy has great increased. I am currently going through chemo treatments, and it has reversed some of the side effects such as hair loss. I wish I took it before I started the chemo so I could keep my hair. It has also strengthened the skin around my nails that were previously peeling pretty bad. Immunocal contains Cysteine which helps your body to naturally produce the amino acid Glutathione. GSH (Glutathione) helps to oxygenate every cell in your body and it also recycles the oxygen you do have. I cannot get through my day without it. I have since become a distributor and love telling people about it! [...]</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT FOR THE BODY IT HELPED ME WITH ALLOT OF MY HEALTH ISSUES ALITTLE PRICY BUT WELL WORTH IT I WOULD DEFENTLY RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT IF YOU COULD AFFORD IT.</li>
            <li> Immunocal food supplement.  Delivery timely, product effectiveness cannot be determined this soon but have tried it in the past and was really helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the oldest spinning (studio cycling) instructor in the country, and I consider Immunocal to be an integral part of my fitness and health regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m diabetic and this is the best now my blood sugar is at 106-145 and I been on it for three weeks now</li>
            <li> This item was purchased for a child with severe autism,and we did not get the results we were hoping for, which was better communication, eye contact, improved mood... we weren&#x27;t looking for a miracle cure, but unfortunately we have seen no change. We used the product for two straight months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about Immuncal and Immunocal Whey Protein Isolate Powder Supplement and researched it a lot. I also checked for the ingredients in both Immuncal and Immunocal Whey Protein Isolate Powder Supplement but mostly have done research on Glutathione.&lt;br /&gt; The ingredients in Immunocal and Immunocal Whey Protein Isolate Powder Supplement are all precursors to the super antioxidant Glutathione!&lt;br /&gt;Google DR.Oz Glutathione&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt; ***If you don&#x27;t want to go to all the trouble of buying the precursors&lt;br /&gt; and you do have to get the right ones...&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Immunocal IS an all-natural non-prescription health product available worldwide and is medically recognized in the Physicians&#x27; Desk Reference.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BUT...This product very expensive and it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper to get the precusors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Mark Hyman, MD&lt;br /&gt;Glutathione: The Mother of All Antioxidants&lt;br /&gt;Great information on Glutathione&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;***Production of Glutathione (GSH) in a cell depends on the availability of glutathione precursors -three amino acids Glutathione is made of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These glutathione precursors are glutamate, glycine and cysteine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST/CHEAPEST/MOST NATURAL WAY TO GET GLUTATHIONE IN YOUR SYSTEM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOGLE....GLUTATHIONE PRECURSORS CYSTEINE WHEY POWDER&lt;br /&gt;Read some of the sites...and take the precursors...(we can&#x27;t take Whey powder because of lactose intolerance), but the other things we can. By the way make sure it&#x27;s UNDENATURED WHEY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m checking out Glutathione now and I&#x27;m going to try to build it up in my body by taking the precursors to help body make Glutathione. They&#x27;re all safe to take, I&#x27;ve done the research. Remember, the ingredients in Immunocal and Immunocal Whey Protein Isolate Powder Supplement are all precursors of Glutathione.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried looking into first about products that have Lipsomes surrounding Glutathione....survives gut &amp; transfers easily to blood instead of going through liver. But Google Glutathione &amp; check Dr. Oz where it talks about the best anti-oxidant being Glutathione he talks about intravenous Glutathione ....check things out and DON&#x27;T believe it til you&#x27;ve checked it out on the Internet....check the studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re in our 60&#x27;s...I have IBS, lastose intolerance and taken anti depressants for years...Paxil...and my husband has severe Radiation Enteritis (diarrhea) from Cancer therapy. Researched for months til found what worked! For leaky gut, Crohn&#x27;s, Celiac disease (go on gluten free diet, but this really helps) By the way SUGAR wrecks villi too, always check labels for endings in \\&quot;OSE\\&quot; as in fructose, lactose, glucose etc)....take GLUTAMINE also called L-Glutamine..Both been taking it for 2 months. Amazing!!! Tasteless,and look it up NO SIDE EFFECTS and can be taken with any meds...not like some things that you can&#x27;t take with Warfarin, Coumadin etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 - 6 days 1/8 tsp Glutamine in room temp water&lt;br /&gt;Take 3 to 4 times a day...1/2 hour before meal or 1 hour after meals.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll notice huge difference by end of 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheapest places for Glutamine are at bodybuilding supplement stores (they use it for torn muscles etc.) TRY Walmarts....AllMax Glutamine...100 gm...$11.99 is a cheap good try out and its actually the best type, it&#x27;s micronized and MUCH easier to dissolve in water. Heals villi in gastro tract so nutrients go where they should instead of leaking to wrong places and causing damage...used for years in Europe and U.K by docs and specialists first thing when you go into hospital as it helps body to heal severe burns, injuries, etc. His and my health and stomach/gastro tract,are SO much better. We&#x27;ve also been taking for last 5 years, probiotics (refrigerated kindfrom health store 12 - 24 Billion extra strength)for gastrointestinal health...but glutamine took our stomach/gastro health to a MUCH better level. BUT THERE&#x27;S MORE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;80% of serotonin is made in gastro tract and only 20% in brain!!! Look it up on internet...so because my gut is so much better and making serotonin...the two of us feel happy! Not happy high, just super healthy,happy feelings! Like our bodies are working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For fast GENERAL info about health products, vitamins, supplements etc AND reviewed by consumers who tried them GO TO AMAZON.COM... Type in the supplement then check the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. WHAT also HAS HELPED OUR HEALTH A LOT FOR THE YEAR IS STAYING AWAY FROM FAST FOOD,PASTRIES (PIES,CAKES,COOKIES,DONUTS)WHITE SUGAR AND ANYTHING FRIED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I promise you nothing is as chaotic as it seems. Nothing is worth your health. Nothing is worth poisoning yourself into stress, anxiety, and fear. Think GOOD thoughts.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;If we are creating ourselves all the time, then it is never too late to begin creating the bodies we want instead of the ones we mistakenly assume we are stuck with.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;― Deepak Chopra</li>
            <li> All went as expected; didn&#x27;t have to give it a second thought. Will continue to use this site. Very nice, thanks.</li>
            <li> Product is overpriced.Companies You Tube videos of cures for Lukemia and cancer seem a bit far reaching,but hope is still there.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and product speaks for itself! It is excellent!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as i wanted a supplement to help with increasing my daily energy. It needs to be hand-mixed to avoid breaking down the whey product and is quite foamy to drink. I use light vanilla soy milk with which to mix it. It&#x27;s not the best-tasting thing i&#x27;ve ever tried but i have noticed a significant improvement in my energy level, particularly in the afternoon. I use one packet for breakfast but have not needed another in the afternoon. My low energy level, in my case, is directly related to menopause. I am otherwise quite healthy and active.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying using this project.  My package arrive on time, and I am looking forward to seeing all of the health improvements that this product will produce.</li>
            <li> This has helped my mother and husband with health issue they both face by boostin their immune systems.  will buy again.</li>
            <li> For all of the amazing benefits it touts, I was willing to try it, even for the price.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s too finicky for my ultra-fast lifestyle.  In order to blend this stuff &amp;#34;correctly&amp;#34; you have to purchase a special blender that will not &amp;#34;denature&amp;#34; the proteins in the mixture.  Well, I don&#x27;t have that blender... so I was left to shake it into my already blended protein shake.  Clumps remained and would not disappear.  Eventually I just started putting it in my cereal so as to leave it in the most natural state.  It&#x27;s too high maintenance for me.</li>
            <li> They did not agree with me.</li>
            <li> hopping it works, have some inprovement ,for what i need it for thank you. try it out see if it works for you</li>
            <li> I started a diet with Immnocal as well as other Immunotec products (supplements, not the diet shakes) and I lost 3 ponds the first two weeks with very little effort. While I am yet to see their full results, I can tell you that the product has help me suppress my hunger and hold me on my long days at work. My wife is using it as well, and she feels very well, we will see the real results in her next doctor&#x27;s appointment. The taste is not great but not bad either, it feels like a shake when you mix it with a juice. It is a little bit expensive, but I got at a discount as I sign up as a consultant, I get a discount with the auto-ship as well.</li>
            <li> Has anyone seen benefits using Immunical for Multiple Sclerosis? Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering Immunocal for my daughter who has fibromyalgia with severe chronic pain that has lasted decades.  After 2 weeks of gradually increasing her daily intake of Immunocal from 1 tsp to 1 pkg per day, she has reduced her oxycodone and other pain meds by two thirds and is feeling much less pain.  My understanding is that she doesn&#x27;t make enough glutathione on her own and the Immunical is giving her precursors that she needs to correct this deficiency.  She is delighted with this result, as am I.  Seeing this improvement is wonderful.  The shipment came quickly. My daughter discussed her great response with her pain doctor who is looking into Immunocal for his other fibromyalgia patients.</li>
            <li> Love the product, not so much the shipping time.</li>
            <li> I thought the terrible taste from this vendor&#x27;s Immunocal was due to Immunocal being a powerful medical-grade whey product. I ate the entire package over about 2 weeks and I did get some health benefit, hence not a 1 star review. However, after getting some fresh Immunocal from Immunotec which did not taste bad, I realize that this guy is stocking slightly old or badly kept Immunocal. On top of the bad taste, it is possible to get fresh Immunocal from Immunotec for more than a 20% or 30% discount, relative to this price. All in all, this was not a good deal. On the positive side, I didn&#x27;t get sick from it, and it was a learning experience, buy from the source when buying Immunocal.</li>
            <li> The item was as it was described, excellent product.  Also  arrived on time,.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product is REALLY good !!. My mom drinks it I asked her about &amp; then I started drinking it. I ad this with my shakes in the mornings. I noticed a significant boost of energy. Also, my hair and nails grow a lot quicker. I have tried so many products for my nails and hair have spend Soooo MUCH money who would of thought that this lil powder is a miracle worker.  Now I order Immunocal on Amazon for mom and me.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would love to take it longer, will be purchasing more, but the cost makes it a little hard to purchase regularly. It would also be wonderful if they could make it so it would dissolve easier. Even after following directions in mixing a little and then adding more liquid, it still has some lumps. I suppose this doesn&#x27;t inhibit the benefits of it. I also wish it could be purchased thru pharmacies or over-the-counter for convenience. Whey protein is important for our health and i would rather purchase a purer brand than all the ones that have other added ingredients.</li>
            <li> love it. i do this twice a year for one month and it keeps my immune system stronge for months.</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping my wife who has Atypical Parkinsonism.  She has taken it before and the results now seem to be better.</li>
