            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite perfume of his and good value for price.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling cologne...</li>

            <li>I also own Acqua Di Gio and I must say that this is not a clone.</li>

            <li>GOOD, SATISFIED WITH ORDER WAS VERY SPECIAL GIFT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest I love Acqua Di Gio and the comparison of this Perry Ellis scent to it</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Aqua Di Gio and now a good fan of Perry Ellis</li>
            <li>nice smell ladies love it</li>
            <li>Its the best I had it when I was young</li>
            <li>Smells amazing :) my husband loves it.</li>
            <li>Amazing scents with cheap price, Recommended!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best perfume I have ever used after Givenchy.</li>
            <li>There probably isn&#x27;t anything more subjective than people&#x27;s perception of smell, but I will say that this musky, warm cologne got a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>The opening notes are great and catch your attention right away</li>
            <li>Warning: This cologne is strong!</li>
            <li>It is an original product, it arrived in good condition</li>
            <li>The shipping is incredibly fast , and it&#x27;s a good price for the bottle !</li>
            <li>I really like this product, very good, i love it.</li>
            <li>Good bang for the buck - good seller shipping was fast and on time.  </li>
            <li>A light, fresh scent thats ideal for about anytime of year, and any situation.</li>
            <li>First off I love most all and anything Perry Ellis, have had very good luck with most anything Perry Ellis brand.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It was very safe and secure.</li>
            <li>but it has a very cheap feel to it.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s your first foray into colognes this a great starter cologne as it is a safe scent that will please virtually everyone and a scent that works in any environment.</li>
            <li>I loved the quick delivery, I ordered it on Friday and received it on Tuesday.</li>
            <li>I liked this EDT a lot -- strong, lasts from morning to evening without a glitch.</li>
            <li>A distinctive and pleasant fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cologne and so does my fiancee.</li>
            <li>360 Red is the best fragrance i&#x27;ve ever bought and the scent lasts all day with just a couple of sprays.</li>
            <li>Many people think this is an Acqua di Gio clone.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>i heard it was like gio, so i would give it a try, and i was pleased..</li>
            <li>And cheap!</li>
            <li>This stuff is top notch.  </li>
            <li>I was scared because the top notes smell like some sort of orange cleaning product.  </li>
            <li>This was fir my son and his favorite.  </li>
            <li>Spray this on and bet your friends (make sure they&#x27;re untrained noses)</li>
            <li>love it and cheaper</li>
            <li>I would definitely order more colognes for my boyfriend again and for myself for an excellent price...</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents that I have added to my wish list</li>
            <li>Im still getting a lot of &amp;#34;Thank yous&amp;#34; :)</li>

            <li>As many have said, it does share a resemblance to Acqua di Gio.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells on me...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most sophisticated fragrance</li>
            <li>am giving it 4 starts, but it deserves more.</li>
            <li>anyway the price is kind of cheap</li>
            <li>but you can do better</li>
            <li>i love it...</li>

            <li>Will buy again, now my favorite fragrance</li>
            <li>and i was paying more</li>
            <li>If you like Acqua Di Gio then you will love this.</li>

            <li>Its also cheaper than the other ones so its a win win.</li>
            <li>love this fragrance because it has its own unique smell...</li>
            <li>Nice and clean smell love it</li>
            <li>Nice, kinds sporty-like, a hint of spice, but clean smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is a delicious and refreshing blend of citrusy goodness with a little woodsy, musky, spiciness action, but intermingling in a beautiful way!</li>
            <li>but it dries down to the best cologne that i own.  </li>
            <li>It has a very clean smell and isnt over powering like some</li>
            <li>Nice sweet smell (for a man)</li>
            <li>this cologne is pretty good</li>
            <li>Bought as a present for my husband and HE smells amazing when wearing it!!</li>
            <li>The bottle is a tall cylinder shape which seems to be easy to knock over to many.</li>
            <li>Very good odor, will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li>story short, I love the product great smell and my wife purchased the ladies version in a top name department store for 40.</li>
            <li>Smell simliar to AG, has a great fresh crisp scent.</li>
            <li>Excellent, everything I expected</li>
            <li>Cheap alternative to Aqua D Gio, to me it is more spicy and lasts longer</li>
            <li>Amazon offers a great price too.  </li>
            <li>the best smelling best dry down summer cologne I have ever used and trust me</li>
            <li>I can easily see this being someones signature scent.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x60;s one of the best lotions Perry Ellis has come up with, it has been my favorite for a few years now</li>
            <li>You can easily distinguish the two scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and somehow didn&#x27;t bother my allergies.</li>
            <li>the smell is a strong...</li>
            <li>Doesnt smell as strong as it did when I sampled this in a locate Perfume store.</li>
            <li>, you can apply before work, hit the gym, and then the grocery store and it still has a pleasingly strong scent no matter what.</li>
            <li>Has an amazing clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>AWESOME SMELL OLD SCHOOL FOR MY OLDER HUSBAND</li>
            <li>I love ADG, so getting this cologne at such a great price was such a great value.</li>
            <li>I also got free shipping and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a super sexy smelling for a man.</li>
            <li>Arrived safely and quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>Nice clean, strong scent at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
            <li>service was very good, as I expected</li>
            <li>Went cheap and decided to try this out.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s calling me cheap now.</li>
            <li>Initially, I primarily get the citrus, sweetness from the cinnamon, and a bit of spice.</li>
            <li>Great big size bottle</li>
            <li>I used Amazon as the seller by the way, and it&#x27;s genuine for all I can tell.</li>
            <li>Big bottle smells great.  </li>
            <li>Great cologne, definitely will be my go to cologne going forward!</li>
            <li>Was nice to find it for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>he liked it as much as do.</li>
            <li>attentive to Cart</li>
            <li>Looking for a cheap Aqua di Gio...</li>
            <li>Cannot beat the 19.99 price with FREE shipping.  </li>
            <li>Was looking for something that was a light scent and not everyone wore</li>
            <li>This is one of the many scents I have purchased in the PE line with no disappointment.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps a bit much for the office, but a nice evening scent.</li>
            <li>first spray always smell like alcohol but after that it smells pretty good</li>
            <li>I will say this is a nice, fresh scent and is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 23 year old brother &amp; he loved it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something with a sweet scent and not too strong give this a try.</li>
            <li>However, it still has a very nice smell for the low cost.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery, very smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s super cool!</li>
            <li>Powerful, yet reserved!  </li>
            <li>First time i buy this cologne smells ok.</li>
            <li>I will say it is an improvement (significant) over Acqua.</li>
            <li>Prime membership is absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts long.  </li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>It also do not have crisp scent as the original authentic version.</li>
            <li>First time purchasing this EDT, love the scent.</li>
            <li>EL PERFUME NO ES ORIGINAL ES UNA LASTIMA POR QUE LA PERSONA LA QUE SE</li>
            <li>DIO CUENTA QUE NO ERA ORIGINAL FUE A LA QUE LE VEND&amp;Iacute; EL PRODUCTO ..</li>
            <li>THE ORIGINAL WAS A PRODUCT THAT I SOLD ..</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of Giorgi Armani Acqua Di Gio.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great cologne that lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>The professor replied that he was impressed that someone so young had such discerning tastes...</li>
            <li>I have many colognes and by far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Clean and fruity</li>
            <li>This smell is clean and reminds me of when I use to sit in the sports cars at the Car auction show .</li>
            <li>Nice smell.. does not last more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>It has a clean feeling smell.</li>
            <li>Came full in original box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool and spicy and clean.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fresh clean light scent not overpowering</li>
            <li>This product was what i expected, it smelled great</li>
            <li>- I dont know why they would put this good stuff in such an unstable device.  </li>
            <li>, i compared them and it is true, but way cheaper in price, i always get compliments with this on</li>
            <li>It seams that a professor of his had commented on how good he smelled and my grandson said it was Perry Ellis 360 Red.  </li>
            <li>good product is for personal use and always buy</li>
            <li>My wife love this scent so much.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and it&#x27;s definitely authentic.</li>
            <li>Too sweet, gives me a headache.  </li>
            <li>This smells so sweet</li>
            <li>To me smells similar to aqua digio with the good hint of cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Brings back lots of good memories created when Gio was a thing.</li>
            <li>The product is real and authentic as I compared with a bottle purchased from Macys.  </li>
            <li>cologne was a bit to musky for me however, I enjoy crisp, clean, almost fruity smelling colognes.</li>
            <li>It is not a strong, very light perfume, I hope that my purchase had been good and that the salesman is not a thief.</li>
            <li>Its a fresh, clean fragrance with a touch of cinnamon</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t able to return the cologne because they fear you wont ship it back ground and cause planes to crash I guess, but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go as far to say that I enjoy this scent a bit more compare to ADG nowadays because of the spicy cinnamon note it brings out that ADG doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fade away quick.</li>
            <li>Perry Ellis 360 Red is absolutely one of my most favorite scents!</li>
            <li>Ive got more tail than a new york taxi cab with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m searching for something new for him that I will beg him to WEAR :)</li>
            <li>My new favorite is Abercrombie&#x27;s Fierce, so</li>
            <li>It does smell alot like it, but with a cheap sweet undertone I really couldn&#x27;t get over...</li>
            <li>The cologne smells awesome no doubt but it wont last long.</li>
            <li>It does not emit very far, you have to lean in to be able to smell it.</li>
            <li>The aroma is excellent but the perfume fixative is weak.</li>
            <li>The shipment was received very quickly, and as I said on another occasion, I prefer to buy perfumes direct amazom as the seller, because the risk involved it is a cheap copy</li>
            <li>This is a clean and crisp scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower you or those around you.</li>
            <li>I have many fragrances, now this well it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li>now i can&#x27;t enjoy it as much as everyone around me XD</li>
            <li>I will probably be Waring it every day to work for quite a while as I enjoy the sent so much.  </li>
            <li>Great smelling cologne, all the reviewers were dead on when comparing it to Aqua Di Gio.  </li>
            <li>like worth it</li>
            <li>It has that relaxing fresh smell that aqua di gio has</li>
            <li>:  After using this for a couple months - still love the fragrance, but am noticing that it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours and it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;project\\&quot; quite as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>Bigger bottle would be nice.</li>
            <li>kind of an Aqua smell and is not lasting.</li>
            <li>I own several bottles of this, as well as Gio.</li>
            <li>its also a fresh smell...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn many different colognes including Acqua di Gio, Kenneth Cole Reaction, DKNY red delicious, Chrome, Polo Blue,  and other top colognes but this one always gets the most compliments.</li>
            <li>Bottle is exceptional size for the money, you will definitely pay more at your local mall or store.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to buy a high quality bottle of cologne at a good price.</li>
            <li>But hell some care, right?</li>
            <li>I then pulled up Amazon on my smartphone right there in the store.  </li>
            <li>(and that&#x27;s what matters, right?)</li>
            <li>But the spray tip on the bottle doesn,t work right.</li>
            <li>It definitely smells more &amp;#34;Alcoholish&amp;#34; than the true Armani stuff.</li>
            <li>I have the entire line of Perry Ellis, but Red, the original Blue, and the Relaunch are the best smelling.</li>
            <li>I was fine with the purchase was fast congratulate all responsible</li>
            <li>Very smell of it is so nice that it last longs for a day.</li>
            <li>shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>I rated it 4 stars because unlike more popular brands like Polo and Nautica, it does not last long.</li>
            <li>Wife doesn&#x27;t seem to like it very much.</li>
            <li>It was plastic sealed new in original box.</li>
            <li>A perfume that smells quite interesting, but not recommend it to young people, as it is a classic scent of middle-aged gentlemen.</li>
            <li>But for whatever reason it just reminds me of some kind of axe body spray I had smelled back in high</li>
            <li>It is a great scent for summer, and last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Simply Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;IMHO, this product can sell for more than Acqua.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and i use it often ;)</li>
            <li>what I get from first smelling it</li>
            <li>I actually have both Acqua Di Gio and this Perry Ellis scent and love both.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this SEXY scent.</li>
            <li>Of course most people looking at this already know 360 Red is a clone of that scent.  </li>
            <li>I fore one keep the box because it looks nice and makes it harder to tip.</li>
            <li>but it wont last more than one hour maybe ....</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like ADG for reference.</li>
            <li>He used to wear this when we first started dating.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>AND I LIKE HOW IT SMELLS ON HIM ;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used polo blue, versace, Chanel bleu, acqua di gio, and this one to me smells much better.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>that had a lot of women turning their heads and asking me what exactly I was wearing.  </li>
            <li>First time I tried it and would buy again.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is ok but, does not seem to last</li>
            <li>It smells almost exactly like Aqua Di Gio to some people, but lasts all night.</li>
            <li>It seems like every cologne I&#x27;ve bought lately smells great</li>
            <li>This was the first time i tried Perry Ellis</li>
            <li>My colleagues at work have been asking me about it ever since i first wore it to work.</li>
            <li>It definitely is that and more.</li>
            <li>Not my go to date cologne(i prefer moodier more mysterious smelling colognes) but it can pull off a date night no problem.</li>
            <li>The scent seems to go away after a short time, but if you are hugging a girl, she will be able to smell it.</li>
            <li>My wife bought the first bottle because after she smelled it on a coworker and just had to get it for me.</li>
            <li>Its a nose pleaser ;)</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied for the price.</li>
            <li>Smells so good on a man it does not go unnoticed at all.</li>
            <li>It last long and has a nice clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It really has a very nice scent, not strong but very manly.</li>
            <li>It has pretty good lasting time, but those kinds of things can vary from person-to-person based on different factors.</li>
            <li>I own 2 other colognes ....</li>
            <li>So so not my favorite Ellis scent don&#x27;t like aquatic scents that much - just my personal taste</li>
            <li>it allot fast shipping will come back  to get more</li>
            <li>Everything is good, except it is too (due to lack of proper words) sweet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good casual smell, definitely stinging when you first put it on; but when it settles it&#x27;s a really (GOOD) smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>Very sweet smell that last quite a while.  </li>
            <li>Bought this fragrance without smelling it because of all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>First off, the shipping was amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>It lasted a long time and was my favorite.</li>
            <li>I like strong and lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>But it lasts long enough to make you smell good for 5 or 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Recently, I started to layer this EDT with something that is not so strong and found the mixing to be working very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This would be great for a teen or someone who wants a little scent but isn&#x27;t worried about premium cologne.</li>
            <li>I do wish it projected a little more, but I am overall quite satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The smell: I bought this because of the reviews i read on how this smelled the same as Aqua Di Gio, amazingly it smells almost the same.</li>
            <li>I worked over 30 hours straight (standing and running), and could still smell it after getting home.</li>
            <li>responsibly recommend</li>
            <li>PE 360 Red also projects better, and has greater longevity than the much more expensive Acqua Di Gio.  </li>
            <li>You would think that its not the real thing, but it really is...</li>
            <li>I recommend buying it and it comes really fast to depending on when you want it.</li>
            <li>but the smell isn&#x27;t what i really looked for.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I have not used it much .</li>
            <li>I really really like it.  </li>
            <li>very much&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again very happy...satisfied customer</li>
            <li>I feel as though when you are starting out and getting a cologne collection going it is important to not spend 70  to 80 dollars per bottle.</li>
            <li>Very recommended</li>
            <li>Intense ($65) and</li>
            <li>Yeah the smell doesn&#x27;t really stick.</li>
            <li>Max 1-2 hours and that too if someone stands really close to you.</li>
            <li>its fresh and obviously masculine....</li>
            <li>fresh and masculine.</li>
            <li>every one of them thank you so much..</li>
            <li>In this case, I didn&#x27;t pay much</li>
            <li>I received my shipment in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Nice to wear everyday.</li>
            <li>Great cologne if you&#x27;re in your late teens early 20s.</li>
            <li>After a while, it dulls down to this beautiful, spicy smell.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>yes i said almost because there is a small distinction between them, such as the Perry Ellis most certainly does have a greater cinnamon smell to it.</li>
            <li>its strong and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li>If you already know/ like what it smells like the one good thing about it is that it is long lasting, I was still able to smell it after a few hours and a shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll take into account for future purchases as they are accessible prices.</li>
            <li>They wanted it for a gift for their male significant others.  </li>
            <li>Perry Ellis starts off with a loud, deep, clean, &amp; crisp smell.&lt;br /&gt;Strength (80%-0%).</li>
            <li>smells fine but doesn&#x27;t last that long, but for the price not bad</li>
            <li>Last a long time, very fresh clean smell to add to any collection when you feel like switching it up...  </li>
            <li>I love the black 360, this stuff doesn&#x27;t last as long but still has nice scent.</li>
            <li>The bottle came completely full which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>This lasts quite a while on my skin, and I would definitely recommend to any other young man looking for a good scent for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>or if you want to surprise your girl with a new scent, get this cologne!</li>
            <li>Perry Ellis Black is better.</li>
            <li>Vintage classic</li>
            <li>But this particular fragrance was a bit too musky and almost woody for my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had to ask why this particular scent?  </li>
            <li>The delivery was fairly quick and arrived 4 days earlier than the delivery date.</li>
            <li>This is now my Scent, no one else seems to have the exact same and it is much cheaper than most other cologne.  </li>
            <li>If you really want to purchase it, might as well buy a 3.4 mL of water and spray it on yourself cause it pretty much the same scent after thirty minutes.</li>
            <li>Smells like Aqua Di Gio but a lot cheaper and not as played out, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommended for those who like citrus scents.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Cologne.</li>
            <li>High quality too</li>
            <li>And it also brought some cologne samples, thank you to FragranceNet for that little gift :) .</li>
            <li>Needless to say he was overly happy when he opened the gift.  </li>
            <li>I like to keep my smell fresh but wearing a variety of colognes (not at the same time, obviosly...)</li>
            <li>I even had a girl at the bar who supposedly worked selling cologne that was very impressed with the scent, however she was adamant that it was Polo Red, not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad, but it must be working.</li>
            <li>It came brand new</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into trying something new and you&#x27;re a fan of Acqua di Gio, give this a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only negative thing is that i&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the scent, its good</li>
            <li>It smells good when you first spray it on but the smell  does not last long at all no more than 1/2hour .</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>when u first get this cologne u will be surprise how big is it</li>
            <li>This was exactly the same product as I was told I would be sold.</li>
            <li>Has decent longevity and projection with an ok smell but too common of a scent to give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>but i suppose it smells nice enough, possibly mix it with something more expensive...</li>
            <li>It smells better than the dark blue bottle.</li>
            <li>I feel the projection of it isn&#x27;t super powerful, but that isn&#x27;t always a negative for some colognes.</li>
            <li>This cologne intends to last longer on pure cotton clothing.</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing like no other I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>Ordered prime before a holiday and still got it in time, so no trouble at all with shipping &amp; delivery.</li>
            <li>I have a 17 year old grandson.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to smells and prefer not to wear fragrances at all</li>
            <li>i used to get this product at the perry ellis store near by my house</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast and its the same fragrance that they sell u at the store.</li>
            <li>and it is the real deal so double bonus.</li>
            <li>the contents of the perfume, not only emits evaporated and Alcohol, is very bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>much longer lasting!  </li>
            <li>4 hours from when I apply the scent, it&#x27;s completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s masculine but inviting.</li>
            <li>I think this is better than aqua de gio and at a ridiculously lower cost.</li>
            <li>I tried to believe and trust the reviews, maybe this seller was just a rip off?, but the good reviews are full of crap.</li>
            <li>- I save it for special occasions as I use up my other fragrances for daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Many seem to hate the shape of the bottle its in and it really doesn&#x27;t feel important in the review.</li>
            <li>what I mean by obviously masculine is that its not unisex because a female would not be able to wear it without  someone thinking that it rubbed off from a man...</li>
            <li>like fresh watermelon on my skin i been looking for this smell for a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Last pretty long in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This one has a fresh scent all day long and stays long.</li>
            <li>It can be easy to knock over but only if you keep it next to a mess.</li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t exactly smell like every other guy in the room.</li>
            <li>I put on upstairs in bedroom after I dress and have to use 10 to 15 sprays to notice.. too bad as it smells great but by the time I get downstairs</li>
            <li>I like the smell for the room for when I do my workouts, though I&#x27;ve gotten no compliments so far in public on the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is the second time we bought this for our 19 year old son.</li>
            <li>, I received it the date was expected and very well packed.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it does smell quite similar.  </li>
            <li>360 Red is by far</li>
            <li>worth the price, and I wear it to work, no genuine compliments from it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheaper, better version of Aqua Di Gio but still not a great scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I blind bought this based on the reviews</li>
            <li>It has the same fresh scent with less acidic undertone.</li>
            <li>when i first brought this 19.50+ shipping less then 23 dollors all together...</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t better or worse in any way, but the scents are extremely similar.</li>
            <li>However, Perry Ellis 360 Red has a slightly stronger cinnamon scent (which I like very much).  </li>
            <li>Not only is the fragrance barely detectable to me but to others as well.</li>
            <li>But the projection on this does not seem to go to far as well as last to long.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest I love Acqua Di Gio and the comparison of this Perry Ellis scent to it</li>

            <li> nice smell ladies love it</li>

            <li> Amazing scents with cheap price, Recommended!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best perfume I have ever used after Givenchy.</li>
            <li> There probably isn&#x27;t anything more subjective than people&#x27;s perception of smell, but I will say that this musky, warm cologne got a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> The opening notes are great and catch your attention right away</li>
            <li> Warning: This cologne is strong!</li>
            <li> It is an original product, it arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> The shipping is incredibly fast , and it&#x27;s a good price for the bottle !</li>
            <li> I really like this product, very good, i love it.</li>
            <li> Good bang for the buck - good seller shipping was fast and on time.  </li>
            <li> A light, fresh scent thats ideal for about anytime of year, and any situation.</li>
            <li> First off I love most all and anything Perry Ellis, have had very good luck with most anything Perry Ellis brand.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It was very safe and secure.</li>
            <li> but it has a very cheap feel to it.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s your first foray into colognes this a great starter cologne as it is a safe scent that will please virtually everyone and a scent that works in any environment.</li>
            <li> I loved the quick delivery, I ordered it on Friday and received it on Tuesday.</li>
            <li> I liked this EDT a lot -- strong, lasts from morning to evening without a glitch.</li>
            <li> A distinctive and pleasant fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne and so does my fiancee.</li>
            <li> 360 Red is the best fragrance i&#x27;ve ever bought and the scent lasts all day with just a couple of sprays.</li>
            <li> Many people think this is an Acqua di Gio clone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell of this.  </li>
            <li> i heard it was like gio, so i would give it a try, and i was pleased..</li>
            <li> And cheap!</li>
            <li> This stuff is top notch.  </li>
            <li> I was scared because the top notes smell like some sort of orange cleaning product.  </li>
            <li> This was fir my son and his favorite.  </li>
            <li> Spray this on and bet your friends (make sure they&#x27;re untrained noses)</li>
            <li> love it and cheaper</li>
            <li> I would definitely order more colognes for my boyfriend again and for myself for an excellent price...</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents that I have added to my wish list</li>

            <li> As many have said, it does share a resemblance to Acqua di Gio.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells on me...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most sophisticated fragrance</li>
            <li> am giving it 4 starts, but it deserves more.</li>
            <li> anyway the price is kind of cheap</li>
            <li> but you can do better</li>
            <li> i love it...</li>

            <li> and i was paying more</li>
            <li> If you like Acqua Di Gio then you will love this.</li>
            <li> Its a better version of it plus its cheaper.</li>

            <li> Nice, kinds sporty-like, a hint of spice, but clean smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is a delicious and refreshing blend of citrusy goodness with a little woodsy, musky, spiciness action, but intermingling in a beautiful way!</li>
            <li> but it dries down to the best cologne that i own.  </li>
            <li> It has a very clean smell and isnt over powering like some</li>
            <li> Nice sweet smell (for a man)</li>

            <li> The bottle is a tall cylinder shape which seems to be easy to knock over to many.</li>
            <li> Very good odor, will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> story short, I love the product great smell and my wife purchased the ladies version in a top name department store for 40.</li>

            <li> Excellent, everything I expected</li>

            <li> I can easily see this being someones signature scent.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x60;s one of the best lotions Perry Ellis has come up with, it has been my favorite for a few years now</li>
            <li> You can easily distinguish the two scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong and somehow didn&#x27;t bother my allergies.</li>
            <li> the smell is a strong...</li>
            <li> Doesnt smell as strong as it did when I sampled this in a locate Perfume store.</li>
            <li> , you can apply before work, hit the gym, and then the grocery store and it still has a pleasingly strong scent no matter what.</li>
            <li> Has an amazing clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> AWESOME SMELL OLD SCHOOL FOR MY OLDER HUSBAND</li>

            <li> attentive to Cart</li>
            <li> Looking for a cheap Aqua di Gio...</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the 19.99 price with FREE shipping.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for something that was a light scent and not everyone wore</li>
            <li> This is one of the many scents I have purchased in the PE line with no disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps a bit much for the office, but a nice evening scent.</li>
            <li> first spray always smell like alcohol but after that it smells pretty good</li>
            <li> I will say this is a nice, fresh scent and is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 23 year old brother &amp; he loved it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something with a sweet scent and not too strong give this a try.</li>
            <li> However, it still has a very nice smell for the low cost.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, very smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s super cool!</li>
            <li> Powerful, yet reserved!  </li>
            <li> First time i buy this cologne smells ok.</li>
            <li> I will say it is an improvement (significant) over Acqua.</li>
            <li> Prime membership is absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li> It smells great and lasts long.  </li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It also do not have crisp scent as the original authentic version.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing this EDT, love the scent.</li>
            <li> EL PERFUME NO ES ORIGINAL ES UNA LASTIMA POR QUE LA PERSONA LA QUE SE</li>
            <li> DIO CUENTA QUE NO ERA ORIGINAL FUE A LA QUE LE VEND&amp;Iacute; EL PRODUCTO ..</li>
            <li> THE ORIGINAL WAS A PRODUCT THAT I SOLD ..</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of Giorgi Armani Acqua Di Gio.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great cologne that lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> The professor replied that he was impressed that someone so young had such discerning tastes...</li>
            <li> I have many colognes and by far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Clean and fruity</li>
            <li> This smell is clean and reminds me of when I use to sit in the sports cars at the Car auction show .</li>
            <li> Nice smell.. does not last more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It has a clean feeling smell.</li>
            <li> Came full in original box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool and spicy and clean.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fresh clean light scent not overpowering</li>
            <li> This product was what i expected, it smelled great</li>
            <li> - I dont know why they would put this good stuff in such an unstable device.  </li>
            <li> , i compared them and it is true, but way cheaper in price, i always get compliments with this on</li>
            <li> It seams that a professor of his had commented on how good he smelled and my grandson said it was Perry Ellis 360 Red.  </li>
            <li> good product is for personal use and always buy</li>
            <li> My wife love this scent so much.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and it&#x27;s definitely authentic.</li>
            <li> Too sweet, gives me a headache.  </li>
            <li> This smells so sweet</li>
            <li> To me smells similar to aqua digio with the good hint of cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Brings back lots of good memories created when Gio was a thing.</li>
            <li> The product is real and authentic as I compared with a bottle purchased from Macys.  </li>
            <li> cologne was a bit to musky for me however, I enjoy crisp, clean, almost fruity smelling colognes.</li>
            <li> It is not a strong, very light perfume, I hope that my purchase had been good and that the salesman is not a thief.</li>
            <li> Its a fresh, clean fragrance with a touch of cinnamon</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t able to return the cologne because they fear you wont ship it back ground and cause planes to crash I guess, but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go as far to say that I enjoy this scent a bit more compare to ADG nowadays because of the spicy cinnamon note it brings out that ADG doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fade away quick.</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis 360 Red is absolutely one of my most favorite scents!</li>
            <li> Ive got more tail than a new york taxi cab with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m searching for something new for him that I will beg him to WEAR :)</li>
            <li> My new favorite is Abercrombie&#x27;s Fierce, so</li>
            <li> It does smell alot like it, but with a cheap sweet undertone I really couldn&#x27;t get over...</li>
            <li> The cologne smells awesome no doubt but it wont last long.</li>
            <li> It does not emit very far, you have to lean in to be able to smell it.</li>
            <li> The aroma is excellent but the perfume fixative is weak.</li>
            <li> The shipment was received very quickly, and as I said on another occasion, I prefer to buy perfumes direct amazom as the seller, because the risk involved it is a cheap copy</li>
            <li> This is a clean and crisp scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower you or those around you.</li>
            <li> I have many fragrances, now this well it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li> now i can&#x27;t enjoy it as much as everyone around me XD</li>
            <li> I will probably be Waring it every day to work for quite a while as I enjoy the sent so much.  </li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne, all the reviewers were dead on when comparing it to Aqua Di Gio.  </li>
            <li> like worth it</li>
            <li> It has that relaxing fresh smell that aqua di gio has</li>
            <li> :  After using this for a couple months - still love the fragrance, but am noticing that it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours and it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;project\\&quot; quite as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> Bigger bottle would be nice.</li>
            <li> kind of an Aqua smell and is not lasting.</li>
            <li> I own several bottles of this, as well as Gio.</li>
            <li> its also a fresh smell...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn many different colognes including Acqua di Gio, Kenneth Cole Reaction, DKNY red delicious, Chrome, Polo Blue,  and other top colognes but this one always gets the most compliments.</li>
            <li> Bottle is exceptional size for the money, you will definitely pay more at your local mall or store.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to buy a high quality bottle of cologne at a good price.</li>
            <li> But hell some care, right?</li>
            <li> I then pulled up Amazon on my smartphone right there in the store.  </li>
            <li> (and that&#x27;s what matters, right?)</li>
            <li> But the spray tip on the bottle doesn,t work right.</li>
            <li> It definitely smells more &amp;#34;Alcoholish&amp;#34; than the true Armani stuff.</li>
            <li> I have the entire line of Perry Ellis, but Red, the original Blue, and the Relaunch are the best smelling.</li>
            <li> I was fine with the purchase was fast congratulate all responsible</li>
            <li> Very smell of it is so nice that it last longs for a day.</li>
            <li> shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> I rated it 4 stars because unlike more popular brands like Polo and Nautica, it does not last long.</li>
            <li> Wife doesn&#x27;t seem to like it very much.</li>
            <li> It was plastic sealed new in original box.</li>
            <li> A perfume that smells quite interesting, but not recommend it to young people, as it is a classic scent of middle-aged gentlemen.</li>
            <li> But for whatever reason it just reminds me of some kind of axe body spray I had smelled back in high</li>
            <li> It is a great scent for summer, and last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Simply Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;IMHO, this product can sell for more than Acqua.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and i use it often ;)</li>
            <li> what I get from first smelling it</li>
            <li> I actually have both Acqua Di Gio and this Perry Ellis scent and love both.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this SEXY scent.</li>
            <li> Of course most people looking at this already know 360 Red is a clone of that scent.  </li>
            <li> I fore one keep the box because it looks nice and makes it harder to tip.</li>
            <li> but it wont last more than one hour maybe ....</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like ADG for reference.</li>
            <li> He used to wear this when we first started dating.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> AND I LIKE HOW IT SMELLS ON HIM ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used polo blue, versace, Chanel bleu, acqua di gio, and this one to me smells much better.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> that had a lot of women turning their heads and asking me what exactly I was wearing.  </li>
            <li> First time I tried it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is ok but, does not seem to last</li>
            <li> It smells almost exactly like Aqua Di Gio to some people, but lasts all night.</li>
            <li> It seems like every cologne I&#x27;ve bought lately smells great</li>
            <li> This was the first time i tried Perry Ellis</li>
            <li> My colleagues at work have been asking me about it ever since i first wore it to work.</li>
            <li> It definitely is that and more.</li>
            <li> Not my go to date cologne(i prefer moodier more mysterious smelling colognes) but it can pull off a date night no problem.</li>
            <li> The scent seems to go away after a short time, but if you are hugging a girl, she will be able to smell it.</li>
            <li> My wife bought the first bottle because after she smelled it on a coworker and just had to get it for me.</li>
            <li> Its a nose pleaser ;)</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m satisfied for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells so good on a man it does not go unnoticed at all.</li>
            <li> It last long and has a nice clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It really has a very nice scent, not strong but very manly.</li>
            <li> It has pretty good lasting time, but those kinds of things can vary from person-to-person based on different factors.</li>
            <li> I own 2 other colognes ....</li>
            <li> So so not my favorite Ellis scent don&#x27;t like aquatic scents that much - just my personal taste</li>
            <li> it allot fast shipping will come back  to get more</li>
            <li> Everything is good, except it is too (due to lack of proper words) sweet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good casual smell, definitely stinging when you first put it on; but when it settles it&#x27;s a really (GOOD) smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> Very sweet smell that last quite a while.  </li>
            <li> Bought this fragrance without smelling it because of all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> First off, the shipping was amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> It lasted a long time and was my favorite.</li>
            <li> I like strong and lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> But it lasts long enough to make you smell good for 5 or 6 hours.</li>
            <li> Recently, I started to layer this EDT with something that is not so strong and found the mixing to be working very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This would be great for a teen or someone who wants a little scent but isn&#x27;t worried about premium cologne.</li>
            <li> I do wish it projected a little more, but I am overall quite satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The smell: I bought this because of the reviews i read on how this smelled the same as Aqua Di Gio, amazingly it smells almost the same.</li>
            <li> I worked over 30 hours straight (standing and running), and could still smell it after getting home.</li>
            <li> responsibly recommend</li>
            <li> PE 360 Red also projects better, and has greater longevity than the much more expensive Acqua Di Gio.  </li>
            <li> You would think that its not the real thing, but it really is...</li>
            <li> I recommend buying it and it comes really fast to depending on when you want it.</li>
            <li> but the smell isn&#x27;t what i really looked for.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have not used it much .</li>
            <li> I really really like it.  </li>
            <li> very much&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again very happy...satisfied customer</li>
            <li> I feel as though when you are starting out and getting a cologne collection going it is important to not spend 70  to 80 dollars per bottle.</li>
            <li> Very recommended</li>
            <li> Intense ($65) and</li>
            <li> Yeah the smell doesn&#x27;t really stick.</li>
            <li> Max 1-2 hours and that too if someone stands really close to you.</li>
            <li> its fresh and obviously masculine....</li>
            <li> fresh and masculine.</li>
            <li> every one of them thank you so much..</li>
            <li> In this case, I didn&#x27;t pay much</li>
            <li> I received my shipment in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Nice to wear everyday.</li>
            <li> Great cologne if you&#x27;re in your late teens early 20s.</li>
            <li> After a while, it dulls down to this beautiful, spicy smell.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> yes i said almost because there is a small distinction between them, such as the Perry Ellis most certainly does have a greater cinnamon smell to it.</li>
            <li> its strong and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> If you already know/ like what it smells like the one good thing about it is that it is long lasting, I was still able to smell it after a few hours and a shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take into account for future purchases as they are accessible prices.</li>
            <li> They wanted it for a gift for their male significant others.  </li>
            <li> Perry Ellis starts off with a loud, deep, clean, &amp; crisp smell.&lt;br /&gt;Strength (80%-0%).</li>
            <li> smells fine but doesn&#x27;t last that long, but for the price not bad</li>
            <li> Last a long time, very fresh clean smell to add to any collection when you feel like switching it up...  </li>
            <li> I love the black 360, this stuff doesn&#x27;t last as long but still has nice scent.</li>
            <li> The bottle came completely full which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> This lasts quite a while on my skin, and I would definitely recommend to any other young man looking for a good scent for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> or if you want to surprise your girl with a new scent, get this cologne!</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis Black is better.</li>
            <li> Vintage classic</li>
            <li> But this particular fragrance was a bit too musky and almost woody for my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had to ask why this particular scent?  </li>
            <li> The delivery was fairly quick and arrived 4 days earlier than the delivery date.</li>
            <li> This is now my Scent, no one else seems to have the exact same and it is much cheaper than most other cologne.  </li>
            <li> If you really want to purchase it, might as well buy a 3.4 mL of water and spray it on yourself cause it pretty much the same scent after thirty minutes.</li>
            <li> Smells like Aqua Di Gio but a lot cheaper and not as played out, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommended for those who like citrus scents.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Cologne.</li>
            <li> High quality too</li>
            <li> And it also brought some cologne samples, thank you to FragranceNet for that little gift :) .</li>
            <li> Needless to say he was overly happy when he opened the gift.  </li>
            <li> I like to keep my smell fresh but wearing a variety of colognes (not at the same time, obviosly...)</li>
            <li> I even had a girl at the bar who supposedly worked selling cologne that was very impressed with the scent, however she was adamant that it was Polo Red, not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad, but it must be working.</li>
            <li> It came brand new</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into trying something new and you&#x27;re a fan of Acqua di Gio, give this a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negative thing is that i&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the scent, its good</li>
            <li> It smells good when you first spray it on but the smell  does not last long at all no more than 1/2hour .</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> when u first get this cologne u will be surprise how big is it</li>
            <li> This was exactly the same product as I was told I would be sold.</li>
            <li> Has decent longevity and projection with an ok smell but too common of a scent to give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> but i suppose it smells nice enough, possibly mix it with something more expensive...</li>
            <li> It smells better than the dark blue bottle.</li>
            <li> I feel the projection of it isn&#x27;t super powerful, but that isn&#x27;t always a negative for some colognes.</li>
            <li> This cologne intends to last longer on pure cotton clothing.</li>
            <li> The scent is refreshing like no other I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Ordered prime before a holiday and still got it in time, so no trouble at all with shipping &amp; delivery.</li>
            <li> I have a 17 year old grandson.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to smells and prefer not to wear fragrances at all</li>
            <li> i used to get this product at the perry ellis store near by my house</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast and its the same fragrance that they sell u at the store.</li>
            <li> and it is the real deal so double bonus.</li>
            <li> the contents of the perfume, not only emits evaporated and Alcohol, is very bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> much longer lasting!  </li>
            <li> 4 hours from when I apply the scent, it&#x27;s completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s masculine but inviting.</li>
            <li> I think this is better than aqua de gio and at a ridiculously lower cost.</li>
            <li> I tried to believe and trust the reviews, maybe this seller was just a rip off?, but the good reviews are full of crap.</li>
            <li> - I save it for special occasions as I use up my other fragrances for daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Many seem to hate the shape of the bottle its in and it really doesn&#x27;t feel important in the review.</li>
            <li> what I mean by obviously masculine is that its not unisex because a female would not be able to wear it without  someone thinking that it rubbed off from a man...</li>
            <li> like fresh watermelon on my skin i been looking for this smell for a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Last pretty long in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This one has a fresh scent all day long and stays long.</li>
            <li> It can be easy to knock over but only if you keep it next to a mess.</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t exactly smell like every other guy in the room.</li>
            <li> I put on upstairs in bedroom after I dress and have to use 10 to 15 sprays to notice.. too bad as it smells great but by the time I get downstairs</li>
            <li> I like the smell for the room for when I do my workouts, though I&#x27;ve gotten no compliments so far in public on the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the second time we bought this for our 19 year old son.</li>
            <li> , I received it the date was expected and very well packed.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it does smell quite similar.  </li>
            <li> 360 Red is by far</li>
            <li> worth the price, and I wear it to work, no genuine compliments from it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheaper, better version of Aqua Di Gio but still not a great scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I blind bought this based on the reviews</li>
            <li> It has the same fresh scent with less acidic undertone.</li>
            <li> when i first brought this 19.50+ shipping less then 23 dollors all together...</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t better or worse in any way, but the scents are extremely similar.</li>
            <li> However, Perry Ellis 360 Red has a slightly stronger cinnamon scent (which I like very much).  </li>
            <li> Not only is the fragrance barely detectable to me but to others as well.</li>
            <li> But the projection on this does not seem to go to far as well as last to long.</li>
            <li> Very fresh, not strong, everyday perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a casual wear, it wears off pretty fast probably like 3-4 hours after applied.</li>
            <li> On adequately hydrated skin, this cologne lasts AT LEAST 12 hours !</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Scent stays on me all day long and it is also name brand for a low price!</li>
            <li> My only issue is that people on here say it lasts very long</li>
            <li> I also have a Curve cologne that doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long on me either.</li>
            <li> This cologne is very long lasting</li>
            <li> i know cologne does not last as long on people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about Perry Ellis Red.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long duration.  </li>
            <li> I like this fragnance..does not stay on body for too long..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay long though</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t seem to smell it on me after very long?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Duration: I have rather dry skin for i</li>
            <li> This is hands down the strongest scent of my collection and it costs next to nothing.</li>
            <li> Polo Double Black ($60) &amp; Mont Blanc Legend</li>
            <li> Price was 1/3 less than local.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tough to think I got the real thing.</li>
            <li> At 23 bucks and some change hard to argue and reading reviews sounded like a clone of the more expensive Acqua Di Gio.</li>
            <li> Smells like expected</li>
            <li> is not what I expected</li>
            <li> Could smell it before box was opened and bottle was wet.</li>
            <li> Not much of a winter scent.</li>
            <li> total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Women (and even a few guys) have approached me on countless occasions and asked what cologne I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really overpowering or anything.</li>
            <li> IS A PITY THAT THIS PAGE (WWW.AMAZON.COM)</li>
            <li> Would return if I could steer clear of this don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> There was no off smell like some other reviews.</li>
            <li> , I need to know what happened to the other ....</li>
            <li> You guys should check other 1 star reviews cause lying do not benefit us.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, new to this cologne game</li>
            <li> You need very little of this, one little spray will last all day.</li>
            <li> I ws shocked by the price because it was soo cheap..</li>
            <li> The only negative would be the glass tower style bottle</li>
            <li> The scent is up to preference though, you may love it or hate it, it just depends on what you like.</li>
            <li> Did not think I would ever hate a fragrance made by a reputable company.</li>
            <li> well it&#x27;s half way there,, the other half is the  price!&lt;br /&gt;NICE</li>
            <li> Also if you buy Acqua Di Gio on amazon you&#x27;re much more likely to get a worthless fake than you are if you buy 360 red....</li>
            <li> If you like ADG, you might as well just get this for half the price.</li>
            <li> its now become a slightly used Christmas gift</li>
            <li> I was unable to locate the item in my home town or in the next larger town.  </li>
            <li> It also helped that it is half the cost of Gio.</li>
            <li> I order the less</li>
            <li> The women will be on the jock when you wear this..4 stars because the shipping took FOREVER; it took almost a week and a half for delivery..</li>
            <li> It  is  not  original.</li>
            <li> so I was a little bit iffy about it</li>
            <li> and the fragrance has not faded away at all, not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> ..think Gio(ADG) with a little punch.</li>
            <li> It was a little too girly for my taste.</li>
            <li> I thought that i had wasted twenty dollars</li>
            <li> I saw a few reviews on you tube and had to try some and let me tell you</li>
            <li> 1/4 was missing</li>
            <li> Need a few sprays to take shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been asked what I&#x27;m wearing a few times in like 2 months of having this cologne</li>
            <li> Very close to Aqua Di Gio at 1/4 the cost, can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!</li>
            <li> but as it drys down to the middle and base notes it grows so mature and musky.</li>
            <li> Given a star less coz its not very great like Hugo boss ....</li>
            <li> Really felt bad for not buying Burberry/ Hugo products.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Aqua de Gio.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how it is supposed to smell</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my grandson must have grown several inches and a lot of confidence because of that encounter.</li>
            <li> want to buy the small to have it in my gabeta in my office.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself because I had this in the past..</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with red.</li>
            <li> He loves the scent and not too expensive to order again in the future..</li>
            <li> and also was empty because the bottle was broken</li>
            <li> If I had bought it from a shady seller I would have thought that maybe its just the one I got.</li>
            <li> the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> This does smell almost identical to acqua di gio, but I gotta say for less than half the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> It lasts hardly for an hour</li>
            <li> Makes it hard to apply correctly.</li>
            <li> Rates higher than all the other Perry Ellis scents (some of which are terrible).</li>
            <li> Well, you&#x27;ll know at least you won&#x27;t be stinking.</li>
            <li> This cologne will swoon your woman, or get you attention at least.</li>
            <li> I bought this out of nostalgia for Aqua Di Gio from the late 90s.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed  with the overall smell of this Perry Ellis product .</li>
            <li> Seems to be fake or Perry Ellis is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Im a little skeptical when it comes to purchasing colognes online</li>
            <li> packing is not good, bottle is damaged .</li>
            <li> I have received a broken and spilled perfume.</li>
            <li> A poor mans ADG.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice at this fragrance game.</li>
            <li> do not recommend this to others as I wish to keep it my secret juice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne because of the reviews so it was a blind buy</li>
            <li> Bought this blind.</li>
            <li> and I Don&#x27;t think Ill be buying Aqua Di Gio anymore</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with its inexpensive price tag...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold ill</li>
            <li> Blind buy for my Dad.</li>
            <li> so figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> you couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought this blind based on reviews on basenotes and fragtanica.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wanted aqua di gio for Christmas which is ridiculously expensive</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but be skeptical about the quality of the product I got.</li>
            <li> After reading that it could be potentially a fake</li>
            <li> This is fake product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the looks of the bottle, and believe me, that is all that this stinker delivers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great blind buy as well.</li>
            <li> Another disappointment in the fragrance category.</li>
            <li> SO HE STINKS.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with \\&quot;RED\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This was not Perry Ellis 360, but some rip off fake or sick joke!</li>
            <li> so bad I almost got sick after I sprayed myself.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I got crap.</li>
            <li> Stinks do not buy this smells like pine sol!!</li>
            <li> The sprayer is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> excellent product I recommend</li>
            <li> My grandson loves this cologne</li>
            <li> excelente vendedor y producto llego en perfecto estado a venezuela</li>
            <li> real nice great price</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last long. Wife doesn&#x27;t seem to like it very much. I usually wear Aqua de Gio. I think it smells like it, but she doesn&#x27;t. Went cheap and decided to try this out. She&#x27;s calling me cheap now. It definitely smells more &amp;#34;Alcoholish&amp;#34; than the true Armani stuff. This would be great for a teen or someone who wants a little scent but isn&#x27;t worried about premium cologne.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne and so does my fiancee. I was very impressed with the size of the bottle and the price. I brought this for him for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Must be smelled to be believed ... WOW!  Powerful, yet reserved!  The best I&#x27;ve smelled ... ever!  You won&#x27;t go wrong with \\&quot;RED\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> If you like to smell delicious and stand out from the crowd, get this cologne. My only issue is that people on here say it lasts very long but I can&#x27;t seem to smell it on me after very long? I also have a Curve cologne that doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long on me either. Could this be because my body does not work well with cologne? Could someone try an help a fella out please?</li>
            <li> First time i buy this cologne smells ok. I am not sure how it is supposed to smell but it doesn&#x27;t smell like acqua di gio by Giorgio Armani which i was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;Will smell it side by side with one from several cologne stores and see how it compares.</li>
            <li> 360 Red is the best fragrance i&#x27;ve ever bought and the scent lasts all day with just a couple of sprays.</li>
            <li> Many people think this is an Acqua di Gio clone. I will say it is an improvement (significant) over Acqua. It has the same fresh scent with less acidic undertone. It is a great scent for summer, and last for a long time. I worked over 30 hours straight (standing and running), and could still smell it after getting home. Simply Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;IMHO, this product can sell for more than Acqua. Did I mention it is almost at 1/2 of Acqua&#x27;s price.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!! you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell of this.  This will be the second bottle for my husband.  I am 25 and my husband 27, but I think this is a great cologne for a man of any age.  He gets compliments on it all the time!!</li>
            <li> It  is  not  original. no  way.</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne at a decent price...</li>
            <li> when i first brought this 19.50+ shipping less then 23 dollors all together...&lt;br /&gt;the first spray always smell like alcohol but after that it smells pretty good&lt;br /&gt;smells like fresh watermelon on my skin i been looking for this smell for a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;but couldnt find it cause i didnt know what was the brand,&lt;br /&gt;also i heard it was gio. but i never brought it cause of that price tag,&lt;br /&gt;then i heard it was like gio, so i would give it a try, and i was pleased..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but when u first get this cologne u will be surprise how big is it .&lt;br /&gt;its like worth it lol. it can last u like 2 years i guess or it smells like it can&lt;br /&gt;if u use 2 sprays a day</li>
            <li> It is perfect. Only perry ellis. Thanks!</li>
            <li> responsibly recommend</li>
            <li> I have many fragrances, now this well it&#x27;s pretty decent. And cheap! I bought it because I thought it smelled like Aqua Di Gio, well it&#x27;s half way there,, the other half is the  price!&lt;br /&gt;NICE</li>
            <li> Nice clean, strong scent at a very reasonable price. Ordered prime before a holiday and still got it in time, so no trouble at all with shipping &amp; delivery. Prime membership is absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne just because the price and the reviews from different people, so bought without knowing it, and guess what? I loved it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is top notch.  This is always compared to Acqua Di Gio - and rightfully so.  They smell extremely similar.  However, Perry Ellis 360 Red has a slightly stronger cinnamon scent (which I like very much).  PE 360 Red also projects better, and has greater longevity than the much more expensive Acqua Di Gio.  The only negative would be the glass tower style bottle - I dont know why they would put this good stuff in such an unstable device.  If you like ADG, you might as well just get this for half the price.</li>
            <li> iv&#x27;e read that this cologne smells like acqua di gio, i compared them and it is true, but way cheaper in price, i always get compliments with this on and i use it often ;)</li>
            <li> Great scent. Combine with Paco and rabanna one million for an amazing scent.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. Seems to be fake or Perry Ellis is not worth it. Not even stands for 2 hours. Really felt bad for not buying Burberry/ Hugo products.</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance for use all day or for work, is smooth and very pleasant, although not recommended for use in evening activities.</li>
            <li> and I have the product in my hands. all in perfect condition .thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne because of the reviews so it was a blind buy what I get from first smelling it it&#x27;s a fresh clean light scent not overpowering it&#x27;s something that you could wear for daily use like going to the market or visiting friends a day at the beach I definitely wouldn&#x27;t wear it going out to a nigh tclub or on a date I am definitely going to use it for a body spray once I use It all up I&#x27;m just going to toss the bottle and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> Bought this fragrance without smelling it because of all of the positive reviews. I was scared because the top notes smell like some sort of orange cleaning product.  I thought that i had wasted twenty dollars but it dries down to the best cologne that i own.  Smells like Aqua Di Gio but a lot cheaper and not as played out, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about Perry Ellis Red. It&#x27;s very good!</li>
            <li> This was fir my son and his favorite.  Good buy for sure</li>
            <li> This is one of the best scents around.  Vintage classic</li>
            <li> Excellent product i recommend it</li>
            <li> I would not buy this. The sprayer is horrible. And the scent goes away after about 10 minutes. Definite skin scent, No projection. Well, you&#x27;ll know at least you won&#x27;t be stinking.</li>
            <li> First off I love most all and anything Perry Ellis, have had very good luck with most anything Perry Ellis brand.&lt;br /&gt;This cologne was a bit to musky for me however, I enjoy crisp, clean, almost fruity smelling colognes. But this particular fragrance was a bit too musky and almost woody for my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t able to return the cologne because they fear you wont ship it back ground and cause planes to crash I guess, but that&#x27;s ok its now become a slightly used Christmas gift...shhhhh!</li>
            <li> I get compliments in the office when I were this perfume. It is affordable and you get a lot for the price you pay. Very fresh, not strong, everyday perfume.</li>
            <li> Spray this on and bet your friends (make sure they&#x27;re untrained noses) 50 bucks that you&#x27;re wearing ADG. Buy another bottle or two of this with that money. This cologne will swoon your woman, or get you attention at least. Its a fresh, clean fragrance with a touch of cinnamon so you won&#x27;t exactly smell like every other guy in the room.</li>
            <li> Bought this blind. Thought it must smell great cause of all the good reviews. But it smells like alcohol and pine sol mixed.</li>
            <li> I have a 17 year old grandson. He had made a Christmas wish list with Perry Ellis 360 Red on it.  I was unable to locate the item in my home town or in the next larger town.  I ordered it on line.  Needless to say he was overly happy when he opened the gift.  I had to ask why this particular scent?  It seams that a professor of his had commented on how good he smelled and my grandson said it was Perry Ellis 360 Red.  The professor replied that he was impressed that someone so young had such discerning tastes... it was a sign of maturity.  Needless to say, my grandson must have grown several inches and a lot of confidence because of that encounter.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!!</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne. I have been using it for years. I have never bought a cologne through online though so I was a little bit iffy about it but all I have is good comments about this. It arrived before the estimated date(which is very good shipping). The bottle came completely full which is a big plus. I tried this on as soon as it arrived and it&#x27;s been like 2 hours since that and the fragrance has not faded away at all, not even a little bit. The way it was packed was definitely awesome. It was very safe and secure. And it also brought some cologne samples, thank you to FragranceNet for that little gift :) . So these are the five reasons why I gave this product five stars. I hope this review can help others buy this great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest I love Acqua Di Gio and the comparison of this Perry Ellis scent to it is what led me to purchase it.. Glad I did, this stuff smells amazing, has great projection, and comparison to ADG are accurate! I actually have both Acqua Di Gio and this Perry Ellis scent and love both. I&#x27;ll go as far to say that I enjoy this scent a bit more compare to ADG nowadays because of the spicy cinnamon note it brings out that ADG doesn&#x27;t. Plus at $20+ compared to $50+ you it is a must buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A perfume that smells quite interesting, but not recommend it to young people, as it is a classic scent of middle-aged gentlemen. The shipment was received very quickly, and as I said on another occasion, I prefer to buy perfumes direct amazom as the seller, because the risk involved it is a cheap copy is 1 in 1 million</li>
            <li> smells like aqua gi gio! love it and cheaper</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend and it smelled really good.. You would think that its not the real thing, but it really is... It came brand new and it wasnt a knock off cologne... I ws shocked by the price because it was soo cheap.. I would definitely order more colognes for my boyfriend again and for myself for an excellent price...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a perfume/cologne fan, but a guy friend of mine just had this on &amp; I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling him! It&#x27;s not too strong and somehow didn&#x27;t bother my allergies. I definitely recommend this SEXY scent. Hope he wears it next time... Yum.</li>
            <li> What a great deal!  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This will last me 4ever, one spray a day, it&#x27;s strong.&lt;br /&gt;Product as advertised and on time shipping.</li>
            <li> Has to be watered down...as odor disappears in minutes....I put on upstairs in bedroom after I dress and have to use 10 to 15 sprays to notice.. too bad as it smells great but by the time I get downstairs the smell is gone...can&#x27;t see how  Amazon can monitor where their wholesale distributors get their products.</li>
            <li> I loved the quick delivery, I ordered it on Friday and received it on Tuesday. This is one of my favorite scents that I have added to my wish list and I&#x27;m glad I have it again!</li>
            <li> Es un aroma muy delicioso y muy limpio no huele muy fuerte pero tan poco pasa desapercibido, me encanto mucho el olor ademas del precio, les comento que yo lo compro desde fuera del pais y aca en mi pais cuesta $58.00 asi que no se compara el precio, tambien lo compre porque el olor lei que es parecido al de Acqua di Gio</li>
            <li> So so not my favorite Ellis scent don&#x27;t like aquatic scents that much - just my personal taste</li>
            <li> I like the smell for the room for when I do my workouts, though I&#x27;ve gotten no compliments so far in public on the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend and it was a great one at that. Im still getting a lot of &amp;#34;Thank yous&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume. Very smell of it is so nice that it last longs for a day. Given a star less coz its not very great like Hugo boss ....but its good.my wifey likes it..</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this cologne!! Especially for the price!! Can&#x27;t get enough of my men when he has this smell on him!</li>
            <li> Great smell, nice package, and great price. If you are looking for something with a sweet scent and not too strong give this a try.</li>
            <li> I really liked it, I had never tried this fragrance. I liked&lt;br /&gt;I want to buy the small to have it in my gabeta in my office.</li>
            <li> Great price and the cologne smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne always gets compliments</li>
            <li> A great cologne for the price! It reminds me of Aqua Di Gio AND Allure Homme Sport by Chanel. If those two mixed. It has that relaxing fresh smell that aqua di gio has but then that kick of a smell that allure gives you. I can easily see this being someones signature scent. It won&#x27;t be mine but I will be using this quite often and I Don&#x27;t think Ill be buying Aqua Di Gio anymore not that I found this cheaper alternative. I have yet to wear it but I just got it in from ups and sprayed it on paper. I will post an update back when i put it on skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite, shipped on time. Love it</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for myself as I a perry ellis man.  It smells great and lasts long.  I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I have many colognes and by far this one is my favorite. This cologne is very long lasting and i get compliments everywhere i go.. This is the cologne i use whenever i go on a date..I love it and the ladies love it as well :)</li>
            <li> Great buy. As many have said, it does share a resemblance to Acqua di Gio. I love ADG, so getting this cologne at such a great price was such a great value. It has pretty good lasting time, but those kinds of things can vary from person-to-person based on different factors. It didn&#x27;t last 12 hours on me like some, but I could still smell it on me halfway through the day and all after applying it around 8am. I feel the projection of it isn&#x27;t super powerful, but that isn&#x27;t always a negative for some colognes. I do wish it projected a little more, but I am overall quite satisfied with this purchase. It&#x27;s a great scent and great buy at this price.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells on me...and so does my wife.</li>
            <li> I never bought a bottle of ADG and I don&#x27;t think I ever will.  Of course most people looking at this already know 360 Red is a clone of that scent.  I am sensitive to smells and prefer not to wear fragrances at all but on the occasions I do I go for this one.  It&#x27;s not the most sophisticated fragrance but if you want a easy to wear fresh crowd pleaser this is probably one of the best choices IMO.  I spray some on after a good workout at the gym and it combines with my sweat and testosterone to smell incredibly manly.</li>
            <li> I have never smelled Acqua di Gio, but I have read that this smells very similar.  I will say this is a nice, fresh scent and is definitely worth the money.  Very good fragrance for hotter days that won&#x27;t overwhelm.  Initially, I primarily get the citrus, sweetness from the cinnamon, and a bit of spice.</li>
            <li> Awesome cool spring and summer morning fragrance.</li>
            <li> The smell: I bought this because of the reviews i read on how this smelled the same as Aqua Di Gio, amazingly it smells almost the same. yes i said almost because there is a small distinction between them, such as the Perry Ellis most certainly does have a greater cinnamon smell to it. But i wouldn&#x27;t say that is the only difference in them. I am a huge fan of Aqua Di Gio and now a good fan of Perry Ellis and i can tell between that the smells that the Aqua Di Gio possess, has its own great sense to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duration: I have rather dry skin for i do shower alot, and i know cologne does not last as long on people with dry skin. But the projection on this does not seem to go to far as well as last to long. It does however, give you what you are looking for. I would recommend buying the [[ASIN:B0045KCCMU Perry Ellis 360 Red DEODORANT STICK 2.75 OZ]] to increase its projection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle: Many seem to hate the shape of the bottle its in and it really doesn&#x27;t feel important in the review. But hell some care, right? The bottle is a tall cylinder shape which seems to be easy to knock over to many. It can be easy to knock over but only if you keep it next to a mess. I fore one keep the box because it looks nice and makes it harder to tip.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells really good. I recommend buying it and it comes really fast to depending on when you want it.</li>
            <li> What was adverised was the \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; however what was delivered was the \\&quot;Toilette spray\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very misleading</li>
            <li> worth the price, and I wear it to work, no genuine compliments from it. but i suppose it smells nice enough, possibly mix it with something more expensive...</li>
            <li> I recommend the seller 100 % excellent products</li>
            <li> Good seller and product</li>
            <li> I like strong and lasting fragrance. I liked this EDT a lot -- strong, lasts from morning to evening without a glitch. Everything is good, except it is too (due to lack of proper words) sweet. Recently, I started to layer this EDT with something that is not so strong and found the mixing to be working very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it 4 starts, but it deserves more. If there was a way to give fractional stars, I would give it 4.50 stars.</li>
            <li> This is what you what trust me.</li>
            <li> good product is for personal use and always buy</li>
            <li> I like the smell, new to this cologne game but the smell isn&#x27;t what i really looked for. Although people say it smells great, it does but eh doesn;t seem to be my type. Still going to use cause its alright. Last pretty long in my opinion.</li>
            <li> it smells good ....... but it wont last more than one hour maybe .... anyway the price is kind of cheap but you can do better</li>
            <li> Love the smell, sad my nose got used to it now i can&#x27;t enjoy it as much as everyone around me XD</li>
            <li> 360 Red is a quality scent.  Should be great in the Summer.</li>
            <li> Whatever you do, do not order this from Amazon!! I have been wearing Perry Ellis 360 Red for years. It&#x27;s one of the best, but when I decided to order from Amazon they shipped me a bottle with no lid and the contents of the spray bottle smelled like chemicals - so bad I almost got sick after I sprayed myself. This was not Perry Ellis 360, but some rip off fake or sick joke! I have no idea what was in the bottle, but they must be buying this product from third world countries and selling it for a &#x27;buck&#x27; in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it so I would purchase it again along with suggesting it to friends. It has a very clean smell and isnt over powering like some</li>
            <li> I was out of town two weeks ago when I visited one of those retail cologne shops.  Guy tried to sell me the same product for 35 bucks.  This was after he said I&#x27;ll give you a good deal on it.  I then pulled up Amazon on my smartphone right there in the store.  I showed the guy where Amazon had it for 17-19 bucks.  He started to smirk and said thats knock-off cologne mine is legit. So you can see after you read this review, I bought the product online with Amazon and saved 20 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I love the product great smell and my wife purchased the ladies version in a top name department store for 40.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself because I had this in the past.. The price this low I couldn&#x27;t pass up..&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this cologne for the rest of my life!! I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> Smells so good! My husbands favorite colonge smells so good! Great big size bottle</li>
            <li> i love it...it really smells great. i am definitely gonna buy one for my wife.</li>
            <li> nice smell ladies love it they just cant seem to get enough of the awesome fragrance it brings them in and thet swoon</li>
            <li> A distinctive and pleasant fresh fragrance.  The bottle is also beautiful.  Will buy again, now my favorite fragrance - I save it for special occasions as I use up my other fragrances for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After using this for a couple months - still love the fragrance, but am noticing that it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours and it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;project\\&quot; quite as much as I would like. Still great, but reduced my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I have received a broken and spilled perfume. as you can help me solve this problem</li>
            <li> I think it&#x60;s one of the best lotions Perry Ellis has come up with, it has been my favorite for a few years now</li>
            <li> i used to get this product at the perry ellis store near by my house and i was paying more the shipping was fast and its the same fragrance that they sell u at the store. plus i always get complements on the smell</li>
            <li> Came earlier than posted. Smells like expected..think Gio(ADG) with a little punch.</li>
            <li> very good product and very nice service</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for delivery on this one. I been looking for this perfume and thanked GOD Amazon has it. This one has a fresh scent all day long and stays long. My wife love this scent so much.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT AND CHEAP FRAGANCE, USE IT AS MY EVERY DAY. CAN&#x27;T BEAT THIS PRICE!</li>
            <li> the product arrived perfect</li>
            <li> I had read that this smelled similar to Gio, so I bought it for my husband.  In my opinion, it does not smell like Gio, but the smell is still nice.  It also helped that it is half the cost of Gio.</li>
            <li> Great product. If you like Acqua Di Gio then you will love this. Its a better version of it plus its cheaper. Also if you buy Acqua Di Gio on amazon you&#x27;re much more likely to get a worthless fake than you are if you buy 360 red....&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing is that i&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the scent, its good but I&#x27;ve had better. The scent is up to preference though, you may love it or hate it, it just depends on what you like. It smells exactly like ADG for reference. I used Amazon as the seller by the way, and it&#x27;s genuine for all I can tell. I also got free shipping and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Big bottle smells great.  Ive got more tail than a new york taxi cab with this stuff. You cant go wrong with red. The bottle will last yoy forever.  Stay up player. ....</li>
            <li> It really has a very nice scent, not strong but very manly. Totally grateful for what I got ...Thank you indeed ... Greetings</li>
            <li> Best scent ever, aqua digio but with a cinnamon addition</li>
            <li> This cologne smell so  good I love when my husband put it on</li>
            <li> I have used Perry Ellis 360 red for about 2 years now.  It has a great smell.  I use it for many occasions!</li>
            <li> O bought this as an anniversary gift for my fianc&amp;eacute;. He used to wear this when we first started dating. It&#x27;s a great scent. It smells manly but also has a sweetness to it. I just love it. Shipping was fast and it&#x27;s definitely authentic. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells great just like Armani glo</li>
            <li> Its the best I had it when I was young can i do promotions for you all I&#x27;m a really good sales men</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from the department store and it smells wonderful. For some reason the bottle I got smells off and does not even last out the door in the morning.</li>
            <li> Guys, if you want girls to be all over you or if you want to surprise your girl with a new scent, get this cologne!</li>
            <li> Great as always. Thanks!</li>
            <li> MY MAN LOVES IT AND I LIKE HOW IT SMELLS ON HIM ;-)</li>
            <li> I love smelling my hubby with this. It&#x27;s my favorite perfume of his and good value for price. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The product it&#x27;s ok, and the aroma it&#x27;s long duration.  But when i got it, the bottle it was not selled.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling cologne...Very sweet smell that last quite a while.  It has been luck of the draw with amazon and if the colgnes are authentic.  This one is great</li>
            <li> Smells amazing :) my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Awesome packaging. I received this on time. Undamaged, unopened. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Nice, kinds sporty-like, a hint of spice, but clean smell. Nice to wear everyday.</li>
            <li> First off, the shipping was amazingly fast. As for the cologne, it&#x27;s probably the best cologne I have ever smelled or used. I&#x27;ve used polo blue, versace, Chanel bleu, acqua di gio, and this one to me smells much better. The opening notes are great and catch your attention right away but as it drys down to the middle and base notes it grows so mature and musky. It does draw a lot of comparison to acqua di gio scent wise but to me it is much much more better. Great cologne, definitely will be my go to cologne going forward!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed  with the overall smell of this Perry Ellis product . It smells good when you first spray it on but the smell  does not last long at all no more than 1/2hour . I have not used it much . Would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed this cologne. Was nice to find it for a reasonable price. Came full in original box.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Always come back to it.&lt;br /&gt;The ladies love it!!!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious.  I love it.  I bought for an ex he liked it as much as do.</li>
            <li> very good product, fast shipping, all good ..... very good product, I recommend the perfume is very good and is very good value for money ratio</li>
            <li> Awesome Cologne.... I really like it! I was looking for this  and I found it here...thank you very much, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Smells so good on my boyfriend</li>
            <li> SMELL GOOD, SATISFIED WITH ORDER WAS VERY SPECIAL GIFT I DID. EXCELLENT&lt;br /&gt;SMELL GOOD, SATISFIED WITH ORDER WAS VERY SPECIAL GIFT I DID. EXCELLENT</li>
            <li> I saw a few reviews on you tube and had to try some and let me tell you I am not disappointed.  I don&#x27;t want to over sell this cologne so I will just say its an enjoyable fragrance.  I really really like it.  I will probably be Waring it every day to work for quite a while as I enjoy the sent so much.  It doesn&#x27;t get lost in the crowed, it has its own identity.</li>
            <li> Has an amazing clean, fresh smell. It&#x27;s worth every penny and would make the ideal gift for the man in your life!</li>
            <li> since wearing this cologne, ive got lots of compliments. its strong and stays on for a long time. definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I beg him not to wear it.  Too sweet, gives me a headache.  I&#x27;m searching for something new for him that I will beg him to WEAR :)</li>
            <li> I was fine with the purchase was fast congratulate all responsible I&#x27;ll take into account for future purchases as they are accessible prices.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS BRAND FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li> This product was what i expected, it smelled great didn&#x27;t fade away quick. Also I have received many complements on it from females.</li>
            <li> it seems like the more I order the less the smell is a strong...</li>
            <li> love it great smell .</li>
            <li> I love this scent! After reading several reviews, i went and pulled the trigger. A lot of the reviews I read said that this smelled like aqua di gio, and it does. Great value for a great juice !value fo</li>
            <li> I also own Acqua Di Gio and I must say that this is not a clone. You can easily distinguish the two scents. However, it still has a very nice smell for the low cost. I recommend this product if you want to take a break from Armani and its price.</li>
            <li> service was very good, as I expected</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments when i use the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is an original product, it arrived in good condition and I bought it in a good price. the fragance is not the best for me but girls love it so lets wear it</li>
            <li> Smells great! Smells just like aqua but a lot cheaper! Wore it to work for the 1st time and got compliments. And it lasted alllll day! I can still smell it after 12 plus hours. Great quality. The women will be on the jock when you wear this..4 stars because the shipping took FOREVER; it took almost a week and a half for delivery.. I was starting to worry</li>
            <li> This cologne is my wife&#x27;s favorite so I ensure that my stock is never without this cologne.  Great scent and not over powering.</li>
            <li> This was exactly the same product as I was told I would be sold. There was no off smell like some other reviews. Its a deal and it is the real deal so double bonus. It was plastic sealed new in original box.</li>
            <li> Smells better than I could imagine</li>
            <li> the best perfume i ever had....ive got many girls askin me about the perfume...its a gr8 night time perfume...a must to have...</li>
            <li> Its smells darn good. go ahead buy for yourself or someone else. they will appreciate it 100%.</li>
            <li> I love it, and it smells good, I really love the scent...  that&#x27;s why I will buy another one for brother.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for Summer! It smells undoubtedly like Aqua Di Gio! Even better, IMO. Plus it lasts a lot longer and projects better than ADG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;If you like ADG, this one&#x27;s for you...if you don&#x27;t, then you won&#x27;t like it.&amp;#34; As simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Summer scent, both for the price and it&#x27;s performance (on my skin)! You just can&#x27;t go wrong with its inexpensive price tag...just hit the &#x27;Buy&#x27; button and thank me later!</li>
            <li> fast shipping and the scent is great for summer. Clean and fruity</li>
            <li> good afternoon friends, some days ago I made a purchase five perfumes and I just came back four, I need to know what happened to the other ....</li>
            <li> Love this product even more than I love Visit by Azzaro... This smells so sweet n sensual....would recommend it to all men....</li>
            <li> Every girl that smelled me said they loved it! I&#x27;m sold ill be ordering all of scents. Bigger bottle would be nice.</li>
            <li> Smells really good.  Good bang for the buck - good seller shipping was fast and on time.  My girlfriend begged for a sleeping shirt of mine covered in it.</li>
            <li> Nice sweet smell (for a man) that had a lot of women turning their heads and asking me what exactly I was wearing.  They wanted it for a gift for their male significant others.  First time I tried it and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Good musky smell but not what I was expecting</li>
            <li> the contents of the perfume, not only emits evaporated and Alcohol, is very bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product is only Alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tanks</li>
            <li> the smell doesn&#x27;t last not even for couple of hrs ,&lt;br /&gt; packing is not good, bottle is damaged . would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is ok but, does not seem to last</li>
            <li> is not what I expected</li>
            <li> I just bought this one. It is a super sexy smelling for a man.</li>
            <li> Best cologne I&#x27;ve got (besides Burberry).  It smells almost exactly like Aqua Di Gio to some people, but lasts all night.</li>
            <li> This cologne it&#x27;s been my favorite for years , I ca not believe I got it for 22 dollars that&#x27;s super cool!</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis 360 has a radiant smell. This smell is clean and reminds me of when I use to sit in the sports cars at the Car auction show .</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and sealer</li>
            <li> DO NOT over apply this beast of a scent! This is hands down the strongest scent of my collection and it costs next to nothing. If only DG the one had this projection and longevity.</li>
            <li> good price and i love it</li>
            <li> Very good smell. Blind buy for my Dad. To me smells similar to aqua digio with the good hint of cinnamon.</li>
            <li> A cinnamony ADG ( aqua de gio )! Very good longevity. A winner!</li>
            <li> Amazing scents with cheap price, Recommended!</li>
            <li> Great scent and a great look. Bought it as a gift to my dad for father&#x27;s day. Delivery was fast and packaging was great. Protected the cologne well</li>
            <li> Another disappointment in the fragrance category. It seems like every cologne I&#x27;ve bought lately smells great but the scent lasts anywhere from 1 to 10 minutes. I can smell Perry Ellis Red for about 2 minutes after application.  The scent is wonderful and fresh, a good summer cologne if it would last longer.</li>
            <li> Ordered all my husbands cologne from here, this one is my favorite, I could just keep smelling him!. For a picky person, this means a lot. Bottle is exceptional size for the money, you will definitely pay more at your local mall or store.</li>
            <li> this cologne is pretty good ima make sure before i finish this bottle ill get another one the smell is amazing</li>
            <li> excellent product as it appears on the page and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;more attentive to Cart</li>
            <li> smells fine but doesn&#x27;t last that long, but for the price not bad</li>
            <li> Stinks do not buy this smells like pine sol!! I wear Aqua Di Gio and ran out. I like Perry Ellis clothing so figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. Does not last even if you did like it, wife couldn&#x27;t even smell this an hour after put this on. Would return if I could steer clear of this don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Im a little skeptical when it comes to purchasing colognes online but this one did not disappoint and a great the price I paid you couldn&#x27;t go wrong. Smell simliar to AG, has a great fresh crisp scent.</li>
            <li> yes yes yes. favorite one by this brand. smell last all day</li>
            <li> This is by far the best perfume I have ever used after Givenchy. It smells like jasmine mixed with mandarin. I had a lot of compliments every time I wear the perfume. Definitely A+. I will be ordering again</li>
            <li> excelente producto, exactamente como la fotografia, llego sin retrasos, excelente precio, recomendado para todos los compradores venezolanos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent product, exactly like the picture, I get no delays, excellent price, recommended to all buyers Venezuelan</li>
            <li> Excellent, everything I expected</li>
            <li> I like this fragnance..does not stay on body for too long..</li>
            <li> I bought this out of nostalgia for Aqua Di Gio from the late 90s. I really enjoyed its scent. I was disappointed when it was discontinued. I recently came across this as a recommendation for an alternative. It smells great! Citrus-y without being too fruity. Makes me feel like I&#x27;m in a tropical climate, without the travel costs. Brings back lots of good memories created when Gio was a thing.</li>
            <li> Good morning all these objects came Congratulations perfect and they were very nice thank you send your best deals to remain a loyal customer dede Caracas Venezuela</li>
            <li> I bought this blind based on reviews on basenotes and fragtanica. Looking for a cheap Aqua di Gio... It does smell alot like it, but with a cheap sweet undertone I really couldn&#x27;t get over... I tried to used it as a car freshener... still no</li>
            <li> Very close to Aqua Di Gio at 1/4 the cost, can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite cologne.  Cannot beat the 19.99 price with FREE shipping.  Much larger bottle than the 1.7fl oz at a lower price.  The product is real and authentic as I compared with a bottle purchased from Macys.  Great Buy, Ladies love it and it won&#x27;t cost you an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> this is a great product i will purchase it again, through my favorie shopping site AMAZON</li>
            <li> AWESOME SMELL OLD SCHOOL FOR MY OLDER HUSBAND HE LOVES IT</li>
            <li> Avergae Smell.&lt;br /&gt;Its kind of an Aqua smell and is not lasting. It lasts hardly for an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;The sprayer is defective as it has a squeaking noise but that doesn&#x27;t affect the outflow.&lt;br /&gt;The Perry Ellis Black is better.</li>
            <li> smells great, great deal.</li>
            <li> This was the first time i tried Perry Ellis and I must say I love it. It has a very beautiful and pleasant smell and would definitely attract people. My colleagues at work have been asking me about it ever since i first wore it to work. Lasts for about 4-5 hours depending on what you are doing. The bottle looks cute too.</li>
            <li> I like Acqua di Gio and this scent is like it but much longer lasting!  Much better price as well!</li>
            <li> Again very happy...satisfied customer</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wanted aqua di gio for Christmas which is ridiculously expensive I googled cologne that smells like aqua di gio and all these amazing reviews came up for perry Ellis. My boyfriend did not receive the gift yet but I&#x27;m positive he will love it!!!</li>
            <li> Good cologne and very good price. A poor mans ADG.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.. does not last more than 5 minutes. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Short time of duration every time that i used</li>
            <li> This is the second time we bought this for our 19 year old son. He loves the scent and we will be buying more this Holiday season. I shopped for the best price and Amazon was the place!</li>
            <li> this is my boyfriend san valentine gift and the package was perfect the perfume is really good, the size is very good for the price.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good, i use it at many ocassions, you can use it by night or at the morning if you want!</li>
            <li> This product is great and it arrived in a fast time. Will recommend this service to another friend.  Keep the good work.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Lovely</li>
            <li> excelente producto recomendado</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PERFUME Y EXCELENTE VENDEDOR TODO LLEG;O EN EL TIEMPO PREVISTO Y TAL CUAL COMO ESTABA ACORDADO, MUCHAS GRACIAS VENDEDOR SERIO Y RESPONSABLE</li>
            <li> excellent product recommend</li>
            <li> I have the entire line of Perry Ellis, but Red, the original Blue, and the Relaunch are the best smelling.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my smell fresh but wearing a variety of colognes (not at the same time, obviosly...) I&#x27;ve worn many different colognes including Acqua di Gio, Kenneth Cole Reaction, DKNY red delicious, Chrome, Polo Blue,  and other top colognes but this one always gets the most compliments. It last long and has a nice clean fresh scent. Its also cheaper than the other ones so its a win win.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent! It is such a perfectly balanced Eau De Toilette! The scent is a delicious and refreshing blend of citrusy goodness with a little woodsy, musky, spiciness action, but intermingling in a beautiful way! No one component overpowers another; the different facets of this scent simply dance around together creating an enticing aura of confidence and summertime sexiness!</li>
            <li> Bought the 200mls of this from Amazon and I must confess it exceeded my expectation. Smells great,will definitely buy it again &amp; also recommend it.</li>
            <li> very good product recommended excellent all good very good product recommended excellent all good very good product recommended excellent all good.</li>
            <li> This does smell almost identical to acqua di gio, but I gotta say for less than half the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong. And I like the bottle. I feel as though when you are starting out and getting a cologne collection going it is important to not spend 70  to 80 dollars per bottle. That is a good idea if you truly love one cologne and that is all you will wear.</li>
            <li> really good product and just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
            <li> Cheap alternative to Aqua D Gio, to me it is more spicy and lasts longer</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend,  he loves it</li>
            <li> On time I receive the item in Colombia, without damage, and good quality</li>
            <li> I love it. It smells better than the dark blue bottle.</li>
            <li> Very good product, it comes with very good proteccion . Very recommended</li>
            <li> Bottle leaked in box when it arrived. Could smell it before box was opened and bottle was wet. 1/4 was missing</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but be skeptical about the quality of the product I got. After reading that it could be potentially a fake it&#x27;s tough to think I got the real thing. Need a few sprays to take shape. But I guess u get what u pay for. Just was dissapointed, this isn&#x27;t a cheaper substitute for Aqua di gio in my opinion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice at this fragrance game. Needed something for daily use at the office. At 23 bucks and some change hard to argue and reading reviews sounded like a clone of the more expensive Acqua Di Gio. It definitely is that and more. I own 2 other colognes .... Polo Double Black ($60) &amp; Mont Blanc Legend Intense ($65) and this can take both head on in terms of performance. Love it. Will buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this to others as I wish to keep it my secret juice.</li>
            <li> Opinion(4th cologne review of 4): I place this in the same ballpark as Acqua Di Gio. I own several bottles of this, as well as Gio. This isn&#x27;t better or worse in any way, but the scents are extremely similar. If you&#x27;re into trying something new and you&#x27;re a fan of Acqua di Gio, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I love the black 360, this stuff doesn&#x27;t last as long but still has nice scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good casual smell, definitely stinging when you first put it on; but when it settles it&#x27;s a really (GOOD) smelling cologne. It&#x27;s a casual wear, it wears off pretty fast probably like 3-4 hours after applied.</li>
            <li> OKAY, WHAT EXPECTED-I LIKE AND RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Been looking for this cologne for awhile now. It smells amazing. A light, fresh scent thats ideal for about anytime of year, and any situation. Arrived safely and quickly.</li>
            <li> buena fragancia y todo muy bien en el envio muy sastifecho con la compra... recomendado para otras ocaciones y compras</li>
            <li> Great smell, well packed, a nice cologne for special occasions. I would highly recommended for those who like citrus scents.</li>
            <li> Yeah the smell doesn&#x27;t really stick. Despite what most reviews said, I decided to try my luck. 4 hours from when I apply the scent, it&#x27;s completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> Ipickbeatuy do not buy from them. This is fake product. It will not last longer than thirty minutes. It also do not have crisp scent as the original authentic version. If you really want to purchase it, might as well buy a 3.4 mL of water and spray it on yourself cause it pretty much the same scent after thirty minutes. You guys should check other 1 star reviews cause lying do not benefit us. We are raged by our purchases, and the best way to retaliate is to help you guys out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s aqua the gio with a touch of cinnamon. I think this is better than aqua de gio and at a ridiculously lower cost. Good for spring, summer, fall. Not much of a winter scent. GOod for work, or out and about. Not my go to date cologne(i prefer moodier more mysterious smelling colognes) but it can pull off a date night no problem. Perfect for teenagers or older gentleman. If it&#x27;s your first foray into colognes this a great starter cologne as it is a safe scent that will please virtually everyone and a scent that works in any environment. It&#x27;s a staple in my collection.</li>
            <li> It has a clean feeling smell. My wife loves it. Will buy again shipping was super fast. It smells so good. Thanks perry ellis great product.</li>
            <li> Very good attention I get the product on time, in perfect condition, very good quality is much charm I recommend them 100% on the entire community of amazon ....</li>
            <li> Amazing cologne. Very cheap and good smelling. The smell reminds me of Giorgi Armani Acqua Di Gio.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great cologne that lasts a very long time. I spray about 6 sprays onto my clothing in the morning (8am), and when&lt;br /&gt;I come home at 7pm, I can still smell it! This cologne intends to last longer on pure cotton clothing.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing this EDT, love the scent.</li>
            <li> not at all what they say it is...got my order and it smells like baby powder and rubbing alcohol,the box was torn and the sprayer was bent,turns out i cant even return it.</li>
            <li> Smells so good on a man it does not go unnoticed at all. The price was a good deal and it arrived at good timing.</li>
            <li> That is probably what we all think about, the smell of cologne. I rated it 4 stars because unlike more popular brands like Polo and Nautica, it does not last long. But it lasts long enough to make you smell good for 5 or 6 hours.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 23 year old brother &amp; he loved it. This stuff smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for about a month and love it.  I receive so many compliments when using them.  Amazon offers a great price too.  Go for it...you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 11yr old son! He loves the scent and not too expensive to order again in the future..</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the scent. I get numerous compliments when wearing it. The scent seems to go away after a short time, but if you are hugging a girl, she will be able to smell it. (and that&#x27;s what matters, right?) I will be purchasing this again once my bottle runs out. Although, this might be a while since 3.4oz is quite a lot of spray. :)</li>
            <li> Great scent ... this is the cologne i rely on for every day use. I recommend buying it and using it too.</li>
            <li> Great price for our favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> It came perfectly packaged.  Also ahead of schedule.  Price was 1/3 less than local.</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis, is a fragrance I&#x27;ve enjoyed for years.  Everything that is  maid from Perry Ellis is great from the woman&#x27;s ellagant and saficticated. I love both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li> Thank you! your product is just as you described, I&#x27;m so pleased with it, I received it the date was expected and very well packed.</li>
            <li> total waste of my money. Not only is the fragrance barely detectable to me but to others as well. maybe i got one from a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34; but I cant recommend this at all</li>
            <li> Got here in a timely manner. .good product.</li>
            <li> The perfume l&amp;aacute;st so many day to arrive and also was empty because the bottle was broken</li>
            <li> Love this, as everyone says, it does smell like Aqua Di Gio.  I had to give it a try at such an affordable price.  I was pleasantly surprised that it does smell quite similar.  I did not smell them side by side but from memory it is a great alternative.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> love this for my husband; excellent value; excellent price.  keep up the good work Amazon.  Love to be able to buy this from you. Cheaper than an outlet purchase!!</li>
            <li> Smells really good always have people telling me I smell good and asking what I&#x27;m wearing def a great buy</li>
            <li> 5 Star. This is the best Cologne i have purchased in a while. I get compliment from women almost every day.</li>
            <li> bleh, not that great smelling.  thought perry ellis would be a better cologne but this one is not a winer</li>
            <li> My wife bought the first bottle because after she smelled it on a coworker and just had to get it for me. I get complements all the time at how good I smell while wearing this.</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis 360 Red is absolutely one of my most favorite scents! Women (and even a few guys) have approached me on countless occasions and asked what cologne I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with this cologne and the price. Was looking for something that was a light scent and not everyone wore</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne ! The shipping is incredibly fast , and it&#x27;s a good price for the bottle !</li>
            <li> The cologne smells awesome no doubt but it wont last long. Max 1-2 hours and that too if someone stands really close to you. If I had bought it from a shady seller I would have thought that maybe its just the one I got. But I bought it from Amazon. The bottle looks fancy in the picture but it has a very cheap feel to it. So don&#x27;t think about gifting it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the looks of the bottle, and believe me, that is all that this stinker delivers. Did not think I would ever hate a fragrance made by a reputable company. Yuck!</li>
            <li> good smell for a good price. smells so good I&#x27;ve been asked what I&#x27;m wearing a few times in like 2 months of having this cologne</li>
            <li> I buy this for my guy all the time.  I love the way it smells on him!  It&#x27;s not really overpowering or anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheaper, better version of Aqua Di Gio but still not a great scent.  Has decent longevity and projection with an ok smell but too common of a scent to give it 5 stars.  Great cologne if you&#x27;re in your late teens early 20s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I blind bought this based on the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;m not a savvy fragrance collector, so I won&#x27;t go into &amp;#34;top notes&amp;#34; or anything fancy like that. This is a clean and crisp scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower you or those around you. Got a lot of compliments with this though, which was a pleasant surprise. Great price too! Didn&#x27;t think it would smell this great, but I am human.&lt;br /&gt;Guys, wives, girlfriends....if you are looking for a signature scent, this may be a winner! Not to mention the delivery was quick and flawless! I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I went of the recommendations of a friend and bought it without knowing what it smelled like, which I suggest you don’t do. It was a little too girly for my taste. It does not emit very far, you have to lean in to be able to smell it. If you already know/ like what it smells like the one good thing about it is that it is long lasting, I was still able to smell it after a few hours and a shower.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne. The scent is refreshing like no other I have purchased in the past. This is one of the many scents I have purchased in the PE line with no disappointment.  This is a great product &amp; the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> A woman told me that I never seen in my life told me that there us nothing sexier than a man that smells good this is one of the colon&#x27; s that have them wanting to sit next to you,I just love this,I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i bought for husband he love it alot smell very nice recommend it allot fast shipping will come back  to get more</li>
            <li> This is a head turner it smells so damn good.</li>
            <li> love this fragrance because it has its own unique smell... its fresh and obviously masculine....what I mean by obviously masculine is that its not unisex because a female would not be able to wear it without  someone thinking that it rubbed off from a man...love this cologne...oh yeah you have to be a stud and play the part to convince the ladies that you are as good as you smell with this cologne...its also a fresh smell...fresh and masculine. Best of both worlds!!!</li>
            <li> Smells so good! Scent stays on me all day long and it is also name brand for a low price!</li>
            <li> Great product, amazing packaging. You need very little of this, one little spray will last all day. It is a very pleasant smell and I wear it more for  me than for my wife :)</li>
            <li> DIDNT LIKE IT. GIVE TO BROTHER IN LAW SO HE STINKS.</li>
            <li> Nice and clean smell love it, I&#x27;m a cologne type of guy I like to wear cologne ever day, I think a man should always smell good.</li>
            <li> Excellent great raping paper in all the bottles arrive in great conditions.&lt;br /&gt;Love every one of them thank you so much..</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this, an excellent spring/summer scent. Ive been using this since April, i believe. This lasts quite a while on my skin, and I would definitely recommend to any other young man looking for a good scent for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Wonderfull i love this model</li>
            <li> no me ha llegado nada kiero saber donde estan ya hace tiempo que los pedi y nada que llegan f</li>
            <li> I really like this product, very good, i love it. Good seller, i recommend. I like the perfume, is a good smell.</li>
            <li> los felicitos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;me llego&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;en poco tiempo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;los felicitos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amigo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jose coronado&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;desde&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;venezuela&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mas fino&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok ...&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Got it today, love it! Dont regret this purchase. I will come back to this when i run out. Its a nose pleaser ;)</li>
            <li> MUY BUENO,LO RECOMIENDO,ES UNA BUENA COLONIA,MUY OLOROSA,ESPECIAL PARA CABALLEROS,ASI QUE SE LA RECOMIENDO A TODOS LO CABALLEROS QUE SABEN DE COLONIA.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like Acqua Di Gio and the scent lasts until it dries. (seconds) Stay away from this, you get what you pay for. In this case, I didn&#x27;t pay much and I got crap. I tried to believe and trust the reviews, maybe this seller was just a rip off?, but the good reviews are full of crap. Just warning you, your choice.</li>
            <li> If you like aqua de gio you would truly love this one! Very good odor, will definitely buy it again! Very good price too for so much of it!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, very smooth transaction. Will order again....Thank you</li>
            <li> There probably isn&#x27;t anything more subjective than people&#x27;s perception of smell, but I will say that this musky, warm cologne got a lot of compliments. It lasted a long time and was my favorite. My new favorite is Abercrombie&#x27;s Fierce, so if you like that scent, you&#x27;ll like this too.</li>
            <li> I love it. The person I bought it for loves it as well.. Price was Great. :) :) :) :)</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever worn. Smells great and the smell stay with you for a good 5-6 hours. Chicks dig it, too!</li>
            <li> This is now my Scent, no one else seems to have the exact same and it is much cheaper than most other cologne.  I even had a girl at the bar who supposedly worked selling cologne that was very impressed with the scent, however she was adamant that it was Polo Red, not sure if that&#x27;s good or bad, but it must be working.</li>
            <li> Nice Cologne smells very good</li>
            <li> This fragrance is something citrusy, this type of fragrance is not my favorite but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I LOVET IT GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Best smells I&#x27;ve smelt on myself.ever</li>
            <li> Great scent and better priced than any store out there. Been using it for 2 years now and have had many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Perfume de especial aroma para uso diario. Recomendable para cualquier ocasi&amp;oacute;n. Buen precio. Originalidad confiable. Entrega a tiempo seg&amp;uacute;n plan de env&amp;iacute;o seleccionado</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly! Doesnt smell as strong as it did when I sampled this in a locate Perfume store. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied for the price.</li>
            <li> excelent 100% bueno. las mejores marcas del mercado lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados desde caracas venezuela&lt;br /&gt; recomiendo a toda la comunidad del mundo</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell! This is the fragrance my boyfriend wore when we started going out, he was working at Perri Ellis at the time. I&#x27;ve loved the smell since. The delivery was fairly quick and arrived 4 days earlier than the delivery date.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool and spicy and clean. But for whatever reason it just reminds me of some kind of axe body spray I had smelled back in high school.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wear, especially in the warmer months.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites fragrances from Perry Ellis.  I just love it and my girlfriend too.  I highly recommend this Cologne.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband,  and it smells very good. It reminds me of a grown and attractive man. It&#x27;s masculine but inviting. Not to mention alluring. I received my shipment in a reasonable amount of time. Very satisfied customer! !</li>
            <li> me vendieron una fancificacion</li>
            <li> Warning: This cologne is strong!</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about picking this up as a ADG clone, don&#x27;t hesitate. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great blind buy as well.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a bit much for the office, but a nice evening scent.</li>
            <li> Excelent!!! Very Good</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely terrific for the price. Would def. recommend, it&#x27;s an attention grabber alright.</li>
            <li> really liked the smell. But the spray tip on the bottle doesn,t work right. It sprays big droplets instead of a mist.  Makes it hard to apply correctly.</li>
            <li> EL PERFUME NO ES ORIGINAL ES UNA LASTIMA POR QUE LA PERSONA LA QUE SE DIO CUENTA QUE NO ERA ORIGINAL FUE A LA QUE LE VEND&amp;Iacute; EL PRODUCTO .. ES UNA LASTIMA QUE ESTA PAGINA(WWW.AMAZON.COM) SE ESTE INFECTANDO DE PERSONAS QUE PRODUCTO QUE NO SON DE CALIDAD Y ENGA&amp;Ntilde;E AL USUARIO DE LA MISMA ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL PERFUME IS NOT HURT BY THAT PERSON REALIZED THAT WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL WAS A PRODUCT THAT I SOLD .. IS A PITY THAT THIS PAGE (WWW.AMAZON.COM) IT IS INFECTED PEOPLE THAT PRODUCT QUALITY ARE NOT FOOLED THE USER TO THE SAME</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this scent, and for the price range, I get a lot of compliments on how it smells. Rates higher than all the other Perry Ellis scents (some of which are terrible). Stick with the Red!</li>
            <li> Bought as a present for my husband and HE smells amazing when wearing it!!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Doesn&#x27;t stay long though</li>
            <li> I love my perry Ellis</li>
            <li> The aroma is excellent but the perfume fixative is weak. Good presentation. Elegant packaging and The EDT arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne, all the reviewers were dead on when comparing it to Aqua Di Gio.  Last a long time, very fresh clean smell to add to any collection when you feel like switching it up...  Will definitely order from perfumesworld again, same day I ordered, same day it was shipped and wasnt a knock off!</li>
            <li> I bought it based on online reviews. Its geat purchase for the price. Only thing noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t last lobger than 4 hrs.</li>
            <li> very good thanks for sending greetings from Venezuela all perfect very good thanks for sending greetings from Venezuela all perfect</li>
            <li> The bottle looks awesome, and the cologne smells very good!  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to buy a high quality bottle of cologne at a good price.</li>
            <li> Strength (100%-80%). Perry Ellis starts off with a loud, deep, clean, &amp; crisp smell.&lt;br /&gt;Strength (80%-0%). After a while, it dulls down to this beautiful, spicy smell.&lt;br /&gt;  This cologne stays on clothes FOREVER! On adequately hydrated skin, this cologne lasts AT LEAST 12 hours ! I wear this to school &amp;&amp; I continually get compliments. 5 Star Cologne .. On Amazon, 5 Star Price. I&#x27;m not an Expert Reviewer, nor am I a paid reviewer. Dont believe me? Go to [...]</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of scents over the years and I keep getting drawn back to Perry Ellis 360 Red.  No matter where I go I always get compliments.  The stuff is a great ice breaker, women can&#x27;t help but tell you how good you smell.  High quality too, you can apply before work, hit the gym, and then the grocery store and it still has a pleasingly strong scent no matter what.</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis 360 Red For Men to me is the best smelling best dry down summer cologne I have ever used and trust me I have used lots and lots. I love this cologne and so do the women that smell it on me. When I have this on they cant get enough. 360 Red is by far my favorite summer cologne #1 on my list. Guys if u want to own the best summer cologne on the planet then buy this u will love it and so will your lady.</li>
            <li> excellent product, excellent seller, recommend</li>
            <li> It is not a strong, very light perfume, I hope that my purchase had been good and that the salesman is not a thief. Please, take it into account.</li>
