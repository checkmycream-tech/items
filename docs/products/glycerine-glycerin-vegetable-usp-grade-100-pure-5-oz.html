            <li>I love this company.</li>
            <li>I love using this product as an additive to my diy oils and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Being the eager person that I am, I had no issue with paying for the shipping, and gladly placed my order.</li>
            <li>Glycerine has many uses and, in many cases, is safe for consumption.  </li>
            <li>Love using this to make my homemade hair products.</li>
            <li>mix it with Vitamin C powder and use as a scrub for the face &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have no complaints and this is usefull for my purposes :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Great product I love Dr. Adorable&#x27;s products so far.</li>
            <li>I started vaping 18mg strength, then cut quickly down to 12mg, and now I&#x27;ve very happy at 6mg...  </li>
            <li>Thanks Dr. Adorable!</li>
            <li>May have been filled by seller</li>
            <li>Great product especially for the price!</li>
            <li>It adds great slip and contains moisture in the hair very well for high dew point regions.  </li>
            <li>If you are trying to save a small fortune, on e-cigarette solution, this stuff works great!</li>
            <li>Just a few squirts in my concoction and you have a great refreshing spritz or a leave in.</li>
            <li>Make my own natural body oil with olive oil, almond oil, glycerine, vitamin e oil for after bath.</li>
            <li>I have used it in hair refreshing mist to soften and moisturize my hair and it really works.</li>
            <li>Burns great and Leaves very, very little residue and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>But for the short time that I had this product my hair feels a million times healthy!  </li>
            <li>Every product we have purchased from Dr. Adorable has been delivered early, exceeds expectations, order after order.  </li>
            <li>We have been mixing our own oils for some time now for oil skin cleansing with various mixtures.  </li>
            <li>I simply love vegetable glycerin for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I tried making my own facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Very pure.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>seller contacted me and explained how glycerin is sold as this is my first time buying.</li>
            <li>Its a clean and clear product that delevers as its promise.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s impressive to me because my hair is very dry (as African American hair tends to be).</li>
            <li>Adding a drop or three of this pure VG when I&#x27;m dripping the 18mg stuff makes it nicer for me.</li>
            <li>This makes a great, simple moisturizing hair spritz that isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy at all.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Proper instruction on how to use it easily available on line - everything from making fire to frosting.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best moisturizer for natural hair.&amp;#34; I heard other women say that about vegetable glycerin, but when I purchase some and starting using it, it was the same result for me.</li>
            <li>in addition, I demand a full refund of the shipping that I was forced to buy by your company, because your shipping is FAR from expedited, which is defined as to make an action happen sooner or be accomplished more quickly; which is the furthest from what your companies shipping is.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Julian Gannon</li>
            <li>This product can be used in many ways outside of the big company&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>And it leaves almost no build up, since it only takes a small amount of glycerin mixed with a large amount of water, which is great.</li>
            <li>Bottle appeared to be opened and it was not filled all the way to the top.  </li>
            <li>Also use it to remove makeup, doesnt clog pores  or dry skin, rinse off with warm wet wash cloth</li>
            <li>Even free shipping offered by other companies had shipped faster than yours...</li>
            <li>Makes it sooo soft and detangable!</li>
            <li>At first, my order was estimated to ship by Tuesday, December 3rd by 8:00 pm, and it has now been over 72 hours overdue the estimated time, and my product has still not arrived.</li>
            <li>It only takes very little to be effective.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair is now.</li>
            <li>I  46 years old and keeping moisture in my skin has become my priority so this is truly a go to product</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product for skin, hair and other applications as it is an excellant way to soffen anything.</li>

            <li> We added dry ice to our chiller which made the fog cling to the ground.</li>
            <li> I use it after I wash my hair, while it&#x27;s still wet.</li>
            <li> Everything as expected</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m transitioning to natural hair, my hair is very damage and weak from all the tight micro braiding, weave extensions, perms and just poor handling of my hair.</li>
            <li> Upon checking out and confirming my order, I noticed that there was no option for regular shipping speed, and was forced to pay for expedited shipping.</li>
            <li> I use it for vaping to cut down harshness in some of my juices, and to make nicotine levels a little milder in some of my stronger juices.</li>
            <li> The bottle wasn&#x27;t all-the-way full, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount of it into a spray bottle, then add water and shake it to mix.</li>
            <li> so the small mistake they made was sending me one 4 ounce and one 5 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> We have never had a bad product or bad service from Dr. Adorable.</li>
            <li> I use this will aloe vera juice and water (because the consistency is sticky and thick).</li>
            <li> Chicago is mere hours from New York, and honestly I am disgusted that I paid extra money for &#x27;expedited&#x27; shipping BY FORCE.</li>
            <li> for the price you can not go wrong.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly disgusted with the shipping that you provide, and after this experience I shall NEVER place another order using your service.</li>

            <li> Very pure. Food grade and great value.</li>
            <li> Every product we have purchased from Dr. Adorable has been delivered early, exceeds expectations, order after order.  This is no exception.  We have been mixing our own oils for some time now for oil skin cleansing with various mixtures.  We have never had a bad product or bad service from Dr. Adorable.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Omg! This is absolutely the best moisturizer for natural hair.&amp;#34; I heard other women say that about vegetable glycerin, but when I purchase some and starting using it, it was the same result for me. I simply love vegetable glycerin. I mix it with water, and aloe vera gel. I simply love vegetable glycerin for my natural hair. Makes it sooo soft and detangable! Definitely five stars!</li>
            <li> Vegetable glycerin is a wonderful substance! I use it in the body moisturizers and lip balm that I make. I also use it in my hair. I put a small amount of it into a spray bottle, then add water and shake it to mix. This makes a great, simple moisturizing hair spritz that isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy at all. I use it after I wash my hair, while it&#x27;s still wet. I also use it once or twice in between washes. It only takes very little to be effective. That&#x27;s impressive to me because my hair is very dry (as African American hair tends to be). And it leaves almost no build up, since it only takes a small amount of glycerin mixed with a large amount of water, which is great. I wish I&#x27;d known about vegetable glycerin years ago, I could have saved a lot of money on hair moisturizing products! Dr. Adorable is great, as always. Shipping was fast. I love this company.</li>
            <li> I love using this product as an additive to my diy oils and conditioners.  It adds great slip and contains moisture in the hair very well for high dew point regions.  Thanks Dr. Adorable!</li>
            <li> Hello Dr. Adorable,&lt;br /&gt;I placed an order for the vegetable glycerin that you make, and have a bone to pick. Upon checking out and confirming my order, I noticed that there was no option for regular shipping speed, and was forced to pay for expedited shipping. Being the eager person that I am, I had no issue with paying for the shipping, and gladly placed my order. At first, my order was estimated to ship by Tuesday, December 3rd by 8:00 pm, and it has now been over 72 hours overdue the estimated time, and my product has still not arrived. I noticed that you are positioned from a shipping site in Chicago, and wondered, what could possibly be taking so long? Chicago is mere hours from New York, and honestly I am disgusted that I paid extra money for &#x27;expedited&#x27; shipping BY FORCE. Even free shipping offered by other companies had shipped faster than yours... EVEN THROUGH THE SAME POSTAL SERVICE. Let me put this in perspective for you; about 2 months ago, I ordered a skateboard from California... over 3 times the distance that you are shipping... and the skateboard that I ordered came OVERNIGHT. I am thoroughly disgusted with the shipping that you provide, and after this experience I shall NEVER place another order using your service. in addition, I demand a full refund of the shipping that I was forced to buy by your company, because your shipping is FAR from expedited, which is defined as to make an action happen sooner or be accomplished more quickly; which is the furthest from what your companies shipping is.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Julian Gannon</li>
            <li> Glycerine has many uses and, in many cases, is safe for consumption.  It is also great for the outdoorsman and for home emergency kits in health issues and for making fire (in conjunction with potassium permanganate).  Proper instruction on how to use it easily available on line - everything from making fire to frosting.</li>
            <li> This is a great humectant!! I use this will aloe vera juice and water (because the consistency is sticky and thick). Just a few squirts in my concoction and you have a great refreshing spritz or a leave in. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Love using this to make my homemade hair products. BEST product for winter hair!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!!! I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair is now. Since I&#x27;m transitioning to natural hair, my hair is very damage and weak from all the tight micro braiding, weave extensions, perms and just poor handling of my hair. But for the short time that I had this product my hair feels a million times healthy!  I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I tried making my own facial cleanser.  I feel the difference from store  bought facial cleansers.  I would definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> Works nicely in my DIY beauty products.</li>
            <li> This works wonderful as a moisturizer. I  46 years old and keeping moisture in my skin has become my priority so this is truly a go to product</li>

            <li> I use it for vaping to cut down harshness in some of my juices, and to make nicotine levels a little milder in some of my stronger juices. I started vaping 18mg strength, then cut quickly down to 12mg, and now I&#x27;ve very happy at 6mg...  but I still have a lot of the stronger juices on my shelf. Adding a drop or three of this pure VG when I&#x27;m dripping the 18mg stuff makes it nicer for me.</li>

            <li> awesome product. mix it with Vitamin C powder and use as a scrub for the face &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I did recieve this on time and it works for my uses.&lt;br /&gt;[EDIT]&lt;br /&gt;The seller contacted me and explained how glycerin is sold as this is my first time buying.I have no complaints and this is usefull for my purposes :)&lt;br /&gt;[EDIT]&lt;br /&gt;But this is meant to be usp grade glycerin so the small mistake they made was sending me one 4 ounce and one 5 ounce bottle.This makes me question standards but it does work.</li>
            <li> for the price you can not go wrong.Its a clean and clear product that delevers as its promise.This product can be used in many ways outside of the big company&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Made this purchase in order to make home made bath salts and a sugar scrub for Christmas gifts.  Bottle appeared to be opened and it was not filled all the way to the top.  May have been filled by seller and I didn&#x27;t measure it to see if it was truly 5 oz.  It worked for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> This was very affordable and a little goes a long way. I have used it in hair refreshing mist to soften and moisturize my hair and it really works. Great product especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I used this to mix my own e cig liquids and works good 1 bottle has lasted me awhile...+ good stuff</li>
            <li> We used this glycerin for our homemade Fog juice. It work perfectly. We added dry ice to our chiller which made the fog cling to the ground.</li>
            <li> Everything as expected</li>
            <li> If you are trying to save a small fortune, on e-cigarette solution, this stuff works great! All you have to do is add any of your&lt;br /&gt;favorite flavors and you&#x27;re good to go! Burns great and Leaves very, very little residue and easy to clean. I hope I don&#x27;t put the people who make e- solution  Out of business. Great product!</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product for skin, hair and other applications as it is an excellant way to soffen anything. The price was great too.</li>
