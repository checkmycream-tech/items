            <li>So glad I can still get it online.  </li>
            <li>I am more into the gourmand type fragrances, and love the Thierry Mugler house.  </li>
            <li>I also love Dolce &amp; Gabanna</li>
            <li>I love this on my husband.</li>
            <li>I can already smell it :)</li>
            <li>What more do you want.  </li>
            <li>Interesting, no labeling on the bottle.</li>
            <li>HAPPY TO HAVE A NEW SOURCE.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really improve much with wearing and didn&#x27;t blend perfectly with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>great masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that Amazon carries this and at such a great price.</li>
            <li>This is an older cologne but smells SO good.  </li>
            <li>Very unique sweet smell from heaven.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong like my known genuine bottle.  </li>
            <li>For a good husband, a nice scent that stays with you all day long.</li>
            <li>Free Shipping,</li>
            <li>This is great cologne and the only place I can now find it for my boyfriend is on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I would still recommend trying this stuff if you can find it cheap.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>To me it is too strong, too sweet and overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Wow !!!!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t say Giorgio Beverly Hills anywhere on the bottle or packaging like my original bottle.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow, I still have my original bottle to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>Has such a nice and sexy smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say it smells EXACTLY the same...  </li>
            <li>This is a true bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>Warning, this IS A Sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Please get it if you like anything sweet.</li>
            <li>I prefer cool scents that smell like I just came out of a shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly a well-conceived product with nice packaging.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, for about $15 more, you can find a cologne that smells ten times better.</li>
            <li>Ok smell and lasts a few hours, good price.</li>
            <li>Love This Cologne, Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>Last long good smell great for work perfect 1000% cant go wrong no bull</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>We liked it when it first came out and was sold by the major department stores.  </li>
            <li>But if you can&#x27;t, $20 (3.4oz) is a low risk investment to try and leave a good impression without making much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>Smells nice and last all day.  </li>
            <li>The perfume has an amazingly fresh and fruity fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
            <li>C my husband ssmells very appetizing when he wears it.</li>
            <li>This one is right up there with Polo Sport, Cool Water, and Light Blue.</li>
            <li>I think Thallium, Nautica, and some others may be a much better option on the low price range</li>
            <li>This is one my wife first bought for me on Christmas when we first met and every Christmas since.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>This is my first time smelling this fragrance.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is exactly as it&#x27;s described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still recommend trying it in a store first.</li>
            <li>Smell is exactly what I like.</li>
            <li>Will definitely pick up some more as I need it.</li>
            <li>Some fragrances bought on here are cheaper because they are not the exact brand or smell, this was not the case.  </li>
            <li>It is still a favorite and is one of the only colognes that you can still get a whiff of after being at the office all day.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what our son wanted</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t like it, other people have their own opinions and are entitled to.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light fresh scent but is definitely formulated for a man.</li>
            <li>women all day long tell me they love this cologne....</li>
            <li>I got kind of average reactions, so I will probably not get another bottle after this one.</li>
            <li>Angel A*men, Angel B*Men, Pure Malt, and</li>
            <li>Classic fragrance!</li>
            <li>It provides a lingering scent that has staying power and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>have gives this a 4 star rating just based on how much I like the scent, but that&#x27;s just my preference of the scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery but</li>
            <li>But this is in a 3.4oz bottle and my original bottle is only 1.7oz</li>
            <li>Other people may love this.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and properly packaged, but when I spray it, cologne leaks out the lid and all over my hand.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Used it for years,compliments all the time, kind of hard to find for me.</li>
            <li>Well, I still have an original bottle Wings from roughly 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going on 12 hours now using the new bottle</li>
            <li>I sprayed my new Wings, and the bottle Spray leaks.</li>
            <li>Definitely affordable at the time I bought it, and not a fake, sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying wings since a long time ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it lands just barely on the straight male side of metrosexual.</li>
            <li>A perfect blend of oceanic, synthetic, and flowery accords, this one is cool enough to wear in the worst heat, and sweet enough for the times when the sun goes down.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only worn it when I haven&#x27;t been sweating, but I want to guess that it would react well to some intense male body chemistry.</li>
            <li>But it is also not very musky or hot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not extremely \\&quot;manly\\&quot; but not too girlie either.</li>
            <li>Apparently this has been licensed to EA fragrances?  </li>
            <li>As far as projection and lasting power, I would rate this a *5 star*.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far bettter than more expensive colognes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone to other stores to get a smaller size and had to pay twice as much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s legit, smells just like a bottle that&#x27;s 10 years old and lasts just as long.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find, lucky i found it here on amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overbearing, even if you lay it on a little too thick, and it lasts most of the day.</li>

            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only worn it when I haven&#x27;t been sweating, but I want to guess that it would react well to some intense male body chemistry.</li>
            <li> But it is also not very musky or hot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not extremely \\&quot;manly\\&quot; but not too girlie either.</li>
            <li> Apparently this has been licensed to EA fragrances?  </li>
            <li> As far as projection and lasting power, I would rate this a *5 star*.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far bettter than more expensive colognes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone to other stores to get a smaller size and had to pay twice as much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s legit, smells just like a bottle that&#x27;s 10 years old and lasts just as long.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find, lucky i found it here on amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overbearing, even if you lay it on a little too thick, and it lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> Will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> ALL DAY LONG.  </li>
            <li> This cologne lasts ALL DAY long...</li>
            <li> Then I was worried because I saw reviews that the scent would only last a few hours.  </li>
            <li> It is getting harder and harder to find this in a local store.  </li>
            <li> Applied to pulse points a little goes a long way and last all day long.</li>
            <li> me give you the low down on Wings for Men.</li>
            <li> At first whiff it comes across as floral and even a little heavy, but stick with it for a few seconds and it will lighten up and show</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t like spending too much for cologne, then you won&#x27;t be disappointed with what you get for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> upon receiving this item, I looked forward to using it and expected some sort of compliment after looking over the reviews of this product...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in any stores other than online.</li>
            <li> Now that the other brand is almost gone</li>
            <li> This is another item that may be hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> in recent years it has been really hard to locate.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;at least I won&#x27;t smell like a locker room or low tide at the pier with this stuff</li>
            <li> Less then $20.</li>
            <li> : Wore it a little, got some impressions from others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores..</li>
            <li> My late wife bought it for me</li>
            <li> Its next to impossible to find in any store were I am from</li>
            <li> It actually nauseated me.  </li>
            <li> It looks like false.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a little floral and spicy, and has a very faint hint of woodsiness.</li>
            <li> If you are blind buying.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> For the price you wont go unhappy.</li>
            <li> Not too bad for the price, however I probably won&#x27;t buy it again...</li>
            <li> If thats not your style this will be horrible for you.</li>
            <li> horrible!</li>
            <li> it a fake buyer be ware!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this anywhere local!&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for many years and always will!</li>
            <li> C my husband ssmells very appetizing when he wears it. The best thing is I still smell it after hours which is very unusual.</li>
            <li> Well, I still have an original bottle Wings from roughly 10 years ago.  My late wife bought it for me so it reminds me of her and what she liked.  So, it arrived yesterday and I was a tad worried I got a knock off.  It doesn&#x27;t say Giorgio Beverly Hills anywhere on the bottle or packaging like my original bottle.  Apparently this has been licensed to EA fragrances?  Anyhow, I still have my original bottle to compare it to.  I&#x27;m happy to say it smells EXACTLY the same...  But this is in a 3.4oz bottle and my original bottle is only 1.7oz (I think this may last me a life time)  Then I was worried because I saw reviews that the scent would only last a few hours.  I&#x27;m going on 12 hours now using the new bottle and it&#x27;s still going strong like my known genuine bottle.  It&#x27;s legit, smells just like a bottle that&#x27;s 10 years old and lasts just as long.  Buy with confidence and enjoy the awesome savings!</li>
            <li> Was introduced to this cologne as a gift and it has since become a part of my collection. It provides a lingering scent that has staying power and for a reasonable price. Applied to pulse points a little goes a long way and last all day long.</li>
            <li> Love This Cologne, Highly Recommended. Great Scent!! Will Buy Again!! Free Shipping, Thanks Amazon!! Donnie R. Longo Jr.</li>
            <li> This cologne is great 4 me and my co-workers n and out of the companys i go two threw the day say i can tell when thst driver JB came he smells so good! Those r the women that is. Ha,ha yall have a GREAT day!</li>
            <li> As expected. Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> man i am telling you...if you are in a slump this will get you out of one in a hurry.....  women all day long tell me they love this cologne....ALL DAY LONG.  Even YOUR girl likes it ........</li>
            <li> Not too bad for the price, however I probably won&#x27;t buy it again...I think Thallium, Nautica, and some others may be a much better option on the low price range</li>
            <li> This is another item that may be hard to find locally. This is one my wife first bought for me on Christmas when we first met and every Christmas since. I ran out this year...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this stuff shares a spot on my shelf with Hugo, Eternity, Obsession and CK-1. I was given a bottle of this for Christmas when I was 17 and have been in love with it ever since. My own son is now 16 and I bought some for him last Christmas and he loves it as well. Never heard anything but good and great about how it smells.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this fragrance, as do I.</li>
            <li> Nice, very good....Thank You....!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only scent that my husband will wear.  It is getting harder and harder to find this in a local store.  I am so glad that Amazon carries this and at such a great price.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne for years and it smells great. I can&#x27;t help myself when I smell it on him, I have to give him extra hugs just so I can smell his cologne.&lt;br /&gt;For this price, this amount is amazing. I&#x27;ve gone to other stores to get a smaller size and had to pay twice as much. This is a great buy!! Classic fragrance!</li>
            <li> HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS. HAPPY TO HAVE A NEW SOURCE.</li>
            <li> A+. 5 Star. This is a true bang for your buck. Warning, this IS A Sweet smell. If thats not your style this will be horrible for you. Very unique sweet smell from heaven. Please get it if you like anything sweet. For the price you wont go unhappy. If you are blind buying. BUY BUY BUY!</li>
            <li> Great scent for my hubby. I try to keep him stocked up on it and it makes a great birthday gift!</li>
            <li> great masculine fragrance. Low key with staying power. Used it for years,compliments all the time, kind of hard to find for me.</li>
            <li> This cologne was always my favorite but in recent years it has been really hard to locate. Plus the price was really fair.</li>
            <li> I receive plenty of complements when I wear this cologne. It&#x27;s not overbearing, even if you lay it on a little too thick, and it lasts most of the day. It&#x27;s a light fresh scent but is definitely formulated for a man. And if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t like spending too much for cologne, then you won&#x27;t be disappointed with what you get for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great quality and services! Great product for a good price! Thank you so much! I love it and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Last long good smell great for work perfect 1000% cant go wrong no bull</li>
            <li> Great price. I&#x27;ve had this before and just love it.</li>
            <li> upon receiving this item, I looked forward to using it and expected some sort of compliment after looking over the reviews of this product...it smells like an air freshener. horrible!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying wings since a long time ago. I sprayed my new Wings, and the bottle Spray leaks. This bottle has no wings writing in front of the bottle it a fake buyer be ware!!!!</li>
            <li> This is great cologne and the only place I can now find it for my boyfriend is on Amazon.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> OMG! This is my first time smelling this fragrance. I know my dad will love this.</li>
            <li> Love this product loved it for years and was happy to see I could get it again one of my favorites!!</li>
            <li> Excelente.... Gracias por su atención...!!!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is exactly as it&#x27;s described. If you need to take a chance, go ahead with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me give you the low down on Wings for Men. I think it is the kind of fragrance that most women will like on a man. It&#x27;s not extremely \\&quot;manly\\&quot; but not too girlie either. I&#x27;d say it lands just barely on the straight male side of metrosexual. It is definitely a little floral and spicy, and has a very faint hint of woodsiness. So far I&#x27;ve only worn it when I haven&#x27;t been sweating, but I want to guess that it would react well to some intense male body chemistry. It&#x27;s not too \\&quot;warm\\&quot; or too \\&quot;cool.\\&quot; I prefer cool scents that smell like I just came out of a shower. This is not like that. But it is also not very musky or hot. There is quite a bit of depth and complexity to it. At first whiff it comes across as floral and even a little heavy, but stick with it for a few seconds and it will lighten up and show its more manly side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I can say confidently about this product is \\&quot;at least I won&#x27;t smell like a locker room or low tide at the pier with this stuff on.\\&quot; And that means the cologne is serving its highest purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gives this a 4 star rating just based on how much I like the scent, but that&#x27;s just my preference of the scent. It&#x27;s clearly a well-conceived product with nice packaging. Definitely affordable at the time I bought it, and not a fake, sold by Amazon. I&#x27;d still recommend trying it in a store first. But if you can&#x27;t, $20 (3.4oz) is a low risk investment to try and leave a good impression without making much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Wore it a little, got some impressions from others. It didn&#x27;t really improve much with wearing and didn&#x27;t blend perfectly with my body chemistry. I got kind of average reactions, so I will probably not get another bottle after this one. I still like the smell, but it isn&#x27;t awesome for me. I would still recommend trying this stuff if you can find it cheap. Otherwise, for about $15 more, you can find a cologne that smells ten times better.</li>
            <li> Second time I our purchased this. Smell is exactly what I like. Great price. Can&#x27;t find in any stores other than online.</li>
            <li> For a good husband, a nice scent that stays with you all day long. Price very good, shipping very fast. Will definitely pick up some more as I need it.</li>
            <li> Some fragrances bought on here are cheaper because they are not the exact brand or smell, this was not the case.  This smelled exactly like it should and the seller was great to work with!</li>
            <li> Hard to find, lucky i found it here on amazon. Women loves this scent, gets compliments all the time when wearing it... :)</li>
            <li> The bottle does not have the name,  why? It looks like false. but...smells good.</li>
            <li> We liked it when it first came out and was sold by the major department stores.  It is still a favorite and is one of the only colognes that you can still get a whiff of after being at the office all day.  Glad that we can still find this!</li>
            <li> Came quickly and in perfect shape.  Fragrance is fabulous.  So glad I can still get it online.  It&#x27;s far bettter than more expensive colognes.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend likes it. Less then $20. Will last me a long time. 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Bottle shape is an added plus, as it will look nice on top of a dresser.</li>
            <li> Where I stay discontinued it. Used to be my #1 cologne. Highly recommend to anyone. You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I brought this item because my mother convinced me too, and I was blown away,,,best buy, must have.  You won&#x27;t regret your choice</li>
            <li> I purchased a gift set from Walmart that had five or six 1/2 oz. bottles in it about 8 or so years ago.  This scent came in the package.  To me it is too strong, too sweet and overpowering.  It actually nauseated me.  Although I don&#x27;t like it, other people have their own opinions and are entitled to.  While some people may adore this, I simply can&#x27;t wear this.  To each their own.  I ended up giving this to someone at work. I am more into the gourmand type fragrances, and love the Thierry Mugler house.  Angel A*men, Angel B*Men, Pure Malt, and I own SunEssence which is a summer scent by Thierry Mugler.  I also love Dolce &amp; Gabanna the One for my winter collection.  As far as projection and lasting power, I would rate this a *5 star*.  However since I don&#x27;t care for it, I had to drop my rating to a *2 star.  Other people may love this.  Try before you purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this on my husband. Its next to impossible to find in any store were I am from so I had changed my husband to a different brand but still missed this one. Now that the other brand is almost gone I thought I would try to find this online. Amazon has it for a great price and I can&#x27;t wait for my husband to get back to Wings. I can already smell it :)</li>
            <li> This is exactly what our son wanted</li>
            <li> Ok smell and lasts a few hours, good price.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and last all day.  What more do you want.  And I got it at a great price.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he loves the smell of it! It got to me very quickly and just in time for Christmas!</li>
            <li> This cologne lasts ALL DAY long... I get a LOT of compliments on this fragrance... It&#x27;s hard to find in stores..</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and properly packaged, but when I spray it, cologne leaks out the lid and all over my hand.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery but the nozzle on the bottle does not work&lt;br /&gt;Pressing it only makes the bottle wet&lt;br /&gt;So iam not pleasedwith this product&lt;br /&gt;Sending it back is no option sinse im over seas</li>
            <li> Interesting, no labeling on the bottle.</li>
            <li> My husbands signature sent and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!  That&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li> This is an older cologne but smells SO good.  Has such a nice and sexy smell.  Wish it was easier to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Another good one for men , smells damn good Wow !!!!!!</li>
            <li> This one is right up there with Polo Sport, Cool Water, and Light Blue. A perfect blend of oceanic, synthetic, and flowery accords, this one is cool enough to wear in the worst heat, and sweet enough for the times when the sun goes down. I wouldn&#x27;t wear this in fall or winter, but it&#x27;s definitely a winner during the spring and summer.</li>
            <li> The perfume has an amazingly fresh and fruity fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Feels like you took the shower power with you and carried it away with you throughout the day!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely reccomend it.</li>
