    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Both are excellent products.</li>
            <li>This, plus the conditioner, has been the best thing I&#x27;ve found to use for the eczema on my scalp.</li>
            <li>This is excellent!</li>
            <li>Solved by Excema issue on my scalp.. very good also the conditioner</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great in that aspect</li>
            <li>product worked great for me.</li>
            <li>Very good product which gets my hair clean everytime!</li>
            <li>the oil&#x27;s too large to fill in pores so no zits, it&#x27;s the perfect cure</li>
            <li>So far it has been wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this shampoo is the best for not setting off my skin sensitivities.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is an excellent product for me and I would suggest for anyone else with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It cleans well and does not have much of a smell which I&#x27;m happy about.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more and plan on sticking with this as my shampoo going forward.</li>
            <li>It did make my scalp feel better and relieved itching ...</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased</li>
            <li>and I would like her hair to have more moisture</li>
            <li>Exederm was recommended by my dermatologist after patch testing revealed I was allergic to ingredients in many shampoos, soaps and creams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>If I need to wash my hair more often, Exederm is o.k.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more soon.  </li>
            <li>Look for more accommodating sellers.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product for Eczema!  </li>
            <li>I got scalp eczema and was very excited to try this after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li>Good luck to any buyer who wants to return the product because you will not be able to do it.  </li>
            <li>but she is not scratching and that is the most important thing for me</li>
            <li>It is a very mild shampoo, no fragrance.</li>
            <li>It has a strong preservative ingredient, one I patch tested 3 plus with- phenoxyethanol.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally I found Exederm and have been problem free for a year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A good product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Exederm shampoo leaves my hair clean and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head six times a week and have mild eczema.</li>
            <li>I use less per wash than I did with others to get a good lather and just as clean.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a tad more drying than most shampoos, but does the job with out the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>This product cleans really well, and leaves my hair very squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the shampoo and conditioner after my boyfriend had gifted me the flare up cream and face wash for my constant eczema breakouts.</li>
            <li>and this is the first shampoo that I used and did not have a rash on my forehead.</li>
            <li>It worked the first 3 weeks but after that, nada.</li>
            <li>for those who say it doesn&#x27;t foam up: wet your hair and squirt the shampoo right on your head...works better than putting it in your hand first!</li>
            <li>This seems to be a good shampoo--it definitely works, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel too dry or flyaway after using it.  </li>
            <li>I had ordered multiple products directly from Exederm and they were nice enough to send me a full refund.  </li>
            <li>The doctors have not been very helpful with their recommendations.</li>
            <li>and my itching was intense.  </li>
            <li>The only hair products I have found free of preservatives is Free and Clear for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It really made a difference for me.</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t work after 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>The Eczema behind my ears is much better since using this product!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any improvements, I recommend almond oil, cleared up my eczema in about one use and only have to use it once a week or less, great for scalp and skin in general, also</li>
            <li>It still cleans my hair just as well as a normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s designed to be that way because less foaming is better for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After first use you could see a big difference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using these 2 Exederm products for 2 weeks, but so far they are very gentle.  </li>
            <li>My 2.5 year old daughter has Eczema.</li>

            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>But if u have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my dermatologist as I have a sensitive scalp and hair loss.</li>
            <li>This Shampoo has done wonders for my itchy and sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>now believe that I had developed an allergy to one or more ingredients common in shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;Or</li>
            <li>It felt like lotion in my hair, made it heavy and didnt clean it at all.</li>
            <li>The combination leave my hair soft and manageable, and my scalp feels NORMAL, at last!</li>
            <li>Beware, had such high hopes because of my contact dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>I washed my hair for the first time with the product tonight and all it did was make my head extremely itchy and my fingers</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that my scalp itches MUCH less than it did before as someone with dermatitis, but it is a little better. . .</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a little unusual.</li>

            <li> It foams a lot less than normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exederm Shampoo is not moisturizing enough for dry scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle is so small and the shipping charge so high, even if you could use it the cost would be prohibitive on any extended basis.  </li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is small, but I found I don&#x27;t need to use as much as normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> As one other poster said, the bottle is smaller, but it doesn&#x27;t take a lot per wash.  </li>
            <li> I noticed other reviewers had similar comments.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo made my scalp and hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> perhaps those shampoos made my scalp too dry.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend the conditioner to go with it as the shampoo alone can slightly dry and friz hair.</li>
            <li> This left my hair limp with no body and requires daily use to wash out the oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for half a year now and am on my third bottle.  </li>
            <li> I expected a product designed for those with eczema, a dry skin condition, to be moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is wrong, it leaves my hair very manageable, but does need to be left on for 2-4 minutes as per its instructions.  </li>
            <li> My eyelids had been swollen, pink, itchy and turning scaley.</li>
            <li> and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to do that as much as other products would,</li>
            <li> but I feel like it leaves my hair a little oily when I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> and it calmed her down immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> J&amp;J Baby shampoo caused dandruff, itching, and dead skin buildups.  </li>
            <li> When my hair dried, my scalp felt itchy, probably because of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> few pimples would form, I&#x27;d scratch them, and I would have scabs that would take weeks to heal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 weeks with no improvement and it dried my hair.</li>
            <li> They and plain petroleum jelly are all I can use now aaannnnddd.....</li>
            <li> no more rash or irritation.</li>
            <li> Yes a bit drying to the hair, but no more itching.</li>
            <li> Lately her scalp has been an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, bottle is very small for price.</li>
            <li> So when looking for a gentler and less weird stuff in it shampoo</li>
            <li> Finally a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t drive my scalp crazy!  </li>
            <li> It got me through a bad Ezema outbreak</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not work for me at all...!!!</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders is the worst!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using head and shoulders to treat my dandruff for months and it hasnt been working. This reduces the number of flakes immensely. They aren&#x27;t all gone, but my skin is clearing up and I think they will be gone soon!&lt;br /&gt;Tip for those who say it doesn&#x27;t foam up: wet your hair and squirt the shampoo right on your head...works better than putting it in your hand first!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvements, I recommend almond oil, cleared up my eczema in about one use and only have to use it once a week or less, great for scalp and skin in general, also the oil&#x27;s too large to fill in pores so no zits, it&#x27;s the perfect cure</li>
            <li> Solved by Excema issue on my scalp.. very good also the conditioner</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good shampoo--it definitely works, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel too dry or flyaway after using it.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that my scalp itches MUCH less than it did before as someone with dermatitis, but it is a little better. . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some problems with shampoo.  J&amp;J Baby shampoo caused dandruff, itching, and dead skin buildups.  Head &amp; Shoulders that I tried to get rid of the Dandruff caused acne and an eczema patch on my eyelid.  So when looking for a gentler and less weird stuff in it shampoo I came across Exederm and tried it out.  I&#x27;ve used it for half a year now and am on my third bottle.  No dandruff, itching, acne, or eczema.  It cleans well and does not have much of a smell which I&#x27;m happy about.  As one other poster said, the bottle is smaller, but it doesn&#x27;t take a lot per wash.  I use less per wash than I did with others to get a good lather and just as clean.  I had no problems with it leaving my hair feeling heavy, but I&#x27;m a guy and have thicker hair so it may not be as much of a factor for me.  I&#x27;m ordering more and plan on sticking with this as my shampoo going forward.</li>
            <li> After first use you could see a big difference!</li>
            <li> It did make my scalp feel better and relieved itching ... It got me through a bad Ezema outbreak</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my scalp and hair feel dry. When my hair dried, my scalp felt itchy, probably because of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exederm Shampoo is not moisturizing enough for dry scalp and hair. I expected a product designed for those with eczema, a dry skin condition, to be moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Just about every shampoo and conditioner I have ever tried leads to irritation.  Head and Shoulders is the worst!  I&#x27;ve only been using these 2 Exederm products for 2 weeks, but so far they are very gentle.  Note that some reviews for the conditioner say it is ineffective.  This is wrong, it leaves my hair very manageable, but does need to be left on for 2-4 minutes as per its instructions.  Both are excellent products.</li>
            <li> My 2.5 year old daughter has Eczema. It breaks my heart to see her scratching. The doctors have not been very helpful with their recommendations. Lately her scalp has been an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the [[ASIN:B004DGK3Z4 Exederm Cleansing Baby Bath 8 oz (237 g)]] on the shelf at CVS and decided to try it with her nightly baths. It was a blessing. So I decided to try this shampoo. We have been using it for about 3 weeks. So far it has been wonderful. I am so glad I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;I use the Exederm conditioner along with it. I am African American and I would like her hair to have more moisture and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to do that as much as other products would, but she is not scratching and that is the most important thing for me right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must mention that I also use the [[ASIN:B00634THEM Organic Root Stimulator Hairepair Vital Oils for Hair and Scalp, 4.3 Ounce]] on her scalp. I do believe this product used in combination with with Exederm has made the difference. On two occasions she started to scratch and I placed some on this in her hair parts and it calmed her down immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> For years my scalp would break out in an itchy rash every 2 or 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;A few pimples would form, I&#x27;d scratch them, and I would have scabs that would take weeks to heal.&lt;br /&gt;I tried medicated, antibacterial, and anti dandruff shampoos, but nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;Finally I found Exederm and have been problem free for a year.&lt;br /&gt;I now believe that I had developed an allergy to one or more ingredients common in shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;Or perhaps those shampoos made my scalp too dry.  Whatever it was I&#x27;m finally cured!&lt;br /&gt;For the rest of my life I&#x27;m only using Exederm.</li>
            <li> I got scalp eczema and was very excited to try this after reading all the reviews. Unfortunately it did not work for me at all...!!! I used it for 2 weeks with no improvement and it dried my hair. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> This left my hair limp with no body and requires daily use to wash out the oil. Yuck.  Never again.</li>
            <li> Exederm was recommended by my dermatologist after patch testing revealed I was allergic to ingredients in many shampoos, soaps and creams. (😢sigh....). My eyelids had been swollen, pink, itchy and turning scaley. I was horrified. Thank Goodness for Exederm products. They and plain petroleum jelly are all I can use now aaannnnddd.....no more rash or irritation. Works wonders!!!!! Yay! 🙆</li>
            <li> This, plus the conditioner, has been the best thing I&#x27;ve found to use for the eczema on my scalp. I ordered the shampoo and conditioner after my boyfriend had gifted me the flare up cream and face wash for my constant eczema breakouts. Those helped my face so much, but it&#x27;s not easy putting cream on your scalp, so I decided to try this. I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is the first shampoo that I used and did not have a rash on my forehead. It&#x27;s great in that aspect but I feel like it leaves my hair a little oily when I blow dry it. But if u have sensitive skin it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> It felt like lotion in my hair, made it heavy and didnt clean it at all. Also, bottle is very small for price.</li>
            <li> This is excellent! It does what it is suppose to do and therefore I am definitely buying this again if I need to.</li>
            <li> Beware, had such high hopes because of my contact dermatitis.  It has a strong preservative ingredient, one I patch tested 3 plus with- phenoxyethanol.  I used this product as well as the conditioner (it has this ingredient also) and my itching was intense.  Even their baby creams and lotions have this in it.  I had ordered multiple products directly from Exederm and they were nice enough to send me a full refund.  The only hair products I have found free of preservatives is Free and Clear for sensitive skin.  Yes a bit drying to the hair, but no more itching.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a little unusual. It foams a lot less than normal shampoo. But it&#x27;s designed to be that way because less foaming is better for sensitive skin. Also, the bottle is small, but I found I don&#x27;t need to use as much as normal shampoo. It still cleans my hair just as well as a normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked great for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and this shampoo is the best for not setting off my skin sensitivities. I immediately noticed the difference when I began using it.  I wouldn&#x27;t ever switch to another product after using this one.</li>
            <li> Finally a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t drive my scalp crazy!  This product cleans really well, and leaves my hair very squeeky clean.  I suggest getting the Exederm Conditioner also.  The combination leave my hair soft and manageable, and my scalp feels NORMAL, at last!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist as I have a sensitive scalp and hair loss. It is a very mild shampoo, no fragrance. It is a tad more drying than most shampoos, but does the job with out the harsh chemicals. I do recommend the conditioner to go with it as the shampoo alone can slightly dry and friz hair.</li>
            <li> It really made a difference for me. I shave my head six times a week and have mild eczema. I&#x27;ve only been using this product a couple of weeks, but haven&#x27;t had a flare up yet. Also helped with some recurring acne.</li>
            <li> Exederm shampoo leaves my hair clean and manageable.  I have to use soaps and shampoos that do not aggregate my eczema.  If I need to wash my hair more often, Exederm is o.k. to use every day.  A good product for anyone with sensitive skin. I plan on ordering more soon.  Mary M.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is an excellent product for me and I would suggest for anyone else with sensitive skin.  Very good product which gets my hair clean everytime!</li>
            <li> This Shampoo has done wonders for my itchy and sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair for the first time with the product tonight and all it did was make my head extremely itchy and my fingers tips burn. So, I had to rewash it with (surprise) Dawn Dishwashing Liquid to get it to stop itching.  Even my ear lobes peeled from it.  Good luck to any buyer who wants to return the product because you will not be able to do it.  You do not want to do business with this company ever.  The bottle is so small and the shipping charge so high, even if you could use it the cost would be prohibitive on any extended basis.  Look for more accommodating sellers.  I noticed other reviewers had similar comments.  You cannot see all the comments about returns unless you dig deep into the system.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for Eczema!  Use with the Exederm Conditioner for maximum benefit!  The Eczema behind my ears is much better since using this product!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was possible for me to reduce the dandruff but it really didn&#x27;t work after 3 weeks of use. It worked the first 3 weeks but after that, nada.</li>
