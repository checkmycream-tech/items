            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Can be better if compared to products under 30$ category.</li>
            <li>Smell is sexy..</li>
            <li>It lasts for a 8-10 hours easily.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my boyfriend for Christmas ordered it two days ago and got it this morning love the fresh clean smell!</li>
            <li>the fragrance is fine, but it does not have longevity.</li>
            <li>The one from amazon was huge an</li>
            <li>and its relatively cheap compared to versace or ed hardy.</li>
            <li>and it is really cheap price for cologne.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it smelled.</li>
            <li>Playboy Miami smells Crisp, Vibrant and Fresh, excellent for us younger guys.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered and I received it quick!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t stick too long, but it&#x27;s a good work cologne for the price.</li>
            <li>but I have recieved the original product and not a fake.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its an amazing fragrance and you wont have second thought to why you bought it.</li>
            <li>&gt; the fragrance is smooth an classy,, can be worn for every day or with that special someone...</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh when I first smelled the cologne.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice, but it isn&#x27;t very strong and doesn&#x27;t last for very long either.</li>
            <li>like it very much</li>
            <li>and the ladies like it  ;)</li>
            <li>my overall thoughts is that it is okay.</li>
            <li>so maybe see if you can find it in a store first to see if it suits your preference.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts all day and smells as good as much more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Playboy Miami definitely screams MIAMI without being so strong</li>
            <li>Just bought this large bottle of Miami (orange) on amazon</li>
            <li>It came very fast and price is decent...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing this cologne again, but smell is very subjective</li>
            <li>smells pretty good but the it only stays on for a little while</li>
            <li>the more expensive ones last longer but non the less its cheap and smells good.</li>
            <li>Great if you don&#x27;t want to use your expensive stuff all the time.</li>
            <li>mostly water, dont smell for long, only for 20 min</li>
            <li>I live in South Florida</li>
            <li>Very masculine but not old-manish (no offense intended).</li>
            <li>I purchased this fragrance from  AMAZON after seeing it at wally world for a higher price an smaller bottle..</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>After trying all of these, I found that the orange one (called Miami) by far my absolute favorite from all of the scents (the red one is a distant second).  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this cologne but have found it hard to find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>they do put offers, we need to buy during that time.</li>
            <li>I initally bought this in store for my 25 yr old boyfriend</li>
            <li>Wow my son had the body spray so we tried the cologne.</li>
            <li>Obviously for the price this doesn&#x27;t concern me, but just remember that this is not the same as the $110 3.4oz Cologne you get at Macy&#x27;s, where 1-2 Sprays and your smelling fresh all day [or all night].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>A good casual day scent.</li>
            <li>I had a slight problem and after an email they resolved it quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased the gift set with all of Playboy cologne scents in small bottles in one box.  </li>
            <li>, this is a direct quote that does not reflect my personal beliefs</li>
            <li>it barely lasts 3-4 Hours.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this for my husband since we cant seem to find it any were else! Smells awesome and last forever go play boy Miami!!</li>
            <li> I like this cologne more than my Elizabeth Tayor&#x27;s Passion for men. I like my Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Passion for men alot.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a passion for men.</li>
            <li> I love perfumes by Playboy. They leave that awesome fragrance to you that confuses people to decide if its strong or subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is a Subtle Fragrance. It lasts for a 8-10 hours easily. I have previously used these perfumes and always get complimented for them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean it every single time I get compliments for using it. My girlfriend is head-over-heels when I wear this fragrance. So Mission Accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its an amazing fragrance and you wont have second thought to why you bought it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this cologne but have found it hard to find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for many years, did not find my nearby stores, so order it in online. It came very fast and price is decent...they do put offers, we need to buy during that time.</li>
            <li> Used this before. like it very much</li>
            <li> My Co-Workers tell me &amp;#34;I crawl up jesus&#x27;s *** crack every morning before I come to work&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*disregard any religous offense, this is a direct quote that does not reflect my personal beliefs</li>
            <li> it smells great. and its relatively cheap compared to versace or ed hardy. but the smell doesnt last very long.  the more expensive ones last longer but non the less its cheap and smells good. so i wont complain.  and the ladies like it  ;)</li>
            <li> I initally bought this in store for my 25 yr old boyfriend and I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it smelled. Very masculine but not old-manish (no offense intended). The scent lasts all day and smells as good as much more expensive brands. This is a larger sized bottle that will last awhile, he mainly uses it as an everyday cologne for work or a rellaxed day.</li>
            <li> Playboy Miami smells Crisp, Vibrant and Fresh, excellent for us younger guys. You sort of the sensation you&#x27;d receive from selling the Chrome cologne. Its an excellent cologne for any occasion, its cheap so you can always have it on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single complaint I would have about this cologne is it doesn&#x27;t last long. Even with 5+ Sprays it barely lasts 3-4 Hours. Obviously for the price this doesn&#x27;t concern me, but just remember that this is not the same as the $110 3.4oz Cologne you get at Macy&#x27;s, where 1-2 Sprays and your smelling fresh all day [or all night].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around great cologne. Will buy again</li>
            <li> you definitely get what you pay for with this one. the fragrance is fine, but it does not have longevity. my overall thoughts is that it is okay. I did get this a part of a valentine&#x27;s day gift. My boyfriend loves it so I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li> smells pretty good but the it only stays on for a little while but if your the guy that want cologne to stay on during your day out i recommend it</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance from  AMAZON after seeing it at wally world for a higher price an smaller bottle.. The one from amazon was huge an&lt;br /&gt;less expensive.&lt;br /&gt; the fragrance is smooth an classy,, can be worn for every day or with that special someone... the women at work seem to love it..  I purchased the entire collection from AMAZON an gave some away to my best friend.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the fragrance smell good</li>
            <li> Does well. Sastified with lasting scent.  Not over powering. A good casual day scent. Will check out the other choices by Playboy!!!</li>
            <li> I had a slight problem and after an email they resolved it quickly and efficiently. I recommend this product to anyone who likes cologne. The bottles half the price of what it is in stores plus its 3 times the size!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my boyfriend for Christmas ordered it two days ago and got it this morning love the fresh clean smell!</li>
            <li> Outstanding value. Great deal.</li>
            <li> This item smells so good and great price to. Everybody i know loves the smell.&lt;br /&gt;If your using it to pick up girls its works great because 50% of the time it works 100% of the time</li>
            <li> the boys love this cologne so nothing better for xmas.  love to smell good for the girls.  definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> mostly water, dont smell for long, only for 20 min</li>
            <li> this smells sooo good all we could find was just the body spray. glad that i found this. will buy again</li>
            <li> i got some of this from walmart one time, but it was half the size, for like $20. found it here &amp; didnt even think twice. love the smell as do most of my &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; friends.</li>
            <li> I bought a smaller bottle of this cologne at wal-mart a couple yes ago and they have not had it since. So I was fortunate to find it on amazon for a good price. It smells awesome and it&#x27;s not too heavy. I get compliments on it often. It&#x27;s one of 3 colognes I regularly wear.</li>
            <li> Geez i thought i was never going to find this stuff again... everyone loves this smell for guys who question buying it</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift and the person receiving loved that is was Playboy.. nifty gift idea.. will buy again</li>
            <li> I love this cologne for &amp;#34;going out&amp;#34;. I think Playboy has done a great job of matching the scents they create with the city name they have allocated.  Playboy Miami definitely screams MIAMI without being so strong you make people sick to their stomachs. It is a great cologne for hitting the night-life and enjoying time out with friends.  And the price...WOW! :) Get a few bottles, or get a few different from the Playboy line.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the gift set with all of Playboy cologne scents in small bottles in one box.  After trying all of these, I found that the orange one (called Miami) by far my absolute favorite from all of the scents (the red one is a distant second).  Just bought this large bottle of Miami (orange) on amazon and it is really cheap price for cologne.</li>
            <li> I loved it! It was exactly what I ordered and I received it quick! Smells great! Easy transaction! Thanks</li>
            <li> The price at which I got this perfume is phenomenol low as compared to buying over the counter. I was sceptical but I have recieved the original product and not a fake. This I checked myself with applying the same at C21 store. The fragrance was same. But this is average cologne. Can be better if compared to products under 30$ category.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like every other guy in Miami Beaches club scene, this is the cologne for you. I live in South Florida and I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh when I first smelled the cologne. I was immediately reminded of the clubs. It does smell nice, but it isn&#x27;t very strong and doesn&#x27;t last for very long either. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this cologne again, but smell is very subjective so maybe see if you can find it in a store first to see if it suits your preference.</li>
            <li> Wow my son had the body spray so we tried the cologne. Smell is sexy..my hubbie got in on it too. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. Great if you don&#x27;t want to use your expensive stuff all the time.</li>
            <li> Came on time. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t stick too long, but it&#x27;s a good work cologne for the price.</li>
