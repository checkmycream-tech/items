            <li>Shipped very fast!!</li>
            <li>I bought it knowing it was cheap</li>
            <li>the color was very vibrant and beautiful, the hair was soft and silky, and the clips seem durable.</li>
            <li>and I saw that this is one of the best pieces of hair that I have bought for quality  quantity and price I am definitely going back to get more</li>
            <li>Other than that its beautiful and looks really cool</li>
            <li>the quality is really good for it to be so cheap I&#x27;ve been doing extensions in wearing extensions for a long time now</li>
            <li>but you need two for a full head.</li>
            <li>Also, buyers might want to know that you may need to buy two for full coverage.</li>
            <li>It felt smooth and soft, not plasticky, and I was able to brush and curl it.  </li>
            <li>but I do have very long hair to be fair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost perfect, except my hair is already kinda long and this only lengthened my hair by three inches</li>
            <li>I mix them in with my blonde extensions and they blend great and looks natural!</li>
            <li>Overall, really amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>I Love this hair wore it for a few days in a row, no shedding so far and easy to take care of, I love it!</li>
            <li>After, one of the clips broke right off.</li>
            <li>and it is soft and easy to put on .&lt;br</li>
            <li>its soft i can brush it easily and style it</li>
            <li>Of course you can&#x27;t put heat on the hair, but my stay straight !</li>
            <li>it was pretty shiny at first</li>
            <li>it is a braid and is looks just like my real hair!</li>
            <li>even asked if it was my real hair!</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve just stated this was my first time buying hair.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with it is that when you take it off it has static.</li>
            <li>The color looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying extensions.</li>
            <li>This one looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>BUT the didn&#x27;t look exactly like the pic</li>
            <li>I did in fact try it on at least and the clips felt great in</li>
            <li>Has a little bit of lace under the clips that makes it more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I liked them and people</li>
            <li>ALSO sheds soooo much .. soooo much!</li>
            <li>i bought these and they came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>:) Really long as well!</li>
            <li>a novice and more experienced extension wearers may not have this problem but for me it is very difficult to attach.</li>
            <li>very cute colors was pretty , very heavy  tho .gonna</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and the colors are very pretty.  </li>
            <li>Thanks c:</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone who could deal with synthetic over real.</li>
            <li>My issue is really with my inability to attach it in my hair.</li>
            <li>IT LOOKS SOOO REAL.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s wayyyy to much of a hassle to bother with.</li>
            <li>Clips are decent and hefty.  </li>
            <li>Dont waste your money its very cheap quality</li>
            <li>If you know how to take of synthetic extensions I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping for a few more inches than that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute but to heavy for my hair</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look super fake, but gorgeous enough to seem like they&#x27;re real.</li>
            <li>The hair was so soft, and the two colors are vibrant but still contrast.</li>
            <li>The hair is very, very soft.</li>
            <li>In the sunlight I&#x27;ll admit they have a shiny fake plastic look to them, but other than that they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>:)  Not sure I agree with that one.</li>
            <li>Hair feels pretty cheap and is hard to manage.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy and the clips are strong.</li>
            <li>Also, like some other people said, the clips will fall apart fairly easily so your for going to have to sew them back in yourself.</li>
            <li>But otherwise the product is great and in the unfortunate case that one of them get damaged I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Sooo soft.</li>
            <li>I was amazed by how soft hair was.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s longer than this extension, then it defeats the purpose of the extension, as your natural hair will tend to cover it.  </li>
            <li>The color is so pretty and the length is so long.</li>
            <li>Also, I was under the impression that there was a net under the clips for your real hair to go.</li>
            <li>Soft &amp; can handle the heat.</li>
            <li>overall looks and feels real.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at the quality I got for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous color, but it&#x27;s synthetic hair, as advertised, and unfortunately looks like it.</li>
            <li>, apparently it really is shipped straight from China (as some other reviewers have mentioned).</li>
            <li>The colors are so vibrant, and it&#x27;s so thick and smooth.</li>
            <li>Came quickly in the mail, I baby powderd them to make them less shiny</li>
            <li>Less quality than I expected, but overall for the money was okay</li>
            <li>IT BARELY SHEDS.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult trying to put it in my hair on my own...</li>
            <li>But its very soft and long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super long weft, so unless you pin up and hair spray your real hair underneath, you&#x27;re going to look ridiculous.</li>
            <li>The only thing is my hair doesn&#x27;t blend very well due to th length of the extensions</li>

            <li> The color is so pretty and the length is so long.</li>
            <li> Also, I was under the impression that there was a net under the clips for your real hair to go.</li>
            <li> Soft &amp; can handle the heat.</li>
            <li> overall looks and feels real.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at the quality I got for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gorgeous color, but it&#x27;s synthetic hair, as advertised, and unfortunately looks like it.</li>
            <li> , apparently it really is shipped straight from China (as some other reviewers have mentioned).</li>
            <li> The colors are so vibrant, and it&#x27;s so thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> Came quickly in the mail, I baby powderd them to make them less shiny</li>
            <li> Less quality than I expected, but overall for the money was okay</li>
            <li> IT BARELY SHEDS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult trying to put it in my hair on my own...</li>
            <li> But its very soft and long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super long weft, so unless you pin up and hair spray your real hair underneath, you&#x27;re going to look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The only thing is my hair doesn&#x27;t blend very well due to th length of the extensions</li>
            <li> And they are so long.</li>
            <li> it is really long</li>
            <li> It is really long</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if u don&#x27;t have long hair</li>
            <li> dye my hair purple soon to match doesnt look right on natural hair color , do put some baby powder on it because it will help it not look fake , not thin hair very thick</li>
            <li> you know how long your hair is!</li>
            <li> It is very long</li>
            <li> From Stephen&#x27;s Girlfriend:  Extension is thick and soft!!</li>
            <li> U was trying to be extremely careful with it, but it just broke.</li>
            <li> this product is a bit heavy for me personally, But</li>
            <li> Was so excited to try this and thought it sounded long enough but was I so wrong!!</li>
            <li> A little heavy when using two, obviously.</li>
            <li> The shipping was a lot faster than I expected!!</li>
            <li> but i brushed it with baby power and washed it to dull out the shine just a little bit.</li>
            <li> Very long and thick.</li>
            <li> My little one&#x27;s hair happens to be longer than the extension, so when worn loose, it&#x27;s hard to see the exention.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This looks like My Little Pony hair and the color isn&#x27;t as pictured.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little darker otherwise i rlly like them</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t an expensive piece which was a big plus!</li>
            <li> but I seem to be unable to properly attach it.  </li>
            <li> Really thick hair, actually doesn&#x27;t look fake after I put some baby powder on it.</li>
            <li> and i had a hard time getting it the way i wanted, so</li>
            <li> It came REALLY late.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, I&#x27;d suggest ordering two.</li>
            <li> A little bit cheesy looking, but its synthetic so of course it does.</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t the same the hair was ugly wish I wouldn&#x27;t of got them.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, I usually don&#x27;t like to shop online.</li>
            <li> :( bummed it&#x27;s too short for me</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> I thought it would feel awkward when wearing it</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience once.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> but I can tell you I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
            <li> Shipping and handling was outrageous!</li>

            <li> This looks like My Little Pony hair and the color isn&#x27;t as pictured.</li>
            <li> Cute but you need two for a full head. A little heavy when using two, obviously.</li>
            <li> I got it today. Didnt take long to get and it is beautiful! I thought it would feel awkward when wearing it but I cant even tell it is on. I will be buying more to but away and have. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.the add for it saud up to 6 days for delivery well after the transaction went through it changed to up to 21 days.it comes from china! And she got to wear it 1 day and one of the clips that holds it in your hair was coming off! So we had to sew it back on.but all in all it is a very beautiful hair piece.</li>
            <li> My Granddaughters thing.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money its very cheap quality</li>
            <li> Well it was a lot longer than my hair and i had a hard time getting it the way i wanted, so i ended up braiding it. It is a lot thinner than i thought too. I recommend getting more than one. Other than that its beautiful and looks really cool</li>
            <li> Beautiful!!!! I love them! Sooo soft. And they are so long. I easily took the clips out and glued them in.</li>
            <li> When I have got my hair from unwig I was amazed by how soft hair was. the quality is really good for it to be so cheap I&#x27;ve been doing extensions in wearing extensions for a long time now and I saw that this is one of the best pieces of hair that I have bought for quality  quantity and price I am definitely going back to get more</li>
            <li> So cheap !! And look cool! Of course you can&#x27;t put heat on the hair, but my stay straight !</li>
            <li> The extension was good for the price I paid.  It felt smooth and soft, not plasticky, and I was able to brush and curl it.  When on, it stayed in place.  After almost 3 weeks of moderate wear, all the fiber is still in, nothing&#x27;s come apart or fell out.  The color was as described.  Just keep in mind, if you have hair that&#x27;s longer than this extension, then it defeats the purpose of the extension, as your natural hair will tend to cover it.  My little one&#x27;s hair happens to be longer than the extension, so when worn loose, it&#x27;s hard to see the exention.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this item was ordered March 14th and we didn&#x27;t get it until April 4th, apparently it really is shipped straight from China (as some other reviewers have mentioned).</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this hair very good quality perfect coloring and secure hair clips very neat also neatly packaged no fake shine looks like real human hair</li>
            <li> it is really long and it is soft and easy to put on .&lt;br /&gt;also it is inexpensive. that is probably my favorite part</li>
            <li> Came just like it looked in the picture. The hair is very, very soft. Love the color and the way it blends and works with your hair! Great product.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with these colors! this was my fav. it was pretty shiny at first but i brushed it with baby power and washed it to dull out the shine just a little bit. PERFEXTOO</li>
            <li> I bought this (Purple) hair extension for 18 dollars. Shipping and handling was outrageous! I thought it was worth it. (turns out- [...] has the same hair extensions for about 5 dollars!) I didn&#x27;t know about that before I bought this... So I got it. It came REALLY late. And when I got it, I tried it on. After, one of the clips broke right off. U was trying to be extremely careful with it, but it just broke. So, unless you have a sewing machine...you&#x27;re SOL. :3</li>
            <li> The color and the ease of use are the best things about these hair extensions. Gave them as Christmas gifts and the teens absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> Looks, well, like plastic so if youre going for a &amp;#34;naturally&amp;#34; colored hair may not work. ALSO sheds soooo much .. soooo much! But its very soft and long. Nice color too</li>
            <li> Its works great and i could get away with it. It is really long so i had to cut it but other wise it works perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> Less quality than I expected, but overall for the money was okay</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t the same the hair was ugly wish I wouldn&#x27;t of got them. Don&#x27;t buy if u don&#x27;t have long hair</li>
            <li> The extensions are so nice, pretty and look great! Plus they&#x27;re very easy to brush!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this online I was skeptical, I usually don&#x27;t like to shop online. I had a bad experience once. It wasn&#x27;t an expensive piece which was a big plus! I wanted hair extensions so I could give my hair a break from all the dying! I got my piece WAYY before delivery date! It was also just as the picture! This hasn&#x27;t changed my mind fully with ordering online but I can tell you I wasn&#x27;t disappointed! It is super adorbs and easy to put in! I love wearing it is a braid and is looks just like my real hair! Def ordering from them again in the future. Thanks c:</li>
            <li> Super cute!!! If you know how to take of synthetic extensions I&#x27;d highly recommend. They&#x27;re fun to add color to ur hair!!! I love them.</li>
            <li> Its ok. A little bit cheesy looking, but its synthetic so of course it does. I don&#x27;t think I will get another...</li>
            <li> Very soft and beautiful, but easily knots up. If you have thick hair, I&#x27;d suggest ordering two. Doesn&#x27;t work with curling iron and isn&#x27;t heat resistant. The clips fall off a lot. Other than that, I liked them and people even asked if it was my real hair!</li>
            <li> The shipping was a lot faster than I expected!! And when they arrived I was completely satisfied. They don&#x27;t look super fake, but gorgeous enough to seem like they&#x27;re real. :) Really long as well! which is a big plus! And easy to cut to fit your style or hair length, too. Really good quality synthetic extensions for the price!! I would recommend these to anyone who could deal with synthetic over real.</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty and the length is so long. It&#x27;s almost perfect, except my hair is already kinda long and this only lengthened my hair by three inches and I was hoping for a few more inches than that. But otherwise the product is great and in the unfortunate case that one of them get damaged I will definitely buy again. Also, buyers might want to know that you may need to buy two for full coverage.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve just stated this was my first time buying hair. It arrived as estimated and was packaged appropriately. The hair is soft and the colors are very pretty.  My issue is really with my inability to attach it in my hair. I&#x27;ve gone on YouTube and searched for tricks but I seem to be unable to properly attach it.  Like I said I am a novice and more experienced extension wearers may not have this problem but for me it is very difficult to attach.</li>
            <li> OMG I love it!! Its so bright and straight. I want it in different colors</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE EXTENSIONS. IT BARELY SHEDS. IT DOES NOT TANGLE WHEN YOU TAKE IT OFF. IT GRIPS ON TO YOUR HAIR EASILY. IT LOOKS SOOO REAL. I GET SO MANY COMPLIMENTS WHEN I WALK DOWNTOWN. The only problem I have with it is that when you take it off it has static. But it can be tamed with hairspray. :) EEE.!! I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Purple is my favorite color and this is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. I mix them in with my blonde extensions and they blend great and looks natural! In the sunlight I&#x27;ll admit they have a shiny fake plastic look to them, but other than that they&#x27;re great! The color looks exactly like the picture. Would definitely recommend! Also they came a month before I was supposed to get them!</li>
            <li> The hair was so soft, and the two colors are vibrant but still contrast. For the quality I thought it was almost human hair! Thank you</li>
            <li> Just got my extension today! Love the color! It&#x27;s difficult trying to put it in my hair on my own... but I still love it! Plan on using it for Vegas next weekend!</li>
            <li> very cute colors was pretty , very heavy  tho .gonna dye my hair purple soon to match doesnt look right on natural hair color , do put some baby powder on it because it will help it not look fake , not thin hair very thick i do like it tho</li>
            <li> Very long and thick. Came quickly in the mail, I baby powderd them to make them less shiny, it is a ton of hair! Still kinda shiny though</li>
            <li> I had no problems receiving my extensions. They are absolutely beautiful and a great price. Beautiful long synthetic locks that can easily be attached. I love the colors!</li>
            <li> I bought it knowing it was cheap lol. It&#x27;s a gorgeous color, but it&#x27;s synthetic hair, as advertised, and unfortunately looks like it. I still wear it though. Also, I was under the impression that there was a net under the clips for your real hair to go. This is not the case. It&#x27;s a super long weft, so unless you pin up and hair spray your real hair underneath, you&#x27;re going to look ridiculous. Also, like some other people said, the clips will fall apart fairly easily so your for going to have to sew them back in yourself. I wear it once in a while, but probably not buy it again. You get what you pay for, folks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my tween who loved it!  It is very long but it was cute in her hair.  He school did make her take it out because they said it was a &amp;#34;distraction&amp;#34;. :)  Not sure I agree with that one.</li>
            <li> I Love this hair wore it for a few days in a row, no shedding so far and easy to take care of, I love it! Worth the money</li>
            <li> The website images,do this no justice! Soft &amp; can handle the heat.Thank You, for a great product!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair this product is a bit heavy for me personally, But overall looks and feels real. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying extensions. This one looks exactly like the picture. The colors are so vibrant, and it&#x27;s so thick and smooth. It isn&#x27;t too shiny. It&#x27;s so easy to brush through and doesn&#x27;t tangle at all. It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy and the clips are strong. It felt very comfortable. I was so surprised at the quality I got for the price. It&#x27;s beautiful and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> From Stephen&#x27;s Girlfriend:  Extension is thick and soft!! Color is to die for.  Clips are decent and hefty.  I can brush it out with no problems too!</li>
            <li> i bought these and they came pretty fast. BUT the didn&#x27;t look exactly like the pic it&#x27;s a little darker otherwise i rlly like them</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot- the color was very vibrant and beautiful, the hair was soft and silky, and the clips seem durable. The only thing is my hair doesn&#x27;t blend very well due to th length of the extensions so make sure you know how long your hair is!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute but to heavy for my hair I can&#x27;t keep it in so I&#x27;m stuck -_-</li>
            <li> Ya get what ya pay for they say. Hair feels pretty cheap and is hard to manage. After working with it for an hour i was able to make it look pretty awesome and I got many compliments on my hair but it&#x27;s wayyyy to much of a hassle to bother with.</li>
            <li> Really thick hair, actually doesn&#x27;t look fake after I put some baby powder on it. Has a little bit of lace under the clips that makes it more comfortable. Overall, really amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast!! Was so excited to try this and thought it sounded long enough but was I so wrong!!:( bummed it&#x27;s too short for me but I do have very long hair to be fair. I did in fact try it on at least and the clips felt great in :) wish I could wear it!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as I already have purple hair and I liked the ombr√© look, HOWEVER what I got in the mail was a solid purple clip-in which tangled the second I put it in my hair. Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> i like it its soft i can brush it easily and style it</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for the money, but I haven&#x27;t found the best way to pin it to look relatively real.</li>
