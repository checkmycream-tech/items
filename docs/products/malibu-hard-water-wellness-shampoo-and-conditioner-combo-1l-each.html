            <li>Smells nice and works great</li>
            <li>Love the softness and silkiness feel of my hair after shampooing with Malibu !</li>
            <li>Since using these Wellness products my hair is in great shape, very manageable and the color is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Has nice lingering fragrance but no improvement in the dryness from well water.</li>
            <li>Her hair is much softer and it smells great!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my high school swimmer.</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting better results than I received.  </li>
            <li>When used once a week my hair is in much better shape and not so lifeless.</li>
            <li>more so idk if that&#x27;s a thing or not...</li>
            <li>this shampoo and conditioner set alleviated those issues.</li>
            <li>The iron bacteria content in our water was turning my hair more orange day by day.  </li>
            <li>I bought the shampoo, conditioner, and the weekly treatment packets (you really must use these too) and have been extremely happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>looks  and feels better using your combo.</li>
            <li>My family and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Economical purchase - caused way more &#x27;dryness&#x27; than desirable!</li>
            <li>This is not much of the best way to describe it</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it builds up.</li>
            <li>the bottles are huge</li>
            <li>But  Amazing really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
            <li>Hair didn&#x27;t feel clean.  </li>
            <li>I also find the large bottles easy to use.</li>
            <li>Actually tried it and LOVE it!.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, genuine product.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to buy the crystals, which might be more powerful, and dump them in the shampoo and let it dissolve and maybe that will give it an extra boost.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo/conditioner last week and my hair is 100% better.</li>
            <li>Very unprofessional company!  </li>
            <li>the first 2 times of using it</li>
            <li>it really works!</li>
            <li>This product works very well, and it has lasted for months!  </li>
            <li>I noticed an improvement in my hair the first time I used this.</li>
            <li>So far there seems to be a difference but still too early to really say for sure</li>
            <li>and I am so glad to have my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li>great shampoo if you live in areas of hard water</li>
            <li>After the very first wash my roots were soft and had volume again</li>
            <li>Even with the softener, we still get iron, and my daughter is the one person in our family with light blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>Very helpful with my rusty water.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair WAAY more ratty, tangled &amp; unmanageable than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Over time, I noticed the tips tuning orange, her hair was very dry and brittle, and broke easily.  </li>
            <li>When we built our house, we weren&#x27;t prepared for how high our iron would be, so we had a softener system installed.  </li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the Malibu treatment packets</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have been warned that if used too often this may dry out your hair, but that is true of just about any product.</li>
            <li>Searched and found this product and had to give it a try to save my newly highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>But seriously, this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>I first used the iron out treatment, to get her hair back to normal</li>
            <li>This helps the cuticle not open up as much and take on as much minerals.  </li>
            <li>Also, use cool water to wet and rinse every time, whether you use this product that day or not.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to strip my hair of natural oils.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt my hair this soft in quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really expected them to last much longer by using Malibu shampoo and conditioner, but I really can&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s doing much.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo, conditioner &amp; packets for a year now and will use no other.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if these products would necessarily remove orange, but immediately following my latest color treatment which did remove orange tint</li>
            <li>It is very common in our area to have iron in your well water as we live in cranberry county and the bogs were originally mined for iron ore.  </li>
            <li>her hair is no longer dry, but she has also started using a leave-in conditioner in conjunction with the new shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde and after only two showers could already see the orange hue it was turning my hair.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to figure out that this was the result of build-up from the minerals in the super hard water in my area.</li>
            <li>Not sure if that&#x27;s the right word.  </li>
            <li>Ordered Well Water Action shampoo and conditioner, the large bottles and got Hard water shampoo and conditioner.  </li>

            <li> If your hair is rusty, dry, and lifeless from shampooing with well water, then please do yourself a big favor and buy these.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s really just my icky water, so</li>
            <li> I have super thick, curly hair that is easily dried out.  </li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s all natural and works with the Texas Hill Country hard water.</li>
            <li> it was suddenly dry and frizzy at the ends but always felt sticky/oily at the roots, no matter how often I washed it.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week...leaves hair dry.</li>
            <li> It dulled my hair and left it feeling heavy and with the same film as on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just moved into a new place and we have horribly hard well water.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work but makes my hair very dry even with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Ive tried using the shampoo with other conditioners thinking that maybe the conditioner is not very rich, but even with other conditioners after the shampoo my hair is left dry and ratty, cant even get my fingers through my hair in the shower!</li>
            <li> And when wet and trying to brush you need to put product in to comb through easily!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> she washes her hair daily with the shampoo and lets the conditioner rest on her hair for a few minutes before washing it out.</li>
            <li> we live in an area with hard water, and she complained of the effects of the water on her hair, such as dryness and an &amp;#34;orange-y tint&amp;#34; (even though she doesn&#x27;t have color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> No more yellow in my hair.</li>
            <li> In the past, when I had gone blonder, my hair turned orange, my husband actually called me Rusty for a while.</li>
            <li> I know other people rave about Malibu and</li>
            <li> Definitely does not assist with hard water.</li>
            <li> If your a blonde and have hard water these are a must</li>
            <li> I hate my well water, but this makes it so much more bearable.</li>
            <li> and we have owned our home for about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> Even with that, the streaks I put in my hair are gone within three weeks or less of having them done.  </li>
            <li> I use shamp/cond twice per week and the dry packet of Hard Water powder once per week.</li>
            <li> A few tips- the products are stripping minerals out (chelating)</li>
            <li> and I cant 100% say its crap because I don&#x27;t know if i got the true stuff because 1 liter of each should have cost me way  </li>
            <li> My hair was in a mess this summer from hard water.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday, with this or anything else!</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out!  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo is very harsh.</li>
            <li> Hard to deal with.  </li>
            <li> Dull hair met its match.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a remedy to the dry/dullness etc of my hair that i thought was caused  by my hard water, BUT</li>
            <li> Please also see my review for Malibu C Hard Water Weekly Demineralizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malibu Hard Water Wellness was recommended to me by a friend, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> We have hard water.  </li>
            <li> hardly anything comes out..</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s just bad for your hair, strips the natural oils away.)</li>
            <li> What a difference it made with hard water!</li>
            <li> I have very hard water in Illinois.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo pump was broken when they arrived.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not satisfied, they are very difficult!  </li>
            <li> I have really bad well water, and using this does help.</li>
            <li> Cause my water is so bad i can smell the metalic smell after i use it.</li>
            <li> I so worried about our water as we just shocked our well and had brown water for two days.</li>
            <li> Been using these products for over a month, and im really disappointed with the condition of my hair when using this.</li>
            <li> but very expensive!</li>
            <li> It was awful!  </li>
            <li> I have horribly rusty well water, but do have a softener.  </li>

            <li> I have been using this shampoo, conditioner &amp; packets for a year now and will use no other.  We have softened well water and I have gray hair.  My gray was having some pinkish streaks when a colorist recommended this shampoo. Since using these Wellness products my hair is in great shape, very manageable and the color is beautiful.  You need to mix baking soda and the shampoo after using the packets to prevent color damage if your hair is gray and I have no damage.  My hair has never been better, do not change this product, it is the best!</li>
            <li> I recently moved to California and was horrified by what was happening to my hair....it was suddenly dry and frizzy at the ends but always felt sticky/oily at the roots, no matter how often I washed it. It took me a while to figure out that this was the result of build-up from the minerals in the super hard water in my area. I tried things like a vinegar rinse and argan oil but nothing worked. I bought this shampoo/conditioner last week and my hair is 100% better. After the very first wash my roots were soft and had volume again and I could actually run my fingers through my hair. If I could give this product 10 stars I would.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  My hair was in a mess this summer from hard water.  I began using this and my stylist even said it must be great stuff.  I only wish the conditioner were a bit &amp;#34;stronger.&amp;#34;  Not sure if that&#x27;s the right word.  I have super thick, curly hair that is easily dried out.  I have to pair this with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I have highlights in my hair and the iron water makes them orange looking. I started using this twice a week and my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> Very unprofessional company!  Hard to deal with.  Ordered Well Water Action shampoo and conditioner, the large bottles and got Hard water shampoo and conditioner.  Now I&#x27;m being told its the same product just the bottles are different.  They won&#x27;t pay the return shipping.  This has taken 2 weeks and I&#x27;m not satisfied, they are very difficult!  I will never buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Economical purchase - caused way more &#x27;dryness&#x27; than desirable! Seemed to strip my hair of natural oils.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting better results than I received.  Has nice lingering fragrance but no improvement in the dryness from well water.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!  Love how it makes my hair look &amp; feel!!  No more yellow in my hair.</li>
            <li> Dull hair met its match. When used once a week my hair is in much better shape and not so lifeless.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair WAAY more ratty, tangled &amp; unmanageable than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. Definitely does not assist with hard water.</li>
            <li> This well water conditioner and shampoo have kept my hair blonde instead of organge. I buy it on line because it is cheaper and easier to find.  If you have rusty water this is the answer for your hair.</li>
            <li> THis is the best shampoo and conditioner I have used.  Excellent. I also find the large bottles easy to use.</li>
            <li> it strips your hair. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> It is very common in our area to have iron in your well water as we live in cranberry county and the bogs were originally mined for iron ore.  When we built our house, we weren&#x27;t prepared for how high our iron would be, so we had a softener system installed.  Even with the softener, we still get iron, and my daughter is the one person in our family with light blonde hair.  Over time, I noticed the tips tuning orange, her hair was very dry and brittle, and broke easily.  I first used the iron out treatment, to get her hair back to normal and now I just have to maintain it with this shampoo.  It has been 3 years and I&#x27;ve never done a treatment again.  Everyone in the family uses this because I figure the iron is still depositing itself, you just cant see it in our brown hair.  Her hair is much softer and it smells great!</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s all natural and works with the Texas Hill Country hard water.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my beautician.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> Been using these products for over a month, and im really disappointed with the condition of my hair when using this. Shampoo is very harsh. Ive tried using the shampoo with other conditioners thinking that maybe the conditioner is not very rich, but even with other conditioners after the shampoo my hair is left dry and ratty, cant even get my fingers through my hair in the shower! And when wet and trying to brush you need to put product in to comb through easily!&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product and I cant 100% say its crap because I don&#x27;t know if i got the true stuff because 1 liter of each should have cost me way  more so idk if that&#x27;s a thing or not...all i know is i was looking for a remedy to the dry/dullness etc of my hair that i thought was caused  by my hard water, BUT THIS IS NOT IT! QUITE THE OPPOSITE!</li>
            <li> I have really bad well water, and using this does help. Cause my water is so bad i can smell the metalic smell after i use it. But great price snd the bottles are huge</li>
            <li> a family member told  me about this product. This is not much of the best way to describe it But  Amazing really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;after the first 2 times of using it I notice a great difference in my hair an how it feels. Just a reminder it doesn&#x27;t take much.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Please also see my review for Malibu C Hard Water Weekly Demineralizer. You&#x27;ll want to start with that, then follow up with these great products. If your hair is rusty, dry, and lifeless from shampooing with well water, then please do yourself a big favor and buy these. You will be relieved to see the results.</li>
            <li> I have well water and have just started using this product. So far there seems to be a difference but still too early to really say for sure</li>
            <li> Very helpful with my rusty water. Still need to have Malibu treatment s, but not as often.</li>
            <li> Just moved into a new place and we have horribly hard well water. It smells of sulphur and leaves a film on your skin after washing hands or showering. I am a natural blonde and after only two showers could already see the orange hue it was turning my hair. It dulled my hair and left it feeling heavy and with the same film as on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malibu Hard Water Wellness was recommended to me by a friend, so I tried it. After only one use, I can already feel and see a difference! My hair is softer and lighter, and the orange hue is gone. It feels almost like a leave-in conditioner. I haven&#x27;t felt my hair this soft in quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been warned that if used too often this may dry out your hair, but that is true of just about any product. Don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday, with this or anything else! (It&#x27;s just bad for your hair, strips the natural oils away.) But seriously, this stuff is amazing and I am so glad to have my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li> i recently bought this shampoo for my wife. we live in an area with hard water, and she complained of the effects of the water on her hair, such as dryness and an &amp;#34;orange-y tint&amp;#34; (even though she doesn&#x27;t have color-treated hair. this shampoo and conditioner set alleviated those issues. she washes her hair daily with the shampoo and lets the conditioner rest on her hair for a few minutes before washing it out. her hair is no longer dry, but she has also started using a leave-in conditioner in conjunction with the new shampoo. after a month&#x27;s use, she&#x27;s hooked. great product; we will buy again.</li>
            <li> We have hard water.  Wasn&#x27;t getting a lather from my regular shampoo.  Hair didn&#x27;t feel clean.  These products worked great and I repurchased.</li>
            <li> This is the same shampoo and conditioner used in the West Baden Springs Resort and Spa. We use it to remind us of our stay there. It smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Shampoo pump was broken when they arrived. Bonus packet of weekly treatment shown was not included.</li>
            <li> I have very blonde hair and we have owned our home for about a year and a half.  The iron bacteria content in our water was turning my hair more orange day by day.  It was awful!  I bought the shampoo, conditioner, and the weekly treatment packets (you really must use these too) and have been extremely happy with the results.  I am not sure if these products would necessarily remove orange, but immediately following my latest color treatment which did remove orange tint I began using these products.  And voila,  orange stays away!  A few tips- the products are stripping minerals out (chelating) so they are drying to my bleached hair,  so I use a deep conditioner after, once per week.  Also, use cool water to wet and rinse every time, whether you use this product that day or not.  This helps the cuticle not open up as much and take on as much minerals.  I use shamp/cond twice per week and the dry packet of Hard Water powder once per week.</li>
            <li> The conditioner left my hair too greasy. I have fine hair and it builds up. The shampoo works good though.</li>
            <li> I so worried about our water as we just shocked our well and had brown water for two days. Searched and found this product and had to give it a try to save my newly highlighted hair. In the past, when I had gone blonder, my hair turned orange, my husband actually called me Rusty for a while. Actually tried it and LOVE it!. Hair is softer and still blonde! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The product works well.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff works really good :)</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.  I have very hard water in Illinois.  I could not even comb my hair after using this product.  I did like the scent.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and works great</li>
            <li> I love the product,it does a great job for my beautiful lady.her hair  looks  and feels better using your combo.</li>
            <li> Having well water and not a water softener was causing my hair to be discolored.  My hairdresser recommended this product.  She said I do not have to use it all the time but it helps to wash my hair with it prior to getting my foils/roots done.  Worked great!</li>
            <li> My family and I love this product.  The size of the bottles keep us from having to buy every month, which is great.</li>
            <li> Love the softness and silkiness feel of my hair after shampooing with Malibu ! What a difference it made with hard water!</li>
            <li> You cannot beat the price on these! If your a blonde and have hard water these are a must and I do not believe you&#x27;ll find them any cheaper.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, genuine product. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out!  Sent back.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work but makes my hair very dry even with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. it really works! but very expensive!</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo.  Conditioner also works well.  Great shampoo for avoiding or getting rid of buildup.  I also highly recommend the Malibu treatment packets</li>
            <li> Great items!  Perfect for my high school swimmer.</li>
            <li> I have horribly rusty well water, but do have a softener.  Even with that, the streaks I put in my hair are gone within three weeks or less of having them done.  I really expected them to last much longer by using Malibu shampoo and conditioner, but I really can&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s doing much.  Honestly, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.  I think I&#x27;m going to buy the crystals, which might be more powerful, and dump them in the shampoo and let it dissolve and maybe that will give it an extra boost.  I actually had more luck with plain lemon juice, but that&#x27;s hard on the hair.  I know other people rave about Malibu and maybe it&#x27;s really just my icky water, so I don&#x27;t want to be totally critical.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, and it has lasted for months!  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement in my hair the first time I used this. I hate my well water, but this makes it so much more bearable.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week...leaves hair dry. I do NOT like the pump on the shampoo...hardly anything comes out..i have to take the entire lid off to get any shampoo.</li>
            <li> great shampoo if you live in areas of hard water</li>
