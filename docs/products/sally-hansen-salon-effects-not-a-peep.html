            <li>Really cute design.</li>
            <li>The birds are not as noticeable, so your nail will look mostly silver</li>
            <li>with the product.&lt;br /&gt;very cute</li>
            <li>Most of the strips were unusable; they would stick to the outer plastic.</li>
            <li>I love using them</li>
            <li>I love sally hansen nail stuff</li>
            <li>I use these stickers a lot, these are cute and seasonal.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand of nail stickers.  </li>
            <li>i got this for my youngest grand daughter</li>
            <li>I love using the Salon effects.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to give them a try with ones that aren&#x27;t old because the reviews are always so good!</li>
            <li>super duper cute, can&#x27;t wait to rock these for the spring!</li>
            <li>cute and lasted 3 weeks very cool</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of practice to master application but lots of cute designs available.  </li>
            <li>Easy application.</li>
            <li>It was really easy to do</li>
            <li>The not only look great</li>
            <li>They are quick &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>Makes it sooo worth it!</li>
            <li>wear if initial application is good.</li>
            <li>The pattern was cute, and other reviews of this product were so good - these strips were just old and the adhesive no longer was sticky.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen got it right when they started making these nail strips.</li>
            <li>Overall, I will try it again with a brighter pattern and maybe apply a top coat.</li>
            <li>This is really pretty</li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>They always go on great and stay for at least five days.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these things &amp; I am like a walking commercial for them...</li>
            <li>First I</li>
            <li>Love the ease of putting them on and taking them off with regular nail polish, hard to go back to regular polish, too many cute designs and no drying time!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Dry polish won&#x27;t stick to nails cracks in pieces:-)</li>
            <li>Came in a closed box and arrived in good condition, however for some reason they it didn&#x27;t stick very well on the nail, I&#x27;ve used these products before and they usually last from 1 to 2 weeks</li>
            <li>but you have to really look at the design to see the animals.</li>
            <li>They are real polish (you can smell it).</li>
            <li>This color or pattern is actually different than I expected, they are like little birds or chicks (perfect for easter).</li>
            <li>she just love them their not easy to come off</li>
            <li>Only by the bright or dark color ones!!!</li>
            <li>but they last a long time and do not chip easily.  </li>
            <li>and it is not messy at all!</li>
            <li>I think they were just old</li>
            <li>They were super thin as well and chipped right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is not a good design to start using salon effects since any error is more obvious due to the solid color.</li>

            <li> It was also very hard to take it off my nails.</li>
            <li> The stickers didn&#x27;t stick on my nails at all, you could hardly see the birds, it was just kinda lame.</li>
            <li> The design was difficult to see against the metalic background.</li>
            <li> But their so expensive to buy at a store.  </li>

            <li> This item was very cute! Came in a closed box and arrived in good condition, however for some reason they it didn&#x27;t stick very well on the nail, I&#x27;ve used these products before and they usually last from 1 to 2 weeks but this one started peeling off the same day.</li>

            <li> These nail strips are amazing! They last at least 8 days or longer depending on how much you do. They are quick &amp; easy to use. There is no product like these on the market. The bird pattern was just adorable!</li>
            <li> I bought these and was so disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#x27;t have enough adhesive to stick to the nail, and were too messy. They didn&#x27;t work and were defective. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Dry polish won&#x27;t stick to nails cracks in pieces:-)</li>
            <li> Too cute, can&#x27;t wait till Easter to wear them. Love the ease of putting them on and taking them off with regular nail polish, hard to go back to regular polish, too many cute designs and no drying time!!!!!!</li>

            <li> I love the product! I will purchase more in the future. It was really easy to do and it is not messy at all!</li>
            <li> The stickers didn&#x27;t stick on my nails at all, you could hardly see the birds, it was just kinda lame.</li>
            <li> Once again-  you get way you pay for. These were under $5... they retail for about $12-$15. The pattern was cute, and other reviews of this product were so good - these strips were just old and the adhesive no longer was sticky. I&#x27;ll have to give them a try with ones that aren&#x27;t old because the reviews are always so good!</li>
            <li> Most of the strips were unusable; they would stick to the outer plastic. I&#x27;ve used these for years so it wasn&#x27;t my error. I think they were just old</li>
            <li> Loved these for the spring time! There were enough stickers to do all of my fingers and toes. Very cute!</li>
            <li> Very easy to put on. Look great</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen got it right when they started making these nail strips. They always go on great and stay for at least five days.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these things &amp; I am like a walking commercial for them... This color or pattern is actually different than I expected, they are like little birds or chicks (perfect for easter).</li>
            <li> I recently started using nail strips. I love using them but, I hate spending so much on them when I go to the stores. The not only look great but, they were well priced. I would denelty recommend these to any one that like nail art.</li>
            <li> I love sally hansen nail stuff but this one suuucks. Do not get the light color ones!! First I though this had a white background, its actually silver. And the design does not.stand out against the silver. The hubby couldn&#x27;t even tell they were birds. They were super thin as well and chipped right away. Looked thin and cheap. Only by the bright or dark color ones!!!</li>
            <li> I use these stickers a lot, these are cute and seasonal.  These take practice to make them look good but they last a long time and do not chip easily.  I love this brand of nail stickers.  They are real polish (you can smell it).</li>
            <li> i got this for my youngest grand daughter she like anomals&lt;br /&gt;and she just love them their not easy to come off</li>
            <li> I love using the Salon effects.  But their so expensive to buy at a store.  So it was awesome to be able to get them offline at a cheaper price.  Makes it sooo worth it!</li>
