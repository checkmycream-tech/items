            <li>good job at cleaning between teeth</li>
            <li>Good tool.</li>
            <li>vendor shipped them in on-time as promised with good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use these instead of flossing, as they are superior to any type of floss.</li>
            <li>Also good for cleaning between teeth.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t stand floss, good alternative</li>
            <li>They are great and much more user freindly than tooth picks.</li>
            <li>great better than toothbrushes cheaper by month</li>
            <li>This is a great deal to be able to buy them in bulk, too.</li>
            <li>the price is right and the product is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Love these and my dentist likes the results!</li>
            <li>With the help of this product, I discovered it was a piece of husk ( I love grains!)</li>
            <li>Make sure you&#x27;re paying attention to the quantity when you purchase these!</li>
            <li>I think they are better than tooth picks!</li>
            <li>great though bends easy at times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what you can miss even though you&#x27;ve flossed.  </li>
            <li>but this is nice</li>
            <li>Liked the product and it was sent in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>My fault for misunderstanding the label but it might be nice to do the math for people</li>
            <li>Break very easy...</li>
            <li>When they&#x27;re new, they feel wonderful, the stimulate the gums and really clean the bottom space between your teeth.</li>
            <li>Each one self contained package with protective top.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when these are finished.</li>
            <li>NOT a substitute for floss, since you&#x27;d not be able to get them between the tops of your teeth, though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had issues with both teeth and gums, but once I started using this product, I&#x27;ve gotten MUCH better checkups at the dentists office.</li>
            <li>I wish they sold a version that had a more rigid wire from which the bristles are attached.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE these.</li>
            <li>and they work better than floss.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more substantial brush.  </li>
            <li>Have used one every day for 6 months (we&#x27;ll almost every day :-)</li>
            <li>all I do is  make sure that I keep one of the brushes in my pocket and keep cleaning that</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>my review helped you, please click on \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; and thank you for reading my review.  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them since July 2012 and love them.</li>
            <li>These are lovely.  </li>
            <li>Do a better job than toothpicks.  </li>
            <li>They work better than dental floss to remove food  </li>
            <li>I think they work better than flossing between your teeth</li>
            <li>this product gets in between the teeth and gets the food out better.</li>
            <li>This is way better than flossing.</li>
            <li>So much better than a toothpick</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended these and they remove many food particles that my toothbrush misses.  </li>
            <li>I do use them more than once, just running it under water after each use.  </li>
            <li>good product make sure you order right size</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t imagine how someone could clean his/her teeth with</li>
            <li>Very good in general .</li>
            <li>They go easily between teeth much better than tooth picks and are much more convenient than floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never been the best a remembering to floss, however I&#x27;m a \\&quot;brush twice a day\\&quot; kinda gal, which has kept my cavity free my entire life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying to stop flossing, use these in addition to get the cleanest clean you can!</li>
            <li>So I NEED to keep my Teeth CLEAN!</li>
            <li>These are very pricey at the store so this was a really good price buying a 6 pack.  </li>
            <li>Easy does it when inserting (Per my Dentist-don&#x27;t force it in between your teeth)</li>
            <li>The Dentek easy brushers for me are gun savers.</li>
            <li>(Honestly, though, the fact that the metal gives and the brush bends is probably a safety feature, as I was willing to try forcing it, and if it didn&#x27;t bend, I might have poked a hole in my gums.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>x 10 per bag is a fine value.  </li>
            <li>Perfect because it&#x27;s the one for TIGHT SPACES.</li>
            <li>These are the perfect thing for getting between teeth if you have tight spaces like I do.</li>
            <li>I think having a large package of picks with one interchangeable cover head for the current pic in use is the best situation.</li>
            <li>some are huge.</li>
            <li>When I discovered that these Dentek brushes were available from Amazon, I had found the solution to cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li>The dentist recommended I try Dentek Easy Brush to get a deeper clean between the teeth</li>
            <li>The tapered end does not always fit in between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Awesome item for teeth with very tight spaces.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my aunt, she has some issues with her teeth and gums, and according to her these are fantastic to clean her mouth without hurting her gums.</li>
            <li>For me the Dentek \\&quot;Easy Brush\\&quot; is better thsn flossing as it massages the gum line as it gently cleans between your teeth.</li>
            <li>These are more expensive than some simular products on the market, but convenient and excellent to be able to carry one or two in purse or pocket.  </li>
            <li>The results are worth it!</li>
            <li>I like using these interdental brushes to clean my teeth after eating.  </li>
            <li>very good item, i love it, just be careful, its big than most size i have had.</li>
            <li>I am hesitant to insert the metal shaft even though the package specifies a special wire coating.</li>
            <li>I could no longer find them locally, I turned to Amazon and got a good price.</li>
            <li>Good quality and used daily</li>
            <li>can only use on one tooth and it is bent.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good item at all?</li>
            <li>Fact is, I heard great things about this product from friends-of-friends, and hoped they would work even more effectively than floss (which I use regularly), but alas, in the end, they wouldn&#x27;t fit between many of my teeth (whereas floss does).</li>
            <li>I have tried most if not all of the several available such pocket brushes-this is by far the best and very economical.</li>
            <li>He goes through them quickly</li>
            <li>Cleans quickly between the teeth.</li>
            <li>They are very practical and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The DenTek easy brush has made cleaning between my teeth an absolute no brainer.</li>
            <li>I have tried many dental brushes and always come back to DenTek&#x27;s Easy Brushes.  </li>
            <li>They both do a great job for tight places.</li>
            <li>hard to find in my area, so was glad to find a large quantity for a great price.  </li>
            <li>Good addition to dental hygiene, simply put, these really work.</li>
            <li>i was introduced to this unique product by my dental hygienist who used it after my cleaning to be certain that all &amp;#34; residue&amp;#34; was removed.</li>
            <li>I bought these with the understanding that they would clean like dental floss only better</li>
            <li>These fit between my teeth near the gumline and clean almost as well as the dental floss, and they don&#x27;t come apart in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are great to keep in your pocket, especially when you have alot of dental work done and you need to constantly worry about having food caught between your teeth.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and can be used several times.</li>
            <li>They are just as good as the competition (GUM), but still a little flimsy for me.  </li>
            <li>You might think that a good flossing and a proper brushing are all you need, but these little guys pull out even more stuff -- and you know they&#x27;re working because you can see it all.  </li>
            <li>So I was hesitant at first at trying this brand.  </li>
            <li>The price is much better than any I have found locally.</li>
            <li>For the first time, the dentist did not complain about my son&#x27;s teeth after using these every day.</li>
            <li>Sterilize with instant hand sanitizer so you can use many times.</li>
            <li>These are way better priced (I think around 33 cents each) and have the added benefit of being cone shaped - which means different sized gaps between teeth can be cleaned with just one size of brush.</li>
            <li>Even after flossing, I cannot believe how much material was still stuck in-between my teeth!</li>
            <li>They remove placque and food in seconds and your mouth really feels fresh after use.</li>
            <li>I have been having a hard time finding this particular brand and style and was delighted to find them available through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>if you have very thigt teeth the little wire twist and it wont work nicely, by the other side is a good product</li>
            <li>This is the most fabulous product in the world for flossing your teeth - they are really narrow and when your teeth are compacted closely together</li>
            <li>I go to the dentist they are also very pleased on my efforts in working on those trouble spots.  </li>
            <li>Good small toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It takes only 2 or 3 uses before the wire just bends too easily.</li>
            <li>These are easy to keep in your pockets and such.</li>
            <li>This product will certainly do in the meantime.</li>
            <li>And you can&#x27;t really force these (which I was willing to try to do), because they&#x27;ll just bend and you&#x27;ll honestly just have wasted that brush (</li>
            <li>/&gt;For the first time in my life, flossing (or something akin to it) doesn&#x27;t leave me asking if it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I hate tooth flossing, so these are just perfect for cleaning between the teeth, and they are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re supposed to be able to reuse them, but by the time I&#x27;ve used them once, the metal has gotten so flimsy and weak that I&#x27;d only be able to use it if I had huge gaps in my teeth.</li>
            <li>I feel like I really need it.</li>
            <li>The bristles are gentle and thorough.</li>
            <li>I use them, but I don;t really like them.  </li>
            <li>Used at my hygienist&#x27; s directions (and insistence), I am really cleaning my mouth and working on improving ailing gums.  </li>
            <li>A bit of practice is needed in order to use these comfortably and establish them as part of daily routine.  </li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s so much easier than flossing</li>
            <li>and my teeth feel so much cleaner after I use these.</li>
            <li>Once I started using this, my dentist visits have been so much easier and the dentist comments on how much my gums have improved and to keep up whatever I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>and they have made a real difference.</li>
            <li>My son really likes using these with his braces.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR YOUR PROMPTNESS.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this product, I expected that I would be able to use it like floss.</li>
            <li>so they go fast.</li>
            <li>this is is a Godsend and far better than regular string floss.</li>
            <li>To some extent, you might feel tempted to blame my teeth (and shame on you if you do, haha), but I do have relatively straight teeth and have already been through braces and retainers (though they still shifted slightly back toward their original position after all that was done).</li>
            <li>this is very helpful specially after i eat outside.</li>
            <li>Very usefull particularly when you are out of home or you are using brackets.</li>
            <li>My daughter recently got braces and wanted something to help clean between them that just brushing alone can&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li>I have deep pockets and this product helps me keep those areas clean until I go in for my dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li>These really work and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>nice to have a small bush between teeth:D</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, what I thought was my teeth rotting was actually just plaque buildup (EW!).</li>
            <li>Ordering in this larger quantity is not only cheaper, but gives me a better reserve.</li>
            <li>The little brushes are very cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>I normally buy the GUM proxabrush go-betweens.</li>
            <li>You can floss on the go after snacks and meals when normal flossing is not an option.     </li>
            <li>It can remove a debris between your teeth when normal toothbrush cannot perform that function.</li>
            <li>/&gt;spend a few cents more for them</li>
            <li>I order a bundle every few years, as they seem to disappear as time goes on. :-).</li>
            <li>My husband can&#x27;t seem to live without these.  </li>
            <li>The Vons where I live used to carry them, but when me and another disgruntled customer were bemoaning the fact that they no longer carried them, I went looking in Amazon.</li>
            <li>Live and learn...</li>
            <li>The first several times we used them, there was a lot of bleeding.</li>
            <li>i was surprised to be told that it could be purchased on-line!</li>
            <li>I have been using these brushes for a few years and really like the way they clean my teeth, gums, etc.</li>
            <li>though it states that these brushes are for tight spaces, I am unwilling to fit them between some of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Large enough handle to grab hold of.  </li>
            <li>These are far cheaper.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Soft Picks.</li>
            <li>Floss frequently cuts my gums, and it&#x27;s darned awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They really helped with a crevice left from the extraction of a wisdom tooth.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>bending it back doesn&#x27;t really work because the metal core of the brush is already weakened from being bent).</li>
            <li>At the dentist for my 6 month checkup, the staff introduced me to the soft picks/brushes.</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY CONVENIENT TO HAVE THE ABOVE SENT TO ME</li>
            <li>I got this info directly from Dentek.</li>
            <li>this and Natural Dentist mouth rinse helped my gums.</li>
            <li>My dental specialist told me that I needed to be extra careful to clean between my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for a long time, and it&#x27;s really convenient to carry one around in my pocket in case I catch something between my teeth during a meal.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, the one they gave me as a sample, I haven&#x27;t been able to find anywhere else since then, but these are a pretty close second place to them.  </li>
            <li>so they know they are clear in knowing that they are ordering 60 brushes total with each quantity order of 1.</li>
            <li>considering this package barely weighs an ounce, don&#x27;t say it&#x27;s for the postage.</li>
            <li>Important to consider the space you have between teeths  to make a correct election on the thick of the brush since there are 2 sizes.</li>
            <li>NO EXCUSE FOR THIS PRICE -</li>
            <li>, in short, I have no idea how you&#x27;re going to confirm this before using these, but only use these if your teeth are properly spaced (which is to say, not super exactly snug against each other).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>There are many products out there like this, but the slightly beveled profile allows easier access to those hard to reach areas between teeth.</li>
            <li>Even if the website picture shows the old plain brushes, if you order them you will be sent the new, fluoride+mint poison variety.</li>

            <li> the price is right and the product is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love these and my dentist likes the results!</li>
            <li> With the help of this product, I discovered it was a piece of husk ( I love grains!)</li>
            <li> Make sure you&#x27;re paying attention to the quantity when you purchase these!</li>
            <li> I think they are better than tooth picks!</li>
            <li> great though bends easy at times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what you can miss even though you&#x27;ve flossed.  </li>
            <li> but this is nice</li>
            <li> Liked the product and it was sent in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> My fault for misunderstanding the label but it might be nice to do the math for people</li>
            <li> Break very easy...</li>
            <li> When they&#x27;re new, they feel wonderful, the stimulate the gums and really clean the bottom space between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Each one self contained package with protective top.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when these are finished.</li>
            <li> NOT a substitute for floss, since you&#x27;d not be able to get them between the tops of your teeth, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with both teeth and gums, but once I started using this product, I&#x27;ve gotten MUCH better checkups at the dentists office.</li>
            <li> I wish they sold a version that had a more rigid wire from which the bristles are attached.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE these.</li>
            <li> and they work better than floss.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more substantial brush.  </li>
            <li> Have used one every day for 6 months (we&#x27;ll almost every day :-)</li>
            <li> all I do is  make sure that I keep one of the brushes in my pocket and keep cleaning that</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> my review helped you, please click on \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; and thank you for reading my review.  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them since July 2012 and love them.</li>
            <li> These are lovely.  </li>
            <li> Do a better job than toothpicks.  </li>
            <li> They work better than dental floss to remove food  </li>
            <li> I think they work better than flossing between your teeth</li>
            <li> this product gets in between the teeth and gets the food out better.</li>
            <li> This is way better than flossing.</li>
            <li> So much better than a toothpick</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these and they remove many food particles that my toothbrush misses.  </li>
            <li> I do use them more than once, just running it under water after each use.  </li>
            <li> good product make sure you order right size</li>
            <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t imagine how someone could clean his/her teeth with</li>
            <li> Very good in general .</li>
            <li> They go easily between teeth much better than tooth picks and are much more convenient than floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never been the best a remembering to floss, however I&#x27;m a \\&quot;brush twice a day\\&quot; kinda gal, which has kept my cavity free my entire life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying to stop flossing, use these in addition to get the cleanest clean you can!</li>
            <li> So I NEED to keep my Teeth CLEAN!</li>
            <li> These are very pricey at the store so this was a really good price buying a 6 pack.  </li>
            <li> Easy does it when inserting (Per my Dentist-don&#x27;t force it in between your teeth)</li>
            <li> The Dentek easy brushers for me are gun savers.</li>
            <li> (Honestly, though, the fact that the metal gives and the brush bends is probably a safety feature, as I was willing to try forcing it, and if it didn&#x27;t bend, I might have poked a hole in my gums.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> x 10 per bag is a fine value.  </li>
            <li> Perfect because it&#x27;s the one for TIGHT SPACES.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect thing for getting between teeth if you have tight spaces like I do.</li>
            <li> I think having a large package of picks with one interchangeable cover head for the current pic in use is the best situation.</li>
            <li> some are huge.</li>
            <li> When I discovered that these Dentek brushes were available from Amazon, I had found the solution to cleaning between my teeth.</li>
            <li> The dentist recommended I try Dentek Easy Brush to get a deeper clean between the teeth</li>
            <li> The tapered end does not always fit in between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome item for teeth with very tight spaces.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my aunt, she has some issues with her teeth and gums, and according to her these are fantastic to clean her mouth without hurting her gums.</li>
            <li> For me the Dentek \\&quot;Easy Brush\\&quot; is better thsn flossing as it massages the gum line as it gently cleans between your teeth.</li>
            <li> These are more expensive than some simular products on the market, but convenient and excellent to be able to carry one or two in purse or pocket.  </li>
            <li> The results are worth it!</li>
            <li> I like using these interdental brushes to clean my teeth after eating.  </li>
            <li> very good item, i love it, just be careful, its big than most size i have had.</li>
            <li> I am hesitant to insert the metal shaft even though the package specifies a special wire coating.</li>
            <li> I could no longer find them locally, I turned to Amazon and got a good price.</li>
            <li> Good quality and used daily</li>
            <li> can only use on one tooth and it is bent.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good item at all?</li>
            <li> Fact is, I heard great things about this product from friends-of-friends, and hoped they would work even more effectively than floss (which I use regularly), but alas, in the end, they wouldn&#x27;t fit between many of my teeth (whereas floss does).</li>
            <li> I have tried most if not all of the several available such pocket brushes-this is by far the best and very economical.</li>
            <li> He goes through them quickly</li>
            <li> Cleans quickly between the teeth.</li>
            <li> They are very practical and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The DenTek easy brush has made cleaning between my teeth an absolute no brainer.</li>
            <li> I have tried many dental brushes and always come back to DenTek&#x27;s Easy Brushes.  </li>
            <li> They both do a great job for tight places.</li>
            <li> hard to find in my area, so was glad to find a large quantity for a great price.  </li>
            <li> Good addition to dental hygiene, simply put, these really work.</li>
            <li> i was introduced to this unique product by my dental hygienist who used it after my cleaning to be certain that all &amp;#34; residue&amp;#34; was removed.</li>
            <li> I bought these with the understanding that they would clean like dental floss only better</li>
            <li> These fit between my teeth near the gumline and clean almost as well as the dental floss, and they don&#x27;t come apart in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are great to keep in your pocket, especially when you have alot of dental work done and you need to constantly worry about having food caught between your teeth.</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and can be used several times.</li>
            <li> They are just as good as the competition (GUM), but still a little flimsy for me.  </li>
            <li> You might think that a good flossing and a proper brushing are all you need, but these little guys pull out even more stuff -- and you know they&#x27;re working because you can see it all.  </li>
            <li> So I was hesitant at first at trying this brand.  </li>
            <li> The price is much better than any I have found locally.</li>
            <li> For the first time, the dentist did not complain about my son&#x27;s teeth after using these every day.</li>
            <li> Sterilize with instant hand sanitizer so you can use many times.</li>
            <li> These are way better priced (I think around 33 cents each) and have the added benefit of being cone shaped - which means different sized gaps between teeth can be cleaned with just one size of brush.</li>
            <li> Even after flossing, I cannot believe how much material was still stuck in-between my teeth!</li>
            <li> They remove placque and food in seconds and your mouth really feels fresh after use.</li>
            <li> I have been having a hard time finding this particular brand and style and was delighted to find them available through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> if you have very thigt teeth the little wire twist and it wont work nicely, by the other side is a good product</li>
            <li> This is the most fabulous product in the world for flossing your teeth - they are really narrow and when your teeth are compacted closely together</li>
            <li> I go to the dentist they are also very pleased on my efforts in working on those trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> Good small toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It takes only 2 or 3 uses before the wire just bends too easily.</li>
            <li> These are easy to keep in your pockets and such.</li>
            <li> This product will certainly do in the meantime.</li>
            <li> And you can&#x27;t really force these (which I was willing to try to do), because they&#x27;ll just bend and you&#x27;ll honestly just have wasted that brush (</li>
            <li> /&gt;For the first time in my life, flossing (or something akin to it) doesn&#x27;t leave me asking if it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I hate tooth flossing, so these are just perfect for cleaning between the teeth, and they are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to be able to reuse them, but by the time I&#x27;ve used them once, the metal has gotten so flimsy and weak that I&#x27;d only be able to use it if I had huge gaps in my teeth.</li>
            <li> I feel like I really need it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are gentle and thorough.</li>
            <li> I use them, but I don;t really like them.  </li>
            <li> Used at my hygienist&#x27; s directions (and insistence), I am really cleaning my mouth and working on improving ailing gums.  </li>
            <li> A bit of practice is needed in order to use these comfortably and establish them as part of daily routine.  </li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s so much easier than flossing</li>
            <li> and my teeth feel so much cleaner after I use these.</li>
            <li> Once I started using this, my dentist visits have been so much easier and the dentist comments on how much my gums have improved and to keep up whatever I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> and they have made a real difference.</li>
            <li> My son really likes using these with his braces.</li>
            <li> VERY WELL</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR YOUR PROMPTNESS.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I expected that I would be able to use it like floss.</li>
            <li> so they go fast.</li>
            <li> this is is a Godsend and far better than regular string floss.</li>
            <li> To some extent, you might feel tempted to blame my teeth (and shame on you if you do, haha), but I do have relatively straight teeth and have already been through braces and retainers (though they still shifted slightly back toward their original position after all that was done).</li>
            <li> this is very helpful specially after i eat outside.</li>
            <li> Very usefull particularly when you are out of home or you are using brackets.</li>
            <li> My daughter recently got braces and wanted something to help clean between them that just brushing alone can&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li> I have deep pockets and this product helps me keep those areas clean until I go in for my dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li> These really work and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> nice to have a small bush between teeth:D</li>
            <li> Lucky for me, what I thought was my teeth rotting was actually just plaque buildup (EW!).</li>
            <li> Ordering in this larger quantity is not only cheaper, but gives me a better reserve.</li>
            <li> The little brushes are very cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> I normally buy the GUM proxabrush go-betweens.</li>
            <li> You can floss on the go after snacks and meals when normal flossing is not an option.     </li>
            <li> It can remove a debris between your teeth when normal toothbrush cannot perform that function.</li>
            <li> /&gt;spend a few cents more for them</li>
            <li> I order a bundle every few years, as they seem to disappear as time goes on. :-).</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t seem to live without these.  </li>
            <li> The Vons where I live used to carry them, but when me and another disgruntled customer were bemoaning the fact that they no longer carried them, I went looking in Amazon.</li>
            <li> Live and learn...</li>
            <li> The first several times we used them, there was a lot of bleeding.</li>
            <li> i was surprised to be told that it could be purchased on-line!</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for a few years and really like the way they clean my teeth, gums, etc.</li>
            <li> though it states that these brushes are for tight spaces, I am unwilling to fit them between some of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Large enough handle to grab hold of.  </li>
            <li> These are far cheaper.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Soft Picks.</li>
            <li> Floss frequently cuts my gums, and it&#x27;s darned awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They really helped with a crevice left from the extraction of a wisdom tooth.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> bending it back doesn&#x27;t really work because the metal core of the brush is already weakened from being bent).</li>
            <li> At the dentist for my 6 month checkup, the staff introduced me to the soft picks/brushes.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY CONVENIENT TO HAVE THE ABOVE SENT TO ME</li>
            <li> I got this info directly from Dentek.</li>
            <li> this and Natural Dentist mouth rinse helped my gums.</li>
            <li> My dental specialist told me that I needed to be extra careful to clean between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a long time, and it&#x27;s really convenient to carry one around in my pocket in case I catch something between my teeth during a meal.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, the one they gave me as a sample, I haven&#x27;t been able to find anywhere else since then, but these are a pretty close second place to them.  </li>
            <li> so they know they are clear in knowing that they are ordering 60 brushes total with each quantity order of 1.</li>
            <li> considering this package barely weighs an ounce, don&#x27;t say it&#x27;s for the postage.</li>
            <li> Important to consider the space you have between teeths  to make a correct election on the thick of the brush since there are 2 sizes.</li>
            <li> NO EXCUSE FOR THIS PRICE -</li>
            <li> , in short, I have no idea how you&#x27;re going to confirm this before using these, but only use these if your teeth are properly spaced (which is to say, not super exactly snug against each other).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> There are many products out there like this, but the slightly beveled profile allows easier access to those hard to reach areas between teeth.</li>
            <li> Even if the website picture shows the old plain brushes, if you order them you will be sent the new, fluoride+mint poison variety.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the dentist give me a few other options as samples after my check-ups, since first using these...</li>
            <li> nice but a little expensive for just 10.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised when I received these because it seems that they were much less substantial than DenTek brushes I had used before.  </li>
            <li> I have periodontal disease and this has held off progression of the disease for a long time now.</li>
            <li> there also alot so it lasts long</li>
            <li> I tried these as an alternative to my normal G.U.M Soft Picks and while they are sturdier they are also a bit harsher (inflexible) on your gums if you happen to miss getting between your teeth or under a bridge.  </li>
            <li> However, it should be noted that those very thin last very little since they broke very easy after 3 or 4 times of use.</li>
            <li> The sample my dentist gave me was a little too big for my tiny tooth spaces and got caught between two of my teeth.</li>
            <li> but now they are ONLY available coated in poisonous fluoride and with added artificial flavor.</li>
            <li> The metal is too thick to glide between the teeth and too flimsy to brush any particular spot on the tooth.</li>
            <li> They bend after the first use because of the poor quality&lt;br /&gt;Wire</li>
            <li> They do tend to bend a little at times but they do last longer than a single use.</li>
            <li> difference.&lt;br /&gt;These do the same job and just as well as the tight gum go-betweens.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested them due to gaps between my teeth</li>
            <li> none of the other options have been as satisfactory to me.</li>
            <li> These little brushes really do a nice job of cleaning at the base of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> At least they are always in stock and not just another empty hook at your local drug or grocery store.</li>
            <li> And all 6 packs are inside another sealed plastic bag, so the brushes can&#x27;t be seen until you open at least the outer bag.  </li>
            <li> flexible so you can bend them to get into tight places.</li>
            <li> TO GET IN THE TIGHT SPACES.  </li>
            <li> i have a few teeth where the brush would not fit, so flossing was my other option!</li>

            <li> My teeth tend to flare slightly, narrower at the gumline than they are at the crown, which makes flossing difficult because the floss tends to start to pull apart as I work my way along, and I sometimes end up with long filaments of dental floss caught in my teeth as a result.  </li>

            <li> The plastic floss sticks are cave-man level compared to these - the small fiber bristles on these DenTek flossing stix</li>
            <li> You can get these at a nameless discount department store for under $4 - and it&#x27;s a bigger package.</li>
            <li> I feel sad having to give this product only two stars.</li>
            <li> These are so small, why bother?  </li>
            <li> They are also small so you can carry one or two in your pocket or purse, so you will have them when you need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the metal wire at the middle of the brush is too thick, and the brush is a bit too hard.</li>
            <li> The price is hard to beat anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Each brush usually lasts for three uses - after that the thin wire bows and is unusable.</li>
            <li> These actually work at removing those little annoying food particles.</li>
            <li> These were less expensive</li>
            <li> Wish these were less expensive.</li>
            <li> They can be difficult to get in between teeth, but keep trying.</li>
            <li> Well, these are a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> They have betrayed their customers in favor of the evil fluoride industry.</li>

            <li> I normally buy the GUM proxabrush go-betweens. So I was hesitant at first at trying this brand.  These were less expensive so I decided to try them  .  I will be getting these from now on. The DenTek is as good as the Gum brand. Too me there is no difference. They both do a great job for tight places. I actually saw no difference.&lt;br /&gt;The only difference is the price. These are far cheaper. These are well made and if I were to do a double blind study I would not have known the difference.&lt;br /&gt;These do the same job and just as well as the tight gum go-betweens.</li>
            <li> Very usefull particularly when you are out of home or you are using brackets. Important to consider the space you have between teeths  to make a correct election on the thick of the brush since there are 2 sizes. However, it should be noted that those very thin last very little since they broke very easy after 3 or 4 times of use.</li>

            <li> When in the States two years ago I found a retailer selling Den Tek mini brushes. I purchased a number of packets and have not been without them ever since. I had almost run out of them only to discover I could buy them on Amazon. They are great and much more user freindly than tooth picks. I keep one in my pocket all of the time.</li>
            <li> The little brushes are very cheap and flimsy. They bend after the first use because of the poor quality&lt;br /&gt;Wire the brushes are made with. One use through one tooth and the brushes was bolo gee usable.&lt;br /&gt;AWFUL PRODUCT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this order.</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t seem to live without these.  They are great when you aren&#x27;t home to get to floss and a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought these with the understanding that they would clean like dental floss only better yet I don&#x27;t see how that can be if you can&#x27;t even get them to run between your teeth. The metal is too thick to glide between the teeth and too flimsy to brush any particular spot on the tooth. I suppose if you have really big gaps in you teeth they may work well, otherwise save your money and try something else.</li>
            <li> These are more expensive than some simular products on the market, but convenient and excellent to be able to carry one or two in purse or pocket.  Each one self contained package with protective top.</li>
            <li> Perfect because it&#x27;s the one for TIGHT SPACES. I will buy more when these are finished.</li>
            <li> Good addition to dental hygiene, simply put, these really work.</li>
            <li> I was hospitalized with a bacterial infection, streptococcus Mutans, which turns out to be a self generated infection, because everyone has that bacteria in their mouth. My dental specialist told me that I needed to be extra careful to clean between my teeth. When I discovered that these Dentek brushes were available from Amazon, I had found the solution to cleaning between my teeth. I carry one of these brushes with me all the time and when I eat anything, I take time to brush with the dentek brush. My last report from the dentist was that I had almost no plaque accumulation.</li>
            <li> Love these and my dentist likes the results!</li>
            <li> I got like 20 of these for around $4. You&#x27;re supposed to be able to reuse them, but by the time I&#x27;ve used them once, the metal has gotten so flimsy and weak that I&#x27;d only be able to use it if I had huge gaps in my teeth. When they&#x27;re new, they feel wonderful, the stimulate the gums and really clean the bottom space between your teeth. NOT a substitute for floss, since you&#x27;d not be able to get them between the tops of your teeth, though. I&#x27;ll save them for whne I feel like I really need it.</li>
            <li> I have tried most if not all of the several available such pocket brushes-this is by far the best and very economical.Excellent product, good supplier.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this product from Amazon, I realized that the same product being sold at \\&quot;HEB\\&quot; was cheaper, (avg. .27 each with local tax). Great brushes though. Probably will not fit all gaps for the avg. ppl out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with both teeth and gums, but once I started using this product, I&#x27;ve gotten MUCH better checkups at the dentists office. My gum issues have all but disappeared. There are many products out there like this, but the slightly beveled profile allows easier access to those hard to reach areas between teeth. The Vons where I live used to carry them, but when me and another disgruntled customer were bemoaning the fact that they no longer carried them, I went looking in Amazon.</li>
            <li> these items are great for removing plaque from the teeth&lt;br /&gt;about the same price that you would pay in the store but&lt;br /&gt;very convenient to receive in the mail especially with&lt;br /&gt;free shipping. no complaints very happy</li>
            <li> great though bends easy at times.</li>
            <li> For me the Dentek \\&quot;Easy Brush\\&quot; is better thsn flossing as it massages the gum line as it gently cleans between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Dental floss doesn&#x27;t get the job done for me. My gums have receded with age. Floss frequently cuts my gums, and it&#x27;s darned awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These get the job done. I keep one in my pocket at all times. The bristles are gentle and thorough.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect thing for getting between teeth if you have tight spaces like I do. They do tend to bend a little at times but they do last longer than a single use.</li>
            <li> This is the most fabulous product in the world for flossing your teeth - they are really narrow and when your teeth are compacted closely together this is is a Godsend and far better than regular string floss. The plastic floss sticks are cave-man level compared to these - the small fiber bristles on these DenTek flossing stix get into all the crevices, and even around the gum line - although a thorough dental hygienist will tell you there&#x27;s no substitute for getting under the gum line around the sides of teeth with string floss. This product will certainly do in the meantime. You can floss on the go after snacks and meals when normal flossing is not an option.     There is a glaring problem with the product offered here on Amazaon. The price Amazon has listed is OFF THE HOOK. They&#x27;ve gotta be kidding or nuts. You can get these at a nameless discount department store for under $4 - and it&#x27;s a bigger package. You get like 10 or 12. Why the exorbitant fee, Amazon? Shame on you!And considering this package barely weighs an ounce, don&#x27;t say it&#x27;s for the postage. NO EXCUSE FOR THIS PRICE - and if your supplier is ripping you off, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it from them.</li>
            <li> great better than toothbrushes cheaper by month</li>
            <li> Have purchased these in the drug store after being recommended by my dentist.  They work where flossing does not.  They really helped with a crevice left from the extraction of a wisdom tooth.&lt;br /&gt;When I could no longer find them locally, I turned to Amazon and got a good price.</li>
            <li> I feel sad having to give this product only two stars. Fact is, I heard great things about this product from friends-of-friends, and hoped they would work even more effectively than floss (which I use regularly), but alas, in the end, they wouldn&#x27;t fit between many of my teeth (whereas floss does). To some extent, you might feel tempted to blame my teeth (and shame on you if you do, haha), but I do have relatively straight teeth and have already been through braces and retainers (though they still shifted slightly back toward their original position after all that was done). And you can&#x27;t really force these (which I was willing to try to do), because they&#x27;ll just bend and you&#x27;ll honestly just have wasted that brush (bending it back doesn&#x27;t really work because the metal core of the brush is already weakened from being bent). (Honestly, though, the fact that the metal gives and the brush bends is probably a safety feature, as I was willing to try forcing it, and if it didn&#x27;t bend, I might have poked a hole in my gums.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in short, I have no idea how you&#x27;re going to confirm this before using these, but only use these if your teeth are properly spaced (which is to say, not super exactly snug against each other).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I recently decided to try this product again, and had an easier time with them. When they work, they work well (but again, it depends on how tightly/loosely your teeth are packed together). Adding a star.</li>
            <li> My partner got braces and he uses these all the time to pick around them and get stuff out. He goes through them quickly so we bought a bunch to leave in all the cars and home etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Will always carry a packet while traveling , have a couple in bathroom and bedside drawer for essentials</li>
            <li> They are just as good as the competition (GUM), but still a little flimsy for me.  I wish they sold a version that had a more rigid wire from which the bristles are attached.  It takes only 2 or 3 uses before the wire just bends too easily.</li>
            <li> Works well for braces compact not flimsy</li>
            <li> I have periodontal disease and this has held off progression of the disease for a long time now. Not sold at WalMart.</li>
            <li> I like using these interdental brushes to clean my teeth after eating.  I have used the DenTek brushes before and found them to be acceptable.  I prefer the GUM brushes, actually, but they are more expensive.  I was surprised when I received these because it seems that they were much less substantial than DenTek brushes I had used before.  I use them, but I don;t really like them.  I&#x27;ll continue to look for sales on the GUM brushes.</li>
            <li> Easy does it when inserting (Per my Dentist-don&#x27;t force it in between your teeth) If it doesn&#x27;t go in don&#x27;t force it in just Floss.&lt;br /&gt;Very good product make sure you order right size some are huge.</li>
            <li> if you have very thigt teeth the little wire twist and it wont work nicely, by the other side is a good product</li>
            <li> I have been having a hard time finding this particular brand and style and was delighted to find them available through Amazon.  Once again, Amazon has just what I need!</li>
            <li> My daughter recently got braces and wanted something to help clean between them that just brushing alone can&#x27;t do.  These work well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what you can miss even though you&#x27;ve flossed.  Used at my hygienist&#x27; s directions (and insistence), I am really cleaning my mouth and working on improving ailing gums.  A bit of practice is needed in order to use these comfortably and establish them as part of daily routine.  I use them while watching TV!</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been to the dentist in 10 years and was basically convinced my teeth were rotting out of my mouth. Lucky for me, what I thought was my teeth rotting was actually just plaque buildup (EW!). I have never been the best a remembering to floss, however I&#x27;m a \\&quot;brush twice a day\\&quot; kinda gal, which has kept my cavity free my entire life. The dentist recommended I try Dentek Easy Brush to get a deeper clean between the teeth so i ordered the 6 pack and I LOVE these. To me, it&#x27;s so much easier than flossing and my teeth feel so much cleaner after I use these. One suggestion, though, pay attention to the sizes! The sample my dentist gave me was a little too big for my tiny tooth spaces and got caught between two of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a long time, and it&#x27;s really convenient to carry one around in my pocket in case I catch something between my teeth during a meal.  I go through a couple a week, ether by using, losing, leaving in my pocket, or whatever.  Ordering in this larger quantity is not only cheaper, but gives me a better reserve.</li>
            <li> These really work and highly recommend. My dentist suggested them due to gaps between my teeth and they work better than floss. I&#x27;m not saying to stop flossing, use these in addition to get the cleanest clean you can!</li>
            <li> Awesome item for teeth with very tight spaces. I have reordered this item sever all times.</li>
            <li> Once I started using this, my dentist visits have been so much easier and the dentist comments on how much my gums have improved and to keep up whatever I&#x27;m doing. Flossing is hard but this is really easy to brush in-between teeth at the base.</li>
            <li> Good quality and used daily</li>
            <li> Well, these are a disappointment!  I was hoping for a more substantial brush.  These are so small, why bother?  And all 6 packs are inside another sealed plastic bag, so the brushes can&#x27;t be seen until you open at least the outer bag.  Thus, can&#x27;t send them back.  Live and learn...bah humbug.</li>
            <li> I hate tooth flossing, so these are just perfect for cleaning between the teeth, and they are easy to use.  The price is much better than any I have found locally.</li>
            <li> Wish these were less expensive. For the first time, the dentist did not complain about my son&#x27;s teeth after using these every day. The first several times we used them, there was a lot of bleeding. With regular use, the bleeding goes away. They can be difficult to get in between teeth, but keep trying. The results are worth it!</li>
            <li> Terrible. Break very easy...useless!&lt;br /&gt;I can only use on one tooth and it is bent.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good item at all?</li>
            <li> These are great to keep in your pocket, especially when you have alot of dental work done and you need to constantly worry about having food caught between your teeth. These are easy to keep in your pockets and such.</li>
            <li> If a piece of food is stuck in your gum, this is a helpful tool. The gum between two of my teeth had been sore for several months when I flossed with string floss. At the dentist for my 6 month checkup, the staff introduced me to the soft picks/brushes. With the help of this product, I discovered it was a piece of husk ( I love grains!) that had lodged in my gum. Once removed, my gum recovered and is no longer sore.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it states that these brushes are for tight spaces, I am unwilling to fit them between some of my teeth. The shaft which holds the bristles is metal. I am hesitant to insert the metal shaft even though the package specifies a special wire coating. I use floss or a floss pick on those teeth.</li>
            <li> My dentist tells me these are &amp;#34;A tooth brush for your gums&amp;#34;. Have used one every day for 6 months (we&#x27;ll almost every day :-) and they have made a real difference.</li>
            <li> good job at cleaning between teeth</li>
            <li> Now these are really excellent.  You might think that a good flossing and a proper brushing are all you need, but these little guys pull out even more stuff -- and you know they&#x27;re working because you can see it all.  The Amazon package of 6 bags x 10 per bag is a fine value.  Please consider trying them. I do keep them with me in my briefcase --  you  can use them modestly in public without having to dash off to the bathroom after a business lunch.</li>
            <li> does what tooth brushing and tooth picks don&#x27;t. Good tool.</li>
            <li> My son really likes using these with his braces. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Bought these little guys &#x27;cause of the cleaning tutorial video I watched for how to maintain my Pax portable vaporizer.. The guy in the vid said it&#x27;s a staple for his cleaning kit, so I figured I&#x27;d follow suit. Make sure you&#x27;re paying attention to the quantity when you purchase these! I totally thought I was paying that price for one pack, so you can imagine my surprise when I received 6x the amount lol.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my aunt, she has some issues with her teeth and gums, and according to her these are fantastic to clean her mouth without hurting her gums.They are very practical and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use after eating anything, Carry them in my back pocket. Wouldn&#x27;t be without them.</li>
            <li> If you have spaces between teeth that catch food this is the best.    Sterilize with instant hand sanitizer so you can use many times.</li>
            <li> If you have braces and are having issues getting between all that wire...this product is perfect for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are stiff; but, not to stiff...flexible so you can bend them to get into tight places. They are also small so you can carry one or two in your pocket or purse, so you will have them when you need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor shipped them in on-time as promised with good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The Dentek easy brushers for me are gun savers. I have lots of issues with my gums, and being diabetic doesn&#x27;t help.    I use these instead of flossing, as they are superior to any type of floss. I have had times when I had a little blood coming from between my teeth and all I do is  make sure that I keep one of the brushes in my pocket and keep cleaning that a rea and usually in a few days, no more bleeding and I just kept from having an abscess or infection.    It also helps if you have any bridge work, for it gets in the gap between the bridge.     Just great stuff.     Jon</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended a different brand that worked out at a dollar a piece.  These are way better priced (I think around 33 cents each) and have the added benefit of being cone shaped - which means different sized gaps between teeth can be cleaned with just one size of brush.</li>
            <li> I have used these before.  They are excellent for cleaning thoroughly between teeth.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome So I NEED to keep my Teeth CLEAN! Still use Floss but this is nice I carry them around! I think they are better than tooth picks! nice to have a small bush between teeth:D</li>
            <li> These brushes work well and each can give multiple uses.  My only issue is that after multiple uses they occasionally break off during use - though that hasn&#x27;t caused any problems.</li>
            <li> Liked the product and it was sent in a timely manner. Will reorder again.</li>
            <li> Good small toothbrush. It can remove a debris between your teeth when normal toothbrush cannot perform that function.</li>
            <li> hard to find in my area, so was glad to find a large quantity for a great price.  My daughter uses these everyday with her braces</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have deep pockets and this product helps me keep those areas clean until I go in for my dental cleaning.  Everytime I go to the dentist they are also very pleased on my efforts in working on those trouble spots.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> The DenTek easy brush has made cleaning between my teeth an absolute no brainer. Even after flossing, I cannot believe how much material was still stuck in-between my teeth! If you want to help prevent periodontal disease, use these. I keep a few everywhere, including in the car, for after meals. Great invention and thank you DenTek. A++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please click on \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; and thank you for reading my review.  :)</li>
            <li> my dental hygenist loves them.&lt;br /&gt;perfect checkups everytime .. conveniently packaged . sterile .. they just work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;spend a few cents more for them</li>
            <li> very good item, i love it, just be careful, its big than most size i have had.</li>
            <li> Large enough handle to grab hold of.  The tapered end does not always fit in between the teeth.  Very good in general .</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY CONVENIENT TO HAVE THE ABOVE SENT TO ME ON A TIMELY BASIS.  I HAVE IMPLANTS AND THESE WORK VERY WELL TO GET IN THE TIGHT SPACES.  THANKS FOR YOUR PROMPTNESS.</li>
            <li> I have periodontal disease and these were recomended by my dentist. I&#x27;ve been using them since July 2012 and love them. It is like brushing in between you teeth. They remove placque and food in seconds and your mouth really feels fresh after use. A must use for anyone with gum issues. My periodontist has noticed the difference. After using these, you will never use floss again.</li>
            <li> These actually work at removing those little annoying food particles. At least they are always in stock and not just another empty hook at your local drug or grocery store. The price is hard to beat anywhere else.</li>
            <li> These are lovely.  Do a better job than toothpicks.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Neat little brushes for all your cleaning needs. Rubber handle with flexible metal and plastic brush end. Also good for cleaning between teeth.</li>
            <li> Buy These!  can&#x27;t stand floss, good alternative</li>
            <li> The brushes are very effective. They work better than dental floss to remove food  brushing doesn&#x27;t reach. They are easy to clean and can be used several times.</li>
            <li> I know it says 10-count, (Pack of 6) but I took that to be that there were 6 brushes in each item.  So I ordered 3.  Now I have 180 brushes.  My fault for misunderstanding the label but it might be nice to do the math for people so they know they are clear in knowing that they are ordering 60 brushes total with each quantity order of 1.</li>
            <li> Great to use for my dental work (permanent retainer).</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the &#x27;interdental brush&#x27; (or whatever you want to call it) a couple of years ago.  Sadly, the one they gave me as a sample, I haven&#x27;t been able to find anywhere else since then, but these are a pretty close second place to them.  My teeth tend to flare slightly, narrower at the gumline than they are at the crown, which makes flossing difficult because the floss tends to start to pull apart as I work my way along, and I sometimes end up with long filaments of dental floss caught in my teeth as a result.  These fit between my teeth near the gumline and clean almost as well as the dental floss, and they don&#x27;t come apart in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in my life, flossing (or something akin to it) doesn&#x27;t leave me asking if it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  I&#x27;ve had the dentist give me a few other options as samples after my check-ups, since first using these...none of the other options have been as satisfactory to me.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I expected that I would be able to use it like floss. Unfortunately, the metal wire at the middle of the brush is too thick, and the brush is a bit too hard. Honestly, I can&#x27;t imagine how someone could clean his/her teeth with it.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try it, I would suggest to buy only one instead of a 6-pack.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist. Cleans quickly between the teeth. Each brush usually lasts for three uses - after that the thin wire bows and is unusable.</li>
            <li> i was introduced to this unique product by my dental hygienist who used it after my cleaning to be certain that all &amp;#34; residue&amp;#34; was removed. i was surprised to be told that it could be purchased on-line! the price is right and the product is wonderful! it removes particles of food that brushing may not touch. the only drawback is that if your teeth are very close together , the brush may not fit in between them. i have a few teeth where the brush would not fit, so flossing was my other option!</li>
            <li> Work great and a great price I think they work better than flossing between your teeth this product gets in between the teeth and gets the food out better.</li>
            <li> i always bring a bag with me. this is very helpful specially after i eat outside. there also alot so it lasts long</li>
            <li> These have to be the best ever toothpicks. I order a bundle every few years, as they seem to disappear as time goes on. :-).</li>
            <li> WARNING: These brushes used to be great but now they are ONLY available coated in poisonous fluoride and with added artificial flavor. I got this info directly from Dentek. They have betrayed their customers in favor of the evil fluoride industry. Even if the website picture shows the old plain brushes, if you order them you will be sent the new, fluoride+mint poison variety.</li>
            <li> works excellent!  nice but a little expensive for just 10.  I think having a large package of picks with one interchangeable cover head for the current pic in use is the best situation.</li>
            <li> This is way better than flossing. Took surgery for gum disease to find this product. My periodontist recommended I use these brushes and I am forever thankful. I do teeth cleanings twice a year and because I use this all the time.  All good!  Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for a few years and really like the way they clean my teeth, gums, etc. I have recommended the Den Tek Brushes to my dentist!</li>
            <li> These are very pricey at the store so this was a really good price buying a 6 pack.  We use them daily so they go fast.</li>
            <li> I have tried many dental brushes and always come back to DenTek&#x27;s Easy Brushes.  They are sturdy and work well, especially with braces or permanent dental work.  This is a great deal to be able to buy them in bulk, too.</li>
            <li> So much better than a toothpick</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these and they remove many food particles that my toothbrush misses.  I carry one with me all of the time and they come it very handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DenTek brushes for years. They go easily between teeth much better than tooth picks and are much more convenient than floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is they do a great job of removing food from between teeth. I use DenTek after every meal.</li>
            <li> works well.  this and Natural Dentist mouth rinse helped my gums.</li>
            <li> Work great.  Always get an A+ from the dentist come checkup time.</li>
            <li> These little brushes really do a nice job of cleaning at the base of your teeth.  They should be used in combination with floss as they can&#x27;t get between the tops of the teeth.  That being said, this also helps to get out that stuck popcorn hull!  I do use them more than once, just running it under water after each use.  This is really a wonderful tool between dentist cleanings.</li>
