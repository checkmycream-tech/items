            <li>Great hand cream.  </li>
            <li>This is a great line of products.</li>
            <li>A great mystery.</li>
            <li>Also great for heels and your elbows.</li>
            <li>This lotion is great to help keep my hands nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Put this on the child&#x27;s hands at bed time and within a week I saw a nice improvement.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice smell that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best hand cream I have found!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light and not medicinal so it will not interfere with your favorite perfume or cologne.</li>
            <li>and I have grown to love it.</li>
            <li>I love being able to read the book immediately.</li>
            <li>so it does not take away from your favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>This cream is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d love this cream, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, but is more like a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent than lavender.</li>
            <li>best cream for dry skin</li>
            <li>I love the way the creamy lotion penetrates my skin so quickly and works its magic.  </li>
            <li>This goes on easier, while the other product I find heating up then apply to work best.  </li>
            <li>This applies well, but not as strong.  </li>
            <li>but I found that this product does a great job to moisten but also seals your skin at the same time.</li>
            <li>Great product- definitely protects hands from lots of washing.  </li>
            <li>I can scrub pots and pans with my feet but this stuff softens them right up better than anything I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed reading this kindle book very much.</li>
            <li>This cream is the best I have bought so far to heal cracked dry skin.</li>
            <li>My family and I are very thankful for this special cream.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very suttle</li>
            <li>and it really helps my hands in the winter time.  </li>
            <li>Surgeon&#x27;s Secret 25% bees wax Cream is probably the best product for dry, chapped skin ever made.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>However, it is not thick and oily like petroleum jelly if this makes sense.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and does have a little greasy residue, but I have not found any lotion or cream that doesn&#x27;t have some residue.  </li>
            <li>The formula is very smooth and thick.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to fragrance, order non-fragrance.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;sealing&amp;#34; quality helps your skin to heal faster and return to natural skin as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li>Not cheap but worth it.</li>

            <li> Not cheap but worth it.</li>
            <li> It comes in a small jar but you do not need very much for it to go a long way.</li>
            <li> Part of the reason is some eczema, and doctor&#x27;s recommendation of steroid creams and vaseline just do not last long enough.  </li>
            <li> The Natural Beeswax Cream works well for very dry areas that are rough - elbows and heels.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is this is highly fragranced.  </li>
            <li> I tossed it in a drawer after trying to use it the first time and having such poor luck.</li>
            <li> This cream is non-steriodal with no side effects, costs a fraction of the other creams and does the same job.</li>
            <li> I use this for my dry heels and hands</li>
            <li> I have cracked dry skin on my hands, elbows and wrists.</li>
            <li> Use this product and dry skin will go away.</li>
            <li> ABOVE AVERAGE RESULTS....</li>
            <li> It sticks with you through several hand washings, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The 100% wax works faster, but also harder to put on.  </li>
            <li> Have used for years and the only cream I use for bleeding dry hands that get worse in winter.</li>
            <li> I admit that at first I did not like the smell; it reminded me of cold cream.  </li>
            <li> If you have the winter blues at least  dry skin will not be a problem.</li>
            <li> It keeps skin moist and youthful all day--though you will have to apply a little to your hands after having washed them three or four times.  </li>
            <li> Usually I apply it and then wear socks for awhile before I go to sleep.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> This product is not as thick or as hard to apply as the 100% beeswax by Surgeron&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This is thick and melts into my skin immediately and does not leave any residue.  </li>
            <li> LIITLE EXPENSIVE FOR 4 OZ JAR....</li>
            <li> I also have eczema to which I have used expensive steriod creams to keep it under control and had to put up with side effects.</li>
            <li> I hate sticky, slimy hand lotion.  </li>
            <li> Helps heal very bad hands.  </li>

            <li> This product is not as thick or as hard to apply as the 100% beeswax by Surgeron&#x27;s.  This goes on easier, while the other product I find heating up then apply to work best.  Both products work well, my daughter&#x27;s fingers peel in winter.  Part of the reason is some eczema, and doctor&#x27;s recommendation of steroid creams and vaseline just do not last long enough.  Put this on the child&#x27;s hands at bed time and within a week I saw a nice improvement.  The 100% wax works faster, but also harder to put on.  This applies well, but not as strong.  Still a very good product.</li>
            <li> best cream for dry skin</li>
            <li> I can scrub pots and pans with my feet but this stuff softens them right up better than anything I have ever used.  Usually I apply it and then wear socks for awhile before I go to sleep.  You can see noticeable lasting improvement to your skin in the morning.  I also use it on my hands and it moisturizes my nails as well.  Has a nice smell that is not overpowering.  My husband uses it on his legs and even he likes it.</li>
            <li> I use this product at night before bed to soften my hands overnight. Its a great product thank you for it.</li>
            <li> Great hand cream.  Works well.  My only complaint is this is highly fragranced.  If you are sensitive to fragrance, order non-fragrance.</li>
            <li> I admit that at first I did not like the smell; it reminded me of cold cream.  But, it has since grown on me and I actually ordered another jar.  The formula is very smooth and thick.  It goes on easily and does have a little greasy residue, but I have not found any lotion or cream that doesn&#x27;t have some residue.  However, it is not thick and oily like petroleum jelly if this makes sense.  I use this for my dry heels and hands and I have grown to love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great line of products. Have used for years and the only cream I use for bleeding dry hands that get worse in winter.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed reading this kindle book very much. A great mystery. I love being able to read the book immediately.</li>
            <li> The Natural Beeswax Cream works well for very dry areas that are rough - elbows and heels.  It helps soften the skin and keep it healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Phyllis T.</li>
            <li> I have cracked dry skin on my hands, elbows and wrists. I use lotions all the time but I found that this product does a great job to moisten but also seals your skin at the same time. The &amp;#34;sealing&amp;#34; quality helps your skin to heal faster and return to natural skin as quickly as possible. The scent is very suttle so it does not take away from your favorite perfume. I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Use this product and dry skin will go away. Also great for heels and your elbows. If you have the winter blues at least  dry skin will not be a problem.</li>
            <li> Helps heal very bad hands.  This is a product I would purchase again and again.  Not cheap but worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product- definitely protects hands from lots of washing.  My manicurist noticed a difference and asked what I was using.</li>
            <li> Surgeon&#x27;s Secret 25% bees wax Cream is probably the best product for dry, chapped skin ever made.  It keeps skin moist and youthful all day--though you will have to apply a little to your hands after having washed them three or four times.  My family and I are very thankful for this special cream.  We could not get along without it.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT...I love the way the creamy lotion penetrates my skin so quickly and works its magic.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> LIITLE EXPENSIVE FOR 4 OZ JAR....ABOVE AVERAGE RESULTS....</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic! It sticks with you through several hand washings, and a little goes a long way. I just wish it was unscented.</li>
            <li> As a vet tech student and assistant, i am constantly washing my hands. This lotion is great to help keep my hands nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This cream is just wonderful!</li>
            <li> I hate sticky, slimy hand lotion.  This is thick and melts into my skin immediately and does not leave any residue.  I have been using it for about 3 years now and it really helps my hands in the winter time.  This is by far the best hand cream I have found!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d love this cream, but I don&#x27;t. I tried to put an even layer over my hands and it was clumpy :/ Why is it clumpy? The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, but is more like a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent than lavender. I tossed it in a drawer after trying to use it the first time and having such poor luck. It didn&#x27;t absorb well (even overnight in gloves), and it didn&#x27;t spread well.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best I have bought so far to heal cracked dry skin. It comes in a small jar but you do not need very much for it to go a long way. The fragrance is very light and not medicinal so it will not interfere with your favorite perfume or cologne. I also have eczema to which I have used expensive steriod creams to keep it under control and had to put up with side effects. This cream is non-steriodal with no side effects, costs a fraction of the other creams and does the same job. I would recommend this to anyone who has a skin condition that needs extra help.</li>
