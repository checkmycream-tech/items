            <li>I&#x27;m glad they still sell it!</li>

            <li>It also has a nice smell, and you don&#x27;t need a lot of it.</li>
            <li>It smells sooooooo good and it lingers in your hair for a long time which is a very good thing.</li>
            <li>Okay this product smells like butter.</li>
            <li>and I think people with kinky curls this might work better.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure if you used a lot it would be.</li>
            <li>never used pomade before, but i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I used this on top of my moisturizer and styler/gel for a twist out.</li>
            <li>I just love this product, the Kinky Curly Gloss Pomade.</li>
            <li>I just absolutely love it</li>
            <li>and I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I love it, because I know how to use it to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>I really does reduce frizz and fly aways.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is great for taming baby hairs and flyaways, but don&#x27;t expect it to last all day.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy and leaves a beautiful healthy glow over my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the rest of the Kinky Curly hair products though, Very recommended.</li>
            <li>It smells really sweet almost like candy.</li>
            <li>This is okay, but was expecting more based upon the reviews I read prior to purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It comes in a really small package but it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Good pomade for laying edges down .</li>
            <li>The major plus is it doesn&#x27;t leave residue in your hair and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of overpowers other scents.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job of adding gloss to natural hair, which has a tendency to look dull because of the texture pattern.</li>
            <li>The curls were very defined and clump together and NO FRIZZ.</li>
            <li>Would have given 5 stars, but I expected more shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about this product.</li>
            <li>This is great to slick my hair back and add shine.</li>
            <li>I try to make my second day hair look fresh with this product</li>
            <li>and my frizz comes right back.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of swiping (sliding your finger across the surface) and emulsifying for use; but on the plus side, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;The KC Gloss Pomade does as advertised; it adds a bit of softness and a touch of shine, but in comparison to other products (i.e. Original Moxie Hair Bling), I found that the Hair Bling works better for my hair type.</li>
            <li>keeps it soft and gives me a well maintained look for any hairstyle.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s ALL NATURAL.</li>
            <li>I use this pomade in my kinky curly hair and it keeps it so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s a nice product--but for my ridiculously thick, coarse, 4a type hair I find that I require a different product to achieve the same results.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> , I think it&#x27;s a nice product--but for my ridiculously thick, coarse, 4a type hair I find that I require a different product to achieve the same results.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Though the other products failed to work on my hair, this product worked very well on my fine edges.  </li>
            <li> I have natural curly/coily/kinky hair (I have a few different textures)</li>
            <li> The pomade is hard packed in a shallow tin; I just assumed it would be whipped, or more like the consistency of butter.</li>
            <li> Works great, but I was shocked at how small the container was.  </li>
            <li> and It just stretched my hair out</li>
            <li> You only need a little to add shine to your entire head.</li>
            <li> I have very loose curls</li>
            <li> You only need  to use a small bit to create the &amp;#34; soft&amp;#34; feel and to reduce  curl crunch.</li>
            <li> The whole kinky-curly line is mediocre.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> If you want the edges of your hair to laid down this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> It lays your edges down and straightens out matted hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is really thick, and it only requires a few dabs of this.</li>
            <li> So, do not use alot or you will be a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONGGGGG way, hence, the size of it, 2oz.</li>
            <li> I did notice that it has been reformulated and is now thicker, so I add a little almond oil to the product.  </li>
            <li> It melts into the scalp and smooths those tough hairs at the hairline to lay down flat.</li>
            <li> Do not attempt to use it to tame edges.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t use oil alone to tame your edges, so don&#x27;t rely on this if you&#x27;re looking for edge control.</li>
            <li> I hated this pomade so much that after I tried it, I sent it back the day after it arrived.</li>
            <li> i usually just use the knot today and then rub in some pomade to add to the shine and style as usual.  </li>
            <li> , it was that bad?!!&amp;#34; And it was, for me at least.</li>
            <li> I found myself reapplying at least once</li>
            <li> I am known for &amp;#34;owning my curls&amp;#34; and as such I am always on the hunt for a product that enhances curls and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of unnecessary crap in it.</li>
            <li> but it is expensive!</li>

            <li> I hated this pomade so much that after I tried it, I sent it back the day after it arrived. Even the UPS guy just looked at me like, &amp;#34;Damn, it was that bad?!!&amp;#34; And it was, for me at least.</li>
            <li> Okay this product smells like butter. I try to make my second day hair look fresh with this product and It just stretched my hair out and my frizz comes right back. I have very loose curls and I think people with kinky curls this might work better. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for Caucasian women. I love the rest of the Kinky Curly hair products though, Very recommended.</li>
            <li> It smells really sweet almost like candy. The lid to the can was off when it was shipped to me. There was nothing covering it. It did make my hair shiny and its not to greasy but I&#x27;m sure if you used a lot it would be. Its not a product that I think I&#x27;ll buy again. The whole kinky-curly line is mediocre.</li>
            <li> never used pomade before, but i love this stuff.  it smells great and when i kinda overdo the custard, this does soften it out a bit.  i usually just use the knot today and then rub in some pomade to add to the shine and style as usual.  good stuff and lasts a while!</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost.  Has a great smell but I don&#x27;t notice a difference in the my hair after adding this.</li>
            <li> Works great, but I was shocked at how small the container was.  My fault for not reading.</li>
            <li> Just the smell of this product alone had me hooked. It smells sooooooo good and it lingers in your hair for a long time which is a very good thing. I have natural curly/coily/kinky hair (I have a few different textures) and I used this on top of my moisturizer and styler/gel for a twist out. My twist out has never looked this good. The curls were very defined and clump together and NO FRIZZ. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It comes in a really small package but it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this product and the container it comes in, and it does a great job controlling stray hairs. But what I don&#x27;t like is the scent -- it&#x27;s kind of overpowers other scents.</li>
            <li> Bought this item to add to my Kinky Curly products. Though the other products failed to work on my hair, this product worked very well on my fine edges.  keeps it soft and gives me a well maintained look for any hairstyle.</li>
            <li> This is okay, but was expecting more based upon the reviews I read prior to purchasing it. May be dependent upon hair type. I will continue to use for now but do not plan on purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I just love this product, the Kinky Curly Gloss Pomade. If you want the edges of your hair to laid down this is the product for you. The smell is great and you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product. You can also used it for the back of your hair as well.</li>
            <li> This product Smells really great. It isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy and leaves a beautiful healthy glow over my hair. It melts into the scalp and smooths those tough hairs at the hairline to lay down flat. I just absolutely love it and I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I did not get the shine I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I do like the smell of this product, but I was expecting a different consistency. The pomade is hard packed in a shallow tin; I just assumed it would be whipped, or more like the consistency of butter. It takes a bit of swiping (sliding your finger across the surface) and emulsifying for use; but on the plus side, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;The KC Gloss Pomade does as advertised; it adds a bit of softness and a touch of shine, but in comparison to other products (i.e. Original Moxie Hair Bling), I found that the Hair Bling works better for my hair type. All in all, I think it&#x27;s a nice product--but for my ridiculously thick, coarse, 4a type hair I find that I require a different product to achieve the same results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this product. For some reason a lot of stores stopped selling it here. But it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do for me. I&#x27;m glad they still sell it!</li>
            <li> This is simply a glosser. It is just compressed oils. Do not attempt to use it to tame edges. You wouldn&#x27;t use oil alone to tame your edges, so don&#x27;t rely on this if you&#x27;re looking for edge control. It does a great job of adding weightless shine to the hair. A little goes a LONGGGGG way, hence, the size of it, 2oz. You only need a little to add shine to your entire head. So, do not use alot or you will be a greasy mess. I love it, because I know how to use it to my satisfaction. It was the only product I used during my 7 day hair detox and I have no complaints. Plus, it&#x27;s ALL NATURAL. Definitely a staple for moi.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of adding gloss to natural hair, which has a tendency to look dull because of the texture pattern. It also has a nice smell, and you don&#x27;t need a lot of it. My daughter&#x27;s hair is really thick, and it only requires a few dabs of this.</li>
            <li> I use this pomade in my kinky curly hair and it keeps it so soft and shiny. I really does reduce frizz and fly aways. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is great to slick my hair back and add shine. I love it but it is expensive!</li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars, but I expected more shine. The smell is GREAT!! You only need  to use a small bit to create the &amp;#34; soft&amp;#34; feel and to reduce  curl crunch. Good pomade for laying edges down . Would purchase again</li>
            <li> Love it.  It added softness and shine to my hair.  I used it on my relaxed hair and now my transitional hair.  I did notice that it has been reformulated and is now thicker, so I add a little almond oil to the product.  Now, I get the same shine and it last longer.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am known for &amp;#34;owning my curls&amp;#34; and as such I am always on the hunt for a product that enhances curls and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of unnecessary crap in it. I think this product is great for taming baby hairs and flyaways, but don&#x27;t expect it to last all day. I found myself reapplying at least once every time I use this product. The major plus is it doesn&#x27;t leave residue in your hair and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about this product. Tried it, the best. It lays your edges down and straightens out matted hair. I use wigs, so this is perfect for my hair under the wig. I will be ordering this again so I&#x27;ll have a spare.</li>
