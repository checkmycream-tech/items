            <li>Gave it as a gift and the person loves it! :)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is not the best choice for a shoe horn since the handle is too short for those who&lt;br /&gt;cannot</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li>What not to love?</li>
            <li>Just the right length, good quality.  </li>
            <li>The back scratcher was fine but the shoe horn is not an adequate fit.</li>
            <li>When necessary, it also doubles as a pesticide. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long, which makes it super easy to use</li>

            <li>This works very well for him.  </li>
            <li>The back scratcher/shoe horn was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made of natural material - bamboo!</li>
            <li>His old one broke.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;a long handled shoe horn from a local shoe store that works better and have&lt;br /&gt;ordered a different back scratcher that appears to have longer teeth on it.</li>
            <li>Right now he cannot bend down to put his shoes on.  </li>
            <li>The bamboo is light but tough.</li>

            <li> Who wants to bend down when slipping their shoes on?</li>
            <li> STURDY AND LONG  ENOUGH</li>
            <li> bend over and too long if you are using it from a sitting position.</li>
            <li> I can take off and put on my shoes without bending down and scratch my back when I have to.</li>
            <li> I also use the &amp;#34;scratcher&amp;#34; to pull the tongues of my shoes up before slipping my feet into the shoe.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if it were sanded down  a bit.  </li>
            <li> BUT ITS NARROWNESS MAKES IT LESS EFFICIENT THAT IT WOULD BE IF WIDER.</li>
            <li> Not a very satisfying scratch.  </li>
            <li> I was so tired of always having to scratch my husband&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> It is heavy</li>
            <li> I am not super lazy</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as slick as some of the plastic ones I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Too Thick the bamboo makes it hard to slip on a tight shoe.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Too Thick the bamboo makes it hard to slip on a tight shoe. The back scratcher was fine but the shoe horn is not an adequate fit.</li>
            <li> I was pleased.  I received a dozen basic bamboo back scratchers and, in my opinion was a good deal.</li>
            <li> I only use it for the shoehorn capabilities and it does the job fine.  I&#x27;ve never been one to scratch my back, so I can&#x27;t really comment on it&#x27;s abilities in that area.    It isn&#x27;t as slick as some of the plastic ones I&#x27;ve used.  I couldn&#x27;t find a plastic one I liked in town or on Amazon Prime, so this one will do.</li>
            <li> Maybe not the best shoe horn but the combo makes it  great for my home office.  I can take off and put on my shoes without bending down and scratch my back when I have to.</li>
            <li> Cheap and does the job! I have it sitting on my desk and use it often. Reaches all the itchy spots on my back with ease. Also doubles as a great shoe horn!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! I was so tired of always having to scratch my husband&#x27;s back. Now I d have to anymore!</li>
            <li> Scratches backs! Puts on shoes!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Gave it as a gift and the person loves it! :)</li>
            <li> Just the right length, good quality.  The shoe horn is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy, doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy when scratching my back.</li>
            <li> I love this backscratcher ! It works great and having it tucked in the visor of my vehicles is fun . Sometimes I look around when I use it in traffic and people just squirm trying to get at their itch .</li>
            <li> got this for my sister who had hip surgery. it saves a lot of bending over. which she can&#x27;t do yet. great item.</li>
            <li> The bamboo is light but tough. I also use the &amp;#34;scratcher&amp;#34; to pull the tongues of my shoes up before slipping my feet into the shoe. When necessary, it also doubles as a pesticide. :)</li>
            <li> The teeth on this back scratcher are too short. It is heavy so it will not break but&lt;br /&gt;it is not the best choice for a shoe horn since the handle is too short for those who&lt;br /&gt;cannot bend over and too long if you are using it from a sitting position. I bought&lt;br /&gt;a long handled shoe horn from a local shoe store that works better and have&lt;br /&gt;ordered a different back scratcher that appears to have longer teeth on it.</li>
            <li> Not a very satisfying scratch.  Perhaps if it were sanded down  a bit.  It works so I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars.  There&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li> I am not super lazy but if I was this would be my best friend. Who wants to bend down when slipping their shoes on? No one! This is the perfect product. I was surprised how cheap it was and its real bamboo. Nice sturdy quality.</li>
            <li> Item is as described. I have already used the shoe horn and it worked well. The back scratcher/shoe horn was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Best shoehorn I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s long, which makes it super easy to use and it&#x27;s made of natural material - bamboo! What not to love? I&#x27;ve used mine for 6 years, now ordering another one.</li>
            <li> This is awesome - we now have 2.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my husband&#x27;s needs.  His old one broke.  He&#x27;s very happy with this one.  Right now he cannot bend down to put his shoes on.  This works very well for him.  He also uses it as a backscratcher.</li>
