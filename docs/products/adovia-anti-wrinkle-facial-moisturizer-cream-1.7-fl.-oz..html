            <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m able to get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream from Adovia Mineral Skin Care.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many positives about this cream</li>
            <li>For best results, use daily.</li>
            <li>I am glad I was given the chance to review this product.</li>
            <li>It has that distinctive, elegant, powdery &amp;#34;Adovia scent&amp;#34</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a perfect cream for under makeup, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>it feels like it makes you sweat more.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I completely love Adovia</li>
            <li>so it is no surprise that i love there anti wrinkle cream</li>
            <li>That said, I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, so it&#x27;s likely I&#x27;m not the best person to be testing this one!  </li>
            <li>They need or you need to change the amount of testing the product time to more like 30 days&#x3D;1 month.</li>
            <li>: Overall, this was a good lightweight cream with a great, soothing fragrance.</li>
            <li>I completely love Adovia</li>
            <li>so it is no surprise that I love their anti-wrinkle moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>My skin seems to love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I mostly used it at night.  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless this did leave my skin looking glowy, healthy and not greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product &amp; will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>, I received item for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Its very rich and creamy and blends with ease.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li>Helps keep the skin looking young and beautiful</li>
            <li>It is a great product with some high quality ingredients and is well worth the price, contains many of the ingredients as products that cost two to three times the price.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li>Opening and closing the jar allows air to touch the product, therefore most great products like yours may lose some of it&#x27;s efficacy before the cream is completely used up.</li>
            <li>I have tried some of Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Minerals line/products and I can honestly say that they make some of the best in the market.</li>
            <li>This is a fine product, and I am pleased to share it with my readers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hey Everyone, I am going to cut to the chase on this review and let you know right away that I found something I totally love that you can use on your skin!</li>
            <li>I also love how light it is on my face.</li>
            <li>I do not think that this is a reasonable fair amount of time to test out a skin product for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>All these ingredients actually are considered very good for the skin and are proven to help promote cell turnover and help diminish the looks of fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Also, it needs spf other than those two issues it was perfect.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things!</li>
            <li>Outside of that, this cream is really good!</li>
            <li>I received this very quickly in the mail and was well wrapped to prevent damage or leaking of the container.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many Adovia products and found their products to be the best of the Dead Sea Mineral made beauty products.</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily, and leaves you with a refreshed feeling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smooth, it&#x27;s non greasy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Adovia has again granted the privilege to me of reviewing another of their fine products.</li>
            <li>With this Adovia product,  I don&#x27;t get powder build up in my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I find it just fine</li>
            <li>Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream is not tested on animals, that is a huge factor for me</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my wrinkles</li>
            <li>but it is a light scent, nothing overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be great if you could dispense this product differently to increase it&#x27;s staying power.</li>
            <li>It is a dense cream but goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I use this Anti-Wrinkle cream in the morning and in the evening after washing my face and neck everyday for best results.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, even though I&#x27;m not totally crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li>To be honest, I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference in the two creams.</li>
            <li>I primarily used this as a nighttime moisturizer since it does not contain SPF.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this cream, too.  </li>
            <li>Be sure that the cream is fully absorbed into the skin, otherwise your face will look cakey.</li>
            <li>really liked using this cream at night, but not so much during the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only did this moisturizer have everything I&#x27;m looking for but it is a great primer for foundation.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and stayed on all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with this facial moisturizer from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What a wonderful facial moisturizer that really works.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Adovia Intensive Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer Cream for about two weeks, morning and evening, and it works very nicely.</li>
            <li>After ordering on Amazon, I actually received a very nice follow up email, addressing any questions or concerns.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this cream did not eradicate my fine lines, it did produce a hydrating and plumping effect that hid them for multiple hours at a time, which was nice for when I wanted to look extra fresh, alert and at my best, like for going to a party.</li>
            <li>continue to use Adovia Intensive Anti Wrinkle Cream, and recommend to you if you&#x27;re looking for a rich moisturizing cream that helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and to keep your face hydrated.</li>
            <li>and I am so excited to share!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It is really worth a try!</li>
            <li>With a tiny bit before i leave it on as a face treatment then after to moisturize my face and make sure i do not have my break outs, the smell is so amazing</li>
            <li>Yep, that&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li>It is a bit thicker in consistency, but it&#x27;s lightweight and it was easy to apply and absorbed quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, moisturizing and is quickly absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light, and fresh.</li>
            <li>I loved the texture and feeling but after a week I got pimples and red blotches.  </li>
            <li>And feels cool and soothing on your skin.</li>
            <li>This product is very good for dry skin in winter, but in summer I would prefer something in much lighter consistency.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, mostly just a natural type of scent.</li>
            <li>It really works well and is easy to use I even like the light scent .</li>
            <li>Other ingredients in this product are acclaimed as being great for the skin, too.</li>
            <li>like to use this at night, after I have showered and have a fresh clean face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure as with any product and religious use, you can see more results.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, however, if you prefer products without scents; the perfume dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>Like myself, I think you&#x27;ll find you&#x27;re not as loyal anymore.</li>
            <li>I love that this has a great texture, not too thick, and not greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Adovia is a unique skin care line, they combine natural ingredients with modern science to formulate an effective blend of minerals and the finest herbal ingredients nature has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I am obsesses with anti wrinkle products, and love to try new products when they come out.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve had a pretty good experience with this product.</li>
            <li>but I swear it actually dries my face out even more!</li>
            <li>I love this all natural anti aging cream!</li>
            <li>This has been a great new addition to my daily skincare regimen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>oily skin, the Adovia Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream is so rich that I noticed that I experienced small pimples around my chin and side of my mouth.</li>
            <li>have a feeling that my fine lines near my eyes might require laser treatment to get them to go away entirely; or, alternatively, perhaps if I keep using this Adovia cream for 6 or more months, I might see some greater reversal of the lines.</li>
            <li>Its only been a week and my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li>The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>received this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You apply generously on to clean face and neck and gently massage in a circular motion until completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>I use in under my makeup and right</li>
            <li>You can feel the quality right away.</li>
            <li>i use this right after i wash my face.</li>
            <li>The Adovia Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream has a clean scent that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally with skincare products it takes about a month before you start seeing real results if the moisturizer states that it does more then just make your face soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This cream goes on very smoothly, and a little bit covers most of my face.</li>
            <li>So this product is wonderful for all levels of aging, from 20 years old and up, male or female.</li>
            <li>Reason being, they are always using natural ingredients, I never feel my skin drying out or becoming greasy during the day</li>
            <li>This combination of ingredients helps to smooth out the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles over time, adding to the overall vitality of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have a nice clean scent to it, a slight perfume smell.</li>
            <li>But I think that comes from some of the natural ingredients found in it cream that naturally produce their own smells.  </li>
            <li>already find it is taking away some of the fine lines, but it is making my skin really soft and rejuvenated .My</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and they had the propylparaben listed in the ingredients when someone asked what the exact ingredients are.  </li>
            <li>, overall I would say I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>love how this cream, is actual cream.</li>
            <li>this is the first time I have used the moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li>I was told what pretty skin I have</li>
            <li>Thanks Adovia!</li>
            <li>I have been using the Adovia Moisturizing Cream for about 3 weeks and have definitely notice a change for the better.</li>
            <li>However, while I love the fact that this cream is so well formulated, the only downfall is that it comes in a jar.  </li>
            <li>This cream leaves my face feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many anti aging creams in the past, that leaves my skin screaming for more moisture...</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I am so glad it&#x27;s finally sold at Amazon for an affordable price.</li>
            <li>This is the first face moisurizer I have ever used that I can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I also applied this moisturizer at night after taking my make up off and cleansing my face and my face feels smooth, soft</li>
            <li>cream is thick (thicker than a gel), but it absorbs fast and smells great.</li>
            <li>While yes it might smell good; fragrances and perfumes in face creams are actually irritants for the skin and a big no</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to give pretty much anything</li>
            <li>Again, I am very grateful and thank you so very much.  </li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>I am recommending this product to all my friends who have experienced facial issues with other skin products.  </li>
            <li>for the active ingredients, Vitamin C is a great topical agent and should be used in all skin care regimens.</li>
            <li>I mean it feels amazing on the skin, and it’s a rich formula that does not leave your skin feeling oily, or greasy.</li>
            <li>month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a great believer in Dead Sea salts and minerals, seaweed and similar oceanic ingredients for keeping skin hydrated, healthy and supple; Adovia&#x27;s Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer is like a sumptuous skincare buffet of these ingredients.</li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning with super soft, hydrated, glowing skin.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect to use before I put my makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of moisturizers are thick and do not completely absorb into your face so that when you apply your makeup it turns cakey and uneven.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another positive I want to share with you is that the people at Adovia are very customer</li>
            <li>This anti wrinkle facial cream smooths out the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles over time.</li>
            <li>I like how creamy this product is because I feel that it really moisturizes throughout the day.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really see any of my wrinkles diminishing yet.</li>
            <li>My whole bathroom smells</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much for providing a sample of this product for review on my blog.</li>
            <li>I also really like the consistency.</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li>That would have been so much</li>
            <li>I really like the scent adovia uses for all their moisturizers and hair products.</li>
            <li>It has too much perfume in it for me.</li>
            <li>and for $29, i expected much more.</li>
            <li>Adovia intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream absorbs into the skin fast, leaving your skin moisturized and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I don’t apply the Adovia Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream on my whole face anymore.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Adovia skincare!</li>
            <li>; sounds so much better.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin tends to be oily, so I was worried this cream might be too much for me and cause pimples.</li>
            <li>Like the Day Cream, this cream is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>I really, really like it.  </li>
            <li>Very oily and the allergic to the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have already outlived her by almost three years and my skin is relatively wrinkle free</li>
            <li>It really helped with my dryness and didn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>I like to apply a light facial moisturizer to my face before applying any foundation or powder, I just think it makes the make up go on easier</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good companion product with the soap for firm, soft skin.</li>
            <li>You will find higher quantities of Lactic Acid in many chemical peels, as it is the most gentle acid of the bunch, but it also goes a long way to have a pinch of it in a daily facial cream.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li>I love the little container this comes in also and because it blends so easily it doesnt require much effort or product so it will last you for awhile.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a seriously rich facial moisturizer, this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You would never put normal perfume on your face, so why put that in a cream!?</li>
            <li>This cream is a must have for any woman over 25, because it not only fights existing wrinkles, but it helps prevent formation of new wrinkles and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>The only makeup I use is the loose mineral kind.</li>
            <li>It would be more appropriate that the company step away from jar products and start putting their creams in air tight pumps which also helps to disallow bacteria to contaminate the product due to sticking your fingers in the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not have too strong of a scent to it, pleasant or unpleasant depending on your taste.</li>
            <li>I am 79+ years old and am mistaken for at least 20 years younger, thanks to my mother who had beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more toned &amp; the wrinkles seem less around my eyes.</li>
            <li>When you have a great product that is dispensed from a jar, it tends to become oxidized and loses it&#x27;s stability over a short time.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly like this cream.</li>
            <li>I used it daily in tandem with Adovia&#x27;s mild anti-acne sulfur soap, however, and that seemed to prevent any outbreaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this for review on my blog</li>
            <li>Even if you&#x27;re loyal to your current moisturizer, you need to try this one.</li>
            <li>Anti Aging Moisturizer - Reduces the Appearance of Existing Wrinkles &amp; Fine Lines &amp; Prevent the Formation of New Wrinkles - Natural Skin Care Solution Facial Cream for Women &amp; Men - Premier Anti Wrinkle Cream.&lt;br /&gt;IF</li>
            <li>I have used a few other of Adovia&#x27;s moisturizers and have always been happy with their products.  </li>
            <li>; that I enjoy so much in their other hair and skin products.</li>
            <li>I love anything with Dead Sea minerals.</li>
            <li>and I get this feeling of smooth and soft skin every day long.</li>
            <li>This cream has a nice thick consistency that absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>Retinyl palmitate is about 20 percent less potent than Retinol, so if you have sensitive skin may be for you.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, and I was actually surprised that it had a fragrance since the previous products I tried from Adovia Skin Care did not have any scent to them.</li>
            <li>Now that I am 40 years old, I have a few fine lines around my eyes, so I was eager to try this free sample of Adovia Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer Cream and review it for you to let you know if I saw any difference with my emerging wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This Anti-Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer Cream, by Adovia, not only prevents the formation of new wrinkles, but helps reduce the appearance of any fine lines that you may already have.</li>
            <li>But it does not irritate my face and i have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>her skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera, of course, has been used for ages and is highly moisturizing and healing, which is why it is frequently used on burn victims.</li>
            <li>before I go to bed, its not heavy or greasy!</li>
            <li>I can also notice that my fine lines are less visible.</li>
            <li>and it makes my face feel so baby soft!</li>
            <li>is you like mostly natural ingredients in your skincare products!  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C for example is an antioxidant and breaks down with light and air.  </li>
            <li>Adovia’s specially formulated Anti Wrinkle Cream helps firm up your skin to get rid of wrinkles, fine lines, and other age skin issues.</li>
            <li>Tight and smooth.</li>
            <li>Since we all have different skin types, some things absorb quicker/better into certain skin types.  </li>
            <li>vital nutrients, anti-oxidants and minerals present in Adovia products are responsibly gathered at the place closest to the soul of Mother Earth-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it in the rotation (especially now that the weather is getting colder), but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Seaweed and aloe vera are also included to help maintain naturally youthful skin.</li>
            <li>, I was just surprised because it said no perfume.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>With hydrating ingredients like natural Almond Oil and Aloe Vera, this cream will absorb into skin to moisturize and maintain texture and radiance.  </li>
            <li>(Sometimes manufacturers must add a bit of scent to cover up the natural odors of ingredients like seaweed, which is used in this cream.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33 and have had adult acne/sensitive skin problems for years.</li>
            <li>I am 66 and have sensitive skin now.  </li>
            <li>This is why I always advise my clients to start young with moisturizer and eye cream, before they &amp;#34;need it&amp;#34; (or so they say.)</li>
            <li>The fact of the matter is that it&#x27;s much easier to preserve what you&#x27;ve got than to try to get it back.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s needed nutrients for maintaining naturally youthful</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that I am 26 years old, so I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles.</li>
            <li>And I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has also been proven that jar creams help to render many ingredients useless because of the constant exposure to light and air.  </li>
            <li>It has been working wonders on my sensitive skin and it has been truly brightening my complexion.</li>
            <li>I currently use several other Adovia products, and love that they have an anti wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li>and I have to say when I first got it, the packaging looked elegant because of the glass container which is a tad heavy than other moisturizers and only a con if you accidentally drop it.</li>
            <li>Seems a bit thick and greasy right when you put it on but actually absorbs quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re older and prone to hot flashes, this product is so heavy</li>
            <li>I said I am totally digging this new cream.</li>
            <li>The texture is quite creamy and thick but can be easily blended into the skin.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed to find it didn&#x27;t have Retinol but will not return it because it seems to be a pretty good product, so I give it an I like it four star rating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers and some are too oily, some are too thick and make any make up</li>
            <li>So if you ever pick up a cream in general that smells</li>
            <li>I like it in general.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and sometimes break out with different products-</li>
            <li>The first week of using it what few wrinkles I am getting (I am 32 years old) looked WAY more visible and the skin on my face began to flake even worse than it did before.</li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised because such was not the case with Adovia!</li>
            <li>The cream is a thick, whipped consistency, but it is fairly light and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Lactic Acid is a gentle ingredient derived from Milk, and it is used to break down the cellular glue holding dead skin cells to the fresh young layers of skin beneath them.</li>
            <li>The only thing I did get out of this short amount of time 14 days was: It made my face feel very soft and almost a silky effect to the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great hydrator, especially now asthe cold and dry autumn weather descends upon us, requiring the application of stronger moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I usually applied it right before I put on my makeup.</li>
            <li>notice that my skin especially under the eyes,  looks moisturized and not dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the soap for the past few years and I love it.</li>
            <li>It works just fine though the consistincy is a little firm.  </li>
            <li>I haven’t been using it long enough to see dramatic results, but I do feel as though my skin looks healthier and more radiant.</li>

            <li> It worked ok.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it and the smell...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m able to get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream from Adovia Mineral Skin Care.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many positives about this cream</li>
            <li> For best results, use daily.</li>
            <li> I am glad I was given the chance to review this product.</li>
            <li> It has that distinctive, elegant, powdery &amp;#34;Adovia scent&amp;#34</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a perfect cream for under makeup, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> it feels like it makes you sweat more.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I completely love Adovia</li>
            <li> so it is no surprise that i love there anti wrinkle cream</li>
            <li> That said, I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, so it&#x27;s likely I&#x27;m not the best person to be testing this one!  </li>
            <li> They need or you need to change the amount of testing the product time to more like 30 days&#x3D;1 month.</li>
            <li> : Overall, this was a good lightweight cream with a great, soothing fragrance.</li>
            <li> I completely love Adovia</li>
            <li> so it is no surprise that I love their anti-wrinkle moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> My skin seems to love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I mostly used it at night.  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless this did leave my skin looking glowy, healthy and not greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product &amp; will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> , I received item for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Its very rich and creamy and blends with ease.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li> Helps keep the skin looking young and beautiful</li>
            <li> It is a great product with some high quality ingredients and is well worth the price, contains many of the ingredients as products that cost two to three times the price.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li> Opening and closing the jar allows air to touch the product, therefore most great products like yours may lose some of it&#x27;s efficacy before the cream is completely used up.</li>
            <li> I have tried some of Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Minerals line/products and I can honestly say that they make some of the best in the market.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product, and I am pleased to share it with my readers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hey Everyone, I am going to cut to the chase on this review and let you know right away that I found something I totally love that you can use on your skin!</li>
            <li> I also love how light it is on my face.</li>
            <li> I do not think that this is a reasonable fair amount of time to test out a skin product for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> All these ingredients actually are considered very good for the skin and are proven to help promote cell turnover and help diminish the looks of fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Also, it needs spf other than those two issues it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things!</li>
            <li> Outside of that, this cream is really good!</li>
            <li> I received this very quickly in the mail and was well wrapped to prevent damage or leaking of the container.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Adovia products and found their products to be the best of the Dead Sea Mineral made beauty products.</li>
            <li> It absorbs easily, and leaves you with a refreshed feeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on smooth, it&#x27;s non greasy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Adovia has again granted the privilege to me of reviewing another of their fine products.</li>
            <li> With this Adovia product,  I don&#x27;t get powder build up in my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I find it just fine</li>
            <li> Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream is not tested on animals, that is a huge factor for me</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my wrinkles</li>
            <li> but it is a light scent, nothing overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be great if you could dispense this product differently to increase it&#x27;s staying power.</li>
            <li> It is a dense cream but goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I use this Anti-Wrinkle cream in the morning and in the evening after washing my face and neck everyday for best results.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, even though I&#x27;m not totally crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li> To be honest, I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference in the two creams.</li>
            <li> I primarily used this as a nighttime moisturizer since it does not contain SPF.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this cream, too.  </li>
            <li> Be sure that the cream is fully absorbed into the skin, otherwise your face will look cakey.</li>
            <li> really liked using this cream at night, but not so much during the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only did this moisturizer have everything I&#x27;m looking for but it is a great primer for foundation.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly and stayed on all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this facial moisturizer from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a wonderful facial moisturizer that really works.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Adovia Intensive Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer Cream for about two weeks, morning and evening, and it works very nicely.</li>
            <li> After ordering on Amazon, I actually received a very nice follow up email, addressing any questions or concerns.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this cream did not eradicate my fine lines, it did produce a hydrating and plumping effect that hid them for multiple hours at a time, which was nice for when I wanted to look extra fresh, alert and at my best, like for going to a party.</li>
            <li> continue to use Adovia Intensive Anti Wrinkle Cream, and recommend to you if you&#x27;re looking for a rich moisturizing cream that helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and to keep your face hydrated.</li>
            <li> and I am so excited to share!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It is really worth a try!</li>
            <li> With a tiny bit before i leave it on as a face treatment then after to moisturize my face and make sure i do not have my break outs, the smell is so amazing</li>
            <li> Yep, that&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li> It is a bit thicker in consistency, but it&#x27;s lightweight and it was easy to apply and absorbed quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, moisturizing and is quickly absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light, and fresh.</li>
            <li> I loved the texture and feeling but after a week I got pimples and red blotches.  </li>
            <li> And feels cool and soothing on your skin.</li>
            <li> This product is very good for dry skin in winter, but in summer I would prefer something in much lighter consistency.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, mostly just a natural type of scent.</li>
            <li> It really works well and is easy to use I even like the light scent .</li>
            <li> Other ingredients in this product are acclaimed as being great for the skin, too.</li>
            <li> like to use this at night, after I have showered and have a fresh clean face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure as with any product and religious use, you can see more results.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, however, if you prefer products without scents; the perfume dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Like myself, I think you&#x27;ll find you&#x27;re not as loyal anymore.</li>
            <li> I love that this has a great texture, not too thick, and not greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Adovia is a unique skin care line, they combine natural ingredients with modern science to formulate an effective blend of minerals and the finest herbal ingredients nature has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I am obsesses with anti wrinkle products, and love to try new products when they come out.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ve had a pretty good experience with this product.</li>
            <li> but I swear it actually dries my face out even more!</li>
            <li> I love this all natural anti aging cream!</li>
            <li> This has been a great new addition to my daily skincare regimen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> oily skin, the Adovia Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream is so rich that I noticed that I experienced small pimples around my chin and side of my mouth.</li>
            <li> have a feeling that my fine lines near my eyes might require laser treatment to get them to go away entirely; or, alternatively, perhaps if I keep using this Adovia cream for 6 or more months, I might see some greater reversal of the lines.</li>
            <li> Its only been a week and my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure: I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li> The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> received this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You apply generously on to clean face and neck and gently massage in a circular motion until completely absorbed.</li>
            <li> I use in under my makeup and right</li>
            <li> You can feel the quality right away.</li>
            <li> i use this right after i wash my face.</li>
            <li> The Adovia Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream has a clean scent that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally with skincare products it takes about a month before you start seeing real results if the moisturizer states that it does more then just make your face soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This cream goes on very smoothly, and a little bit covers most of my face.</li>
            <li> So this product is wonderful for all levels of aging, from 20 years old and up, male or female.</li>
            <li> Reason being, they are always using natural ingredients, I never feel my skin drying out or becoming greasy during the day</li>
            <li> This combination of ingredients helps to smooth out the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles over time, adding to the overall vitality of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a nice clean scent to it, a slight perfume smell.</li>
            <li> But I think that comes from some of the natural ingredients found in it cream that naturally produce their own smells.  </li>
            <li> already find it is taking away some of the fine lines, but it is making my skin really soft and rejuvenated .My</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> and they had the propylparaben listed in the ingredients when someone asked what the exact ingredients are.  </li>
            <li> , overall I would say I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> love how this cream, is actual cream.</li>
            <li> this is the first time I have used the moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I was told what pretty skin I have</li>
            <li> Thanks Adovia!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Adovia Moisturizing Cream for about 3 weeks and have definitely notice a change for the better.</li>
            <li> However, while I love the fact that this cream is so well formulated, the only downfall is that it comes in a jar.  </li>
            <li> This cream leaves my face feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many anti aging creams in the past, that leaves my skin screaming for more moisture...</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I am so glad it&#x27;s finally sold at Amazon for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> This is the first face moisurizer I have ever used that I can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I also applied this moisturizer at night after taking my make up off and cleansing my face and my face feels smooth, soft</li>
            <li> cream is thick (thicker than a gel), but it absorbs fast and smells great.</li>
            <li> While yes it might smell good; fragrances and perfumes in face creams are actually irritants for the skin and a big no</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to give pretty much anything</li>
            <li> Again, I am very grateful and thank you so very much.  </li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> I am recommending this product to all my friends who have experienced facial issues with other skin products.  </li>
            <li> for the active ingredients, Vitamin C is a great topical agent and should be used in all skin care regimens.</li>
            <li> I mean it feels amazing on the skin, and it’s a rich formula that does not leave your skin feeling oily, or greasy.</li>
            <li> month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a great believer in Dead Sea salts and minerals, seaweed and similar oceanic ingredients for keeping skin hydrated, healthy and supple; Adovia&#x27;s Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer is like a sumptuous skincare buffet of these ingredients.</li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning with super soft, hydrated, glowing skin.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect to use before I put my makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of moisturizers are thick and do not completely absorb into your face so that when you apply your makeup it turns cakey and uneven.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another positive I want to share with you is that the people at Adovia are very customer</li>
            <li> This anti wrinkle facial cream smooths out the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles over time.</li>
            <li> I like how creamy this product is because I feel that it really moisturizes throughout the day.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really see any of my wrinkles diminishing yet.</li>
            <li> My whole bathroom smells</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks so much for providing a sample of this product for review on my blog.</li>
            <li> I also really like the consistency.</li>
            <li> The price is very affordable which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> That would have been so much</li>
            <li> I really like the scent adovia uses for all their moisturizers and hair products.</li>
            <li> It has too much perfume in it for me.</li>
            <li> and for $29, i expected much more.</li>
            <li> Adovia intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream absorbs into the skin fast, leaving your skin moisturized and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I don’t apply the Adovia Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream on my whole face anymore.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Adovia skincare!</li>
            <li> ; sounds so much better.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin tends to be oily, so I was worried this cream might be too much for me and cause pimples.</li>
            <li> Like the Day Cream, this cream is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I really, really like it.  </li>
            <li> Very oily and the allergic to the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have already outlived her by almost three years and my skin is relatively wrinkle free</li>
            <li> It really helped with my dryness and didn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
            <li> I like to apply a light facial moisturizer to my face before applying any foundation or powder, I just think it makes the make up go on easier</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good companion product with the soap for firm, soft skin.</li>
            <li> You will find higher quantities of Lactic Acid in many chemical peels, as it is the most gentle acid of the bunch, but it also goes a long way to have a pinch of it in a daily facial cream.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li> I love the little container this comes in also and because it blends so easily it doesnt require much effort or product so it will last you for awhile.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a seriously rich facial moisturizer, this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You would never put normal perfume on your face, so why put that in a cream!?</li>
            <li> This cream is a must have for any woman over 25, because it not only fights existing wrinkles, but it helps prevent formation of new wrinkles and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> The only makeup I use is the loose mineral kind.</li>
            <li> It would be more appropriate that the company step away from jar products and start putting their creams in air tight pumps which also helps to disallow bacteria to contaminate the product due to sticking your fingers in the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not have too strong of a scent to it, pleasant or unpleasant depending on your taste.</li>
            <li> I am 79+ years old and am mistaken for at least 20 years younger, thanks to my mother who had beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more toned &amp; the wrinkles seem less around my eyes.</li>
            <li> When you have a great product that is dispensed from a jar, it tends to become oxidized and loses it&#x27;s stability over a short time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like this cream.</li>
            <li> I used it daily in tandem with Adovia&#x27;s mild anti-acne sulfur soap, however, and that seemed to prevent any outbreaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this for review on my blog</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re loyal to your current moisturizer, you need to try this one.</li>
            <li> Anti Aging Moisturizer - Reduces the Appearance of Existing Wrinkles &amp; Fine Lines &amp; Prevent the Formation of New Wrinkles - Natural Skin Care Solution Facial Cream for Women &amp; Men - Premier Anti Wrinkle Cream.&lt;br /&gt;IF</li>
            <li> I have used a few other of Adovia&#x27;s moisturizers and have always been happy with their products.  </li>
            <li> ; that I enjoy so much in their other hair and skin products.</li>
            <li> I love anything with Dead Sea minerals.</li>
            <li> and I get this feeling of smooth and soft skin every day long.</li>
            <li> This cream has a nice thick consistency that absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> Retinyl palmitate is about 20 percent less potent than Retinol, so if you have sensitive skin may be for you.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, and I was actually surprised that it had a fragrance since the previous products I tried from Adovia Skin Care did not have any scent to them.</li>
            <li> Now that I am 40 years old, I have a few fine lines around my eyes, so I was eager to try this free sample of Adovia Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer Cream and review it for you to let you know if I saw any difference with my emerging wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This Anti-Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer Cream, by Adovia, not only prevents the formation of new wrinkles, but helps reduce the appearance of any fine lines that you may already have.</li>
            <li> But it does not irritate my face and i have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> her skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera, of course, has been used for ages and is highly moisturizing and healing, which is why it is frequently used on burn victims.</li>
            <li> before I go to bed, its not heavy or greasy!</li>
            <li> I can also notice that my fine lines are less visible.</li>
            <li> and it makes my face feel so baby soft!</li>
            <li> is you like mostly natural ingredients in your skincare products!  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C for example is an antioxidant and breaks down with light and air.  </li>
            <li> Adovia’s specially formulated Anti Wrinkle Cream helps firm up your skin to get rid of wrinkles, fine lines, and other age skin issues.</li>
            <li> Tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> Since we all have different skin types, some things absorb quicker/better into certain skin types.  </li>
            <li> vital nutrients, anti-oxidants and minerals present in Adovia products are responsibly gathered at the place closest to the soul of Mother Earth-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it in the rotation (especially now that the weather is getting colder), but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Seaweed and aloe vera are also included to help maintain naturally youthful skin.</li>
            <li> , I was just surprised because it said no perfume.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> With hydrating ingredients like natural Almond Oil and Aloe Vera, this cream will absorb into skin to moisturize and maintain texture and radiance.  </li>
            <li> (Sometimes manufacturers must add a bit of scent to cover up the natural odors of ingredients like seaweed, which is used in this cream.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 and have had adult acne/sensitive skin problems for years.</li>
            <li> I am 66 and have sensitive skin now.  </li>
            <li> This is why I always advise my clients to start young with moisturizer and eye cream, before they &amp;#34;need it&amp;#34; (or so they say.)</li>
            <li> The fact of the matter is that it&#x27;s much easier to preserve what you&#x27;ve got than to try to get it back.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s needed nutrients for maintaining naturally youthful</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that I am 26 years old, so I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles.</li>
            <li> And I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has also been proven that jar creams help to render many ingredients useless because of the constant exposure to light and air.  </li>
            <li> It has been working wonders on my sensitive skin and it has been truly brightening my complexion.</li>
            <li> I currently use several other Adovia products, and love that they have an anti wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li> and I have to say when I first got it, the packaging looked elegant because of the glass container which is a tad heavy than other moisturizers and only a con if you accidentally drop it.</li>
            <li> Seems a bit thick and greasy right when you put it on but actually absorbs quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re older and prone to hot flashes, this product is so heavy</li>
            <li> I said I am totally digging this new cream.</li>
            <li> The texture is quite creamy and thick but can be easily blended into the skin.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find it didn&#x27;t have Retinol but will not return it because it seems to be a pretty good product, so I give it an I like it four star rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers and some are too oily, some are too thick and make any make up</li>
            <li> So if you ever pick up a cream in general that smells</li>
            <li> I like it in general.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and sometimes break out with different products-</li>
            <li> The first week of using it what few wrinkles I am getting (I am 32 years old) looked WAY more visible and the skin on my face began to flake even worse than it did before.</li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised because such was not the case with Adovia!</li>
            <li> The cream is a thick, whipped consistency, but it is fairly light and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Lactic Acid is a gentle ingredient derived from Milk, and it is used to break down the cellular glue holding dead skin cells to the fresh young layers of skin beneath them.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did get out of this short amount of time 14 days was: It made my face feel very soft and almost a silky effect to the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great hydrator, especially now asthe cold and dry autumn weather descends upon us, requiring the application of stronger moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I usually applied it right before I put on my makeup.</li>
            <li> notice that my skin especially under the eyes,  looks moisturized and not dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the soap for the past few years and I love it.</li>
            <li> It works just fine though the consistincy is a little firm.  </li>
            <li> I haven’t been using it long enough to see dramatic results, but I do feel as though my skin looks healthier and more radiant.</li>
            <li> I have use other Adovia products and like this one for its complete ingredients and creamy texture</li>
            <li> It’s a little thick, but smooths and absorbs into the skin quite easily.</li>
            <li> It acts as a very powerful anti-oxidant, which helps slow down the aging process.</li>
            <li> Yep, I got the Wow factor i have been looking for, which is really hard to do on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Adovia</li>
            <li> a thick moisturizer like this is great for the cold weather.</li>
            <li> Simply it is a bit of a heavier moisturizer than the others I usually use and that is why I like to use it sometimes before I go to bed as a night cream, and wake up with a baby soft skin, rather than using it as a daily moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very strong smell, not an unpleasant smell</li>
            <li> It moisturizes really well and doesn&#x27;t leave an icky feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have not really noticed a big improvement in my wrinkles/lines and have been using it nightly for about 6 weeks now.</li>
            <li> and I hope to keep it that way for as long as I can.  </li>
            <li> It is so dry in</li>
            <li> It helps with my dry skin, and also has helped fill int he wrinkles on my forehead, and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> My forehead and cheeks are oily and my nose and around it, is really dry.</li>
            <li> My skin type is dry.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have any dry patches.</li>
            <li> This is one of the products i can NOT live without&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin extra soft and hydrated without a greasy feeling, however I still feel the extra thin layer on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried several, and have never been let down.</li>
            <li> My final step is using this all over my neck and down to my neck.</li>
            <li> product is a Adovia anti wrinkle facial moisturizer cream, infuse your skin with vitamin C, dead sea salt and minerals, lactic acid and collagen for  a maximum long term anti wrinkle effect.</li>
            <li> The Anti Wrinkle cream helps reduce existing wrinkles as well as preventing future lines and wrinkles from forming by keeping skin tight and toned.</li>
            <li> Only had it for a little over a week.</li>
            <li> Adovia Anti-Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer contains dead sea minerals, vitamin C, collagen, retinol, and lactic acid.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only been a few weeks, so</li>
            <li> Adovia Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer Cream - with Dead Sea Minerals, Collagen, Retinol and Lactic Acid - Premier</li>
            <li> careful.</li>
            <li> feel like I&#x27;ve caked it on and others are so thin they really do nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Previously I reviewed their Adovia Moisturizing Day Cream and their Adovia Anti-Aging Facial Life &amp; Firm Serum - both</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish is that the cream was a tad bit less heavy.</li>
            <li> It is infused with Vitamin C, dead sea salt &amp; minerals, along with lactic acid &amp; collagen for long term</li>
            <li> Now that I have given it a try, I have seen a noticeable change for the past two weeks in my overall skin coloration, wrinkles, and tightness of  my face.  </li>
            <li> Cream infused skin with vitamin C, Dead Sea salt &amp; minerals, lactic acid and collagen for maximum long term anti-wrinkle effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unlike any other that I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> Adovia Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer Cream has a thick gel-like consistency (if this even makes any sense) and absorbs into a matte silicone finish.</li>
            <li> There is something about the Dead Sea salt and sulfur that works... Not too harsh and doesn&#x27;t dry me out but keeps the oil and blemishes away.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little thicker than other moisturizers and anti-wrinkle creams I&#x27;ve used, but it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I recommend not to apply on the areas you typically breakout.</li>
            <li> It has the same subtle scent.</li>
            <li> you notice in the advert of this item on Amazon it says RETINOL, that&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li> Gave it 4 stars because it feels a little greasy throughout the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First let me tell you a little about this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I am not a huge fan of it and am quite disappointed in the results thus far, but I want to keep trying it because I don&#x27;t like wasting things/money.</li>
            <li> I order this because it was supposed to have Retinol, Lactic Acid,and Dead Sea Minerals like Salt.</li>
            <li> The Dead</li>
            <li> intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream has Dead Sea Minerals, Seaweed and Aloe Vera.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> The list of vitamins and healing minerals goes on: Collagen, Retinol, Dead Sea Minerals, Seaweed.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using it</li>
            <li> Neither are heavy, and neither have sun protection.</li>
            <li> cream states that it is infused with vitamin C, dead sea salt, minerals, collagen and lactic acid.  </li>
            <li> Has a very unpleasant strong odor</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts, it didn&#x27;t clog my pores or have any other negative effects on my skin.</li>
            <li> It was a little thick going on.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in using moisturizers at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick without feeling heavy and your face feels moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I could only test this product for one</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a really thick, heavy cream</li>
            <li> So adding this to a cream jar form actually renders it useless.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when asked to try this facial moisturizer by Adovia</li>
            <li> It lasts me at least three months because I use very little</li>
            <li> I hate dry skin in general, but it&#x27;s tough around my nose because it&#x27;s not easy to wear makeup and cover it up...</li>
            <li> negative is since I have acne prone, and</li>
            <li> It is thicker than I expected making it difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> I tried this during the day as well because I wanted to see if it would be too thick to wear under make up.  </li>
            <li> can mean the world of a difference.</li>
            <li> It is not some watered down crap like I have seen with other want to be creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any problems with my skin while using this cream.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Adovia.</li>
            <li> It looks worst sometimes, especially when it&#x27;s flaky.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I am not saying its a bad time.  </li>
            <li> It serves as a make-up base or primer as well as moisturizer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was kindly sent this product to review and I have to say when I first got it, the packaging looked elegant because of the glass container which is a tad heavy than other moisturizers and only a con if you accidentally drop it. It has a nice, light-powdery scent. The texture is quite creamy and thick but can be easily blended into the skin. I like how creamy this product is because I feel that it really moisturizes throughout the day. I&#x27;ve been only using this product for a couple of days now so I can&#x27;t really see any of my wrinkles diminishing yet. I&#x27;m sure as with any product and religious use, you can see more results. I do like the claims of this product so I will definitely keep using it especially now that winter is coming along and a thick moisturizer like this is great for the cold weather. The ingredients used in this cream are good for the skin so I would recommend this for those who want to prevent wrinkles and who want to lessen them as well.</li>
            <li> I do love Adovia Products and I think this one is my favorite . It really works well and is easy to use I even like the light scent . I have use other Adovia products and like this one for its complete ingredients and creamy texture #adovia #gotitfree</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a seriously rich facial moisturizer, this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Adovia products. I have tried several, and have never been let down. I simply adore their scent. My whole bathroom smells great- but it is a light scent, nothing overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream goes on very smoothly, and a little bit covers most of my face. I felt like it made my skin look smoother immediately- probably because my skin just soaked up the moisturizer. It is so dry in Phoenix!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and sometimes break out with different products- I have never had that problem with Adovia products. I just have softer, nicer looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for providing a sample of this product for review on my blog.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and I love that it is from Israel and it smells nice. My biggest problem with this cream is that it comes in a jar and not in a tube or pump. When you have a great product that is dispensed from a jar, it tends to become oxidized and loses it&#x27;s stability over a short time. Opening and closing the jar allows air to touch the product, therefore most great products like yours may lose some of it&#x27;s efficacy before the cream is completely used up. It would be great if you could dispense this product differently to increase it&#x27;s staying power.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like this cream. It does not moisturize skin in my opinion. I would not buy the product again.</li>
            <li> Adovia Anti-Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer contains dead sea minerals, vitamin C, collagen, retinol, and lactic acid. Seaweed and aloe vera are also included to help maintain naturally youthful skin. This combination of ingredients helps to smooth out the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles over time, adding to the overall vitality of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream smells wonderful. I also really like the consistency. It’s a little thick, but smooths and absorbs into the skin quite easily. I haven’t been using it long enough to see dramatic results, but I do feel as though my skin looks healthier and more radiant. I prefer using this at night, when I don’t have to worry about thicker products creating an oily effect beneath my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product was provided to facilitate a review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> It is infused with Vitamin C, dead sea salt &amp; minerals, along with lactic acid &amp; collagen for long term effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth, it&#x27;s non greasy and easy to apply. There is no residue after drying and this stuff works! Makes for a great stocking stuffer this season too!</li>
            <li> This is great! I use in under my makeup and right before I go to bed, its not heavy or greasy! Leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome face product. I like to use along with hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C cream for even better results. The price is very affordable which is a plus for me. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Now that I have given it a try, I have seen a noticeable change for the past two weeks in my overall skin coloration, wrinkles, and tightness of  my face.  My eyes look great and my neck looks rather youthful again.  BRAVO to you!  I am recommending this product to all my friends who have experienced facial issues with other skin products.  I will be ordering this again as soon as I get enough money for my next order. Again, I am very grateful and thank you so very much.  Jan C.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Its only been a week and my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell, not an unpleasant smell, I was just surprised because it said no perfume. But it does not irritate my face and i have very sensitive skin. I also love how light it is on my face. It is not a caking moisturizer. I would order again and reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I have several different products by this company and I love them all</li>
            <li> just okay.  It was a little thick going on.</li>
            <li> Adovia has again granted the privilege to me of reviewing another of their fine products. Previously I reviewed their Adovia Moisturizing Day Cream and their Adovia Anti-Aging Facial Life &amp; Firm Serum - both delightful products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Adovia Intensive Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer Cream for about two weeks, morning and evening, and it works very nicely. It is a dense cream but goes on smoothly. It serves as a make-up base or primer as well as moisturizer. I am a firm believer in using moisturizers at least twice a day. I also believe that serums play a great part in the care of our skin, so I use serums as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so delighted to use a product created and produced in Israel with wonderful minerals from the Dead Sea. Other ingredients in this product are acclaimed as being great for the skin, too. This is a fine product, and I am pleased to share it with my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions are solely my own. I was not compensated.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. I use it before derma rolling my face and sometimes in areas where I have stretch marks. It moisturizes really well and doesn&#x27;t leave an icky feeling on my skin. I think I get the most benefit of it when I derma roll after moisturizing. My skin is so much brighter and smoother. I can&#x27;t speak about wrinkles because knock on wood I don&#x27;t have them yet but this is definitely a good prevention for it. I give it a 4 star since it don&#x27;t have an SPF. That would have been so much nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**product was sent to me in return of my honest and unbiased opinion about it. **</li>
            <li> What a wonderful facial moisturizer that really works. It is also non greasy.</li>
            <li> The cream has a pleasant silky feel and leaves no oily residue. I have not really noticed a big improvement in my wrinkles/lines and have been using it nightly for about 6 weeks now. Keeping fingers crossed and hoping to see a measurable difference one of these days if product does what it claims!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Only had it for a little over a week. Definitely a good moisturizer. Gave it 4 stars because it feels a little greasy throughout the day. But my skin feels nice</li>
            <li> I got this as a discounted iten for my review and I orders it for my mom. She Loved it and has now started to order it</li>
            <li> I have used a few other of Adovia&#x27;s moisturizers and have always been happy with their products.  I received this very quickly in the mail and was well wrapped to prevent damage or leaking of the container.  I really like the scent adovia uses for all their moisturizers and hair products. It&#x27;s a nice clean scent.  I used this one before bed and exfoliated and washed my face.  Then, I applied this moisturizer cream and left it on all night. I woke up in the morning and my face was still moisturized.  I am almost 35 and am looking to improve the way I care for my face and prevent wrinkles the best I can.  This cream has a nice thick consistency that absorbs into the skin. I tried this during the day as well because I wanted to see if it would be too thick to wear under make up.  I put my make up on top of it and didn&#x27;t have a shiny face and my makeup didn&#x27;t run.  To me that means I can use it day or night.  The only thing that I did not like is the fact that they use propylparaben to preserve the moisturizer. As such, I gave this 4 stars rather than 5 because it has a paraben to preserve it. I threw the box away that came with it and the container doesn&#x27;t list the ingredients.  I had to look at customer questions and answers to find the information and they had the propylparaben listed in the ingredients when someone asked what the exact ingredients are.  Basically, you need to do your research into preservatives and decide if that ingredient bothers you. Also, it needs spf other than those two issues it was perfect.</li>
            <li> I would like to say I use Adovia Anti Wrinkle cream because my daughter took it . I used it one night and liked it, smells really good and feel nice on your face. My daughter said she loves it her skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li> It has too much perfume in it for me. It worked ok. I just couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of it on my face. So I use it on my hands.</li>
            <li> smells great, goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it and the smell...it&#x27;s only been a few weeks, so I think it&#x27;s doing the job.</li>
            <li> So far so good! have been using it for a week and like how it feels on my skin and looks under my makeup. Whether is psychological or not I feel like my skin is tighter.</li>
            <li> Has a very unpleasant strong odor</li>
            <li> Adovia Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer Cream - with Dead Sea Minerals, Collagen, Retinol and Lactic Acid - Premier Anti Aging Moisturizer - Reduces the Appearance of Existing Wrinkles &amp; Fine Lines &amp; Prevent the Formation of New Wrinkles - Natural Skin Care Solution Facial Cream for Women &amp; Men - Premier Anti Wrinkle Cream.&lt;br /&gt;IF you notice in the advert of this item on Amazon it says RETINOL, that&#x27;s not true. This contains Retinyl palmitate NOT Retinol. Retinyl palmitate is about 20 percent less potent than Retinol, so if you have sensitive skin may be for you. I order this because it was supposed to have Retinol, Lactic Acid,and Dead Sea Minerals like Salt. I was disappointed to find it didn&#x27;t have Retinol but will not return it because it seems to be a pretty good product, so I give it an I like it four star rating. But they need to change their description because it&#x27;s misleading.</li>
            <li> Feels a bit sticky when I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;But, overall I would say I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> careful. this dries out your skin beyond belief. and for $29, i expected much more.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing cream truly brings moisture to my skin.  I like this product because it does what it suppose to do.  My skin feels soft to the touch.  I use it in the morning and before bed.  I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m able to get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  This product was bought at a promotional price for the purpose of a product review.  This is also an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it is just what I wanted.  It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, moisturizing and is quickly absorbed into my skin.  Excellent.</li>
            <li> The Adovia Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream is a luxurious anti-aging moisturizer. I mean it feels amazing on the skin, and it’s a rich formula that does not leave your skin feeling oily, or greasy. Adovia intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream absorbs into the skin fast, leaving your skin moisturized and hydrated. I love the scent, and I was actually surprised that it had a fragrance since the previous products I tried from Adovia Skin Care did not have any scent to them. The scent is light, and fresh. The Adovia Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream has a clean scent that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that my skin especially under the eyes,  looks moisturized and not dry. I can also notice that my fine lines are less visible. My skin feels quenched! The only thing I can say that’s  negative is since I have acne prone, and oily skin, the Adovia Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream is so rich that I noticed that I experienced small pimples around my chin and side of my mouth. I don’t apply the Adovia Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream on my whole face anymore. Instead, I apply it on my forehead, under and around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use Adovia Intensive Anti Wrinkle Cream, and recommend to you if you&#x27;re looking for a rich moisturizing cream that helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and to keep your face hydrated. If you&#x27;re like me and have acne prone skin I recommend not to apply on the areas you typically breakout. Instead apply around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: The Adovia Intensive Anti Wrinkle Cream was sent to me for review purposes. However, the opinions expressed are 100% mine based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> So Happy with this purchase and works great on Arms and Knees too</li>
            <li> I currently use several other Adovia products, and love that they have an anti wrinkle cream. I am obsesses with anti wrinkle products, and love to try new products when they come out. I can honestly say this is a great product. It helps with my dry skin, and also has helped fill int he wrinkles on my forehead, and around my eyes. It is a great product with some high quality ingredients and is well worth the price, contains many of the ingredients as products that cost two to three times the price.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Adovia skincare! The cream is thick without feeling heavy and your face feels moisturized all day. A definite addition to your regimen.</li>
            <li> Hey Everyone, I am going to cut to the chase on this review and let you know right away that I found something I totally love that you can use on your skin! Yep, that&#x27;s right! I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;It is an Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream from Adovia Mineral Skin Care.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many positives about this cream and I am so excited to share!&lt;br /&gt;First let me tell you a little about this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia is a unique skin care line, they combine natural ingredients with modern science to formulate an effective blend of minerals and the finest herbal ingredients nature has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;The vital nutrients, anti-oxidants and minerals present in Adovia products are responsibly gathered at the place closest to the soul of Mother Earth-The Dead Sea!&lt;br /&gt;I think that is so cool!&lt;br /&gt;This intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream has Dead Sea Minerals, Seaweed and Aloe Vera.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said I am totally digging this new cream. It comes in a beautiful glass jar, it weighs 1.7 fl. oz.&lt;br /&gt;You apply generously on to clean face and neck and gently massage in a circular motion until completely absorbed. For best results, use daily. It can also be used as a make up foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I love how this cream, is actual cream. You can feel the quality right away. It is not some watered down crap like I have seen with other want to be creams.&lt;br /&gt;It has a beautiful light fresh scent. After applying you can feel the difference in your skin. It almost seems to instantly wake you up by revitalizing those skin cells. It feels amazing!&lt;br /&gt;After using this only for a week, I can notice such a difference! Yep, I got the Wow factor i have been looking for, which is really hard to do on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Adovia Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Cream is not tested on animals, that is a huge factor for me and I hope it is for you too.&lt;br /&gt;Another positive I want to share with you is that the people at Adovia are very customer friendly.&lt;br /&gt;That can mean the world of a difference. After ordering on Amazon, I actually received a very nice follow up email, addressing any questions or concerns. It is nice to know that Adovia is here for me as a consumer.</li>
            <li> This cream is a must have for any woman over 25, because it not only fights existing wrinkles, but it helps prevent formation of new wrinkles and fine lines.  Adovia’s specially formulated Anti Wrinkle Cream helps firm up your skin to get rid of wrinkles, fine lines, and other age skin issues. With hydrating ingredients like natural Almond Oil and Aloe Vera, this cream will absorb into skin to moisturize and maintain texture and radiance.  With added Silicon and Vitamin A, it promotes skin health and enhances firmness and elasticity while helping to restore equilibrium to the skin’s moisture and pH balance systems. The Anti Wrinkle cream helps reduce existing wrinkles as well as preventing future lines and wrinkles from forming by keeping skin tight and toned. I use this Anti-Wrinkle cream in the morning and in the evening after washing my face and neck everyday for best results. I am glad I was given the chance to review this product.</li>
            <li> Now that I am 40 years old, I have a few fine lines around my eyes, so I was eager to try this free sample of Adovia Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer Cream and review it for you to let you know if I saw any difference with my emerging wrinkles. (Shivers--I hate admitting I have &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34;--&amp;#34;fine lines&amp;#34; sounds so much better.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is thick (thicker than a gel), but it absorbs fast and smells great. It has that distinctive, elegant, powdery &amp;#34;Adovia scent&amp;#34; that I enjoy so much in their other hair and skin products. Don&#x27;t worry, however, if you prefer products without scents; the perfume dissipates quickly. (Sometimes manufacturers must add a bit of scent to cover up the natural odors of ingredients like seaweed, which is used in this cream.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tends to be oily, so I was worried this cream might be too much for me and cause pimples. I used it daily in tandem with Adovia&#x27;s mild anti-acne sulfur soap, however, and that seemed to prevent any outbreaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this cream did not eradicate my fine lines, it did produce a hydrating and plumping effect that hid them for multiple hours at a time, which was nice for when I wanted to look extra fresh, alert and at my best, like for going to a party. I can see how this cream prevents wrinkles from worsening by maintaining the skin&#x27;s moisture balance for hours on end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a feeling that my fine lines near my eyes might require laser treatment to get them to go away entirely; or, alternatively, perhaps if I keep using this Adovia cream for 6 or more months, I might see some greater reversal of the lines. Unfortunately, I could only test this product for one month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a great believer in Dead Sea salts and minerals, seaweed and similar oceanic ingredients for keeping skin hydrated, healthy and supple; Adovia&#x27;s Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer is like a sumptuous skincare buffet of these ingredients. It&#x27;s a great hydrator, especially now asthe cold and dry autumn weather descends upon us, requiring the application of stronger moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, even though I&#x27;m not totally crazy about the scent. (It sort of smells like lipstick.) But it&#x27;s a perfect cream for under makeup, especially in the winter. In the summer, I&#x27;ll use it as a night cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the soap for the past few years and I love it. this is the first time I have used the moisturizer cream. It works just fine though the consistincy is a little firm.  It&#x27;s a good companion product with the soap for firm, soft skin.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, great texture but I swear it actually dries my face out even more! The first week of using it what few wrinkles I am getting (I am 32 years old) looked WAY more visible and the skin on my face began to flake even worse than it did before. So far, I am not a huge fan of it and am quite disappointed in the results thus far, but I want to keep trying it because I don&#x27;t like wasting things/money.</li>
            <li> Great product! Leaves my skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a product review before, EVER,  but I LOVE this product and ALL the Adovia products! They have transformed my skin. MUST try. There is something about the Dead Sea salt and sulfur that works... Not too harsh and doesn&#x27;t dry me out but keeps the oil and blemishes away. Can&#x27;t say enough good things! You can&#x27;t go wrong with Adovia. I&#x27;m 33 and have had adult acne/sensitive skin problems for years. Adovia was the answer.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it night and day, even under makeup. Absorbs completely and leaves my skin feeling great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get it to work but it&#x27;s a really thick, heavy cream so when you try to distribute it around on your face, it practically rips your face off. If you&#x27;re older and prone to hot flashes, this product is so heavy it feels like it makes you sweat more. It has gotten so many great reviews I&#x27;m still trying to get it to work for me but I think I&#x27;ll probably end up sending it back and going back to my Oil of Olay. Oh, it also causes blackheads around the nose too.</li>
            <li> i wish this had worked for me.  I am 66 and have sensitive skin now.  I loved the texture and feeling but after a week I got pimples and red blotches.  I washed my face and put neosporen on them and they went away and I had to send back</li>
            <li> I was given the chance to try this product out and i can honestly say that i dont just like it i love it. Its very rich and creamy and blends with ease. And feels cool and soothing on your skin. I love the little container this comes in also and because it blends so easily it doesnt require much effort or product so it will last you for awhile.</li>
            <li> This Anti-Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer Cream, by Adovia, not only prevents the formation of new wrinkles, but helps reduce the appearance of any fine lines that you may already have. That&#x27;s the toughest thing to accomplish when looking for a skin care product. This is why I always advise my clients to start young with moisturizer and eye cream, before they &amp;#34;need it&amp;#34; (or so they say.) The fact of the matter is that it&#x27;s much easier to preserve what you&#x27;ve got than to try to get it back. So this product is wonderful for all levels of aging, from 20 years old and up, male or female. It has a very light scent that is not too feminine or overpowering. This type of cream should be used daily, after cleansing and before makeup. You will need to add sunscreen to it, as it does not include SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the active ingredients, Vitamin C is a great topical agent and should be used in all skin care regimens. It acts as a very powerful anti-oxidant, which helps slow down the aging process. Lactic Acid is a gentle ingredient derived from Milk, and it is used to break down the cellular glue holding dead skin cells to the fresh young layers of skin beneath them. You will find higher quantities of Lactic Acid in many chemical peels, as it is the most gentle acid of the bunch, but it also goes a long way to have a pinch of it in a daily facial cream. Aloe Vera, of course, has been used for ages and is highly moisturizing and healing, which is why it is frequently used on burn victims. The list of vitamins and healing minerals goes on: Collagen, Retinol, Dead Sea Minerals, Seaweed. This product is packed with proven nourishment that our skin uses to repair and maintain its structure and health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Day cream arrived in a sealed jar for quality protection, holding 50 ml/1.7 oz. The translucent jar was enclosed in an additional white and blue colored box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Another great product! I was lucky enough to receive this for review on my blog and I loved it. It has a pleasant scent and absorbs quickly. I noticed a firmer and smoother texture to my skin after just a week.</li>
            <li> I love anything with Dead Sea minerals. I promise as soon as I applied this to my face, my face looked radiant and glowing. Within a few days of using it I was told what pretty skin I have and no one has ever told me that.</li>
            <li> I completely love Adovia so it is no surprise that i love there anti wrinkle cream the moisture i get from it is amazing i use this right after i wash my face. When i take a shower i use it before and after. With a tiny bit before i leave it on as a face treatment then after to moisturize my face and make sure i do not have my break outs, the smell is so amazing and it makes my face feel so baby soft! This is one of the products i can NOT live without&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Like the Day Cream, this cream is very hydrating. It has the same subtle scent. To be honest, I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference in the two creams. Both make my skin feel hydrated. Neither are heavy, and neither have sun protection. Both absorb well. That said, I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, so it&#x27;s likely I&#x27;m not the best person to be testing this one!  I&#x27;ll keep it in the rotation (especially now that the weather is getting colder), but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Adovia Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer is a lightweight moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave your face oily. This product is perfect to use before I put my makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of moisturizers are thick and do not completely absorb into your face so that when you apply your makeup it turns cakey and uneven.&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer absorbs quickly and leaves my complexion perfectly hydrated. The only makeup I use is the loose mineral kind. So my daily moisturizer really is key in how my makeup looks once applied. With this Adovia product,  I don&#x27;t get powder build up in my fine lines and wrinkles. It&#x27;s the perfect &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; for my mineral makeup.&lt;br /&gt;All of the Adovia products that I&#x27;ve tried have been wonderful and are spa quality.  The Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer is no different.  This is one more Adovia product that I can honestly give a 5 star rating. I can find nothing but good things to say about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a quality moisturizer. Even if you&#x27;re loyal to your current moisturizer, you need to try this one. Like myself, I think you&#x27;ll find you&#x27;re not as loyal anymore. Thanks Adovia!</li>
            <li> I was only given 14 days to test and review this product through Dailydeals.com. I do not think that this is a reasonable fair amount of time to test out a skin product for wrinkles. They need or you need to change the amount of testing the product time to more like 30 days&#x3D;1 month. The only thing I did get out of this short amount of time 14 days was: It made my face feel very soft and almost a silky effect to the product. I did like the way it felt on my face and the smell was minimum which was good also.</li>
            <li> Application: I primarily used this as a nighttime moisturizer since it does not contain SPF. It has a pleasant fragrance that I have come to associate with all Adovia products. The cream is a thick, whipped consistency, but it is fairly light and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy. It absorbs into your skin fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Overall, this was a good lightweight cream with a great, soothing fragrance. I used it for a couple weeks, but I did not notice any vast changes in the quality of my skin. It is a jar of cream, so there is the concern of contamination from dipping your fingers into the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Adovia products and found their products to be the best of the Dead Sea Mineral made beauty products. I completely love Adovia so it is no surprise that I love their anti-wrinkle moisturizer cream. Cream infused skin with vitamin C, Dead Sea salt &amp; minerals, lactic acid and collagen for maximum long term anti-wrinkle effect. Anything made with Dead Sea Minerals really helps and improves my skin. I do not have my break outs Reason being, they are always using natural ingredients, I never feel my skin drying out or becoming greasy during the day and I get this feeling of smooth and soft skin every day long. Cream also contains silicon and vitamin A, which increase the firmness and overall vitality of skin. I really enjoy using this cream, too.  It goes on a little thicker than other moisturizers and anti-wrinkle creams I&#x27;ve used, but it is not greasy. It absorbs easily, and leaves you with a refreshed feeling.  I like to use it at morning underneath my foundation, it makes a great base.&lt;br /&gt;This is one cream that I&#x27;m going to add to my list of beauty needs.  I really, really like it.  It&#x27;s unlike any other that I&#x27;ve used before.  I have received and review a lot of ant wrinkle cream but Adovia do not stop to impress me with quality of product and promises that there made.</li>
            <li> Very oily and the allergic to the fragrance.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer cream that works well</li>
            <li> What an amazing beauty product , this product arrived just as described . This product arrived in a timely manner and was packaged perfectly , it arrived in excellent condition .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a Adovia anti wrinkle facial moisturizer cream, infuse your skin with vitamin C, dead sea salt and minerals, lactic acid and collagen for  a maximum long term anti wrinkle effect.This anti wrinkle facial cream smooths out the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles over time. Seaweed and premier aloe vera feed skin it&#x27;s needed nutrients for maintaining naturally youthful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really great moisturizer for youthful and healthy looking skin, I have been using it for about a week now .I already find it is taking away some of the fine lines, but it is making my skin really soft and rejuvenated .My skin feels softer and more supple after applying , it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or slimy feel it absorbs right into your skin beautifully .This is another great product we all need to add to our beauty regime .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this wonderful moisturizer .</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream on my face at night after showering and I love it.  No breakouts of any kind.  My skin loves it.  Seems a bit thick and greasy right when you put it on but actually absorbs quite quickly.  Pleasant smell, not too overpowering.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin. My forehead and cheeks are oily and my nose and around it, is really dry. I hate dry skin in general, but it&#x27;s tough around my nose because it&#x27;s not easy to wear makeup and cover it up... It looks worst sometimes, especially when it&#x27;s flaky. I have been using the Adovia Moisturizing Cream for about 3 weeks and have definitely notice a change for the better. It does have a nice clean scent to it, a slight perfume smell. It is a bit thicker in consistency, but it&#x27;s lightweight and it was easy to apply and absorbed quickly into my skin. I personally only needed to use it once a day. I usually applied it right before I put on my makeup. My skin did feel softer and well-moisturized after I applied the cream all over my face. I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts, it didn&#x27;t clog my pores or have any other negative effects on my skin. Overall, I&#x27;ve had a pretty good experience with this product. I love that it is dermatologist tested and hypoallergenic, great for all skin types. I have had some great luck with products I have tried from Adovia... I am definitely a fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Just received my second jar of Adovia Anti Wrinkle Moisturizer and have to put in my two cents.  It lasts me at least three months because I use very little and it covers well and stays on all day.  I am 79+ years old and am mistaken for at least 20 years younger, thanks to my mother who had beautiful skin. I have already outlived her by almost three years and my skin is relatively wrinkle free and I hope to keep it that way for as long as I can.  Cleansing my skin is akin to brushing my teeth both morning and night and using my skin care products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Adovia products, and this one did not disappoint me at all! Now that the colder, drier seasons are here, I find myself changing up my skincare routine. This has been a great new addition to my daily skincare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this at night, after I have showered and have a fresh clean face. I apply my serums, oils, and anything else that I may use at night. My final step is using this all over my neck and down to my neck. I wake up in the morning with super soft, hydrated, glowing skin. I love that this has a great texture, not too thick, and not greasy. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, mostly just a natural type of scent. I have been using this daily for about a month, and I still have plenty of product to work through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I am 26 years old, so I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles. However I like to use skincare products now to help prevent wrinkles later. My skin type is dry. And I have sensitive skin. I have not experienced any problems with my skin while using this cream. My skin seems to love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> Adovia Anti Wrinkle Facial Moisturizer Cream has a thick gel-like consistency (if this even makes any sense) and absorbs into a matte silicone finish. It leaves the skin extra soft and hydrated without a greasy feeling, however I still feel the extra thin layer on my skin. It does work great as a makeup base, as it feels like it evens out the skin and makes pores appear smaller. Be sure that the cream is fully absorbed into the skin, otherwise your face will look cakey. It does not have too strong of a scent to it, pleasant or unpleasant depending on your taste. I find it just fine, it does not bother me in any way. I also noticed that using this cream makes my skin look brighter. I have combination skin that is acne prone, however this cream has not clogged my pores and does not break me out which is why I like it. The only thing I wish is that the cream was a tad bit less heavy. Simply it is a bit of a heavier moisturizer than the others I usually use and that is why I like to use it sometimes before I go to bed as a night cream, and wake up with a baby soft skin, rather than using it as a daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
            <li> I have used Adovia skincare products before and just loved them.  I recently received a bottle of this cream for review.  I used it for about a month before writing this review.  Normally with skincare products it takes about a month before you start seeing real results if the moisturizer states that it does more then just make your face soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream states that it is infused with vitamin C, dead sea salt, minerals, collagen and lactic acid.  All these ingredients actually are considered very good for the skin and are proven to help promote cell turnover and help diminish the looks of fine lines and wrinkles.  However, while I love the fact that this cream is so well formulated, the only downfall is that it comes in a jar.  It has also been proven that jar creams help to render many ingredients useless because of the constant exposure to light and air.  Vitamin C for example is an antioxidant and breaks down with light and air.  So adding this to a cream jar form actually renders it useless.  It would be more appropriate that the company step away from jar products and start putting their creams in air tight pumps which also helps to disallow bacteria to contaminate the product due to sticking your fingers in the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream was great in hydrating the face.  It really helped with my dryness and didn&#x27;t clog my pores.  It wasn&#x27;t runny and didn&#x27;t sting my eyes because it has no fragrance or perfume added in which is awesome.  I can&#x27;t stand companies who feel the need to make their creams smell good. While yes it might smell good; fragrances and perfumes in face creams are actually irritants for the skin and a big no no.  So if you ever pick up a cream in general that smells good..run.  You would never put normal perfume on your face, so why put that in a cream!? Now with that being said, this product did have a smell to it.  But I think that comes from some of the natural ingredients found in it cream that naturally produce their own smells.  However checking the ingredient list, the company did not seem to add anything extra that would synthetically produce a smell.  So that is a bonus for sure!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked using this cream at night, but not so much during the day. I found that this cream took a bit to absorb during the day.  So I mostly used it at night.  With that being said, I am not saying its a bad time.  Since we all have different skin types, some things absorb quicker/better into certain skin types.  Nonetheless this did leave my skin looking glowy, healthy and not greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this cream is you like mostly natural ingredients in your skincare products!  It is really worth a try! The only reason I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is because of the jar packaging.  Outside of that, this cream is really good!</li>
            <li> This cream leaves my face feeling smooth and soft. I have only used the product for 1 week so I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my wrinkles but my face definately feels tighter. It has a nice smell and is very smooth to apply. It also makes it easier to apply my makeup and helps my face powder stay on longer.</li>
            <li> I like it in general. It is thicker than I expected making it difficult to put on. I&#x27;m still waiting for results.</li>
            <li> I love this all natural anti aging cream! It has been working wonders on my sensitive skin and it has been truly brightening my complexion. I have tried some of Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Minerals line/products and I can honestly say that they make some of the best in the market. I have tried so many anti aging creams in the past, that leaves my skin screaming for more moisture...so I was pleasantly surprised because such was not the case with Adovia! I am hooked on this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like Adovia anti wrinkle cream.I always like how it makes my skin feel. Tight and smooth. I am so glad it&#x27;s finally sold at Amazon for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> This is the first face moisurizer I have ever used that I can see a difference in my skin. My skin feels more toned &amp; the wrinkles seem less around my eyes. I am very happy with this product &amp; will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I like to apply a light facial moisturizer to my face before applying any foundation or powder, I just think it makes the make up go on easier and everyone should be applying a moisturizer to their face, especially in the dryness of the desert of Las Vegas where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers and some are too oily, some are too thick and make any make up I wear feel like I&#x27;ve caked it on and others are so thin they really do nothing at all. It&#x27;s rare to find a really great facial moisturizer that has everything I&#x27;m looking for including a great feel, great scent, non greasy and moisturizing capabilities. So let me tell you I was skeptical when asked to try this facial moisturizer by Adovia but I&#x27;m willing to give pretty much anything a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did this moisturizer have everything I&#x27;m looking for but it is a great primer for foundation. My make up didn&#x27;t streak, become clumpy or rub off. It went on smoothly and stayed on all day. I also applied this moisturizer at night after taking my make up off and cleansing my face and my face feels smooth, soft and I don&#x27;t have any dry patches. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this facial moisturizer from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclaimer, I received item for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Good product as described.</li>
            <li> Helps keep the skin looking young and beautiful</li>
            <li> This product is very good for dry skin in winter, but in summer I would prefer something in much lighter consistency.</li>
            <li> Good product as described.</li>
