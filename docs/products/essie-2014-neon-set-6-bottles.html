            <li>She&#x27;s so happy</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>These are neons in the sense that they&#x27;re bright and have some neon pigment, but I wouldn&#x27;t call these in your face neons.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s great on its own).</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase and felt the price was just right!</li>
            <li>I love the bright colors.  </li>
            <li>colors though are really nice.</li>
            <li>So fresh and beautiful looking.</li>
            <li>I love Essie nail polish.</li>
            <li>in all, if you know going in that they&#x27;re going to be a pain to apply (and most neons are), and then take the time to properly apply them, you&#x27;ll be very happy with the payoff.</li>
            <li>Although I love these colors..</li>
            <li>I am glad I rushed to get this collection.</li>
            <li>I love them all.</li>
            <li>I love Essie</li>
            <li>and I love these colors.  </li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>Love this colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a nail polish buff and love Essie polishes -</li>
            <li>Love the summer colors.</li>
            <li>environmental  friendly nail polish that ranks better than most in exposure to toxins.</li>
            <li>This 6 full bottle set of Neons is exceptional in pigmentation and bold in color.</li>
            <li>These colors are wonderful, I have had tons of fun mixing and matching different looks.  </li>
            <li>Cracks very quickly for the price.</li>
            <li>The colors are great and very well packed, everything was brand new!</li>
            <li>;) I am!O:-)</li>
            <li>Once you do get a solid color however, the polishes are very neon, very bright and very fun.</li>
            <li>Be bold, Be free....</li>
            <li>Chipped off right away!</li>
            <li>Ni gift bag, each is bubble wrapped and is true Essie product.</li>
            <li>Half or more of these shades don&#x27;t look as good on as in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I received this order super fast, the colors were awesome (of course), and they threw in little surprises too!</li>
            <li>Thick, brilliant color to showcase your tooties awaits.</li>
            <li>These colors are so pretty.  </li>
            <li>They look exactly like the photo</li>
            <li>BUT I&#x27;m realizing that their colors that are so pretty in the bottle are really translucent when applying!</li>
            <li>It needed another coat and it chopped within the first day.</li>
            <li>Also, be aware this high quality polish drys fast...</li>
            <li>These nail polishes aren&#x27;t very opaque like many other colors in the Essie line.</li>
            <li>and I got several compliments on the blue and purple colors; however, the color chips pretty easily.</li>
            <li>The only bottle here that was worth</li>
            <li>They dried sort of matte and so easy to peel off.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, each nail polish can individually wrapped in bubble wrap.  </li>
            <li>The pink and 2 blue colors chipped so quickly</li>
            <li>I found them to be very different than what was out there in terms of neon collections and they really pop over white (except Chills and Thrills</li>
            <li>You need to work fast with these, and be very careful not to go over the same spot twice otherwise you&#x27;ll streak and get bald spots and sometimes lumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> And my message to other old ladies out there?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every one of these except Too Taboo and found that they are streaky, hard to work with and really need three coats to become opaque.</li>
            <li> As a regular user I expected more :-(</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Essie is really slipping.</li>
            <li> I went to nail salon and took the pink color with me to have them apply it.</li>
            <li> I have alread tried the pink, the turquoise and the purple.</li>
            <li> Do not be discouraged at other reviews suggesting this is Gel color...</li>
            <li> Only now, in these - my &amp;#34;Golden Years&amp;#34; - have I found the courage to go beyond red and pink and sashay into the dangerous land of purple and green nail polish.  </li>
            <li> The wear times on these are also pretty bad, but thats to be expected with neon colors.</li>
            <li> The green and peach colors are not shiny when you put them on and take about 5 coats so you cannot not your nail underneath.</li>
            <li> I usually swear by Essie..</li>
            <li> I have to apply at least 3 coats for a solid color even when using their &#x27;First Base&#x27; base coat.</li>
            <li> much less expensive buying this way</li>
            <li> You will not go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> The polish itself is very very thin.  </li>
            <li> I am sadly disappointed with this batch.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in Essie..</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so annoying.</li>
            <li> So - rock on with your bad self!</li>

            <li> wife loves the colors. much less expensive buying this way</li>
            <li> The colors are great and very well packed, everything was brand new! Defintily get from this source and these colors are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I love Essie nail polish. This was not what I expected. The colors all chipped within a day of painting. The green and peach colors are not shiny when you put them on and take about 5 coats so you cannot not your nail underneath. The pink and 2 blue colors chipped so quickly I was finding flakes of them all over the place. The only bottle here that was worth it was the purple. I am sadly disappointed with this batch. Essie is really slipping.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, each nail polish can individually wrapped in bubble wrap.  These colors are wonderful, I have had tons of fun mixing and matching different looks.  You will not go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> These are neons in the sense that they&#x27;re bright and have some neon pigment, but I wouldn&#x27;t call these in your face neons. I&#x27;ve tried every one of these except Too Taboo and found that they are streaky, hard to work with and really need three coats to become opaque. You need to work fast with these, and be very careful not to go over the same spot twice otherwise you&#x27;ll streak and get bald spots and sometimes lumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;he colors though are really nice. I found them to be very different than what was out there in terms of neon collections and they really pop over white (except Chills and Thrills, that&#x27;s great on its own). The wear times on these are also pretty bad, but thats to be expected with neon colors. The longest wearing one I had on was Chills and Thrills which lasted 5-6 days, but that was because I had a layer of gel on underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you know going in that they&#x27;re going to be a pain to apply (and most neons are), and then take the time to properly apply them, you&#x27;ll be very happy with the payoff.</li>
            <li> I went to nail salon and took the pink color with me to have them apply it. I gave the nail polish 5 stars because it stayed on for 2 weeks, and the color was beautiful.</li>
            <li> I usually swear by Essie..Although I love these colors..The polish itself is very very thin.  My stylist had to apply 3 coats and it still is almost see through.  Disappointed in Essie..As a regular user I expected more :-(</li>
            <li> I am glad I rushed to get this collection. I love them all. So fresh and beautiful looking. I have alread tried the pink, the turquoise and the purple. Now on to the orange. Very happy with this purchase and felt the price was just right!</li>
            <li> Amazing Essie strikes again!!. This 6 full bottle set of Neons is exceptional in pigmentation and bold in color. Ni gift bag, each is bubble wrapped and is true Essie product. Do not be discouraged at other reviews suggesting this is Gel color...IT IS NOT GEL COLOR!. This is a great deal for phymaldahide...(embalming fluid fee oops) environmental  friendly nail polish that ranks better than most in exposure to toxins. Also, be aware this high quality polish drys fast...Thick, brilliant color to showcase your tooties awaits. Be bold, Be free....Be an Essie Summer Neon girl!!;) I am!O:-)</li>
            <li> Only now, in these - my &amp;#34;Golden Years&amp;#34; - have I found the courage to go beyond red and pink and sashay into the dangerous land of purple and green nail polish.  Yes, I know.  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;controversial&amp;#34; for a Boomer to actually &amp;#34;boom&amp;#34; like this.  But what the hey-nonny-nonny.  I love Essie and I love these colors.  And my message to other old ladies out there?  Purple nails make younger hands.  So - rock on with your bad self!</li>
            <li> I received this order super fast, the colors were awesome (of course), and they threw in little surprises too! I was VERY happy with my order!</li>
            <li> Essie colors are awesome! I love them</li>
            <li> These nail polishes aren&#x27;t very opaque like many other colors in the Essie line. I have to apply at least 3 coats for a solid color even when using their &#x27;First Base&#x27; base coat. Once you do get a solid color however, the polishes are very neon, very bright and very fun.</li>
            <li> Love this colors. great quality.</li>
            <li> These are not neon, they are great colors but Essie doesn&#x27;t understand what neon means</li>
            <li> We have these at the salon that I work at and when I used them on our clients, I had to have these for myself at home.  These colors are so pretty.  Love Essie!!!</li>
            <li> I love the bright colors.  They look exactly like the photo and I got several compliments on the blue and purple colors; however, the color chips pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Got this for a birthday gift for my niece. She&#x27;s so happy I&#x27;m now the awesome Aunt. She&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail polish buff and love Essie polishes - BUT I&#x27;m realizing that their colors that are so pretty in the bottle are really translucent when applying! It&#x27;s so annoying. Half or more of these shades don&#x27;t look as good on as in the bottle. Too Taboo and the darker blue one work well - the others are just too sheer.</li>
            <li> Cracks very quickly for the price.</li>
            <li> Love the summer colors.</li>
            <li> The bottles I received were nothing like the Essie I buy in the stores. It needed another coat and it chopped within the first day. Very disappointing</li>
            <li> For some reason this polish had a different texture and outcome. They dried sort of matte and so easy to peel off. This was the fist time buying essie polish off of amazon and last. I use essie polish all the time but for some reason buying it off amazon the quality was different.</li>
            <li> Chipped off right away!</li>
    </ol>
