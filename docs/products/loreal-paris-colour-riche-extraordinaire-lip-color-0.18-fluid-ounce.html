            <li>Perfect by itself or to add to lipstick.</li>
            <li>Loved the color and the glossiness!</li>
            <li>The perfect nude for tanned skin even goes good by itself</li>
            <li>It looks great alone or with a lip stick underneath.</li>
            <li>It matches the photo perfectly and I love the packaging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great mixture of a nude and peach and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>received this product in a timely fashion, loved the price and everything about this lip color.  </li>
            <li>Good to use and shine all the day if don&#x27;t eat it</li>
            <li>It is a rich color and goes on creamy and has a wonderful smell to it.</li>
            <li>The most beautiful moist color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was great, and I would buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li>Great rich color!</li>
            <li>Love the shade!</li>
            <li>Love this lip gloss!</li>
            <li>but this gloss is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have found the perfect nude color lipstick thanks to L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not talking about a difference between what 2 people think smells nice.</li>
            <li>The color is a nice nude shade and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Nice neutral lipgloss with a very sweet smell.</li>
            <li>My favorite shade is Nude Ballet because it goes with everything and flatters most skin tones.  </li>
            <li>Another plus: no really nasty taste!</li>
            <li>Adorable color but quality doesn&#x27;t match price, maybe if it were a two pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the color as a lip gloss, but I purchased it believing it was more pigmented as a lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>I would never be able to put this on without using a mirror or if I was in a hurry (which I always am).  </li>
            <li>I really love this color..</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>GREAT ,THE COOL OR WAS RIGHT ON, VERY MOISTURIZING, STYS</li>
            <li>It glides on easily and is rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>Nude ballet is one of the few shades I&#x27;ve been really impressed by.</li>
            <li>Doesnt taste cheap either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy to reapply, and works for my preferred nude style of makeup application.</li>
            <li>The lip color glides on smoothly and has a slightly sweet taste.  </li>
            <li>so I was excited to get this.</li>
            <li>This is a sweet smelling and&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>I love this so much.</li>
            <li>First, the case is cute, the applicator is nice, and I like that you can see what color you are getting via that small window on the case -- no stumbling around to read the fine print on the bottom of the package like with most lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful even with my pale skin tone.</li>
            <li>Also, most richly pigmented lip colors are really drying for me, but this is very moisturizing and requires no chapstick underneath.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky and smears easily.  </li>
            <li>This went right in the trash.</li>
            <li>I really like the entire Colour Riche lip line, and own 3 of the colors at the moment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned with a slight olive tone and brown eyes)</li>
            <li>lasting sexy shiny nude&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for summer&lt;br /&gt;Subtle but</li>
            <li>Love the natural subtle color and smells good.</li>
            <li>I will definitely stick with this brand for a while and hope they put out some more shades, particularly some lighter ones which make the lips look fuller.  </li>
            <li>IF ONLY I COULD BE AS HAPPY ABOUT MY SPODE WASTE NASKET, THAT I NEBER HAVE SEEN</li>
            <li>I expected more color pay off.</li>
            <li>I have light, yellow/golden undertoned asian skin.</li>
            <li>It also disappears fast after taking a sip of anything.  </li>
            <li>Also, the applicator CONCEPT is good but my applicator in actuality is too wide and the product applies in a (not a technical term...)</li>
            <li>I love nude/pink lip colors, and this is just right for my pale skin.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of it and color is very natural and pretty.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s a lovely product.</li>
            <li>I have many other lip glosses</li>
            <li>It does not make your lips dry or cracked, it leaves them soft and smooth and lasts for a few good hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>classic color&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this color and L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>A little too &amp;#34;glossy&amp;#34; I wanted something with a bit more staying power but what can ya do?</li>
            <li>It a true nude shade, no hint of any other color.  </li>
            <li>it is pretty glossy, and can be sticky, especially if you have long hair that tends to blow into your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sweet which often causes me to lick my lips and dry them out, but it&#x27;s not disgusting either; simply no taste at all.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding nude shades I enjoy.</li>
            <li>Sticky and much glossier than expected.</li>
            <li>Gives me that slight bit of nude color with a little shimmer which I love in the summer months.</li>
            <li>so much I bought it in two other colors.</li>
            <li>A little too much pearlessecnce for my taste-</li>

            <li> My only small quibble is that the color doesn&#x27;t last a real long time; i must reapply several times per day.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just not worth the hassle of sending it back.</li>
            <li> Nude Ballet is the percent beige pink color</li>
            <li> A little can go a long way!</li>
            <li> This is a lip gloss, not a true lipstick.  </li>
            <li> No more $35 lipsticks for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I may have gotten an old bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick and does not stay on for a lengh of time.</li>
            <li> This is all kinds of wrong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why mine smells awful</li>
            <li> Mine smells so bad that I don&#x27;t want to apply it to my lips...</li>
            <li> so I had to order another one :(</li>
            <li> The smell of this is horrible!  </li>
            <li> It also leaves a terrible taste in my mouth when I use it.  </li>

            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Colour Riche Extraordinaire Lip Color, Nude Ballet, 0.18.  received this product in a timely fashion, loved the price and everything about this lip color.  appreciate the prompt delivery of this item too.</li>

            <li> This is surprisingly long lasting (will need reapplication after eating) Nude Ballet is the percent beige pink color</li>
            <li> Nude ballet is my go to lip color. I wish it came in a lipstick but this gloss is amazing.</li>
            <li> Omg this is the best lipgloss I&#x27;ve ever had. The perfect nude for tanned skin even goes good by itself</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding nude shades I enjoy. I have light, yellow/golden undertoned asian skin. Nude ballet is one of the few shades I&#x27;ve been really impressed by. It is a rich color and goes on creamy and has a wonderful smell to it. A little can go a long way!

Word of warning, though... it is pretty glossy, and can be sticky, especially if you have long hair that tends to blow into your face.</li>
            <li> Adorable color but quality doesn&#x27;t match price, maybe if it were a two pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For a reference I&#x27;m fair skinned with a slight olive tone and brown eyes)</li>
            <li> The most beautiful moist color.</li>
            <li> This is a lip gloss, not a true lipstick.  I like the color as a lip gloss, but I purchased it believing it was more pigmented as a lipstick.  It cannot be worn without a lipstick and liner.  It is very sticky and smears easily.  It also disappears fast after taking a sip of anything.  I have many other lip glosses I prefer over this one.</li>
            <li> Good to use and shine all the day if don&#x27;t eat it</li>
            <li> I love this color.  Gives me that slight bit of nude color with a little shimmer which I love in the summer months.</li>
            <li> GREAT ,THE COOL OR WAS RIGHT ON, VERY MOISTURIZING, STYS ON WELL ,, IWOULDRECOMMEND THIS TO FRIENDS, IF ONLY I COULD BE AS HAPPY ABOUT MY SPODE WASTE NASKET, THAT I NEBER HAVE SEEN</li>
            <li> Love the natural subtle color and smells good. Doesnt taste cheap either.</li>
            <li> This is all kinds of wrong! I&#x27;m not sure why mine smells awful but it does. I&#x27;m not talking about a difference between what 2 people think smells nice. Mine smells so bad that I don&#x27;t want to apply it to my lips... aroma keeps wafting up to my olfactory senses!  Arggh! It&#x27;s just not pleasant.  Also, the applicator CONCEPT is good but my applicator in actuality is too wide and the product applies in a (not a technical term...) gloppy fashion. I would never be able to put this on without using a mirror or if I was in a hurry (which I always am).  That all said, the color is the only thing I DO like about this product.  I&#x27;m afraid I may have gotten an old bottle but it&#x27;s just not worth the hassle of sending it back.</li>
            <li> I adore L&#x27;oreal products so I was excited to get this. I really love this color.. It matches the photo perfectly and I love the packaging. I love nude/pink lip colors, and this is just right for my pale skin. It&#x27;s a great mixture of a nude and peach and looks amazing. It looks great alone or with a lip stick underneath. It does not make your lips dry or cracked, it leaves them soft and smooth and lasts for a few good hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was great, and I would buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this so much. I am buying it in twos. Perfect by itself or to add to lipstick.</li>
            <li> Love this lip gloss! The color is a nice nude shade and I love the scent. It smells like apricots to me. I don&#x27;t find it sticky and I like that it&#x27;s not shimmery or glittery. I like the lip gloss so much I bought it in two other colors.</li>
            <li> Loved the color and the glossiness!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful even with my pale skin tone. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I lost it the second day though so I had to order another one :(</li>
