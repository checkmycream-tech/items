            <li>I really love these lashes.</li>
            <li>and I like my eyelashes to look more thicker and longer than most eyelashes</li>

            <li>:) I will be ordering more pairs soon. :)</li>
            <li>I was really pleased with my lashes.</li>

            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>many.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have to say these lashes are durable even more so than the ones in the store.&lt;br</li>

            <li>and I had to cut the ends but definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li>She was so excited!</li>
            <li>Eye lashes where full and long you can reuse each pair about 6 7 times or more just depends on how much mascara you use Happy happy!</li>
            <li>but, the quality for what i wanted them for is nice and exactly what i needed for fantasy creatures and play makeup!</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast..and for the price, theyre really good eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I bought my first pack almost 2 months ago and am still able to re-use these lashes!</li>
            <li>but you will need to do some trimming to the inner and outer of the lash and have really good glue!</li>
            <li>and they go on so easily.  </li>
            <li>Cheap eyelashes, good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply .</li>
            <li>easy to use.    </li>
            <li>Strong packaging as well.  </li>
            <li>and they looked good with the makeup i used which was vibrant and bold!</li>
            <li>but for the most part and price they&#x27;re cool</li>
            <li>Full and light weight !</li>
            <li>I have taken one and cut it in half to use as accents, this seems to be the best for me.  </li>
            <li>then they are fine.</li>
            <li>- Super Hermosas !</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and immidiate!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super cute when I do wear them.</li>
            <li>The shipping was nice and got here fast before date.</li>
            <li>they feel so light on my lashes</li>
            <li>and I have to say that in the beginning when I was learning to apply lashes these were fantastic.</li>
            <li>Definitely cheap and plastic-y.</li>
            <li>i should have known they were going to be cheap.</li>
            <li>and I actually enjoy the way they look.</li>
            <li>May need to be cut to fit but no complaints.</li>
            <li>well there is some for the cheap prize i bought them because it was cheaper then</li>
            <li>I just ordered these lashes a few days ago and there AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>These eyelashes are great for Halloween only!</li>
            <li>1) since they&#x27;re from asia, they are cheaply made and NO glue included.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Some of the eyelashes were rolling around in the cheap looking box.</li>
            <li>These eyelashes were fantastic.</li>
            <li>They look and feel cheap.</li>
            <li>Shipping was free from China, and came 2 weeks sooner than posted.</li>
            <li>and i dont care for these since they were so cheap and it works for them.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>they seem a bit hard to get on at first, but if you insist they do the job PERFECTLY and last all night without needing to replace or add glue to them!!! :D</li>
            <li>I bought these eylashes thinking I would try something new, and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love these eyelashes so much!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>They were super cheap, and look super cheap.</li>
            <li>They stayed right where I put them all night and were easy to peel off.</li>
            <li>Pathetic have worked perfectly for what I need, there are so many for an impeccable price!</li>
            <li>The thickness is just about right!</li>
            <li>They are cheap as well, but they look more realistic compared to these pairs.</li>
            <li>I do not suggest these, spend the couple extra dollars on good ones.</li>
            <li>I wore them and everyone instantly noticed them... in a good way.</li>
            <li>very affordable , amazing turn out they are very reusable  and comfortable</li>
            <li>and they were such a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a BAD product, it&#x27;s just that I cant find the use for them as of this moment.</li>
            <li>Not bad for $3.99...</li>
            <li>To be fair the price was super low  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure how thick but not thick at all just like the rest perfect</li>
            <li>super recommended</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars, is that I&#x27;m sure that there&#x27;s better quality ones out there.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more and recomending these to as many people as possible!</li>
            <li>I love ordering these style of eyelashes in different varieties and to be able to swith the look up on your eye</li>
            <li>Quick delivery...was expecting them on the 9th, but got them today (Friday 1/5/2013).</li>
            <li>And super affordable.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re super un-natural plastic</li>
            <li>have much more expensive sets and these are not bad lots of sizes and the quality is good they go on very easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beyond happy with them, and it cost me 59 dollars less</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t constantly FEEL like long lashes which is the best thing.</li>
            <li>The best thing about them is that one pair will last a long time ..when you take them off they do not change shape ..</li>
            <li>Those are the only minimal complaints I have about this product, but other than that they did look great and the price and quantity of the product is awesome.</li>
            <li>They look real!!</li>
            <li>definately plan on inverting a little more for better quality would not buy again!</li>
            <li>I definitely will be buying more!</li>
            <li>The thickness doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but I had to trim them a bit for it to properly fit on my eyes.</li>
            <li>They shipped mighty fast</li>
            <li>great for cosplay or everyday wear.</li>
            <li>I thought the owners would have more decency to make our packages more private and the word EYELASHES smacked on the package didn&#x27;t help too much.</li>
            <li>They arrived on time, but I thought they&#x27;d look more natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with the extra attention they need because they look fantastic</li>
            <li>They take a while to receive but its worth the wait.</li>
            <li>They are very durable and pretty easy to work with if you know what your doing.  </li>
            <li>I have used different glues and none have been able to seal the edges down for more than an hour at most!</li>

            <li>Cute different sizes I like to double up very realistic looking super fair price</li>
            <li>most drug stores charge 4.50 and up for a decent pair, and i want the most for my buck , this box will last me 20 nites out dancing with my friends</li>
            <li>(I have worn false eyelashes off and on for a good 7 years and can work a pretty cheap falsy into functioning most of the time)</li>
            <li>These lashes are good on the other hand they do feel a bit plasticy but what can you expect.  </li>
            <li>If you are unsure if these are the right type of lash for you, I say for the price go ahead and just try them :</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t seem to be the right ones in the picture.</li>
            <li>right ahead boo boo....</li>
            <li>I usually get 2 or 3 wears out of each pair, and at this price, I think that&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>They are kind of long though, just what I asked for.</li>
            <li>They look natural, and are not too much over the top.</li>
            <li>and they took about 2 and a half weeks to get here which is pretty good sense</li>
            <li>Their very light and look very real when I put them on definitely buying them again</li>
            <li>May be fine for a night out on the town, but not everyday use</li>
            <li>Got here faster than I thought such a great deal so many for such a low price I am definitely getting more</li>
            <li>Shipping time was surprisingly fast as well, being that they are coming the whole way from Hong Kong!!</li>
            <li>They really last a lot of time, a lot, and are beautiful in all ways, very full and thick.</li>
            <li>First off, they had to be trimmed to shape</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so pretty  </li>
            <li>*** that hahaha!</li>
            <li>At first I was like \\&quot;ummm, they look like too much/too fake\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but once I put them on they were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The quality of the hair was pretty neat</li>
            <li>My first pair of lashes never arived (</li>
            <li>first let me say it was my first time putting falsies on....</li>
            <li>and I hope to do more business with this seller in the future.</li>
            <li>I Love the Asian type of lettering on the box!</li>
            <li>Definitely buying these again :)</li>
            <li>I really like them!</li>
            <li>Plus they arrived at my home (in kentucky) much faster than it said they would!</li>
            <li>They are long and soft so that is good.</li>
            <li>i got another set i will repeat this review , they are exactly alike</li>
            <li>They will be good for going out on a date with my husband, but not for everyday use.</li>
            <li>i cut them down to fit my eyes and they look really cute</li>
            <li>I ordered these because the price was great and because the other reviews sounded like they would be good, and in the picture you can&#x27;t really tell just how thick they are!</li>
            <li>I definitely feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth!!</li>
            <li>and they arent really curved to fit your natural eyelid</li>
            <li>Just to enhance the look from a distance, so i totally am pleasesd an will purchace more in the future easy to apply to someone else</li>
            <li>There ok it just feels a little heavy on my eyes, ive seem some pictures of some women wearing them and they look great on them</li>
            <li>and I wear them pretty much every day</li>
            <li>extremely long i thought it would be a much better quality..</li>
            <li>i love dramatic lashes and these are nice</li>
            <li>I decided to give these lashes a try, i love wearing lashes since i hardly have any of my own anymore so fake lashes make a huge difference on me and make my eys pop :) ...and for the price of these you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li>wore my first pair to work (im a dancer) and they held up very well, kept them on while i slept and everything for three days straight</li>
            <li>A pair will last me a good 2 weeks of daily use, mainly since the band is much thicker than those of drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>These were ok, they are too long and look drag queen like but ok for the night out in town.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with these false lashes, they&#x27;re pretty and good quality for the low price.</li>
            <li>They are so beautiful and add a dramatic touch to your face stay on all day when using duo lash adhesive</li>
            <li>Very cheap and awkward, but good for the price.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>These dont bend how I anted, &amp; they dont hold glue very well.</li>
            <li>I really like them soo much     </li>
            <li>I really like these eyelashes.</li>
            <li>i really dont like this</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look anything like real lashes.</li>
            <li>THEY LOOK VERY NICE.LOT</li>
            <li>I had people thinking they were my real eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The benefit of them not being made of real hair is that they don&#x27;t get clumped up and ruined by mascara.</li>
            <li>-)--------I took a star off because you really have to work with them to conform to your eyes.</li>
            <li>They are very lightweight</li>
            <li>really makes my eyes pop.</li>
            <li>And the lashes look too much like plastic</li>
            <li>I really like using these lashes.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t very durable, but for the price I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really complain for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>but they are so much cheaper</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much for them.i</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.they just went straight for the trash</li>
            <li>However, the quality of lashes leaves much to be desired.  </li>
            <li>The are so real like and they are truly reusable.</li>
            <li>If you prefer real hair falsies</li>
            <li>Yes they do not FEEL real.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be a great buy since I was really tired of paying $10 to get a strip lash put on or $80</li>
            <li>The eyelashes are not as cute as I expected</li>
            <li>they also don&#x27;t contour to your eyelash very well.</li>
            <li>but they are cheap enough</li>
            <li>I can find but these are way too much.</li>
            <li>Very disapointed the lashes I recieved</li>
            <li>These false eye lashes are a great buy.</li>
            <li>Although the eyelashes aren&#x27;t real(isn&#x27;t made with human hair, which I usually buy real eyelashes), they are still very cute and affordable!</li>
            <li>than it normally would if I got them from anywhere else!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t come with glue but other than that I love them</li>
            <li>very dark very nice and long</li>
            <li>I will stick to tried and true brands such as ardell and kiss.</li>
            <li>When I received my package more than half of the eyelashes were mangled and misshapen.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel realistic but who cares?</li>
            <li>and they LOOK realistic.</li>
            <li>, it makes the whole look really come together instead of just using clear glue.</li>
            <li>the extra few dollars and just get the good ones.</li>
            <li>, they took forever to arrive; the last lashes I bought from another seller took only a week to arrive and they were better quality than these.</li>
            <li>Besides all of that I am very upset that I paid for something that I clearly did not want!</li>
            <li>Besides all of that I am very upset that I paid for something that I clearly did not want!</li>
            <li>Ok so i love long eyelashes and these are thick ones like promised...</li>
            <li>They are thick, which makes them look better!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I do consider these my training wheels for bigger and better things, yet I would consider these as my everyday eye-wigs and have some nicer higher quality ones for my nights out in town!</li>
            <li>Its a great price, but it looks too fake.</li>
            <li>I am not one to really care about looking natural, so if you do these probably aren&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>Honestly I was sketched out reading the negative reviews on these</li>
            <li>my only complaint is that even though i use good glue, the corners seem to pop off so i have to redo the whole process if i plan to wear them all day.</li>
            <li>I think they are way worth the price because lashes you would buy at walgreens &amp; etc are about the same price as these.</li>
            <li>They alright to thin only useful when my thicker ones aren&#x27;t good anymore</li>
            <li>i cut them in half and just stick them on the corners of my eyes to make them more natural looking.</li>
            <li>the lashes themselves are long enough for those of you blessed which large eyes(i have to trim about 1/3 of them to fit my eye)   </li>
            <li>I really liked these lashes because they are very thick and full but they aren&#x27;t always practical because they don&#x27;t really look natural at all; they are too thick and full for some people and certain occasions.</li>
            <li>Each lash has extra tabs on the ends that are placed in little holes in the box, so when you take them out you have to trim the sides with scissors but honestly given the price I paid for them I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>Do not reccomend if you are new to lash application.</li>
            <li>I loved them for a dramatic lash  </li>
            <li>These were better than I had expected considering the prior reviews.  </li>
            <li>First of all they are not hard to bend at all, I have only put on falsies a handful of times before</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t have a very natural look.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m experienced enough with false lashes that I was able to make these work, but I think for a first timer they could be frustrating.</li>
            <li>&amp; When I wanna be dramatic I double up lol</li>
            <li>They are great for costumey stuff, or very dramatic looks.</li>
            <li>they may be a little harder to work with as they do not bend that easy , but I used regular eyelash glue and they stayed in fine .</li>
            <li>I love these so much - they are super thick and just long enough to make people wonder if they are natural or not.</li>
            <li>They are bendable enough for easy application, yet sturdy enough to last.</li>
            <li>These lashes are soft and dramatic looking yet not too over the top, which is exactly what I wanted for nights out and raves.</li>
            <li>They look extremely fake for everyday wear, BUT they are perfect for stage make up or photography.</li>
            <li>a clear plastic cut-out</li>
            <li>B00027D8IC Duo Lash Adhesive, Clear, 0.25 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>I ordered 4 pairs, and they arrived earlier than expected, Im a huge fan of make-up.</li>
            <li>These looked promising, enough that I bought them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beyond surprised at their durability.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s not kid ourselves, even with natural lashes 95% of people can tell you weren&#x27;t born with them.</li>
            <li>(she&#x27;s been attending more events lately) and she would always look fab.</li>
            <li>but they look and feel natural.</li>
            <li>I have to trim these lashes to look somewhat natural.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look natural but like plastic.</li>
            <li>I am a professional make-up artist.</li>
            <li>cos i fixed myself.</li>
            <li>They are not for natural day look, atleast for me.</li>
            <li>I think my eyelash craving has been fixed.</li>
            <li>Reusable I would recommend to anyone  for professional use</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t really soft, they were plastic.</li>
            <li>only way to get to see if you&#x27;re not going to get the job done with the same time as a result of the most part of the floor and the other hand</li>
            <li>I am on my second pair only because I lost the first.  </li>
            <li>I should also add that I have bought these exact lashes from a different seller months prior to this review!!  </li>
            <li>Very full and thick</li>
            <li>Its hard to put on personally, but I really love how natural it looks.</li>
            <li>I use lashes everyday and am able to get at least a week&#x27;s worth of wear from one pair of these lashes.</li>
            <li>I received them super fast, they arrived in about 3-4 days and they come in a cute thin little box with Asian writing on it and</li>
            <li>they were more everyday look, they are good quality, just not for everyday wear, they are DRAMATIC, so order if thats what youre looking for</li>
            <li>but i cant even wear these bc there too thick and heavy, that they are uncomforable to wear and on top of that they just dont look right after being put on.</li>
            <li>If the lashes are too big, you should cut to fit your eyes (cut a little from each edge).</li>
            <li>they came on time though that was the only good thing other than they were thick.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used the same pair twice with no trouble.</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re super heavy, and hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li>But least I have a few good lashes that aren&#x27;t ruined.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wear false eyelashes, so I cannot judge the condition of the product, but they were cheap and useable.</li>
            <li>I see that there are a few positive reviews, and can&#x27;t fathom that they have ever used even remotely decent eyelashes because .</li>
            <li>I refuse to go back to wearing just any old eyelashes now that i&#x27;ve discovered these!</li>
            <li>Other than that I really like them!</li>
            <li>While the seller of this item sent it very quickly, i discovered that these eyelashes are pretty useless.</li>
            <li>Women ask me what kind of mascara I wear, and I don&#x27;t hesitate to tell them they&#x27;re fake.</li>
            <li>these are 100% not for everyday use unless u wanna look like a lil elementary cartoon girl</li>
            <li>This lashes were very cheap, not realistic, and hard to put on.</li>
            <li>they were exactly what i expected not to full and not to thin and they look very natural</li>
            <li>I wore these with a costume, and as other reviewers have mentioned, they certainly have a costume-look, and not a natural-look.</li>
            <li>First off i was skeptical about these only because they are so cheap and affordable for so</li>
            <li>Lashes are a little thick but they look nice.</li>
            <li>Im guessing it had something to do with the mail services) within the next day of me contacting them they had sent me a new package that arived 2 short days later!</li>
            <li>If youre good at false lashes then I recommend them but for me, a newbie, they were stiff, and I was not use to gluing them on.</li>
            <li>I could barely hold my eyelids open!</li>
            <li>They were full and thick.</li>
            <li>so full and thick.</li>
            <li>Finally, true thick style eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>They are super thick, makes me feel like I have bugs on my lashes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually wear false lashes, to be fair.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they don&#x27;t look normal at all.</li>
            <li>but I found them to be a little too stiff to put on easily.</li>
            <li>but with a little bending they curved really well.</li>
            <li>They came all bent out of shape, super wide, and not a strong line to put glue on.</li>

            <li> I really love these lashes.</li>
            <li> and I like my eyelashes to look more thicker and longer than most eyelashes</li>

            <li> :) I will be ordering more pairs soon. :)</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with my lashes.</li>
            <li> the use is more for halloween or something to dress up with.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> many.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have to say these lashes are durable even more so than the ones in the store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> personally love them and would consider buying these again.</li>
            <li> i love them.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re good quality and look pretty on.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it, good price, good quality UNLESS your looking for real human hair, which these are def.</li>
            <li> and I had to cut the ends but definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li> She was so excited!</li>
            <li> Eye lashes where full and long you can reuse each pair about 6 7 times or more just depends on how much mascara you use Happy happy!</li>
            <li> but, the quality for what i wanted them for is nice and exactly what i needed for fantasy creatures and play makeup!</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast..and for the price, theyre really good eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I bought my first pack almost 2 months ago and am still able to re-use these lashes!</li>
            <li> but you will need to do some trimming to the inner and outer of the lash and have really good glue!</li>
            <li> and they go on so easily.  </li>
            <li> Cheap eyelashes, good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply .</li>
            <li> easy to use.    </li>
            <li> Strong packaging as well.  </li>
            <li> and they looked good with the makeup i used which was vibrant and bold!</li>
            <li> but for the most part and price they&#x27;re cool</li>
            <li> Full and light weight !</li>
            <li> I have taken one and cut it in half to use as accents, this seems to be the best for me.  </li>
            <li> then they are fine.</li>
            <li> - Super Hermosas !</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and immidiate!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super cute when I do wear them.</li>
            <li> The shipping was nice and got here fast before date.</li>
            <li> they feel so light on my lashes</li>
            <li> and I have to say that in the beginning when I was learning to apply lashes these were fantastic.</li>
            <li> Definitely cheap and plastic-y.</li>
            <li> i should have known they were going to be cheap.</li>
            <li> and I actually enjoy the way they look.</li>
            <li> May need to be cut to fit but no complaints.</li>
            <li> well there is some for the cheap prize i bought them because it was cheaper then</li>
            <li> I just ordered these lashes a few days ago and there AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are great for Halloween only!</li>
            <li> 1) since they&#x27;re from asia, they are cheaply made and NO glue included.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Some of the eyelashes were rolling around in the cheap looking box.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes were fantastic.</li>
            <li> They look and feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Shipping was free from China, and came 2 weeks sooner than posted.</li>
            <li> and i dont care for these since they were so cheap and it works for them.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> they seem a bit hard to get on at first, but if you insist they do the job PERFECTLY and last all night without needing to replace or add glue to them!!! :D</li>
            <li> I bought these eylashes thinking I would try something new, and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes so much!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> They were super cheap, and look super cheap.</li>
            <li> They stayed right where I put them all night and were easy to peel off.</li>
            <li> Pathetic have worked perfectly for what I need, there are so many for an impeccable price!</li>
            <li> The thickness is just about right!</li>
            <li> They are cheap as well, but they look more realistic compared to these pairs.</li>
            <li> I do not suggest these, spend the couple extra dollars on good ones.</li>
            <li> I wore them and everyone instantly noticed them... in a good way.</li>
            <li> very affordable , amazing turn out they are very reusable  and comfortable</li>
            <li> and they were such a good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a BAD product, it&#x27;s just that I cant find the use for them as of this moment.</li>
            <li> Not bad for $3.99...</li>
            <li> To be fair the price was super low  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how thick but not thick at all just like the rest perfect</li>
            <li> super recommended</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars, is that I&#x27;m sure that there&#x27;s better quality ones out there.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more and recomending these to as many people as possible!</li>
            <li> I love ordering these style of eyelashes in different varieties and to be able to swith the look up on your eye</li>
            <li> Quick delivery...was expecting them on the 9th, but got them today (Friday 1/5/2013).</li>
            <li> And super affordable.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re super un-natural plastic</li>
            <li> have much more expensive sets and these are not bad lots of sizes and the quality is good they go on very easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond happy with them, and it cost me 59 dollars less</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t constantly FEEL like long lashes which is the best thing.</li>
            <li> The best thing about them is that one pair will last a long time ..when you take them off they do not change shape ..</li>
            <li> Those are the only minimal complaints I have about this product, but other than that they did look great and the price and quantity of the product is awesome.</li>
            <li> They look real!!</li>
            <li> definately plan on inverting a little more for better quality would not buy again!</li>
            <li> I definitely will be buying more!</li>
            <li> The thickness doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but I had to trim them a bit for it to properly fit on my eyes.</li>
            <li> They shipped mighty fast</li>
            <li> great for cosplay or everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I thought the owners would have more decency to make our packages more private and the word EYELASHES smacked on the package didn&#x27;t help too much.</li>
            <li> They arrived on time, but I thought they&#x27;d look more natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with the extra attention they need because they look fantastic</li>
            <li> They take a while to receive but its worth the wait.</li>
            <li> They are very durable and pretty easy to work with if you know what your doing.  </li>
            <li> I have used different glues and none have been able to seal the edges down for more than an hour at most!</li>
            <li> I have used different glues and none have been able to seal the edges down for more than an hour at most!</li>
            <li> Cute different sizes I like to double up very realistic looking super fair price</li>
            <li> most drug stores charge 4.50 and up for a decent pair, and i want the most for my buck , this box will last me 20 nites out dancing with my friends</li>
            <li> (I have worn false eyelashes off and on for a good 7 years and can work a pretty cheap falsy into functioning most of the time)</li>
            <li> These lashes are good on the other hand they do feel a bit plasticy but what can you expect.  </li>
            <li> If you are unsure if these are the right type of lash for you, I say for the price go ahead and just try them :</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t seem to be the right ones in the picture.</li>
            <li> right ahead boo boo....</li>
            <li> I usually get 2 or 3 wears out of each pair, and at this price, I think that&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> They are kind of long though, just what I asked for.</li>
            <li> They look natural, and are not too much over the top.</li>
            <li> and they took about 2 and a half weeks to get here which is pretty good sense</li>
            <li> Their very light and look very real when I put them on definitely buying them again</li>
            <li> May be fine for a night out on the town, but not everyday use</li>
            <li> Got here faster than I thought such a great deal so many for such a low price I am definitely getting more</li>
            <li> Shipping time was surprisingly fast as well, being that they are coming the whole way from Hong Kong!!</li>
            <li> They really last a lot of time, a lot, and are beautiful in all ways, very full and thick.</li>
            <li> First off, they had to be trimmed to shape</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so pretty  </li>
            <li> *** that hahaha!</li>
            <li> At first I was like \\&quot;ummm, they look like too much/too fake\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but once I put them on they were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The quality of the hair was pretty neat</li>
            <li> My first pair of lashes never arived (</li>
            <li> first let me say it was my first time putting falsies on....</li>
            <li> and I hope to do more business with this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I Love the Asian type of lettering on the box!</li>
            <li> Definitely buying these again :)</li>
            <li> I really like them!</li>
            <li> Plus they arrived at my home (in kentucky) much faster than it said they would!</li>
            <li> They are long and soft so that is good.</li>
            <li> i got another set i will repeat this review , they are exactly alike</li>
            <li> They will be good for going out on a date with my husband, but not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> i cut them down to fit my eyes and they look really cute</li>
            <li> I ordered these because the price was great and because the other reviews sounded like they would be good, and in the picture you can&#x27;t really tell just how thick they are!</li>
            <li> I definitely feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth!!</li>
            <li> and they arent really curved to fit your natural eyelid</li>
            <li> Just to enhance the look from a distance, so i totally am pleasesd an will purchace more in the future easy to apply to someone else</li>
            <li> There ok it just feels a little heavy on my eyes, ive seem some pictures of some women wearing them and they look great on them</li>
            <li> and I wear them pretty much every day</li>
            <li> extremely long i thought it would be a much better quality..</li>
            <li> i love dramatic lashes and these are nice</li>
            <li> I decided to give these lashes a try, i love wearing lashes since i hardly have any of my own anymore so fake lashes make a huge difference on me and make my eys pop :) ...and for the price of these you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> wore my first pair to work (im a dancer) and they held up very well, kept them on while i slept and everything for three days straight</li>
            <li> A pair will last me a good 2 weeks of daily use, mainly since the band is much thicker than those of drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> These were ok, they are too long and look drag queen like but ok for the night out in town.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with these false lashes, they&#x27;re pretty and good quality for the low price.</li>
            <li> They are so beautiful and add a dramatic touch to your face stay on all day when using duo lash adhesive</li>
            <li> Very cheap and awkward, but good for the price.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> These dont bend how I anted, &amp; they dont hold glue very well.</li>
            <li> I really like them soo much     </li>
            <li> I really like these eyelashes.</li>
            <li> i really dont like this</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look anything like real lashes.</li>
            <li> THEY LOOK VERY NICE.LOT</li>
            <li> I had people thinking they were my real eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The benefit of them not being made of real hair is that they don&#x27;t get clumped up and ruined by mascara.</li>
            <li> -)--------I took a star off because you really have to work with them to conform to your eyes.</li>
            <li> They are very lightweight</li>
            <li> really makes my eyes pop.</li>
            <li> And the lashes look too much like plastic</li>
            <li> I really like using these lashes.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t very durable, but for the price I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t really complain for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> but they are so much cheaper</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much for them.i</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.they just went straight for the trash</li>
            <li> However, the quality of lashes leaves much to be desired.  </li>
            <li> The are so real like and they are truly reusable.</li>
            <li> If you prefer real hair falsies</li>
            <li> Yes they do not FEEL real.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be a great buy since I was really tired of paying $10 to get a strip lash put on or $80</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are not as cute as I expected</li>
            <li> they also don&#x27;t contour to your eyelash very well.</li>
            <li> but they are cheap enough</li>
            <li> I can find but these are way too much.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed the lashes I recieved</li>
            <li> These false eye lashes are a great buy.</li>
            <li> Although the eyelashes aren&#x27;t real(isn&#x27;t made with human hair, which I usually buy real eyelashes), they are still very cute and affordable!</li>
            <li> than it normally would if I got them from anywhere else!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t come with glue but other than that I love them</li>
            <li> very dark very nice and long</li>
            <li> I will stick to tried and true brands such as ardell and kiss.</li>
            <li> When I received my package more than half of the eyelashes were mangled and misshapen.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel realistic but who cares?</li>
            <li> and they LOOK realistic.</li>
            <li> , it makes the whole look really come together instead of just using clear glue.</li>
            <li> the extra few dollars and just get the good ones.</li>
            <li> , they took forever to arrive; the last lashes I bought from another seller took only a week to arrive and they were better quality than these.</li>
            <li> Besides all of that I am very upset that I paid for something that I clearly did not want!</li>
            <li> Besides all of that I am very upset that I paid for something that I clearly did not want!</li>
            <li> Ok so i love long eyelashes and these are thick ones like promised...</li>
            <li> They are thick, which makes them look better!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I do consider these my training wheels for bigger and better things, yet I would consider these as my everyday eye-wigs and have some nicer higher quality ones for my nights out in town!</li>
            <li> Its a great price, but it looks too fake.</li>
            <li> I am not one to really care about looking natural, so if you do these probably aren&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was sketched out reading the negative reviews on these</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that even though i use good glue, the corners seem to pop off so i have to redo the whole process if i plan to wear them all day.</li>
            <li> I think they are way worth the price because lashes you would buy at walgreens &amp; etc are about the same price as these.</li>
            <li> They alright to thin only useful when my thicker ones aren&#x27;t good anymore</li>
            <li> i cut them in half and just stick them on the corners of my eyes to make them more natural looking.</li>
            <li> the lashes themselves are long enough for those of you blessed which large eyes(i have to trim about 1/3 of them to fit my eye)   </li>
            <li> I really liked these lashes because they are very thick and full but they aren&#x27;t always practical because they don&#x27;t really look natural at all; they are too thick and full for some people and certain occasions.</li>
            <li> Each lash has extra tabs on the ends that are placed in little holes in the box, so when you take them out you have to trim the sides with scissors but honestly given the price I paid for them I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Do not reccomend if you are new to lash application.</li>
            <li> I loved them for a dramatic lash  </li>
            <li> These were better than I had expected considering the prior reviews.  </li>
            <li> First of all they are not hard to bend at all, I have only put on falsies a handful of times before</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t have a very natural look.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m experienced enough with false lashes that I was able to make these work, but I think for a first timer they could be frustrating.</li>
            <li> &amp; When I wanna be dramatic I double up lol</li>
            <li> They are great for costumey stuff, or very dramatic looks.</li>
            <li> they may be a little harder to work with as they do not bend that easy , but I used regular eyelash glue and they stayed in fine .</li>
            <li> I love these so much - they are super thick and just long enough to make people wonder if they are natural or not.</li>
            <li> They are bendable enough for easy application, yet sturdy enough to last.</li>
            <li> These lashes are soft and dramatic looking yet not too over the top, which is exactly what I wanted for nights out and raves.</li>
            <li> They look extremely fake for everyday wear, BUT they are perfect for stage make up or photography.</li>
            <li> a clear plastic cut-out</li>
            <li> B00027D8IC Duo Lash Adhesive, Clear, 0.25 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 pairs, and they arrived earlier than expected, Im a huge fan of make-up.</li>
            <li> These looked promising, enough that I bought them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond surprised at their durability.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s not kid ourselves, even with natural lashes 95% of people can tell you weren&#x27;t born with them.</li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s been attending more events lately) and she would always look fab.</li>
            <li> but they look and feel natural.</li>
            <li> I have to trim these lashes to look somewhat natural.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look natural but like plastic.</li>
            <li> I am a professional make-up artist.</li>
            <li> cos i fixed myself.</li>
            <li> They are not for natural day look, atleast for me.</li>
            <li> I think my eyelash craving has been fixed.</li>
            <li> Reusable I would recommend to anyone  for professional use</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t really soft, they were plastic.</li>
            <li> only way to get to see if you&#x27;re not going to get the job done with the same time as a result of the most part of the floor and the other hand</li>
            <li> I am on my second pair only because I lost the first.  </li>
            <li> I should also add that I have bought these exact lashes from a different seller months prior to this review!!  </li>
            <li> Very full and thick</li>
            <li> Its hard to put on personally, but I really love how natural it looks.</li>
            <li> I use lashes everyday and am able to get at least a week&#x27;s worth of wear from one pair of these lashes.</li>
            <li> I received them super fast, they arrived in about 3-4 days and they come in a cute thin little box with Asian writing on it and</li>
            <li> they were more everyday look, they are good quality, just not for everyday wear, they are DRAMATIC, so order if thats what youre looking for</li>
            <li> but i cant even wear these bc there too thick and heavy, that they are uncomforable to wear and on top of that they just dont look right after being put on.</li>
            <li> If the lashes are too big, you should cut to fit your eyes (cut a little from each edge).</li>
            <li> they came on time though that was the only good thing other than they were thick.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used the same pair twice with no trouble.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re super heavy, and hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li> But least I have a few good lashes that aren&#x27;t ruined.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear false eyelashes, so I cannot judge the condition of the product, but they were cheap and useable.</li>
            <li> I see that there are a few positive reviews, and can&#x27;t fathom that they have ever used even remotely decent eyelashes because .</li>
            <li> I refuse to go back to wearing just any old eyelashes now that i&#x27;ve discovered these!</li>
            <li> Other than that I really like them!</li>
            <li> While the seller of this item sent it very quickly, i discovered that these eyelashes are pretty useless.</li>
            <li> Women ask me what kind of mascara I wear, and I don&#x27;t hesitate to tell them they&#x27;re fake.</li>
            <li> these are 100% not for everyday use unless u wanna look like a lil elementary cartoon girl</li>
            <li> This lashes were very cheap, not realistic, and hard to put on.</li>
            <li> they were exactly what i expected not to full and not to thin and they look very natural</li>
            <li> I wore these with a costume, and as other reviewers have mentioned, they certainly have a costume-look, and not a natural-look.</li>
            <li> First off i was skeptical about these only because they are so cheap and affordable for so</li>
            <li> Lashes are a little thick but they look nice.</li>
            <li> Im guessing it had something to do with the mail services) within the next day of me contacting them they had sent me a new package that arived 2 short days later!</li>
            <li> If youre good at false lashes then I recommend them but for me, a newbie, they were stiff, and I was not use to gluing them on.</li>
            <li> I could barely hold my eyelids open!</li>
            <li> They were full and thick.</li>
            <li> so full and thick.</li>
            <li> Finally, true thick style eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> They are super thick, makes me feel like I have bugs on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear false lashes, to be fair.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they don&#x27;t look normal at all.</li>
            <li> but I found them to be a little too stiff to put on easily.</li>
            <li> but with a little bending they curved really well.</li>
            <li> They came all bent out of shape, super wide, and not a strong line to put glue on.</li>
            <li> Secondly people are saying that you have to cut off so much because they are so long, this is not true there is a tiny part you have to cut off</li>
            <li> These might not be for you if you dislike super long and thick lashes because they look like baby doll lashes.</li>
            <li> I have small little lashes that regular mascara barely helps with, so when I want to have a night out - I go right for these babies!</li>
            <li> They look nice in the box but upon applying they are super heavy on the lid, so after awhile they get annoying</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear fake lashes all the time, got interested when I wore them for a theater show I was in.</li>
            <li> they are a little stiff and it poked me and irritated my eyes with the full strip.  </li>
            <li> a while l didnt like paying all that money on lashes that would not last that long</li>
            <li> but hey for 1.50 or whatever I paid these should last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> They are really thick and look funny if you don&#x27;t have bottom lashes too, which I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> These were easy to put on, but looked silly on me.  </li>
            <li> I use lashes everyday and these are so light and thick</li>
            <li> I was not really used to wearing them, so I had a hard time at first, but now, it&#x27;s no big</li>
            <li> They are long lasting though, and very thick(A bit too thick in my opinon bc</li>
            <li> There are a lot of them and that is a plus, but they feel very artificial and don&#x27;t look good unless it is for a costume or cosplay.</li>
            <li> the were hard and straight</li>
            <li> The lashes are REALLY long and gets in the way when I wear sunglasses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to hold the lashes from the middle to ensure its center.</li>
            <li> They arrived earlier than expected, look just like the picture.</li>
            <li> I bought these a long time ago and thought they looked to gaudy.</li>
            <li> Not naturally looking in anyway.</li>
            <li> and i tried putting it on and had to cut em cuz they were too long...</li>
            <li> That is a minor VERY minor issue.</li>
            <li> so to that shop i give 5 stars, on the other hand I&#x27;m switching this order from a 5 star to a 1 simply because it was not what i ordered.</li>
            <li> But now that I have been doing makeup for a long time and have seen my ability grow, I have outgrown these!</li>
            <li> No one has commented that my lashes look fake, but they are a little over the top for my taste.</li>
            <li> its just they look too fake and they would be better for sumthing like halloween but not to be wearing everyday.</li>
            <li> When I finally received my lashes, I checked the box and noticed that I had only received 4 pieces instead of 5, showing that I was missing a pair of lashes.</li>
            <li> I ordered and got 3 random pairs witch i was hating because they dont even appear full when u put them on</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as long as I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> I have smaller eyes, so I have to cut them down anyways.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem, if I even have one, is that they&#x27;re a little long to be worn with glasses.</li>
            <li> I wear false lashes pretty regularly, and they typically cost me about $6 a pair.</li>
            <li> Maybe for a fun Halloween type thing but not good for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I cut them now to give myself a fanned out lash look, I get tired of wearing mascara and its not good for your lashes anyway- too many toxins.</li>
            <li> As I recall, they shipped the same day I ordered them and arrived in about two and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> They stayed on well all night and they come packaged with a little bit extra on each end, so there is no trouble with bends in the lashes from packaging that I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> They have a very thick bottom, which doesnt bend very well, thus putting it on an actual eyelid is pretty difficult.</li>
            <li> These are very natural looking and fanastic for everyday use!!</li>
            <li> they are very inexpensive, and I know it clearly says thick lashes, but the individual lashes themselves are quite thick making the lash very heavy.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;the lashes themselves are good, the base that the lashes are attatched to is a little thin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem is that the part that you glue to you eye is plastic.... and not very forgiving in application.</li>
            <li> These lashes look it was meant  for Halloween or for drag.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll give the remainder lashes to my friend who does drag.</li>
            <li> Received on expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> They arrived well before the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> They came warlier than i expected they were supposed to be here the 24th but</li>
            <li> I would recommend instead the 10 Pairs of Long False Eyelashes Eye Lashes Makeup, Professional, Black made by the same company as these lashes.</li>
            <li> false eyelashes are supposed to be more dramatic to enhance the eyes, (would we wear them if they didn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> Unless you like people to only focus on your eyes, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting THICK false lashes, because it looks exactly like that.</li>
            <li> Just a quick review about the reusable thick false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> The length of the lashes are a bit long for my taste, but for less than $1 a pair, I dont mind trimming them down myself.</li>
            <li> i like them because their really black but their just too long im going to trim them down an see if that works...</li>
            <li> Although i wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for first timer, because they are a bit difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> and they came in all foreign writing and a banged up box.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first because of the price</li>
            <li> People look at you funny because they look completely fake.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are thick but not long.</li>
            <li> do not get these if u have difficulty putting on false lashes in general, they are really thick which i liked but the bottom part where u attach them to your lashes is thick and uncomfortable to wear and yoyu always feel like they are falling off.</li>
            <li> A little wide</li>
            <li> I bought these a long time ago, they look nothing like the ones for sale now, so I&#x27;m not sure if the eyelashes themselves have changed.</li>
            <li> DARK..</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re going on a stage or not going to be with in about 7 feet of anyone these eyelashes are not worth getting.</li>
            <li> so if you are looking for eyelashes to wear during the day I would suggest getting the regular not the thick.</li>
            <li> and they dont glue down.</li>
            <li> I like to cut them in half for a less dramatic look and apply the half half way across the lid (middle to outer edge) or in fourths and apply a fourth just at the outer ends of my eyes after i apply eyeliner.</li>
            <li> They are very sexy &amp; dramatic (not in a bad halloween type of way though)....</li>
            <li> Unlike my other pairs they come off or well start to peel off after a few hours..</li>
            <li> All of the individual hairs are the same length, and they look ridiculously fake.</li>
            <li> Also I used the revlon BLACK lash glue</li>
            <li> Ugh so mad at amazon right now.</li>
            <li> There to stiff for me and very  rough to the eye.</li>
            <li> They look alright after being trimmed, but not good enough to deal with the pain.</li>
            <li> They are so thick, long,  and luscious.  </li>
            <li> Lashes are too thick and too long.  </li>
            <li> Way too thick and long</li>
            <li> so bummed I was expecting long thick lashes</li>
            <li> Besides that, they seem to be a little cheaper than ones you can buy in the stores.  </li>
            <li> They are held on to the board with a little... almost like a string.</li>
            <li> the box the eyelashes came in is cardboard and was a little banged up when i got it&lt;</li>
            <li> Not worth your wait or money!</li>
            <li> but they did feel a little heavy on my lids.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Once I got the box they were smushed an a few damaged.</li>
            <li> So all In all a waste of my $2 on these.</li>
            <li> Would recommend them as an everyday wear paired with the DUO surgical glue for lashes.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t too heavy for my eyes, either.</li>
            <li> Wasted money NEVER EVER</li>
            <li> this product was a waste.</li>
            <li> Not for everyday look</li>
            <li> As someone who wears lashes quite often, I felt these were just too heavy to wear.</li>
            <li> But I have used them a few times when I&#x27;ve gone out on the town.</li>
            <li> They are a little stiff but its what you pay for.</li>
            <li> and I got them all for less than two dollars!</li>
            <li> They are very thick and long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used fake eyelashes for a while now, but I was getting tired of spending a lot of money on human hair eyelashes that don&#x27;t last after three uses.</li>
            <li> Way too long, so unnatural like doll eyelashes..except in worse quality.</li>
            <li> they are a little heavy and thick</li>
            <li> I have only used false eyelashes once before this, and they were not all that hard to put on.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re very stiff compared to other lashed i&#x27;ve used and are hard to stick on.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and read the reviews afterwards, I was skeptical seeing how many people gave it a bad review, however I want to know what they were thinking?</li>
            <li> they are too thick and stiff its hard to get the ends to stick down</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS USE INDIVIDUALS HOPE I GET THIS THING DOWN PACK!!</li>
            <li> I had to loosen the wire up a little bit and that seemed to do the trick, at least.</li>
            <li> They also are obviously fake compared to human hair lashes.</li>
            <li> Ill stick to thinner ones next time.</li>
            <li> Though in the packaging they give off an almost artificial \\&quot;sheen\\&quot;, they look and feel really natural once you put them on.  </li>
            <li> Thirdly people are saying you can tell they are fake</li>
            <li> and they are so theatrical, well you&#x27;re buying fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy again</li>
            <li> Yes these are fake, and yes they are not human hair</li>
            <li> They were way to thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> I usually wear the ardell 105 or 117 ..</li>
            <li> Thick, plastic, stiff and will not stay on.</li>
            <li> I had to cut them in sections they were too stiff and thick at the lash band to go on in one piece and stay in place.  </li>
            <li> Very heavy feeling too.</li>
            <li> I assumed these would be thick like the Japanese lashes I get, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> they were a little sloppy and uneven and the box was smashed when it came in.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to put on because they come flat and are hard to shape.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the cherry brand,the band on that are thinner and not as thick as these.</li>
            <li> Very stiff and needed alot of flexing to make it work with my eyes....</li>
            <li> Everyone was saying these lashes won&#x27;t bend and are difficult to work with but after applying a thin line of my usual Duo glue and bending the band gently back and forth for 30 seconds I had no problem applying them to my eye.</li>
            <li> Hard to bend, plastic feel when bending them and even on your eye.</li>
            <li> and it was hard for him too</li>
            <li> but these suckers are usles</li>
            <li> i recieved these really late.</li>
            <li> They arrived faster than I expected but the lashes are fake looking...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s to late now.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t thick at all they feel like paper not like hair or lashes.  </li>
            <li> But they are sooooo thick</li>
            <li> the edges are to thick to glue on</li>
            <li> When the title says thick, THEY REALLY MEAN THICK.</li>
            <li> I mean I am not an expert at putting these things on, I am newbie.</li>
            <li> i mean ig</li>
            <li> Seriously buy these lashes, or you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
            <li> they are thick and dark, and very dramatic, which i like, but as others have said they are a little cheapo looking and look obviously fake when you wear them.</li>
            <li> but when these came they were so heavy and fake looking</li>
            <li> These were not good at all.</li>
            <li> Very fake and don&#x27;t stay on long</li>
            <li> , they were too long, and very fake.</li>
            <li> Very thick and a little difficult to work with</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they are too thick or dramatic like some have said.  </li>
            <li> It is so thick and fake and it doesn&#x27;t even stay on the eyes because it&#x27;s SOO heavy and thick!!</li>
            <li> Very Thick n Lovely&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> They are VERY thick..</li>
            <li> They are VERY thick</li>
            <li> These lashes are hard to put on and feel very hard (plastic like) really uncomfortable....</li>
            <li> I am a fan of fake eyelashes , these are quite hard</li>
            <li> anyways i ordered these lashes thinking they&#x27;d be thin on the inside and thicker to give the cat eye look</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my inexperience with false eyelashes</li>
            <li> When I told them I had false lashes on they DID NOT believe me.</li>
            <li> but you are not even cutting lashes off when you do so, in fact these could even be slightly longer!</li>
            <li> it looks sloppy and i dont wear them at all.</li>
            <li> Please ladies don&#x27;t make yourself look like a crazy psychopathic bride of chuck doll wearing these thick, hard, plastic lashes!</li>
            <li> I have used one pair for a week, as long as you trim the glue off of the base..</li>
            <li> but im a just learning so for professionals that want that dramatic look go for it</li>
            <li> These lashes are dramatic, shiny, and can be used over and over again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard and very FAKE looking....  </li>
            <li> For one they are very hard to shape!</li>
            <li> /&gt;it would be easier to glue and place, if the base was a little stiffer, but i got them promptly</li>
            <li> sorry no subtleties in these lashes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think ill even use these fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> For those who say they look too fake, wellllll that&#x27;s because they are fake...</li>
            <li> Fake and Tacky are the two words I would use.</li>
            <li> i wrote the review for THE WRONG PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> they feel and look fake...</li>
            <li> i have worn fake eyelashes befor</li>
            <li> Too fake looking.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stick on even with expensive glue.</li>
            <li> and they stayed on for a few hours (got annoying and had to remove).</li>
            <li> I use lashes quite often to perform and can get quite expensive</li>
            <li> I am sorry, but even at the price . . .</li>
            <li> who knows maybe i was doing it wrong</li>
            <li> They are so fake looking that my daughter refused to wear them.</li>
            <li> I do not like them at all they look really fake</li>
            <li> the box was smashed and the lashes look like plastic and not even close to something that could be used kinda sad</li>
            <li> They look and feel extremely fake, as in \\&quot;Toy</li>
            <li> Store\\&quot; fake.</li>
            <li> If your not an expert at applying fake lashes these will be very difficult for you use.</li>
            <li> and they look to fake and when the package was really bad</li>
            <li> These are a lot longer and might require some cutting.</li>
            <li> I get compliments like crazy.</li>
            <li> and they look too fake!</li>
            <li> sorry!</li>
            <li> They do not picture well seeing as they are too shiny and fake looking!</li>
            <li> I am so mad I need them</li>
            <li> They look way to fake!</li>
            <li> Hardly even bend, but they aren&#x27;t the worst.</li>
            <li> Very fake.</li>
            <li> I had to trim them before putting them on and they look very fake.</li>
            <li> waxy and very fake looking.</li>
            <li> the eyelashes where in bad shape so not buy this they suck</li>
            <li> thats bad coming from me</li>
            <li> these are un-usably bad.</li>
            <li> The packaging was bad.</li>
            <li> I even trimmed them, and they still look bad on me.</li>
            <li> WOUlDNt SiCK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d expect fake lashes to look unnatural, but these are outrageously unnatural.  </li>
            <li> That disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I realised i cant trust everyone.. :((((</li>
            <li> I hate that I do have cut the tips of on each side, but for the price f</li>
            <li> I hate these they will be going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Hate it hate it</li>
            <li> Whenever I took the item out of the package I was horrified on how anime and atrocious these eyelashes looked!</li>
            <li> i hated them.</li>
            <li> but i was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I waited about 3 weeks for these to be delivered and then ended up very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to wear them all day today and they&#x27;re horrible.</li>
            <li> shipped on time but terrible quality, you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Dont buy them awful product</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are horrible.</li>
            <li> It how a flexible band &amp; Doesn&#x27;t come with that nasty sticky glue</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>
            <li> Awful lashes!!</li>
            <li> These are the worst eyelashes I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Simply terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cute different sizes I like to double up very realistic looking super fair price I love them. Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> These dont bend how I anted, &amp; they dont hold glue very well. They also are obviously fake compared to human hair lashes. &amp; they took forever to get to my house. Unfortunately, a waste of money. ):</li>
            <li> They really last a lot of time, a lot, and are beautiful in all ways, very full and thick. super recommended</li>
            <li> I ordered these because the price was great and because the other reviews sounded like they would be good, and in the picture you can&#x27;t really tell just how thick they are! I love fake eye lashes and I wear them pretty much every day but when these came they were so heavy and fake looking I had to use an entire tube of glue and they still wouldn&#x27;t stick. I wore them for an hour and between them falling off and making my eyes feel like they were 15lbs each I just couldn&#x27;t wear them anymore.</li>
            <li> These false eye lashes are a great buy. Good quality product. Ordered on Tuesday and item was delivered on Sat!</li>
            <li> Ok so i love long eyelashes and these are thick ones like promised... Altho i bought 2 diffrent types these were a gift but some of these were detached from the board when i recived them so i kept these for myself... Still happy with the product and the price i was paying around $4 a pair... not any more</li>
            <li> this product is amazing!!! it works so nicely on your eyelashes. the glue doesnt come with this people! but for that many for this price, thats a-m-a-z-i-n-g!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used fake eyelashes for a while now, but I was getting tired of spending a lot of money on human hair eyelashes that don&#x27;t last after three uses. Thus, I thought this might be the better solution. I&#x27;m not saying that I don&#x27;t like them, but there&#x27;s a definite difference from human hair eye lashes. These are a lot longer and might require some cutting. They also don&#x27;t have a very natural look. I tried to put them on and then realized that there&#x27;s no curvature to them, so I held both ends together for a bit so that the eyelash would curve and adhere to my lid shape. Not a big issue, just something I noticed. I will probably use all of them until they are destroyed, but I don&#x27;t know if I will choose again to buy eyelashes that aren&#x27;t made of human hair. It&#x27;s just a persona preference.</li>
            <li> I bought my first pack almost 2 months ago and am still able to re-use these lashes! They&#x27;re gorgeous and fit comfortably. A little wide and I had to cut the ends but definitely worth the price!! I refuse to go back to wearing just any old eyelashes now that i&#x27;ve discovered these!</li>
            <li> So I gave these a review too soon. I&#x27;ve been trying to wear them all day today and they&#x27;re horrible. First off, they had to be trimmed to shape cause they&#x27;re so square. And they&#x27;re super heavy, and hurt my eyes. The end also won&#x27;t glue on properly so they jab into my eye. They look alright after being trimmed, but not good enough to deal with the pain. Oh and they itch. I do not suggest these, spend the couple extra dollars on good ones.</li>
            <li> These looked promising, enough that I bought them. The problem is that the part that you glue to you eye is plastic.... and not very forgiving in application. The quality of the lashes is good, but again unless your good at getting them on... Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> These lashes look it was meant  for Halloween or for drag.  It&#x27;s hard and very FAKE looking....  sorry no subtleties in these lashes</li>
            <li> While the seller of this item sent it very quickly, i discovered that these eyelashes are pretty useless. They have a very thick bottom, which doesnt bend very well, thus putting it on an actual eyelid is pretty difficult. I shall still continue to buy my eyelashes at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Once I got the box they were smushed an a few damaged. But least I have a few good lashes that aren&#x27;t ruined. Annoyed I have to cut them in order to have them fit the length of my eyes. They are super thick, makes me feel like I have bugs on my lashes. Ill stick to thinner ones next time. I don&#x27;t think ill even use these fuller lashes. So all In all a waste of my $2 on these.</li>
            <li> Merry Christmas!  Just a quick review about the reusable thick false eyelashes.  They&#x27;re so pretty  and they go on so easily.  Really nice product.  Strong packaging as well.  The  eyelashes are very nice and really enhance my eyes.  Best holiday wishes to all.</li>
            <li> hey ,    please can you get me 20 more of the eye lashes?    I really like them soo much     and i would like to give some of them to my friends</li>
            <li> tHESE JUSt DiDNt WORK FOR ME! WOUlDNt SiCK At All WitH GlUE tHAt COSt NEARllY 5 DOllERS i tHOUGHt tHEYD StiCK tHEN BUT NOPPEE!!. DO NOt liKE.</li>
            <li> I really like these eyelashes. I mean I am not an expert at putting these things on, I am newbie. These are not the top of line products, but they are good quality. I do consider these my training wheels for bigger and better things, yet I would consider these as my everyday eye-wigs and have some nicer higher quality ones for my nights out in town! What can I say, Love &#x27;em. I hate that I do have cut the tips of on each side, but for the price f*** that hahaha! Would recommend them as an everyday wear paired with the DUO surgical glue for lashes.</li>
            <li> i really dont like this they look shiny and they look to fake and when the package was really bad the eyelashes where in bad shape so not buy this they suck</li>
            <li> Thick, plastic, stiff and will not stay on. They don&#x27;t look anything like real lashes. I hate these they will be going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I BUY ALL TIME THEY LOOK GOOD. BUY THEM THEY LOOK VERY NICE.LOT FOR MONEY. LOOK LIKE YOUR LASH.  NICE BUY</li>
            <li> I really liked these lashes because they are very thick and full but they aren&#x27;t always practical because they don&#x27;t really look natural at all; they are too thick and full for some people and certain occasions.</li>
            <li> These are very natural looking and fanastic for everyday use!! They look real!! And feel great! I love these! I reccomend them! I will be buying more</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes. At first I was like \\&quot;ummm, they look like too much/too fake\\&quot; but once I put them on they were exactly what I wanted. Some can&#x27;t pull it off, others can.</li>
            <li> I assumed these would be thick like the Japanese lashes I get, but I was wrong. I would probably use these lashes if I was a make-up artist for theatrical production. The lashes are REALLY long and gets in the way when I wear sunglasses. The thickness doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but I had to trim them a bit for it to properly fit on my eyes. I think I&#x27;ll give the remainder lashes to my friend who does drag.</li>
            <li> shipped on time but terrible quality, you get what you pay for! They don&#x27;t stay on my eyes and look plastic.</li>
            <li> they were exactly what i expected not to full and not to thin and they look very natural you will be very pleased with this item</li>
            <li> Love these lashes.  I&#x27;m beyond surprised at their durability. A pair will last me a good 2 weeks of daily use, mainly since the band is much thicker than those of drugstore brands. The length of the lashes are a bit long for my taste, but for less than $1 a pair, I dont mind trimming them down myself. The thickness is perfect, just the right amount of lashes. Though in the packaging they give off an almost artificial \\&quot;sheen\\&quot;, they look and feel really natural once you put them on.  Havent found anything better for the quality and price, so these will forever be my go-to lashes!</li>
            <li> They are very thick and long. the lashes themselves are long enough for those of you blessed which large eyes(i have to trim about 1/3 of them to fit my eye)   I loved them for a dramatic lash  I got 2 uses from each pair and i used mascara on them</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, great quality for a great price. I&#x27;ve recommended it to so many people. I always get compliments on them too, they&#x27;re beautiful!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel realistic but who cares? Nobody will feel them but you. Very full and thick and they LOOK realistic. I had people thinking they were my real eyelashes. The benefit of them not being made of real hair is that they don&#x27;t get clumped up and ruined by mascara. And there&#x27;s plenty for a very good price. I recommend them to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this purchase. And the price you can&#x27;t beat! These lashes aren&#x27;t for the conservative type. They are very sexy &amp; dramatic (not in a bad halloween type of way though)....For those who say they look too fake, wellllll that&#x27;s because they are fake... Let&#x27;s not kid ourselves, even with natural lashes 95% of people can tell you weren&#x27;t born with them. If you are unsure if these are the right type of lash for you, I say for the price go ahead and just try them :-)--------I took a star off because you really have to work with them to conform to your eyes.</li>
            <li> These lashes are good on the other hand they do feel a bit plasticy but what can you expect.  The shipping was nice and got here fast before date.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and read the reviews afterwards, I was skeptical seeing how many people gave it a bad review, however I want to know what they were thinking? First of all they are not hard to bend at all, I have only put on falsies a handful of times before and I got these on in five minutes...without a mirror! Secondly people are saying that you have to cut off so much because they are so long, this is not true there is a tiny part you have to cut off but you are not even cutting lashes off when you do so, in fact these could even be slightly longer! Thirdly people are saying you can tell they are fake and they are so theatrical, well you&#x27;re buying fake eyelashes what else do you want that is what they are supposed to be. Over all I am overwhelmingly pleased with this buy and will order again and again!&lt;br /&gt;P.s. They shipped mighty fast I had them two days after ordering!&lt;br /&gt;If i could give this even more than 5 stars I would. Seriously buy these lashes, or you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
            <li> The thickness is just about right! I have been using them for my mom (she&#x27;s been attending more events lately) and she would always look fab. The price is great too.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and awkward, but good for the price. I think it depends on what type you order. There are a lot of them and that is a plus, but they feel very artificial and don&#x27;t look good unless it is for a costume or cosplay. But they do the job for some people.</li>
            <li> Very stiff and needed alot of flexing to make it work with my eyes....</li>
            <li> I thought the owners would have more decency to make our packages more private and the word EYELASHES smacked on the package didn&#x27;t help too much. Whenever I took the item out of the package I was horrified on how anime and atrocious these eyelashes looked! Fake and Tacky are the two words I would use. Unless you want them for a costume party go ahead! Other than that, they don&#x27;t look normal at all.</li>
            <li> I just recieved these eyelashes and I immediately didn&#x27;t like them. They are way thicker than the ones in the picture and they look too fake! I would recommend instead the 10 Pairs of Long False Eyelashes Eye Lashes Makeup, Professional, Black made by the same company as these lashes. They are cheap as well, but they look more realistic compared to these pairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I get lots of compliments on my lashes. Women ask me what kind of mascara I wear, and I don&#x27;t hesitate to tell them they&#x27;re fake. They are very lightweight so they adhere well. I usually get 2 or 3 wears out of each pair, and at this price, I think that&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> The price is unbeatable. If the lashes are too big, you should cut to fit your eyes (cut a little from each edge). Then apply glue to the lashes, allow about 15 seconds to set next put on your eyelid. It&#x27;s easier to hold the lashes from the middle to ensure its center.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes were not usable the were hard and straight no way could even glue them. Dont buy them awful product</li>
            <li> When the title says thick, THEY REALLY MEAN THICK. These were easy to put on, but looked silly on me.  They weren&#x27;t too heavy for my eyes, either.</li>
            <li> These arrived on time &amp; not damaged. They look nice in the box but upon applying they are super heavy on the lid, so after awhile they get annoying &amp; I just wanted to go home to peel them off. They are long lasting though, and very thick(A bit too thick in my opinon bc they kinda give you the doll eye look) I wouldnt purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear false lashes, to be fair. The quality of the hair was pretty neat and so was the volume of it but I found them to be a little too stiff to put on easily. I had to loosen the wire up a little bit and that seemed to do the trick, at least. Maybe it&#x27;s just my inexperience with false eyelashes but they did feel a little heavy on my lids. Those are the only minimal complaints I have about this product, but other than that they did look great and the price and quantity of the product is awesome.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear false eyelashes, so I cannot judge the condition of the product, but they were cheap and useable.</li>
            <li> Their very light and look very real when I put them on definitely buying them again soon I love these lashes.</li>
            <li> l like them  they feel so light on my lashes l brought 2 10 pairs and l love them l have enough for a while l didnt like paying all that money on lashes that would not last that long but l so like these thankyou</li>
            <li> wore my first pair to work (im a dancer) and they held up very well, kept them on while i slept and everything for three days straight and they still were beautiful and still reusable. buy it</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are horrible. They aren&#x27;t thick at all they feel like paper not like hair or lashes.  Wasted money NEVER EVER PURCHASE THIS</li>
            <li> I love these so much - they are super thick and just long enough to make people wonder if they are natural or not. They stayed right where I put them all night and were easy to peel off.</li>
            <li> wish it came with glue. but love the product! they are super cute! i love that they have soo many in a set</li>
            <li> I have only used false eyelashes once before this, and they were not all that hard to put on. I had to bend them some and cut off the sides, but that was not an issue. I love the look it gave my eyes. I have included a picture of me wearing them. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars, is that I&#x27;m sure that there&#x27;s better quality ones out there. One plus is that the box they came in has a heart cutout on the cover. I thought it was cute.</li>
            <li> It took me a month to receive these, I had given up on them.  Besides that, they seem to be a little cheaper than ones you can buy in the stores.  I am on my second pair only because I lost the first.  They are very durable and pretty easy to work with if you know what your doing.  I have taken one and cut it in half to use as accents, this seems to be the best for me.  they are a little stiff and it poked me and irritated my eyes with the full strip.  I don&#x27;t think they are too thick or dramatic like some have said.  false eyelashes are supposed to be more dramatic to enhance the eyes, (would we wear them if they didn&#x27;t?, no) but hey for 1.50 or whatever I paid these should last me a long time.  and im happy with them</li>
            <li> These eyelashes were very nice! I loved them. You have to cut like a 1/4 of an inch off each side of just extra track and they arent really curved to fit your natural eyelid but with a little bending they curved really well. I would definitely recommend them and I will be buying them again!</li>
            <li> When I received the eye lashes I was very impressed. They were nicer than I thought. They were full and thick. The price was excellent. I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Love them!!!! Would definitely purchase them again. And the price was nice. Had purchased some for my neighbors. I recommend this item to anyone who is considering purchasing them.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes!! They are so beautiful and add a dramatic touch to your face stay on all day when using duo lash adhesive</li>
            <li> my wife loves using this product. it makes her feel sexy. she loves wearing them in our bed time play and out on date nights</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! I can wear these anytime. I also used them for a wedding party. Try all loved it. For this price, I def recommend this product. Even great for beginners.</li>
            <li> they are too thick and stiff its hard to get the ends to stick down but im a just learning so for professionals that want that dramatic look go for it but you will need to do some trimming to the inner and outer of the lash and have really good glue!</li>
            <li> I bought these eylashes thinking I would try something new, and I am so glad I did! these lashes are great quality, and each pair can be re-used! also the costumer service is very nice and understanding. My first pair of lashes never arived (Im guessing it had something to do with the mail services) within the next day of me contacting them they had sent me a new package that arived 2 short days later! I will be buying more and recomending these to as many people as possible!</li>
            <li> they should be ashame of themselves to sell something like that. the eyelashes do not look like the picture.they feel like paper and they dont glue down. this product was a waste. i threw them in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I love it.. Look great on.. Looks great even after three days.. I recommend it for everyone. Itz really great..😍😍😍</li>
            <li> Best eyeleashes very easy to apply and also reusable.! Also stays on druing touching water. i went to the beach and i was worry it will fall off , but I guess not! Well be ordering MORE! :)</li>
            <li> MY FAVE im all for gothic/lolita makeup AND THESE DID THE TRICK. so full and thick. really makes my eyes pop. thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;br /&gt;sorry i wrote the review for THE WRONG PRODUCT. sorry! anyways i ordered these lashes thinking they&#x27;d be thin on the inside and thicker to give the cat eye look but i was very disappointed. i received eyelashes that i had already purchased from another shop. so to that shop i give 5 stars, on the other hand I&#x27;m switching this order from a 5 star to a 1 simply because it was not what i ordered.</li>
            <li> They arrived on time, but I thought they&#x27;d look more natural. All of the individual hairs are the same length, and they look ridiculously fake. I don&#x27;t mind people being able to tell I have falsies on, but I don&#x27;t want to look like I have polyester caterpillars on my eyes. I bought these a long time ago, they look nothing like the ones for sale now, so I&#x27;m not sure if the eyelashes themselves have changed.</li>
            <li> first let me say it was my first time putting falsies on....These lashes are hard to put on and feel very hard (plastic like) really uncomfortable.... they feel and look fake... definately plan on inverting a little more for better quality would not buy again!</li>
            <li> Just as it say haven&#x27;t try lashes yet if we bring our own to salon it&#x27;s cheaper that way</li>
            <li> very dark very nice and long I love ordering these style of eyelashes in different varieties and to be able to swith the look up on your eye I am happy with the product and the time in which it took to take!</li>
            <li> There ok I guess for the price.  There to stiff for me and very  rough to the eye. It&#x27;s alrite</li>
            <li> PERFECT BOX! They are too big</li>
            <li> Tryed and tryed an tryed an couldent.get them on my eyelash&lt;br /&gt; i have worn fake eyelashes befor and iv.never had problems but these suckers are usles</li>
            <li> i like them because their really black but their just too long im going to trim them down an see if that works...</li>
            <li> Although the eyelashes aren&#x27;t real(isn&#x27;t made with human hair, which I usually buy real eyelashes), they are still very cute and affordable! They are thick, which makes them look better! My mom &amp; I love them. I would recommend them to everyone. Also, they arrived at the estimated time I was given when I purchased them :)</li>
            <li> Very Thick n Lovely&lt;br /&gt;The only way to get to see if you&#x27;re not going to get the job done with the same time as a result of the most part of the floor and the other hand I am a beautiful person</li>
            <li> Maybe for a fun Halloween type thing but not good for everyday wear. And the lashes look too much like plastic</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. They are kind of long though, just what I asked for. Great for going out.. but they dont stick well</li>
            <li> I use lashes everyday and these are so light and thick but they look and feel natural. I love them</li>
            <li> I have to trim these lashes to look somewhat natural. Its a great price, but it looks too fake. Unless you like people to only focus on your eyes, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting THICK false lashes, because it looks exactly like that. period. I cut them now to give myself a fanned out lash look, I get tired of wearing mascara and its not good for your lashes anyway- too many toxins.</li>
            <li> I chose 1 star bc i hated them. thats bad coming from me bc i am an eyelash addict. the thicker the better but i cant even wear these bc there too thick and heavy, that they are uncomforable to wear and on top of that they just dont look right after being put on.</li>
            <li> This were ok... for the price I paid. They came a liittle mis shapen. But for the pricd it was ok</li>
            <li> I ordered and got 3 random pairs witch i was hating because they dont even appear full when u put them on but they do make nice bottom lashes thats it.</li>
            <li> Love it they can be reused and reshaped</li>
            <li> I really like using these lashes. I was not really used to wearing them, so I had a hard time at first, but now, it&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to cut them. They are held on to the board with a little... almost like a string. I have smaller eyes, so I have to cut them down anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reused them several times before tossing them. And it&#x27;s almost like the more you use them, the better they bend and form to your eye (probably from all the glue, haha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying these again. Shipping time was surprisingly fast as well, being that they are coming the whole way from Hong Kong!!</li>
            <li> - Super Hermosas ! Son Bonitas &amp; se miran reales ( :&lt;br /&gt;Definitivamente volver&amp;eacute; a comprar otras !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graciass s</li>
            <li> these were a good deal, 1$ for 10 pairs. i can not and will not complain. They are a little stiff but its what you pay for. I clip these into smaller sections and use them just to add some flair on the outer part of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The only reason i gave four stars was because i could not apply to myself but, the quality for what i wanted them for is nice and exactly what i needed for fantasy creatures and play makeup! Just to enhance the look from a distance, so i totally am pleasesd an will purchace more in the future easy to apply to someone else and they looked good with the makeup i used which was vibrant and bold! The shipping was quick and immidiate!</li>
            <li> To start out with the images that appear on the page are not the lashes you will receive! With that being said I will review the lashes I did get! I have been doing makeup for over a year now and I have to say that in the beginning when I was learning to apply lashes these were fantastic.I should also add that I have bought these exact lashes from a different seller months prior to this review!!  But now that I have been doing makeup for a long time and have seen my ability grow, I have outgrown these! For one they are very hard to shape! Most come in the box looking deformed. They do not picture well seeing as they are too shiny and fake looking! The edges always pop up! I have used different glues and none have been able to seal the edges down for more than an hour at most! Besides all of that I am very upset that I paid for something that I clearly did not want! Save your money buy better lashes!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!! It is the crapiest lashes ever!! I would give. This zero stars but it ain&#x27;t possible. It is so thick and fake and it doesn&#x27;t even stay on the eyes because it&#x27;s SOO heavy and thick!! Do not buy</li>
            <li> Definitely cheap and plastic-y. They aren&#x27;t very durable, but for the price I don&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;m experienced enough with false lashes that I was able to make these work, but I think for a first timer they could be frustrating. I would recommend them to someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing. They are great for costumey stuff, or very dramatic looks. I&#x27;m glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t woren yet, simply because I have not had a chance to wear them yet.&lt;br /&gt;When I do wear the I&#x27;ll enlighten you.</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes so much! All they need is mascara to take away the shine &amp; they&#x27;re perfect. &amp; When I wanna be dramatic I double up lol</li>
            <li> I never got my eye lashes I orders them June 26 and it is almost September !!! I am so mad I need them it&#x27;s been months !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> LOOKS AMAZING IF YOU KNOW HOW TO PUT IT ON ! It how a flexible band &amp; Doesn&#x27;t come with that nasty sticky glue you get when you purchase eye lashes . WILL BUY AGAIN .</li>
            <li> Horrible.  Looks nothing like the picture. They look like feathers. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Nope. Just a lot of nopes. Hard to bend, plastic feel when bending them and even on your eye. Doesn&#x27;t look natural but like plastic. Has plastic sheen to it.</li>
            <li> i got the lashes as an impulse buy. i should have known they were going to be cheap. it looks sloppy and i dont wear them at all. i gave them to my sister because i didn&#x27;t like them. they were a little sloppy and uneven and the box was smashed when it came in.</li>
            <li> They look extremely fake for everyday wear, BUT they are perfect for stage make up or photography. Not for everyday look</li>
            <li> They look way to fake! Not only that but I ordered 2 different kinds of lashes and got the same ones. They look the same and the numbers on the side of the box are the same.</li>
            <li> Very thick and a little difficult to work with but I can&#x27;t really complain for the price I paid. Not sure if I would buy again</li>
            <li> Yes these are fake, and yes they are not human hair but they are so much cheaper and I actually enjoy the way they look. I was also really impressed by the fast delivery. Thank you so much and I hope to do more business with this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> Brought them for my sister. She loved It! I Love the Asian type of lettering on the box! looked awesome!</li>
            <li> Nothing to complain about got here super quick way before the date it was supposed to and were in perfect condition! Eye lashes where full and long you can reuse each pair about 6 7 times or more just depends on how much mascara you use Happy happy!</li>
            <li> Too fake looking. Not my style.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them one bit.good thing I didn&#x27;t pay much for them.i wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.they just went straight for the trash</li>
            <li> This lashes were very cheap, not realistic, and hard to put on. They look okay in pictures but I would NEVER wear them in public.</li>
            <li> To start out with the images that appear on the page are not the lashes you will receive!&lt;br /&gt; I have used different glues and none have been able to seal the edges down for more than an hour at most! Besides all of that I am very upset that I paid for something that I clearly did not want! Save your money buy better lashes!</li>
            <li> These lashes were okay.  They are VERY thick.. DARK.. and I would probably use them one day some day for Halloween.  I bought them for daily use.  But they are sooooo thick i may get mistaken for a hooker.. so as for now, they sit in a draw waiting to be used.  I would probably not buy this product again.  It&#x27;s not a BAD product, it&#x27;s just that I cant find the use for them as of this moment.</li>
            <li> The package came on time and I had no problems with the seller.    However, the quality of lashes leaves much to be desired.  Do not reccomend if you are new to lash application. I am a professional make-up artist. I had the most dfficult time trying to apply them and was unable , once placed to get them to stay.You may have better luck with them than I did but I doubt it. I will stick to tried and true brands such as ardell and kiss. I will not be purchasing theese again. Sometimes you have to pay for quality.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes look great if you want to look glamorous at night or for photographs. They are VERY thick so if you are looking for eyelashes to wear during the day I would suggest getting the regular not the thick. I like to cut them in half for a less dramatic look and apply the half half way across the lid (middle to outer edge) or in fourths and apply a fourth just at the outer ends of my eyes after i apply eyeliner. They are reuseable and come in a ten pack. Very good deal price wise. I&#x27;m glad I found this seller on amazon and I will purchase products form them in the future.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter she loves them. The are so real like and they are truly reusable. She was so excited!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these eyelashes. They are so thick, long,  and luscious.  Everytime I wear them I get compliments like crazy. After wearing them for a while though you do get used to wearing them. They don&#x27;t constantly FEEL like long lashes which is the best thing.</li>
            <li> They arrived earlier than expected, look just like the picture. Although i wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for first timer, because they are a bit difficult to put on. But if your experienced, they wont be a problem for you. The price is unbeatable. 2 bucks for 10 Pairs? Pretty awesome! Definitely buying these again :)</li>
            <li> These lashes I absolutely love. great for cosplay or everyday wear. All in all a great buy! Will definately buy in the future!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stick on even with expensive glue.</li>
            <li> Awful lashes!! Very fake and don&#x27;t stay on long</li>
            <li> Honestly I was sketched out reading the negative reviews on these but all I can say is I&#x27;m very happy with these lashes. I love trying out diff falsies and for the price I couldn&#x27;t resist buying these. 10 pairs for under 5 bucks including the shipping, I figured I might as well try these out despite the so-so reviews. I received them super fast, they arrived in about 3-4 days and they come in a cute thin little box with Asian writing on it and a clear plastic cut-out so you can see what they look like before you lift off the lid. These lashes are soft and dramatic looking yet not too over the top, which is exactly what I wanted for nights out and raves. Each lash has extra tabs on the ends that are placed in little holes in the box, so when you take them out you have to trim the sides with scissors but honestly given the price I paid for them I didn&#x27;t mind. Everyone was saying these lashes won&#x27;t bend and are difficult to work with but after applying a thin line of my usual Duo glue and bending the band gently back and forth for 30 seconds I had no problem applying them to my eye. I&#x27;m pleased with these false lashes, they&#x27;re pretty and good quality for the low price. If you prefer real hair falsies these might be too cheap looking for you, but I think they&#x27;re really cute and a good deal.</li>
            <li> These were not good at all. They were way to thick and heavy. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as long as I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> Very fake. Way too long, so unnatural like doll eyelashes..except in worse quality. Please save your money and buy anything else. These are the worst eyelashes I have ever seen. I wouldn&#x27;t even use them as part of a halloween costume. Simply terrible.</li>
            <li> I Bought this lashers and is very good. the price that you can&#x27;t beat. I reused it several times cos i fixed myself. Nice lashers and I recommend it for any one.</li>
            <li> Cheap eyelashes, good price and fast shipping. They are what you should expect for the price. They are difficult to put on because they come flat and are hard to shape. Not re-usable at all! Won&#x27;t be buying again, I&#x27;d rather keep buying them from Walgreens or CVS for $5.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast..and for the price, theyre really good eyelashes. Unlike my other pairs they come off or well start to peel off after a few hours..I probably wont buy them again.</li>
            <li> These lashes go on very easily using the duo glue [[ASIN:B00027D8IC Duo Lash Adhesive, Clear, 0.25 Ounce]] and they stayed on for a few hours (got annoying and had to remove). They are really thick and look funny if you don&#x27;t have bottom lashes too, which I don&#x27;t. They will be good for going out on a date with my husband, but not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> These were better than I had expected considering the prior reviews.  I use lashes quite often to perform and can get quite expensive so these are great.</li>
            <li> Appreciated greatly by the recipient.</li>
            <li> Got here faster than I thought such a great deal so many for such a low price I am definitely getting more</li>
            <li> i recieved these really late. and they came in all foreign writing and a banged up box. the lashes werent harmed though!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all they suck don&#x27;t buy just a waist of time so don&#x27;t buy you will not like them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear these regularly, so they&#x27;ll probably last me forever and then some. They&#x27;re super cute when I do wear them.</li>
            <li> I am sorry, but even at the price . . . these are un-usably bad. I see that there are a few positive reviews, and can&#x27;t fathom that they have ever used even remotely decent eyelashes because . . . I don&#x27;t see how anyone could even \\&quot;make\\&quot; them work. (I have worn false eyelashes off and on for a good 7 years and can work a pretty cheap falsy into functioning most of the time)</li>
            <li> They are all the same size so I would probably trim some of them, depending on how I want to use them. I don&#x27;t really wear fake lashes all the time, got interested when I wore them for a theater show I was in. But I had human hair type of lashes so they look/feel better, although I haven&#x27;t tried these on since I just got them today. Quick delivery...was expecting them on the 9th, but got them today (Friday 1/5/2013). Not bad for $3.99... This would seem good for parties...</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first because of the price but boy am I impressed. I wore them and everyone instantly noticed them... in a good way. Did you do your makeup different? it looks really good, how did you get your eyelashes so long they look awesome! When I told them I had false lashes on they DID NOT believe me. So that is why I am writing this review. Yes you do have to cut the edges that is only because of the packaging they come in so they don&#x27;t fall out. That is a minor VERY minor issue. Yes they do not FEEL real. WHO CARES? are people going to touch your eyelashes? Yeah, didn&#x27;t think so lol. Also I used the revlon BLACK lash glue, it makes the whole look really come together instead of just using clear glue.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be a great buy since I was really tired of paying $10 to get a strip lash put on or $80+ for the individual and/or cluster lashes. they are very inexpensive, and I know it clearly says thick lashes, but the individual lashes themselves are quite thick making the lash very heavy. As someone who wears lashes quite often, I felt these were just too heavy to wear. I could barely hold my eyelids open!</li>
            <li> I got my order for I have to give them away it was not what I was thinking they would be, order was on time thank you for that</li>
            <li> I bought these a long time ago and thought they looked to gaudy. well, i love them! i cut them down to fit my eyes and they look really cute when im wearing all my eye makeup smoked out. i ended up purchasing these again. great for a night out on the town. my only complaint is that even though i use good glue, the corners seem to pop off so i have to redo the whole process if i plan to wear them all day.</li>
            <li> Received my order in a timely fashion. I thought it would have taken longer! Lashes are a little thick but they look nice. May need to be cut to fit but no complaints.</li>
            <li> I just got these yesterday and decided to use these today, Valentines Day. I really like them! The only problem, if I even have one, is that they&#x27;re a little long to be worn with glasses. Other than that I really like them!</li>
            <li> you love lashes well there is some for the cheap prize i bought them because it was cheaper then the beauty store was saling and my secrete santa ofer so yay.</li>
            <li> i love dramatic lashes and these are nice i love them and they took about 2 and a half weeks to get here which is pretty good sense it comes from hong kong (: dont hesitate to buy great deal</li>
            <li> i was swayed by the low price so i decided to try them. they&#x27;re very stiff compared to other lashed i&#x27;ve used and are hard to stick on. they are thick and dark, and very dramatic, which i like, but as others have said they are a little cheapo looking and look obviously fake when you wear them. i cut them in half and just stick them on the corners of my eyes to make them more natural looking. but i don&#x27;t think i would buy these again.</li>
            <li> They arrived faster than I expected but the lashes are fake looking... Not naturally looking in anyway. May be fine for a night out on the town, but not everyday use</li>
            <li> do not get these if u have difficulty putting on false lashes in general, they are really thick which i liked but the bottom part where u attach them to your lashes is thick and uncomfortable to wear and yoyu always feel like they are falling off. who knows maybe i was doing it wrong but my friend is a makeup pro and it was hard for him too so yeah. they came on time though that was the only good thing other than they were thick.</li>
            <li> These are great lashes , I just put in another order in for a set of these. Ive only worn them once &amp; I&#x27;m pleased! I think they are way worth the price because lashes you would buy at walgreens &amp; etc are about the same price as these. I think you are basically getting ripped of at those places. These might not be for you if you dislike super long and thick lashes because they look like baby doll lashes.</li>
            <li> I just ordered these lashes a few days ago and there AMAZING!!! I got them in 3 days from ordering them and there perfect!! And super affordable. If you are looking for great lashes these are them i will be ordering from them again soon!  Mackenzie</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are great for Halloween only! I purchased these lashes for my daughters dance competitions. They are so fake looking that my daughter refused to wear them. I saved them for her to wear at Halloween. If your not an expert at applying fake lashes these will be very difficult for you use. I do not recommend these lashes for every day wear.</li>
            <li> Hello Ladies,&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! I am not one to really care about looking natural, so if you do these probably aren&#x27;t for you. These lashes are dramatic, shiny, and can be used over and over again. I have small little lashes that regular mascara barely helps with, so when I want to have a night out - I go right for these babies!</li>
            <li> 1) since they&#x27;re from asia, they are cheaply made and NO glue included.&lt;br /&gt;2) since they&#x27;re from asia, they took over a month to get here&lt;br /&gt;3) they&#x27;re super un-natural plastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pay the extra few dollars and just get the good ones. don&#x27;t try to save money buying these</li>
            <li> T he quality is ok. The eyelashes are not as cute as I expected and they don&#x27;t seem to be the right ones in the picture. The packaging was bad. Some of the eyelashes were rolling around in the cheap looking box.</li>
            <li> I wear false lashes pretty regularly, and they typically cost me about $6 a pair. These are just as good and I got them all for less than two dollars! They&#x27;re good quality and look pretty on. I&#x27;m beyond happy with them, and it cost me 59 dollars less than it normally would if I got them from anywhere else! Plus they arrived at my home (in kentucky) much faster than it said they would! Great item.</li>
            <li> although these are not human hair. its is a great price for 10 pair and u can reuse them. most drug stores charge 4.50 and up for a decent pair, and i want the most for my buck , this box will last me 20 nites out dancing with my friends cuz i use one pair 2 times.</li>
            <li> ordered these thinking they were more everyday look, they are good quality, just not for everyday wear, they are DRAMATIC, so order if thats what youre looking for</li>
            <li> Its hard to put on personally, but I really love how natural it looks. The shipping was great and the seller. If youre good at false lashes then I recommend them but for me, a newbie, they were stiff, and I was not use to gluing them on. So good luck.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes took a good month to get to me. The package was ripped open and one pair of the eyelashes was damaged and unusable.  To be fair the price was super low  and I knew shipping would be a problem since it ships form china. But the eye lashes work fairly good so no complaints there</li>
            <li> Its 5 stars for a reason. Love everything about it, good price, good quality UNLESS your looking for real human hair, which these are def. not.</li>
            <li> good lashes for the price if you love thick lashes it perfect for you because they are very full if you want the drama look great get it</li>
            <li> They came all bent out of shape, super wide, and not a strong line to put glue on. They are long and soft so that is good. But wish they weren&#x27;t bent all to hell.</li>
            <li> They were super cheap, and look super cheap. But I have used them a few times when I&#x27;ve gone out on the town. No one has commented that my lashes look fake, but they are a little over the top for my taste.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are thick but not long. If they were longer they would be perfect. These are perfect those ladies that just want fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> The lashes are ok for the price but have to hold for a while when applying and then come off after a while but for the most part and price they&#x27;re cool</li>
            <li> the box the eyelashes came in is cardboard and was a little banged up when i got it&lt;br /&gt;the lashes themselves are good, the base that the lashes are attatched to is a little thin.&lt;br /&gt;it would be easier to glue and place, if the base was a little stiffer, but i got them promptly and they are a good&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li> these eyelashes are so amazing I regret not buying more than one they are beautiful every one loves them im going to order more</li>
            <li> Theses lashes are amazing! I love them! They don&#x27;t come with glue but other than that I love them I definitely will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I got these early and they were perfect for the doll like look i was going for. definitely going through this sellar again.</li>
            <li> Awesome for the price! I have wore them four times since I got them and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> They alright to thin only useful when my thicker ones aren&#x27;t good anymore in I have to buy more so these I call my stand by lashes</li>
            <li> When I received my package more than half of the eyelashes were mangled and misshapen. they also don&#x27;t contour to your eyelash very well.</li>
            <li> I decided to give these lashes a try, i love wearing lashes since i hardly have any of my own anymore so fake lashes make a huge difference on me and make my eys pop :) ...and for the price of these you can&#x27;t beat that! Well when i got them last week or so i tryed them they are a little heavy and thick then what im use to. I usually buy the cherry brand,the band on that are thinner and not as thick as these. There ok it just feels a little heavy on my eyes, ive seem some pictures of some women wearing them and they look great on them but im just not feeling these, i will keep as a backup though!</li>
            <li> Love these lashes. Easy to apply . Would purchase these a again. Received on expected arrival date. Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes were fantastic. They arrived well before the expected arrival date. As I recall, they shipped the same day I ordered them and arrived in about two and a half weeks. I wore these with a costume, and as other reviewers have mentioned, they certainly have a costume-look, and not a natural-look. They stayed on well all night and they come packaged with a little bit extra on each end, so there is no trouble with bends in the lashes from packaging that I&#x27;ve had in the past. I was easily able to layer three pairs of these for an animated look, and they work well on many eye-types as I helped a couple of round-eyed friends with their make-up as well. So far, I&#x27;ve used the same pair twice with no trouble. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I really love these lashes. They look natural, and are not too much over the top. easy to use.    I have a video with them on here: [...]</li>
            <li> I ordered this item an it took two months to get here and still don&#x27;t have it. I needed it for a dance and it&#x27;s to late now. Ugh so mad at amazon right now.</li>
            <li> I do not like them at all they look really fake, they  looks like plastic would not even attempt to use these will task to them in the trash I would not recommend you purchase these</li>
            <li> These were ok, they are too long and look drag queen like but ok for the night out in town. They are not for natural day look, atleast for me.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my eyelash purchases through Amazon. Every fake eyelash I purchased is cheaper than any drug store brand not to mention 10 times more eyelashes for the price. I think my eyelash craving has been fixed. I now have enough for the next couple of years for costume parties, if I want to get dolled up, having makeup parties with the girls or whatever my hearts desire. I totally recommend. Thank you for your product. The quality is great.</li>
            <li> Lashes are too thick and too long.  I&#x27;d expect fake lashes to look unnatural, but these are outrageously unnatural.  I even trimmed them, and they still look bad on me.</li>
            <li> I love love love these eyelashes !!!! Full and light weight ! Reusable I would recommend to anyone  for professional use</li>
            <li> My daughter used them all the time and they look great. I can&#x27;t beat the prize for that many!&lt;br /&gt;Shirley</li>
            <li> I wear lashes alot, so I thought this was a good deal. I guess I am spoiled - I wear human hair lashes, and these feel like they are made of baling wire. Plus, they have no adhesive to place them on your eye for trimming.</li>
            <li> I had to trim them before putting them on and they look very fake. Very heavy feeling too. Don&#x27;t think I will be buying these again.</li>
            <li> Finally, true thick style eyelashes.  Really good wear I have used one pair for a week, as long as you trim the glue off of the base..</li>
            <li> it you want a costume y look then they are fine. waxy and very fake looking. but they are cheap enough</li>
            <li> Well you get what you pay for. They look and feel cheap. Hardly even bend, but they aren&#x27;t the worst. Probably the best you&#x27;ll get for a buck or 2.</li>
            <li> They look rediculous when you where them. People look at you funny because they look completely fake. Way too thick and long and I like my eyelashes to look more thicker and longer than most eyelashes I can find but these are way too much. Unless you&#x27;re going on a stage or not going to be with in about 7 feet of anyone these eyelashes are not worth getting.</li>
            <li> If you dress up a lot in costumes this is a great product for you. Please ladies don&#x27;t make yourself look like a crazy psychopathic bride of chuck doll wearing these thick, hard, plastic lashes!</li>
            <li> have not received them we are still waiting so we cannot reviewed them until we see them. we will let you know</li>
            <li> it was iight i mean ig its just they look too fake and they would be better for sumthing like halloween but not to be wearing everyday.They came warlier than i expected they were supposed to be here the 24th but got here the 14th and i tried putting it on and had to cut em cuz they were too long...bou...NO!!! these are 100% not for everyday use unless u wanna look like a lil elementary cartoon girl then u gor right ahead boo boo....mhm</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 pairs, and they arrived earlier than expected, Im a huge fan of make-up. These eyelashes are Beautiful and can be used more than once. :)  I highly recommend this product. :) They go best with DUO eyelash adhesive. :) I will be ordering more pairs soon. :)</li>
            <li> i just got them last night and they dont even seem like they can be used the box was smashed and the lashes look like plastic and not even close to something that could be used kinda sad</li>
            <li> very affordable , amazing turn out they are very reusable  and comfortable they last all threw out the day or night.</li>
            <li> Pathetic have worked perfectly for what I need, there are so many for an impeccable price! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with my lashes. For the price I was very satisfied. Buying bulk is a great way to save money.</li>
            <li> If I couldn&#x27;t make these 0 stars I would. Do not buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like these lashes, they were too long, and very fake. They weren&#x27;t really soft, they were plastic. Not only that, they took forever to arrive; the last lashes I bought from another seller took only a week to arrive and they were better quality than these. I bought these a month ago. When I finally received my lashes, I checked the box and noticed that I had only received 4 pieces instead of 5, showing that I was missing a pair of lashes. That disappointed me. Well, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes, and oh so perfect for the frugal shopper!  I use lashes everyday and am able to get at least a week&#x27;s worth of wear from one pair of these lashes. They are bendable enough for easy application, yet sturdy enough to last. Shipping was free from China, and came 2 weeks sooner than posted.</li>
            <li> It takes patience you have to work with them.  I had to cut them in sections they were too stiff and thick at the lash band to go on in one piece and stay in place.  I&#x27;m okay with the extra attention they need because they look fantastic and they were such a good price.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how thick but not thick at all just like the rest perfect</li>
            <li> extremely long i thought it would be a much better quality.. the use is more for halloween or something to dress up with.</li>
            <li> Great price but they just don&#x27;t look the way I thought they would. I might have to purchase something else</li>
            <li> my granddaughter was so happy to receive these from me as a gift. she buys eyelashes all the time and this will help her from going to the store so often.</li>
            <li> NEVER USED STRIPS BEFORE LEARNING HOW TO PUT THESE ON OMG I LOVE EM I GUESS ONCE I FIGURE OUT I ALWAYS USE INDIVIDUALS HOPE I GET THIS THING DOWN PACK!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriends always ask me for eyelashes and i dont care for these since they were so cheap and it works for them.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed the lashes I recieved look nothing like the ones in the picture not even close so bummed I was expecting long thick lashes</li>
            <li> Hate it hate it the edges are to thick to glue on I will never buy these again nor recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> have much more expensive sets and these are not bad lots of sizes and the quality is good they go on very easy</li>
            <li> First off i was skeptical about these only because they are so cheap and affordable for so many.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have to say these lashes are durable even more so than the ones in the store.&lt;br /&gt;As i remove the Lash from its case, i pull it off and it doe not damage the lash, not one bit!.&lt;br /&gt;I personally love them and would consider buying these again. There is so many their well defined, Whats not to love?!</li>
            <li> I bought these in an attempt to find something cheaper than the 11euro eyelashes by eyelure and when i received these i was super excited!!! I am a fan of fake eyelashes , these are quite hard and i do suggest you curl them with an eyelash curler before you put them on!!!! they seem a bit hard to get on at first, but if you insist they do the job PERFECTLY and last all night without needing to replace or add glue to them!!! :D absolutely a must have, and the price is amazing!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I waited about 3 weeks for these to be delivered and then ended up very disappointed. They look and feel extremely fake, as in \\&quot;Toy Store\\&quot; fake. In fact, I gave them to my daughters to play dress up with. Not worth your wait or money!</li>
            <li> they are great i love them. the only downside to it is that they feel like plastic is glued to your eye. i only use them for that extra wow! soon getting more styles.</li>
            <li> do not stick with anything, do not stick with anything, do not stick with anything, do not stick with anything, do not stick with anything! do not stick with anything</li>
            <li> I purchased these online and I must say that they came much quicker than anticipated and were a wonderful buy! I definitely feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth!! great deal!!</li>
            <li> I usually wear the ardell 105 or 117 .. these are the same .. they may be a little harder to work with as they do not bend that easy , but I used regular eyelash glue and they stayed in fine . The best thing about them is that one pair will last a long time ..when you take them off they do not change shape .. I linked this to all my friends .. i got another set i will repeat this review , they are exactly alike</li>
            <li> I have ordered this for my Sister almost 40-45 days back and havent got it yet. I realised i cant trust everyone.. :((((</li>
            <li> I buy them all the time. I absolutely love them and its wayy cheaper than buying them at the store. They take a while to receive but its worth the wait. Buyyy them!</li>
            <li> so far so good. i have&#x27;nt worn them yet. so i dont know they look on. i&#x27;ll have to see.</li>
