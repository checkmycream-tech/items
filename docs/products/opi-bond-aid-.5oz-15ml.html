            <li>, I am very glad I did now.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the packaging and shipping of this product.</li>
            <li>Liked this product it worked well</li>
            <li>i do my my own nails</li>
            <li>I almost aways do my own at home, but I was out of town</li>
            <li>My daughter and I started doing our own gel nails with a kit</li>
            <li>My real nails looked perfect for almost 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced varying degrees of success with or without applying the product.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for acrylic or gel nail application.</li>
            <li>My manicurist would use this to adhere my acrylics better</li>
            <li>I really love OPI BondAid-</li>
            <li>Even my manicurist thinks it works better than OPI&#x27;s Chip Skip.</li>
            <li>I love painting my nails.</li>
            <li>Nails seen to chip more than before i used this product.</li>
            <li>Then it was more growth than anything.</li>
            <li>They could have provided a better nail brush.</li>
            <li>I think the Gelish PH balance works a bit better and it was cheaper.</li>
            <li>Prepares the nails before top coat is applied.</li>
            <li>It was ok, but my polish still came off after 2 days.</li>
            <li>And it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Make sure your nails are free of oils and lotion</li>
            <li>Bond Aid dries up quickly so you can move on to applying your favorite nail polish or gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although psychologically it feels great to &amp;#34;prep&amp;#34; our nails for painting...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what this does, but my nail lady used it, so when I decided to pioneer doing my own nails with the gel polish, I bought it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still not as good as a professional manicure</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I am able to keep my gel polish on for much longer now that I start with the Bond Aid.  </li>
            <li>but they kept peeling off quickly.</li>
            <li>product as described shipped quickly</li>
            <li>I tried this to get my polish to hold better on my natural nails (not recommended by manufacture)</li>
            <li>I love this product,  only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because my items where a week late, so i wasnt very happy about that.</li>
            <li>I need to try this some more before coming up with a better review other then it doesn&#x27;t hurt and doesn&#x27;t hinder extension.</li>
            <li>one does have a strong smell, so if you&#x27;re allergic or very sensitive, try to apply it in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li>I get several more days of wear from my polish when I use this.</li>
            <li>The manicure last 2 weeks or more as promised.  </li>
            <li>some item that we can spend our money on that will satisfy our need for our nail polish lasting more than 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, this isn&#x27;t the solution (no pun</li>
            <li>It really works and I&#x27;ve had a lot of success with the gels staying on.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to OPI Bond Aid in a Beauty Supply store, but they no longer carry it.  </li>
            <li>This works pretty well, however, if you have your hands in water alot</li>
            <li>Putting it on first really helps the gel polish stay longer on my nails.</li>
            <li>This really does work.  </li>
            <li>when I was ready to change it.</li>
            <li>this really helps to keep your polish on longer.</li>
            <li>but it really works -</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in wear from what I get without it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in how my gel manicure stays, but I&#x27;ve heard from others that it&#x27;s done very well.  </li>
            <li>it really helps nail polish adhere to your nails, sustaining my manicure through the week.</li>
            <li>I think this really helps.</li>
            <li>it hasn&#x27;t seemed to make much of a</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Apply carefully and enjoy your manicure for weeks instead of days!</li>
            <li>Went to a nail place that uses this and was amazed at how much longer my polish lasted so bought a bottle myself.  </li>
            <li>but you can use any brush of your choice, a thin to mid thickness works best.</li>
            <li>its just alcohol and its purpose is really to dry out any natural oils in your nail so that the gel polish with adhere better.</li>
            <li>I had read some comments that this Bond Aid isn&#x27;t necessary if you make your own mix of alcohol and acetone to dry up your nails before polish.</li>
            <li>Helped for less chipping. :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>but I still find these PH balances work better than just plain rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>but I have since let my nails grow natural.</li>
            <li>I have had no trouble with peeling or cracking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how well</li>
            <li>The manicure still lasted about the same amount of time, but I think this is more due to my novice skill level and not sealing the nail ends properly.  </li>
            <li>Small bottle of mostly acetone to remove oils prior to basecoat</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry up the cuticle or nail surface like pure acetone does.</li>
            <li>I have used it a few times, and I am not convinced that it really makes much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>and this addition will keep busy hands with a manicure several days longer.</li>

            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> My manicure lasted twice as long after using Bondaid.</li>
            <li> The only thing i was disappointed about was how tiny the bottle is, but I didnt put much thought into how much .5 oz.</li>
            <li> This was it - the missing piece that would make my at home manicures last as long as salon manicures.  </li>
            <li> I did notice it was harder to peel the polish off (</li>
            <li> its really not needed.</li>
            <li> It was recommended for use before base coat of polish to help the polish adhere better and, therefore, last longer.  </li>
            <li> and i out this on my nails after i push up my cuticles and file my nails down</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, so no fault of the seller, just questioning the product itself.  </li>
            <li> it did help a little but will still peel off.</li>
            <li> this stuff is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use for applying acrylic nails, I was really impatient to use this product and couldnt wait for the rest of my amazon packages to come in</li>
            <li> so I used this bondaid as a base coat before my actual base coat and it worked amazing!</li>
            <li> I used this as a base when shellacing my nails and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 because the brush is dinky and stiff. .</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what other people complaint about.</li>
            <li> Small</li>
            <li> I usually do gel at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but if you know what it does</li>
            <li> and I work at an animal rescue and don&#x27;t usually wear polish because it just chips off.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin, short nails</li>
            <li> The lady put this first on before the base coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time with the gels staying on my nails and a friend recommended I use this.</li>
            <li> This really helps as a base coat to bond the polish to my nail.</li>
            <li> My nail polish usually starts chipping within a day after a manicure, but not with this product!  </li>
            <li> I used this product before applying my base coat for a basic manicure and it did not extend the life of my manicure at all.</li>
            <li> Of course, us nail fanatics pray that there must be some secret..</li>
            <li> The tips of my nails are always so thin and peeling.  </li>
            <li> Definitely do not regret getting this bad boy!</li>
            <li> Is this fake?</li>
            <li> I use it with the OPI base/top coat and OPI colors I almost always end up taking them off before they even look bad.</li>

            <li> This really does work.  I get several more days of wear from my polish when I use this.</li>
            <li> Helped for less chipping. :)</li>
            <li> I purhased this in an attempt to get my at-home gel manicures to last longer than one week.  I have only used this once, but it did help the polish stick to my nails.  The manicure still lasted about the same amount of time, but I think this is more due to my novice skill level and not sealing the nail ends properly.  I did notice it was harder to peel the polish off (which I know is a no-no!) when I was ready to change it.</li>
            <li> I used this product before applying my base coat for a basic manicure and it did not extend the life of my manicure at all. I still experienced chipping after two days. Maybe it works better for acrylic or gel nail application.</li>
            <li> this stuff is a waste of money. its really not needed. its just alcohol and its purpose is really to dry out any natural oils in your nail so that the gel polish with adhere better. but regular rubbing alcohol is all you need. i feel juked.</li>
            <li> Great for gel! Definitely do not regret getting this bad boy!</li>
            <li> My manicurist would use this to adhere my acrylics better but I have since let my nails grow natural. I tried this to get my polish to hold better on my natural nails (not recommended by manufacture) anad it did help a little but will still peel off.</li>
            <li> Works great even with CND</li>
            <li> this really helps to keep your polish on longer. It sets your Ph in your nail bed,I follow this with a sticky nail primer before polish and can go 2wks between redo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Works great so I&#x27;m not sure what other people complaint about. I had read some comments that this Bond Aid isn&#x27;t necessary if you make your own mix of alcohol and acetone to dry up your nails before polish. Nah nah nah nah!! I tried that before buying this Bond Aid and not even close to working. Bond Aid dries up quickly so you can move on to applying your favorite nail polish or gel. I had tried a blue glue-type-liquid from Sally Beauty and it worked well but only with regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;This one does have a strong smell, so if you&#x27;re allergic or very sensitive, try to apply it in a well ventilated area. Doesn&#x27;t come with a brush but you can use any brush of your choice, a thin to mid thickness works best. Doesn&#x27;t dry up the cuticle or nail surface like pure acetone does.</li>
            <li> Is this fake? It doesn&#x27;t work like the one they use at the nail salon. Amazon needs to get better about weeding out fake beauty care products.</li>
            <li> Liked this product it worked well and I could tell a difference if I did not use it.</li>
            <li> This was it - the missing piece that would make my at home manicures last as long as salon manicures.  It&#x27;s basically a dehydrating agent but it really works - I think in a pinch you can also mix acetone and isopropyl alcohol but I&#x27;d rather leave that to the professionals.</li>
            <li> Great for at home nails.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times, and I am not convinced that it really makes much of a difference.  It arrived quickly, so no fault of the seller, just questioning the product itself.  I have used it under regular and shellac polishes and I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in wear from what I get without it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in how my gel manicure stays, but I&#x27;ve heard from others that it&#x27;s done very well.  I guess it varies person to person.</li>
            <li> This bonding agent works great under my Shellac manicure.  I have had no trouble with peeling or cracking.  The manicure last 2 weeks or more as promised.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I really love OPI BondAid-it really helps nail polish adhere to your nails, sustaining my manicure through the week. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My nail polish usually starts chipping within a day after a manicure, but not with this product!  It&#x27;s WONDERFUL!!  Even my manicurist thinks it works better than OPI&#x27;s Chip Skip.</li>
            <li> I think this really helps. I use it prior to my gel polish</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails. Of course, us nail fanatics pray that there must be some secret..some item that we can spend our money on that will satisfy our need for our nail polish lasting more than 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, this isn&#x27;t the solution (no pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;Although psychologically it feels great to &amp;#34;prep&amp;#34; our nails for painting...it hasn&#x27;t seemed to make much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;You win some, you lose some.</li>
            <li> Dont see any differences at all. Nails seen to chip more than before i used this product. Oh wells i guess.</li>
            <li> It took forever to get here. Small but it&#x27;ll do the job.</li>
            <li> The point of this is to help with bonding of gel.... Can&#x27;t say I noticed any difference whether I used it or not.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> This does indeed help keep my polish longer than without it. I use my hands a lot and it last about two days before the tips can see any tiny chips at all.  about 5 days before I redo them.</li>
            <li> The jury is still deliberating on whether this &#x27;bond aid&#x27; is even remotely necessary. I&#x27;ve experienced varying degrees of success with or without applying the product. You decide.</li>
            <li> Used this with my order of OPI gel system intro kit since this doesn&#x27;t come with the kit, works as it should. Excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use for applying acrylic nails, I was really impatient to use this product and couldnt wait for the rest of my amazon packages to come in so I used this bondaid as a base coat before my actual base coat and it worked amazing! My nail polish didnt chip off! The only thing i was disappointed about was how tiny the bottle is, but I didnt put much thought into how much .5 oz. was. I will definitely be buying this product again. And it was shiped to my house in about 2-3 days!</li>
            <li> Small bottle of mostly acetone to remove oils prior to basecoat</li>
            <li> Causes nail polish to lose its luster and shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time with the gels staying on my nails and a friend recommended I use this. It really works and I&#x27;ve had a lot of success with the gels staying on.</li>
            <li> i do my my own nails and i out this on my nails after i push up my cuticles and file my nails down it keeps the on till i take em off</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the bonding aid I had before, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I am still using the same bottle.  And it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I am able to keep my gel polish on for much longer now that I start with the Bond Aid.  I went and had my nails done and asked the manicurist what she was applying, she told me and I immediately ordered it.  I almost aways do my own at home, but I was out of town so I had to pay to get them done, I am very glad I did now.</li>
            <li> Dries the nail instantly. No wait time. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I started doing our own gel nails with a kit but they kept peeling off quickly. This product stopped that from happening.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to OPI Bond Aid in a Beauty Supply store, but they no longer carry it.  It was recommended for use before base coat of polish to help the polish adhere better and, therefore, last longer.  IT WORKS!  I have been using it ever since.  By the way, nail salons use the same product before applying gel polish or acrylic products because it improves adhesion.  I take a bottle for them to use on my toes before applying regular polish so that it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I usually do gel at home. I had to go to the salon to get my gel done for a wedding because i didn;t have time to do it myself. The lady put this first on before the base coat. It makes such a difference. My nail isn&#x27;t lifting at the cuticle after a week. You just need to put it around your cuticles not on the the entire nail. I would buy this again!!</li>
            <li> I found this online at a wonderful price not including the shipping.  This is one of those things I would always forget to buy while at the store so I ordered it online.  I am very pleased with the packaging and shipping of this product. I recommend everyone shop online with Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I used this as a base when shellacing my nails and was not disappointed.  My real nails looked perfect for almost 3 weeks.  Then it was more growth than anything.</li>
            <li> I love this product,  only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because my items where a week late, so i wasnt very happy about that.</li>
            <li> My manicure lasted twice as long after using Bondaid. I recommend it and will continue to use it.  I gave it a 4 because the brush is dinky and stiff. . They could have provided a better nail brush.</li>
            <li> I think the Gelish PH balance works a bit better and it was cheaper. I know this stuff is essentially alcohol - but I still find these PH balances work better than just plain rubbing alcohol. It must be a different concentration or something.</li>
            <li> When i was looking for a bonding product I knew that I could trust the OPI name!  Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Great product. Prepares the nails before top coat is applied.</li>
            <li> product as described shipped quickly</li>
            <li> It was ok, but my polish still came off after 2 days.</li>
            <li> this product I had heard about on youtube, so I thought I would give it a go....it does actually seem to hold my regular polish on longer.... by like a day or two...though I still struggle with chipping at the tips... but I guess that&#x27;s a given when you don&#x27;t use gel polish?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what this does, but my nail lady used it, so when I decided to pioneer doing my own nails with the gel polish, I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend it? I&#x27;m not sure, but if you know what it does then you should get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this helpful? Probably not.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use with my gel nail polish.  Putting it on first really helps the gel polish stay longer on my nails.</li>
            <li> Works good with OPI products</li>
            <li> This works pretty well, however, if you have your hands in water alot I wouldn&#x27;t bother.  I would try chip skip next time.</li>
            <li> Apply carefully and enjoy your manicure for weeks instead of days!</li>
            <li> I have very thin, short nails and I work at an animal rescue and don&#x27;t usually wear polish because it just chips off.  This really helps as a base coat to bond the polish to my nail.</li>
            <li> I need to try this some more before coming up with a better review other then it doesn&#x27;t hurt and doesn&#x27;t hinder extension.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders with gel nails.  I use it with the OPI base/top coat and OPI colors I almost always end up taking them off before they even look bad.</li>
            <li> Went to a nail place that uses this and was amazed at how much longer my polish lasted so bought a bottle myself.  Make sure your nails are free of oils and lotion and this addition will keep busy hands with a manicure several days longer.</li>
            <li> Great product. Must have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great with any nail polish.</li>
            <li> great product doing my own  gel manicure</li>
            <li> i love it its perfect</li>
            <li> Still not as good as a professional manicure but it does make my polish stay on a day or two longer than without using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how well this works.  The tips of my nails are always so thin and peeling.  This product helps to prevent the polish from peeling off too.</li>
