            <li>Beautiful colour!  </li>
            <li>and this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat this price, this is a great dupe for Nars Orgasm!  </li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin</li>
            <li>This color is beautiful.</li>
            <li>I am in between medium and fair skin and this looks amazing on!!!</li>
            <li>Beautiful color.</li>
            <li>It looks great and</li>
            <li>Great price for this product.</li>
            <li>It would look great in a matte shade.</li>
            <li>it looks great on so many skin colors!!</li>
            <li>I love the color it works perfect fro me, its also in a great container.</li>
            <li>Visit my site and message me for details, I am more than happy to share my before and afters!    </li>
            <li>Lovely color and fits perfect with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>This blush works perfectly with my light skin and the pigmentation is great.</li>
            <li>Every item from them that I&#x27;ve tried I&#x27;ve loved.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would look good on paler/lighter skinned ladies.</li>
            <li>I loved it when I applied it, UNTIL I turned my head to the side and saw this gawdy strip of GOLD glitter...and it wasn&#x27;t sparse</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be good for someone looking for a blush and highlighter in one, who doesn&#x27;t mind the gold tone to the glitter.</li>
            <li>Would be good if the glitter/sheen were reduced.</li>
            <li>Good product, good price, looks nice on my fair skin after I put on make up.  </li>

            <li>it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on and immediately fell in love!</li>
            <li>I have good brushes and very light skin.</li>
            <li>This blush is amazing</li>
            <li>those are amazing pigmented blushes</li>
            <li>I enjoy both and for $3 on the ELF website they are a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice shimmer to it, though.</li>
            <li>But nice blush.</li>
            <li>but i found that on my skin by the end of the day it kind of blotched off my cheeks</li>
            <li>Builds really nicely.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this blush!!!</li>
            <li>Came right on time and will order from them again &amp; again!!!</li>
            <li>So easy to travel with, I use it every day!</li>
            <li>I really love ELF products.</li>
            <li>perfect daily color.</li>
            <li>The formula of the blush is okay; it&#x27;s silky but also powdery</li>
            <li>I love this color</li>
            <li>This blush is ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is lovely anyhow with a Schimmer orange.</li>
            <li>I love these blushes.</li>
            <li>So glad</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>so i decided to pick up this ever so famous blush</li>
            <li>and i got to say i LOVE</li>
            <li>but it still reflects the light nicely.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>This would probably make a better highlighter than a blush.</li>
            <li>The color is very nice, but the gold sheen is a bit much.  </li>
            <li>The color is very nice and really very close to the nars orgasm.</li>
            <li>So far I am pretty impressed with the Candid Coral shade of e.l.f studio blush.</li>
            <li>The candid coral is great with my yellow toned skin and blond hair...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I was so impressed with these that I went back and purchased all the colors available except for the highlighters.</li>
            <li>this blush doesn&#x27;t do much on its own, but on its own, it gives a really nice golden sheen/glow to my skin.</li>
            <li>Very vibrant and does not take much to give you a nice glow!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very bold imo.</li>
            <li>I loved this color, it achieves a more mature look for my makeup at work.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>it does not wear away easily, though it helps I also use the ELF Mist and Set.  </li>
            <li>My favorite new blush!!!!</li>
            <li>I got this because I heard it was pretty much a duplicate of the very popular &amp;#34;Nars &#x27;orgasm&#x27;&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I also have light yellow undertones to my skin, so it would look great on others that do as well.</li>
            <li>I guess I know why e.l.f. is so cheap...</li>
            <li>I do not like the material because is so cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for all season, especially  spring and summer.</li>
            <li>face forward, but as soon as you turn your head you can see tons of the gold everywhere, and when the light hits it at all</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with fallout, but I apply with a light hand.</li>
            <li>The color payoff was great (love the color) considering how much I spent on it.</li>
            <li>The gold actually makes it even more gorgeous.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an elf product and I was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This lasts long and looks great.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful, but the blush itself is not very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I top it with a brighter blush, but this makes it look more natural and blends well.</li>
            <li>I really liked the color and it match to my skin color really well, very pigmented!</li>
            <li>is a great brand that&#x27;s not very expensive!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it gives a pretty settled coral look, my only problem is the shimmers, would not use this during daytime but would be great for night look.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice natural look.</li>
            <li>the price this is a fairly good blush that I would buy again, nothing short of what I would expect from E.L.F.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I bought this in candid coral, and it&#x27;s a nice subtle, healthy color on my otherwise sickly-pale scottish-german skin.</li>
            <li>I put this one first and if I want a strong color</li>
            <li>, it was super saturated amount of gold sparkles.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t stay on super</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a pretty light Latina</li>
            <li>Not really but a nice light blush.</li>
            <li>Great, love the color, I use it with a pink blush, to give it a more natural look, just as nice as the more expensive ones I used to buy.  </li>
            <li>Coral color blush perfect for me but not too heavy coverage, just gives a soft blush look.</li>
            <li>The only cons for me is that you have to really load it on your brush to get good pigment.  </li>
            <li>but so far, I had not had a reaction to this blush :)</li>
            <li>This shade looks super pretty in the picture</li>
            <li>Since it is a natural color, a fear of attaching too much is also a lovely color!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a really pretty coral color and it does has some gold but not that much where its super noticeable on your skin.</li>
            <li>Nice color but not highly pigmented</li>
            <li>I feel like higher quality blushes</li>
            <li>but at $3, it doesn&#x27;t really matter!  </li>
            <li>Just is not so intense, but that is not bad, if you want a decent looking blush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to need to buy more soon but only because I&#x27;ve had it for so long and use it the most.</li>
            <li>Only good if your paper white.</li>
            <li>This is great if you want to try a coral shade, but not go all crazy as this is fresh and coral, while still being nice and proper.</li>
            <li>This really is a pretty shade, much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>This is a nice blush for the price, but it&#x27;s a little shimmery for my taste.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be more Coral and not so pink.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>You would really have to pack it on your brush before you started looking like a clown.  </li>
            <li>I really like this blush</li>
            <li>no matter how much I applied.</li>
            <li>and you couldn&#x27;t really see it on me.</li>
            <li>I really had to layer this on to even get some type of shade.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Then again, it is from elf, so I do not think you can expect too much in the way of quality.</li>
            <li>This one you really go through quite a bit,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but I have to build quite a few layers to see anything</li>
            <li>I would normally choose pink as my blush colors but am glad I chose this coral color.  </li>
            <li>The golden shimmer does tend to fall out all over your face if you&#x27;re not careful, as well.  </li>
            <li>And then I like layering it with other blushes I have, and it looks UH-MAZING! &#x3D;]]</li>
            <li>It has a slight sparkle (more of a glow).</li>
            <li>famous and expensive brand keel your skin healthy.</li>
            <li>If you really can&#x27;t afford Nars, then this would work, but in my opinion, the Nars is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>not exactly a fan of e.l.f make up, was just searching for a pretty coral color, this one is definitely true to color, not as pigmented</li>
            <li>There are little gold flecks in the blush that gives your skin a radiant glow without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>which I consider a plus because I normally can&#x27;t pull of bronzer.</li>
            <li>The only cons I have are that it&#x27;s pretty small and kind of hard for me to fit my blush brush in it and that like with other ElF products the powder is very soft, so apply lightly!</li>
            <li>it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>It was a little light for my complexion.</li>
            <li>the color lighter than I expect I have to use several time in my cheek when I see the real color.</li>
            <li>This blush is a really pretty color, goes on well, and lasts long.  </li>
            <li>The color is very similar but it doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth or last as long as the Nars version.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a subtle peachy glow and i am defiantly going to be using this A LOT :)</li>
            <li>As far as pigmentation goes, I&#x27;ve found this blush to be quite sheer.</li>
            <li>so my skin can sometimes be sensitive towards different products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dark skinned and this just blends into my skin really.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t quite show it in the picture but its a little more peachy than coral and has small gold flecks.</li>
            <li>This blush is a really dark coral pink with flecks of golden shimmer in it.  </li>
            <li>I was very doubtful at first since my last order was &amp;#34;not so great&amp;#34; but this is AMAZING!</li>

            <li> Nice color but not highly pigmented</li>
            <li> I feel like higher quality blushes</li>
            <li> but at $3, it doesn&#x27;t really matter!  </li>
            <li> Just is not so intense, but that is not bad, if you want a decent looking blush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to need to buy more soon but only because I&#x27;ve had it for so long and use it the most.</li>
            <li> Only good if your paper white.</li>
            <li> This is great if you want to try a coral shade, but not go all crazy as this is fresh and coral, while still being nice and proper.</li>
            <li> This really is a pretty shade, much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a nice blush for the price, but it&#x27;s a little shimmery for my taste.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be more Coral and not so pink.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> You would really have to pack it on your brush before you started looking like a clown.  </li>
            <li> I really like this blush</li>
            <li> no matter how much I applied.</li>
            <li> and you couldn&#x27;t really see it on me.</li>
            <li> I really had to layer this on to even get some type of shade.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Then again, it is from elf, so I do not think you can expect too much in the way of quality.</li>
            <li> This one you really go through quite a bit,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but I have to build quite a few layers to see anything</li>
            <li> I would normally choose pink as my blush colors but am glad I chose this coral color.  </li>
            <li> The golden shimmer does tend to fall out all over your face if you&#x27;re not careful, as well.  </li>
            <li> And then I like layering it with other blushes I have, and it looks UH-MAZING! &#x3D;]]</li>
            <li> It has a slight sparkle (more of a glow).</li>
            <li> famous and expensive brand keel your skin healthy.</li>
            <li> If you really can&#x27;t afford Nars, then this would work, but in my opinion, the Nars is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> not exactly a fan of e.l.f make up, was just searching for a pretty coral color, this one is definitely true to color, not as pigmented</li>
            <li> There are little gold flecks in the blush that gives your skin a radiant glow without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> which I consider a plus because I normally can&#x27;t pull of bronzer.</li>
            <li> The only cons I have are that it&#x27;s pretty small and kind of hard for me to fit my blush brush in it and that like with other ElF products the powder is very soft, so apply lightly!</li>
            <li> it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> It was a little light for my complexion.</li>
            <li> the color lighter than I expect I have to use several time in my cheek when I see the real color.</li>
            <li> This blush is a really pretty color, goes on well, and lasts long.  </li>
            <li> The color is very similar but it doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth or last as long as the Nars version.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a subtle peachy glow and i am defiantly going to be using this A LOT :)</li>
            <li> As far as pigmentation goes, I&#x27;ve found this blush to be quite sheer.</li>
            <li> so my skin can sometimes be sensitive towards different products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark skinned and this just blends into my skin really.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite show it in the picture but its a little more peachy than coral and has small gold flecks.</li>
            <li> This blush is a really dark coral pink with flecks of golden shimmer in it.  </li>
            <li> I was very doubtful at first since my last order was &amp;#34;not so great&amp;#34; but this is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Only downsides is it doesn&#x27;t last a long time on the skin</li>
            <li> Full, long, thick lashes are always in style, but applying false lashes daily isn’t always practical and is very time consuming.  </li>
            <li> Its a pale pink, not as vibrant as I thought but still like it and use from time to time</li>
            <li> At least it didnt cost that much.</li>
            <li> Very low-quality, don&#x27;t even waste 5 dollars on this!!</li>
            <li> careful carriage the case would hold and last, otherwise if you are rough on your cosmetics when packing them the plastic &amp;#34;window&amp;#34; can come off and the powder can get a bit all over.</li>
            <li> I think you need to be careful applying this</li>
            <li> so you do have to be careful with it.  </li>
            <li> Less pink than expected.</li>
            <li> I have not had problems with the product being too small, but that&#x27;s because I use a smaller blush brush.</li>
            <li> well, I usually have to reapply later in the day</li>
            <li> so I use it more as a base and blend with my other blush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even dark</li>
            <li> I think that this would be a really smart buy for anyone who craves really dramatic lashes but either can’t wear false lashes, or don’t have the time to apply falsies in their daily routine.</li>
            <li> Before using this I used wet and wild blushes and don&#x27;t give me wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this blush a few times and it just doesn&#x27;t show up on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a little messy, but powder blush usually is</li>
            <li> So finding a way to get the look of fake lashes without actually having to take the time to glue them on is life changing!</li>
            <li> This is a VERY pale coral (if it can even be called coral).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle peachy coral.</li>
            <li> Because I am very very pale (Norse!)</li>
            <li> you hardly have to dab your brush to get the color you need!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really liked the color and it match to my skin color really well, very pigmented! I´ll make another purchase according to the reviews the judy travis!!!</li>
            <li> I love the color it works perfect fro me, its also in a great container. So easy to travel with, I use it every day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but I have to build quite a few layers to see anything so I use it more as a base and blend with my other blush. I thought it was going to be more Coral and not so pink. Nice shimmer to it, though.</li>
            <li> I really love ELF products. Every item from them that I&#x27;ve tried I&#x27;ve loved. And I adore this blush. It doesn&#x27;t quite show it in the picture but its a little more peachy than coral and has small gold flecks. Because I am very very pale (Norse!) the gold flakes work almost like a bronzed for me which I consider a plus because I normally can&#x27;t pull of bronzer. I also have light yellow undertones to my skin, so it would look great on others that do as well. The only cons I have are that it&#x27;s pretty small and kind of hard for me to fit my blush brush in it and that like with other ElF products the powder is very soft, so apply lightly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this blush a few times and it just doesn&#x27;t show up on my skin. I have good brushes and very light skin. I guess I know why e.l.f. is so cheap... wouldn&#x27;t buy anything from this brand again.</li>
            <li> I really love this blush! It looks great and it lasts!&lt;br /&gt;e.l.f. is a great brand that&#x27;s not very expensive!&lt;br /&gt;I def recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> It was a little light for my complexion. But nice blush. Was hoping to get something close to Nars Orgasm. Not really but a nice light blush.</li>
            <li> I do not like the material because is so cheap. the color lighter than I expect I have to use several time in my cheek when I see the real color. suggest buy famous and expensive brand keel your skin healthy.</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful.The shipping was fast.Great price for this product. It&#x27;s great for all season, especially  spring and summer.</li>
            <li> perfect daily color. Use them a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY pale coral (if it can even be called coral). I&#x27;m dark skinned and this just blends into my skin really. no color pop or resemblance of any color at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would look good on paler/lighter skinned ladies.</li>
            <li> This really is a pretty shade, much better than I expected. It&#x27;s a subtle peachy coral. I loved it when I applied it, UNTIL I turned my head to the side and saw this gawdy strip of GOLD glitter...and it wasn&#x27;t sparse, it was super saturated amount of gold sparkles. It ruined the blush for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be good for someone looking for a blush and highlighter in one, who doesn&#x27;t mind the gold tone to the glitter. I think you need to be careful applying this or it could get clownish. It&#x27;s deceiving when you&#x27;re applying it while looking at yourself face forward, but as soon as you turn your head you can see tons of the gold everywhere, and when the light hits it at all it&#x27;s very bold imo.</li>
            <li> This blush is a really dark coral pink with flecks of golden shimmer in it.  The formula of the blush is okay; it&#x27;s silky but also powdery so you do have to be careful with it.  The golden shimmer does tend to fall out all over your face if you&#x27;re not careful, as well.  Packaging-wise, it&#x27;s very similar to the packaging of NARS except it has a window to see the color and it&#x27;s plastic, not rubber.  As far as pigmentation goes, I&#x27;ve found this blush to be quite sheer. You would really have to pack it on your brush before you started looking like a clown.  I have not had problems with the product being too small, but that&#x27;s because I use a smaller blush brush. It&#x27;s all up to personal preference, I guess.  Overall I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> not exactly a fan of e.l.f make up, was just searching for a pretty coral color, this one is definitely true to color, not as pigmented but it gives a pretty settled coral look, my only problem is the shimmers, would not use this during daytime but would be great for night look.</li>
            <li> Less pink than expected.</li>
            <li> Not the same colour as the picture.</li>
            <li> I love this color it looks great on so many skin colors!! Very vibrant and does not take much to give you a nice glow!!</li>
            <li> Only good if your paper white.</li>
            <li> This blush is ok. This is my first time using an elf product and I was pleased with it. The color payoff was great (love the color) considering how much I spent on it. Only downsides is it doesn&#x27;t last a long time on the skin and it&#x27;s a shimmery blush. I personally prefer a matte blush over a shimmery blush but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Since it is a natural color, a fear of attaching too much is also a lovely color!&lt;br /&gt;It is lovely anyhow with a Schimmer orange.</li>
            <li> I love these blushes. I bought this in candid coral, and it&#x27;s a nice subtle, healthy color on my otherwise sickly-pale scottish-german skin. It has a slight sparkle (more of a glow). I would buy again!</li>
            <li> I really like this blush, I have olive skin tone and it makes me look like im blushing not wearing makeup. I put this one first and if I want a strong color I top it with a brighter blush, but this makes it look more natural and blends well.</li>
            <li> Full, long, thick lashes are always in style, but applying false lashes daily isn’t always practical and is very time consuming.  So finding a way to get the look of fake lashes without actually having to take the time to glue them on is life changing! I think that this would be a really smart buy for anyone who craves really dramatic lashes but either can’t wear false lashes, or don’t have the time to apply falsies in their daily routine. Visit my site and message me for details, I am more than happy to share my before and afters!    [...]</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Came right on time and will order from them again &amp; again!!!</li>
            <li> The color is very nice, but the gold sheen is a bit much.  As a redhead, I have to be conservative in makeup choices.  Would be good if the glitter/sheen were reduced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to need to buy more soon but only because I&#x27;ve had it for so long and use it the most. The color is perfect on me. So glad</li>
            <li> This I couldnt even see on my skin (olive toned) no matter how much I applied. I gave it to my kids as play make up. At least it didnt cost that much.</li>
            <li> This is a nice blush for the price, but it&#x27;s a little shimmery for my taste. It would look great in a matte shade.</li>
            <li> The candid coral is great with my yellow toned skin and blond hair...it is not a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; coral...more like a soft pink.</li>
            <li> Its lighter than I thought. Its a pale pink, not as vibrant as I thought but still like it and use from time to time</li>
            <li> This lasts long and looks great. I love the color it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> This blush is amazing and I recommend it to anyone. It is a really pretty coral color and it does has some gold but not that much where its super noticeable on your skin. The gold actually makes it even more gorgeous. Before using this I used wet and wild blushes and don&#x27;t give me wrong those are amazing pigmented blushes but i found that on my skin by the end of the day it kind of blotched off my cheeks so i decided to pick up this ever so famous blush and i got to say i LOVE it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on and immediately fell in love! it has lasted all day and my skin still looks flawless! I am in between medium and fair skin and this looks amazing on!!! It gives me a subtle peachy glow and i am defiantly going to be using this A LOT :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been contemplating to buy this, go for it! you will be absolutely happy that you got it!</li>
            <li> Nice color but not highly pigmented</li>
            <li> I ordered this blush because I read in a magazine that it is comperable to the Benefit Brand Coralista blush and it is supposed to go with any skin type.  This blush is a really pretty color, goes on well, and lasts long.  I would normally choose pink as my blush colors but am glad I chose this coral color.  I will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> Lovely color and fits perfect with my skin tone. I&#x27;m a olive skin tone, so perfect for medium makeup wearers.</li>
            <li> Great, love the color, I use it with a pink blush, to give it a more natural look, just as nice as the more expensive ones I used to buy.  Good product, good price, looks nice on my fair skin after I put on make up.  Gives a nice natural look.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Builds really nicely.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this blush!!! Granted, I have a darker skin tone, so this blush doesn&#x27;t do much on its own, but on its own, it gives a really nice golden sheen/glow to my skin. And then I like layering it with other blushes I have, and it looks UH-MAZING! &#x3D;]]</li>
            <li> I like this blush, it&#x27;s not too shimmery but it still reflects the light nicely. However, it doesn&#x27;t stay on super well, I usually have to reapply later in the day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad. This shade looks super pretty in the picture and I&#x27;m a pretty light Latina and you couldn&#x27;t really see it on me. I really had to layer this on to even get some type of shade. :( I&#x27;ll just try another color.</li>
            <li> Very low-quality, don&#x27;t even waste 5 dollars on this!! So disappointed! I&#x27;m not even dark and it doesn&#x27;t show up!</li>
            <li> My favorite new blush!!!! I was very doubtful at first since my last order was &amp;#34;not so great&amp;#34; but this is AMAZING! love it</li>
            <li> I tried this because everyone was saying how it was a NARS Orgasm dupe. It looks that way but when I applied it, it was too sheer. There was very sheer colour. It was also too shimery. My face looked like a disco ball. The wear is short too, I have it on for about 2 hours and it&#x27;s gone. This would probably make a better highlighter than a blush.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a dupe of NARS Orgasm for a fraction of the price, look no further. This blush works perfectly with my light skin and the pigmentation is great. There are little gold flecks in the blush that gives your skin a radiant glow without being overwhelming. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with fallout, but I apply with a light hand. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Coral color blush perfect for me but not too heavy coverage, just gives a soft blush look.</li>
            <li> I loved this color, it achieves a more mature look for my makeup at work.&lt;br /&gt;For the price this is a fairly good blush that I would buy again, nothing short of what I would expect from E.L.F.&lt;br /&gt;With careful carriage the case would hold and last, otherwise if you are rough on your cosmetics when packing them the plastic &amp;#34;window&amp;#34; can come off and the powder can get a bit all over.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful, but the blush itself is not very pigmented. Then again, it is from elf, so I do not think you can expect too much in the way of quality.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colour!  I have very fair skin and this is perfect.  it does not wear away easily, though it helps I also use the ELF Mist and Set.  great product!</li>
            <li> The color is very nice and really very close to the nars orgasm. Just is not so intense, but that is not bad, if you want a decent looking blush. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I got this because I heard it was pretty much a duplicate of the very popular &amp;#34;Nars &#x27;orgasm&#x27;&amp;#34; blush.  The color is very similar but it doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth or last as long as the Nars version.  (As you can tell, I ended up splurging and buying Nars)  If you really can&#x27;t afford Nars, then this would work, but in my opinion, the Nars is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This is great if you want to try a coral shade, but not go all crazy as this is fresh and coral, while still being nice and proper. Peachy Cheeky could almost act as a highlight on a deeper skin tone. I enjoy both and for $3 on the ELF website they are a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I was so impressed with these that I went back and purchased all the colors available except for the highlighters.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this price, this is a great dupe for Nars Orgasm!  The only cons for me is that you have to really load it on your brush to get good pigment.  I feel like higher quality blushes you hardly have to dab your brush to get the color you need!  This one you really go through quite a bit, but at $3, it doesn&#x27;t really matter!  I use this on every day &amp;#34;work days&amp;#34; and use my more expensive blushes on weekends/events.</li>
            <li> So far I am pretty impressed with the Candid Coral shade of e.l.f studio blush. It is a little messy, but powder blush usually is so I am not one to complain. I also have rosacea so my skin can sometimes be sensitive towards different products but so far, I had not had a reaction to this blush :)</li>
