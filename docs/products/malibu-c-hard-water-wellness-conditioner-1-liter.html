            <li>I LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safe on chemically treated hair as well -</li>
            <li>I love the pump on this bottle.</li>
            <li>do not like the orange-creme like smell but their hair looks well and healthy.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is even better.</li>

            <li>This conditioner is really softening and it smells great as well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love the citrus smell.</li>
            <li>I wish it was better</li>
            <li>This product was ok; but it didn&#x27;t condition my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this after I wrote the company to ask what product would be most similar to their discontinued EC Mode Brilliant De-tangling Conditioner and they suggested this product as a replacement.  </li>

            <li>After using, our hair felt squeaky clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>, I love the scent so much!</li>
            <li>It is worth EVERY penny!</li>
            <li>So glad to have found this product in a Large bottle.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is good for someone with very short hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and smells delicious, very beachy.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product that I keep in all of our bathrooms as we have very hard water.  </li>

            <li>After awhile it was not cutting it</li>

            <li>It works great on my hair, keeps brassiness from coming back from my blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Wow, this conditioner makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t condition at all and left my hair more tangled than anything.</li>
            <li>It is better to use it last.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My first thought was</li>
            <li>I used Ion product at first as it was easy to get at a local beauty supply store also.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft after using the shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good compliment to the Malibu C shampoo for hard water.</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff is great with the shampoo for my hard water Santa Barbara hair.  </li>
            <li>The combo together revives my whole family&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this and have really noticed the softness to my hair, it doesn&#x27;t feel like straw anymore.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is made with organic ingredients and it keeps my hair blonde and soft!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I def noticed a difference using this shampoo and conditioner made my hair softer and it actually felt clean.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t act as a true conditioner would, you&#x27;ll definitely still need to use another conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and it has really helped with my hair, we have very hard and mineral rich water here and use water softeners (add salt to water)</li>
            <li>New hairs have already started sprouting up on my head and my hair feels stronger, fuller, and thicker!</li>
            <li>The main thing I like about this conditioner is that it doesn&#x27;t feel like my hair soaked in conditioner after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>My hair used to be super blonde but isn&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li>When I realized it was a combination of the water in my house and the time of year (I live in the midwest and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best alternative to just cutting my hair off!</li>
            <li>Helps keep my hair healthy with hard water.</li>
            <li>I get enough softness with this product, but not too much.</li>
            <li>well water was restored to its natural lustre.</li>
            <li>Naturally I started to get concerned.  </li>
            <li>well, apparently Well Water Action shampoos &amp; conditioners are now called Hard Water Wellness shampoos &amp; conditioners, so I actually received the items that I had requested...which items I have used and love.  </li>
            <li>The yellow is slowly coming out of my hair and it is looking better all the time.  </li>
            <li>We have well water with high amounts of bacterial iron which will turn my blonde hair red!</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair naturally but highlight it to a lighter shade.  </li>
            <li>I am a 24 year old male.  </li>
            <li>My hair loses the reddish brassiness, my girl&#x27;s hair gets fluffier, and my husband&#x27;s dry scalp and dandruff is alleviated.</li>
            <li>My hair never felt clean because of our hard water.</li>

            <li> My hair never felt clean because of our hard water.</li>
            <li> I live where the water is heavily chlorinated and this saved my hair.</li>
            <li> I did not realize it but the hard water in tandem with the shampoo I was using was actually creating an intangible build up or residue on my scalp which was preventing and in fact impeding new hair growth!  </li>
            <li> all of this has really been hard on my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to stay around for long though.</li>
            <li> When I would use product in my hair and when my hair was wet, I was starting to see my scalp.</li>
            <li> its very dry and cold in the winter), I started to look for a better shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I say all I do is wash it with Malibu and blow dry it ever day.</li>
            <li> I have untreated well water and recommend this product if your hair has gotten dry and strawlike.</li>
            <li> If you have long thick hair, I suggest that you not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Keeps my blonde hair less (not totally) gold and yellow from my hard water.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day alternating with a shampoo and conditioner for dry hair</li>
            <li> Just be careful because the first time I used it, I pushed too hard and it missed my hand, so just push slowly and cup your hand.</li>
            <li> My hair felt softer and less dry, but not oily, using this product.  </li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this shampoo and conditioner after I moved to a rural area where the well water was giving my hair a dull, yellowish hue - the Malibu C Hard Water shampoo and conditioner completely eliminated the discoloration in my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues with baldness or concerns about hair thinning in the past, but recently I started to notice a lot of hair thinning.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered Malibu Hard water shampoo and conditioner and have never looked back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner for several months and my once-beautiful hair is as dull as ever.</li>
            <li> It also had no effect on  calming down frizziness either.  </li>
            <li> Since using the shampoo and conditioner the green tint is gone.</li>
            <li> It had no de-tangling properties for my long, very thick, slightly wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> We are on a community well with very hard water, my wife&#x27;s beautician recommended this product as the hard water gave her hair a green tint, she&#x27;s blonde.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its just this conditioner because I&#x27;ve been using Redkin cleansing</li>
            <li> We have a well and the water is hard.</li>
            <li> Even with a softener, it&#x27;s still hard on my hair.</li>
            <li> We have hard water.</li>
            <li> I believe it is getting all the buildup of hard water minerals out of our hair.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend for people with hard water.</li>
            <li> Her dull and brittle looking hair from the minerals in</li>
            <li> Stellar.&lt;br /&gt;A must for people with hard water.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Maybe this product will work in slightly or moderately hard water, but for very hard water, it does nothing.</li>
            <li> but this has made it bearable at least!</li>
            <li> Sorry for the mistake, but I didn&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Wrong item had it returned</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> and I was having a terrible time finding anything that didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling gummy.</li>

The main thing I like about this conditioner is that it doesn&#x27;t feel like my hair soaked in conditioner after rinsing it out. I get enough softness with this product, but not too much.

            <li> I have used this product for 3 years and it is the best for well water.  When we moved to our house I was not looking forward to the well water as being a blonde.  I used Ion product at first as it was easy to get at a local beauty supply store also.  After awhile it was not cutting it so I ordered Malibu Hard water shampoo and conditioner and have never looked back.  Every time I get my hair cut they ask me what product I use and I say all I do is wash it with Malibu and blow dry it ever day. They tell me it is a great product and that my hair is very healthy.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is great with the shampoo for my hard water Santa Barbara hair.  It&#x27;s the best alternative to just cutting my hair off!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner. It&#x27;s not too heavy and smells delicious, very beachy.</li>
            <li> Keeps my blonde hair less (not totally) gold and yellow from my hard water. Without this my hair definitely shows gold and yellow. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this shampoo and conditioner after I moved to a rural area where the well water was giving my hair a dull, yellowish hue - the Malibu C Hard Water shampoo and conditioner completely eliminated the discoloration in my hair and it&#x27;s safe on chemically treated hair as well - I have blonde hair naturally but highlight it to a lighter shade.  Great product!</li>
            <li> We have hard water. My hair used to be super blonde but isn&#x27;t anymore. I hate it. So I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It works great!!! I&#x27;ve only used this for a month, 2-3 times a week. My hair is getting light again and shiny!! I&#x27;m not sure if its just this conditioner because I&#x27;ve been using Redkin cleansing shampoo(which is so awesome too!). This smells so beach-y, I love the scent so much! It doesn&#x27;t seem to stay around for long though. It compliments the Redkin shampoo so well, they both have similar scents. I love the pump on this bottle. Just be careful because the first time I used it, I pushed too hard and it missed my hand, so just push slowly and cup your hand.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous.  After using, our hair felt squeaky clean and smooth.  I believe it is getting all the buildup of hard water minerals out of our hair.  After just one use our hair was softer than it&#x27;s been in quite some time and it behaved differently, in a good way.</li>
            <li> Use with malibu shampoo- improves hair&#x27;s consistency without making hair limp or greasy in appearance - hair is not frizzy-just bouncy with a great sheen</li>
            <li> Maybe this product will work in slightly or moderately hard water, but for very hard water, it does nothing. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner for several months and my once-beautiful hair is as dull as ever.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I wrote the company to ask what product would be most similar to their discontinued EC Mode Brilliant De-tangling Conditioner and they suggested this product as a replacement.  This conditioner is nothing like the de-tangling conditioner.  It had no de-tangling properties for my long, very thick, slightly wavy hair.  It also had no effect on  calming down frizziness either.  I tried it for several weeks and each time it felt like I had not conditioned my hair at all.  If you have long thick hair, I suggest that you not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I love this Malibu shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> well, apparently Well Water Action shampoos &amp; conditioners are now called Hard Water Wellness shampoos &amp; conditioners, so I actually received the items that I had requested...which items I have used and love.  Sorry for the mistake, but I didn&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> So disappointed. This didn&#x27;t condition at all and left my hair more tangled than anything. Maybe this is good for someone with very short hair. I&#x27;ll try to pass it off on my brother...</li>
            <li> this is one of the best hair conditioner&#x27;s that you can use when you have well water and you dye your hair</li>
            <li> So glad to have found this product in a Large bottle. It works great on my hair, keeps brassiness from coming back from my blonde hair. Its gentle and smells wonderful. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> My children swim 4-5 times a week.  At my stylist&#x27;s recommendation, I bought this for their daily use.&lt;br /&gt;They do not like the orange-creme like smell but their hair looks well and healthy.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft after using the shampoo. The combo together revives my whole family&#x27;s hair. My hair loses the reddish brassiness, my girl&#x27;s hair gets fluffier, and my husband&#x27;s dry scalp and dandruff is alleviated. Good stuff!</li>

            <li> The yellow is slowly coming out of my hair and it is looking better all the time.  I think with continued use it will do the job I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Wow, this conditioner makes a huge difference. I live where the water is heavily chlorinated and this saved my hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> Smells good, leaves hair smooth and shiny (not sticky and no build-up). The shampoo is even better.</li>
            <li> I had a reaction to the conditioner. I would check the ingredients before purchasing.</li>
            <li> We have well water with high amounts of bacterial iron which will turn my blonde hair red! This shampoo is made with organic ingredients and it keeps my hair blonde and soft!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years - have lots of rust in my water at home.  I use it every other day alternating with a shampoo and conditioner for dry hair</li>
            <li> We are on a community well with very hard water, my wife&#x27;s beautician recommended this product as the hard water gave her hair a green tint, she&#x27;s blonde. Since using the shampoo and conditioner the green tint is gone.</li>
            <li> My daughter said a beautician had used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair and she was amazed at the difference she was able to see.  Her dull and brittle looking hair from the minerals in well water was restored to its natural lustre. Able to use it on her 8 and 9 year old daughter&#x27;s hair without problems .</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff</li>
            <li> This conditioner is really softening and it smells great as well. I feel like it seals the cuticle so I do not like when I do a deep conditioning after using this. It is better to use it last.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my hair healthy with hard water. Don&#x27;t love the citrus smell.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that I keep in all of our bathrooms as we have very hard water.  It has repaired all of our hair.  My daughter and I used to have noticeable split ends, and after 6 months of use, we have to hunt for them. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Stellar.&lt;br /&gt;A must for people with hard water.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner goes with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I am &amp;#34;matchy matchy&amp;#34; like that.</li>
            <li> My hair never felt clean because of our hard water. This rinse makes a big difference. It is a big bottle and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot, so it lasts.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this.  She is in swim club and refused to wear a swim cap, so her hair sustains a lot of chlorine damage.  This definitely helps her hair.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and it has really helped with my hair, we have very hard and mineral rich water here and use water softeners (add salt to water) all of this has really been hard on my hair. I bought this and have really noticed the softness to my hair, it doesn&#x27;t feel like straw anymore. I wish it was better but this has made it bearable at least! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product was ok; but it didn&#x27;t condition my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair felt softer and less dry, but not oily, using this product.  I have untreated well water and recommend this product if your hair has gotten dry and strawlike.</li>
            <li> I am a 24 year old male.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with baldness or concerns about hair thinning in the past, but recently I started to notice a lot of hair thinning.  When I would use product in my hair and when my hair was wet, I was starting to see my scalp. Naturally I started to get concerned.  My first thought was perhaps it was my conditioner that I was using, I stopped using that and just switched to a regular head and shoulders type product.  When I realized it was a combination of the water in my house and the time of year (I live in the midwest and its very dry and cold in the winter), I started to look for a better shampoo. I found this product online almost a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one month of use I started to feel amazing results. I did not realize it but the hard water in tandem with the shampoo I was using was actually creating an intangible build up or residue on my scalp which was preventing and in fact impeding new hair growth!  After one month of use, I&#x27;ve had amazing results! New hairs have already started sprouting up on my head and my hair feels stronger, fuller, and thicker! I am SO grateful to this product.  It is worth EVERY penny! Thank you Malibu!!!!</li>
            <li> We have well water and I was having a terrible time finding anything that didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling gummy. This conditioner really works and leaves my hair clean.</li>
