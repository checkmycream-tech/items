    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>Received in excellent condition, and just as promised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The best thing to do is turn the clippers over, put the metal hooks in, then use BOTH THUMBS to apply even pressure, pushing forward, until the plastic guide teeth cover the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received the product in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>These worked out great and the price was very good!</li>
            <li>These worked great once I figured out how they worked.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>However, I was able to sell them to a friend and they told me tehy work great!</li>
            <li>They fit my and is clipper perfectly.</li>
            <li>Good quality too not flimsy but not brittle either.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly to the blade if you know how to place them correctly.</li>
            <li>These fit the Andis Ceramic BGRC perfectly.</li>
            <li>remove the guides, turn the clippers over, then let the plastic teeth part rest on an even ledge (edge of a desk is good).  </li>
            <li>in all, its a good product for the price</li>
            <li>perfect fit, use then with a 0 or 000 guard when using with a 1</li>
            <li>They fit my BRGC perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love them they work great</li>
            <li>i love them!</li>
            <li>On a side note, the andis bgrv clippers are really nice.</li>
            <li>bucks and healing a nice sliced finger to boot..</li>
            <li>These guides work great and come with all full sizes from 1-8.  </li>
            <li>Very easy,</li>
            <li>other wise I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Very good clip on action.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this garbage that doesn&#x27;t fit its own clipper.</li>
            <li>When purchasing, make sure it is the correct product needed (size).</li>
            <li>No brand is better than Andis.</li>
            <li>Anyway, MAKE SURE this &amp;#34;UNIVERSAL&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I feel like they&#x27;re going to break my clippers when I am able to attach them.</li>
            <li>and I love the versatility of the lengths I can shave my dog.</li>
            <li>I think the hair clipper replacements are better than the originals.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>They are good guards for andis fade or envy, clip on bottom part first and then top should slide in.</li>
            <li>They are easy to snap on and there are many to choose from.  </li>
            <li>but they worked perfectly, I cut both my boys hair and they worked great, I cut the boys hair with 3 different guides so there are a lot of back and forths</li>
            <li>this allows you to comfortably push the guide and compress the spring allowing you to easily attach the top of the guide to the teeth on your clipper.  </li>
            <li>These have been an amazing addition to my grooming set and have made my life so much easier!</li>
            <li>but they fit just fine and will probably sand the tips to keep from gouging my pets skin but</li>
            <li>Works for what it&#x27;s meant to do which is to fit on clippers as comb attachment.</li>
            <li>so the guard stretches to fit the desired size</li>
            <li>but it doesnt fit....</li>
            <li>Will this fit andis fade master clippers</li>
            <li>Great price, was different from description</li>
            <li>I was told it would fit my Andis clippers, Model LS/LS2.</li>
            <li>as soon as they got to my place i slapped them on and tried them out, fit like a glove.</li>
            <li>some wont fit.</li>
            <li>&quot; they didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>and I wanted guards to fit everything.</li>
            <li>but with a struggle and pulling them back off as well, maybe after some use they will loosen up and be great for all clippers.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish they put in some directions that its best to push the guard from the bottom where the bump is and it will pop right on or off, doing it any other way its easy to pull the whole detachable blade off with the guard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even worth returning/exchanging!</li>
            <li>These guides secure much more effectively than Wahl and Remington guides, they also last longer.</li>
            <li>I wish I would of kept the original packaging, I would of return them to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I have an Andis Clipper (actually a dog clipper but has been the best clipper for my boys that we have bought so far)</li>
            <li>Fits right~!  </li>
            <li>Item was just as expected at a great price.</li>
            <li>The package was delivered very quickly and item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>No problems and my first haircut with the clippers went smoothly.</li>
            <li>At first, I was trying to put these on my Andis master clippers and they didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>They fit the wahl clippers great bt when it comes to the andis masters only the bigger guards fits, the #0,#1,#11/2 don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Ive had mine for over a year very durable ignore everyone who says they dont fit bgrc&#x27;s</li>
            <li>On the osters fast feeds they fit</li>
            <li>Once you get the guides on a decent set of clippers, they do fine.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product is good, but it looks like the mechanism might wear out over time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how you can sell a product, call it &amp;#34;Universal&amp;#34; and have it not fit your own clipper!</li>
            <li>So I clip in the back and push the extra guide forward and shazaam my clip guide works great.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Fit my Andis bgrv better than any other ones I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li>because I spend more going through the hassle of sending it back...</li>
            <li>The only downside is being able to read the numbers of each attachment.</li>
            <li>great.. wish I had read these negative reviews first ,</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think these worked and was going to return them.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that is a bit challenging is getting it on and off my 000 (way better than being loose though).</li>
            <li>It is my first new set of guides since I got out of beauty school years and years ago!</li>
            <li>I do is you attach the metal clip/ hook on the bottom of your blade then in each guide (not so much in the 0 and 1 size</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like applying so much pressure to plastic parts</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Andis products, but these clippers guards are straight junk.</li>
            <li>I slid the comb into the bottom of the blade and gently pulled upward until it clicked into place.</li>
            <li>That hasn&#x27;t happened yet, but I am very cautious when I change</li>
            <li>, it just takes a whole lotta patience.  </li>
            <li>which is they dnt fit all clippers which is misleading to say they&#x60;re universal.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a half dozen hair cuts now and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>A COUPLE OF THE OLDER REVIEWS</li>
            <li>It messed up my first haircut with them because I wanted to get a nice little tapered fade on the sides and back.</li>
            <li>This is exactly wut I needed to fit the larger blade dat I have on my clippers n its universal</li>
            <li>These are high quality</li>
            <li>Do not push the plastic part too far or you certainly run the risk of having a coil pop out or having them fall off</li>
            <li>great value... takes a little to get used to, a little tricky to use  </li>
            <li>This is garbage, I bought these to go with me brand new Andis Fademaster..</li>
            <li>, the result was I sliced my finger with a razor cut almost to the bone, then my brand new Andis clippers blade snapped a tooth and the guide also lost two teeth as well..</li>
            <li>So now I have to buy a new andis blade for my clipper and a new set of guides that are manageable</li>
            <li>Only works on one of my fastfeed clippers, doesn&#x27;t fit on my andis masters so they&#x27;re not universal</li>
            <li>I only use the higher guards</li>
            <li>Disregard instructions and put the metal clips on the back first then stretch the guide over the front of the cutters.</li>
            <li>But with some slight modification they&#x60;ll fit better, that&#x27;s taking some neddle nose pliers and bending the hooks up that connects to the back of the blade slightly</li>
            <li>They direct you to attach the plastic side to the front of your blade and then pull backwards.  </li>
            <li>I have the bgrc professional detachable blade hair clippers and this reads that it fits....got the package and went to use it</li>
            <li>) there is an indentation in the middle of the teeth for you to push your finger into (the the teeth don&#x27;t go to the bottom as much and the ones on the edge)</li>
            <li>Not sure what models they do fit on.</li>
            <li>, my total anticipated cost to replace on totally new unused equipment as a result is looking close to $40.</li>
            <li>Only used twice so far.</li>
            <li>So much force is needed that initially I was quite sure that I would break them or have the coil inside shoot out, thereby rendering them useless.  </li>
            <li>ON HOW A PURCHASER HAD TO PUSH HARD ON THE CLIPPER GUIDE TO GET A PROPER FIT.</li>
            <li>These arrived and when I first tried them they did not fit my clippers, again too short.  </li>
            <li>Used them to cut the little guys hair 4 days ago, He is a lot cooler now, Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>even then they are still a tight fit Andis need to make some modifications on these and correct the problem which is the spring action load needs to be loosen up a bit, I mean they will go on any clipper</li>

            <li> It does not fit this particular model of Andies which was advertised on the same page I was thinking it was</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works for what it&#x27;s meant to do which is to fit on clippers as comb attachment. The tips are indeed sharp so file them a bit. Overall dissapointed at the workmanship and quality of Andis who have been in the clipper business since 1922. Slacking.</li>
            <li> These worked out great and the price was very good! It is my first new set of guides since I got out of beauty school years and years ago! The only thing that is a bit challenging is getting it on and off my 000 (way better than being loose though). I only use the higher guards so I have yet to try any of the guards under a #4.</li>
            <li> This is exactly wut I needed to fit the larger blade dat I have on my clippers n its universal so the guard stretches to fit the desired size</li>
            <li> They fit my and is clipper perfectly.</li>
            <li> They did not fit my clippers. However, I was able to sell them to a friend and they told me tehy work great!</li>
            <li> This does not fit the Andis Ceramic BGRC Professional Detachable Blade Hair Clipper!  Don&#x27;t buy this garbage that doesn&#x27;t fit its own clipper.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t follow the directions included with the brushes to attach them.  They direct you to attach the plastic side to the front of your blade and then pull backwards.  Instead, attach the metal clips to the back of your blade then slide forward.  The plastic will slide up and then around your blade front.</li>
            <li> It does not fit this particular model of Andies which was advertised on the same page I was thinking it was</li>
            <li> When purchasing, make sure it is the correct product needed (size).</li>
            <li> I thought this would work for my clippers and found out they were useless. I need to put them on EBAY.</li>
            <li> These have been an amazing addition to my grooming set and have made my life so much easier! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Why in gods name would you send attachment combs, that were ordered with a specific trimmer that are not designed to be used with that unit??? Hence my later order for the other set that I never received.</li>
            <li> I was going to return the comb set until I came back to read the reviews. I found a couple reviews that talked about the spring loading mechanism on the comb. You do have to push really hard to get the comb over the blade so it can sit on the blade. If it is sitting in the blade and looks crooked then it will pop off while cutting your hair. There are no instructions/illustrations on how to do this properly. It messed up my first haircut with them because I wanted to get a nice little tapered fade on the sides and back. These blades are annoying on the first use because you expect an easy-pop on secured fit and it isn&#x27;t advertised as a spring-loaded blade anywhere here on amazon or on the packaging. So in conclusion, IF YOU ARE GOING TO GET THESE PLEASE READ A COUPLE OF THE OLDER REVIEWS ON HOW A PURCHASER HAD TO PUSH HARD ON THE CLIPPER GUIDE TO GET A PROPER FIT. Other than that the product is good, but it looks like the mechanism might wear out over time. On a side note, the andis bgrv clippers are really nice.</li>
            <li> They do not fit my clippers. They were suggested for the clippers i purchase so I bought them. I tried on and oy won&#x27;t snap on.</li>
            <li> This was just what I needed.  Fits right~!  Works well clipping the dogs.  Use weekly!!!  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This product was as described and seems to be quality made.  I have used it for a half dozen hair cuts now and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> BEWARE! NOT UNIVERSAL! Do not fit! They go on with a lot of force but popped off as soon as I tried using them. Seller only refunds UNOPENED, UNUSED products, MINUS shipping fee, MINUS 15% restocking fee! It&#x27;s not even worth returning/exchanging! RIP OFF ALERT!</li>
            <li> These guides work great and come with all full sizes from 1-8.  These guides secure much more effectively than Wahl and Remington guides, they also last longer. No brand is better than Andis.</li>
            <li> I have the bgrc professional detachable blade hair clippers and this reads that it fits....got the package and went to use it but it doesnt fit....please change how your ad reads it was a waste of my time and money....because I spend more going through the hassle of sending it back...what a headache</li>
            <li> These worked great once I figured out how they worked.  I have an Andis Clipper (actually a dog clipper but has been the best clipper for my boys that we have bought so far), it has a #10 blade and my other guides were far too short to attach.  After having to almost buzz cut my boys hair as the largest guide I had was a 3 I finally got around to getting some other guides.  These arrived and when I first tried them they did not fit my clippers, again too short.  I looked at them and after a bit of poking around with a screw driver I lifted up the metal part of the guide a little and that was when I saw the spring, after that it all fell into place.  There is no description stating how to attach them and there are no instructions in the box explaining that they are spring loaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do is you attach the metal clip/ hook on the bottom of your blade then in each guide (not so much in the 0 and 1 size) there is an indentation in the middle of the teeth for you to push your finger into (the the teeth don&#x27;t go to the bottom as much and the ones on the edge) this allows you to comfortably push the guide and compress the spring allowing you to easily attach the top of the guide to the teeth on your clipper.  Like I say my clipper blade is long and I had to push these guides almost 1/2&amp;#34; to reach the end but they worked perfectly, I cut both my boys hair and they worked great, I cut the boys hair with 3 different guides so there are a lot of back and forths and I felt they held up well and expect them to last quite a while.</li>
            <li> They are good guards for andis fade or envy, clip on bottom part first and then top should slide in.</li>
            <li> These are a pain to get on the Andis clipper, but they do work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Very good clip on action. Disregard instructions and put the metal clips on the back first then stretch the guide over the front of the cutters. Remove in reverse.  I can use with my #1 or #000 blade. Only used twice so far. Will change my rating after several uses to 5 or 3 depending on durability.</li>
            <li> They are easy to snap on and there are many to choose from.  Very reasonably priced. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I followed instructions that some other folks provided: install from the BACK of the clippers, then slide it forward over the teeth at the front.  No problems and my first haircut with the clippers went smoothly.</li>
            <li> Fit my Andis bgrv better than any other ones I&#x27;ve tried them all. Good quality too not flimsy but not brittle either.</li>
            <li> Will this fit andis fade master clippers</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, this product WILL NOT FIT your Andis Outliner II. The clip is too tall, the comb too wide, it does not fit! I don&#x27;t understand how you can sell a product, call it &amp;#34;Universal&amp;#34; and have it not fit your own clipper!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like applying so much pressure to plastic parts but they fit just fine and will probably sand the tips to keep from gouging my pets skin but other wise I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I like these attachments because it matches my silver bgrc by Andis. They fit perfectly to the blade if you know how to place them correctly. The only downside is being able to read the numbers of each attachment.</li>
            <li> Takes a lot of work out of grooming</li>
            <li> nothing universal about this product...doesn&#x27;t fit my andis clippers, sad to say.  have to use my finger on the back to keep this on the clippers.  accident waiting to happen.</li>
            <li> Great price, was different from description</li>
            <li> Put the metal cleats on the back of the clipper head then pull the guide forward to hook the front lip over the cutting edge. These fit the Andis Ceramic BGRC perfectly. These are high quality and I&#x27;d recommend them. The tips are a bit sharp so don&#x27;t shove them through the skin. I rounded mine with some sandpaper.</li>
            <li> This is garbage, I bought these to go with me brand new Andis Fademaster.. Well to get on the guide I had to push as hard as I could and managed  to have them snapped on crooked, then to get it off was next to impossible, the result was I sliced my finger with a razor cut almost to the bone, then my brand new Andis clippers blade snapped a tooth and the guide also lost two teeth as well.. So now I have to buy a new andis blade for my clipper and a new set of guides that are manageable, my total anticipated cost to replace on totally new unused equipment as a result is looking close to $40. bucks and healing a nice sliced finger to boot.. great.. wish I had read these negative reviews first , stupidity</li>
            <li> I was told it would fit my Andis clippers, Model LS/LS2. Not even close. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t need to use it until 12-1-13, having purchased it in September of the same year, and was denied a refund. Now it&#x27;s just useless junk in the closet. Anyway, MAKE SURE this &amp;#34;UNIVERSAL&amp;#34; product fits your clippers before you purchase. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> A total disappointment! Cheap plastic, poor quality. And easily broken. Would not recommend to anyone. A total waste of money</li>
            <li> as soon as they got to my place i slapped them on and tried them out, fit like a glove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Andis products, but these clippers guards are straight junk. They are so hard to put on my Andis Masters. I feel like they&#x27;re going to break my clippers when I am able to attach them. I wish I would of kept the original packaging, I would of return them to Amazon.com. Don&#x27;t buy them.</li>
            <li> Excellent. i have no complains what so ever about the product. The package was delivered very quickly and item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> these guides are built srurdy and should last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Only works on one of my fastfeed clippers, doesn&#x27;t fit on my andis masters so they&#x27;re not universal</li>
            <li> Despite the negative reviews about these not fitting right, I ordered them anyway because the price of blades can be expensive.  I slid the comb into the bottom of the blade and gently pulled upward until it clicked into place. Very easy, and I love the versatility of the lengths I can shave my dog.</li>
            <li> This does not fit all Andis clippers as advertised.  I have the T-outliner clippers, and these guards are too big for them.  Not sure what models they do fit on.</li>
            <li> Item was just as expected at a great price. Received in excellent condition, and just as promised.</li>
            <li> Ive had mine for over a year very durable ignore everyone who says they dont fit bgrc&#x27;s, they just dont know how to put them on...flip your clippers over, put the metal claws on the bottom of the blade and stretch it up over the teeth...</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think these worked and was going to return them.  The seller then contacted me, and somewhat explained how to use them.  The key info that is missing in the description is that these universal guides are SPRING LOADED.  It is also written nowhere on the packaging.  You have to pull the hooks out using quite a bit of force in order to get them to open up wide enough to attach to your clippers.  So much force is needed that initially I was quite sure that I would break them or have the coil inside shoot out, thereby rendering them useless.  That hasn&#x27;t happened yet, but I am very cautious when I change guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing to do is turn the clippers over, put the metal hooks in, then use BOTH THUMBS to apply even pressure, pushing forward, until the plastic guide teeth cover the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove the guides, turn the clippers over, then let the plastic teeth part rest on an even ledge (edge of a desk is good).  Again use BOTH THUMBS to push the plastic part forward, the press down slightly once the plastic teeth are unsecured from the blade. Do not push the plastic part too far or you certainly run the risk of having a coil pop out or having them fall off track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, its a good product for the price, it just takes a whole lotta patience.  Once you get the guides on a decent set of clippers, they do fine.</li>
            <li> This does not fit my andis big detachable blades. They are too short.  Also they do. OT Fil my andis masters. I am very angry as I type this on my iPad. Total waste off time</li>
            <li> does not let hair get to clippers to cut.  Had to go back to using comb with clippers.</li>
            <li> perfect fit, use then with a 0 or 000 guard when using with a 1 some wont fit. i love them!</li>
            <li> I used all the adapters with andis blades on babybliss clippers they work well fit a little tight though and when taking them off you have to take off the detachable blade too little hard to get off but works well.</li>
            <li> I think the hair clipper replacements are better than the originals. They are more durable, however they can be a little difficult to put on and take off of the clippers.</li>
            <li> these look different but were way to hard to install. they actually broke the teeth of my clipper blade. pretty disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> At first, I was trying to put these on my Andis master clippers and they didn&#x27;t fit. \\&quot;I thought\\&quot; they didn&#x27;t fit but the guides have springs in them. So I clip in the back and push the extra guide forward and shazaam my clip guide works great.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use with andis 63965 bgrc.  Does not fit so why call them universal?  I was dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I can confirm that these cutting guides fit the Andis Ceramic BGRC clippers (63965). For the price I was hoping they were aluminum, but they&#x27;re just plastic.Putting them on is not comfortable at all, and you need to use both of your hands. Also, when putting them on, the guide teeth may snap or get bent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do the job, but I wish they did it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: You need to detach them opposite of what the instructions tell you.</li>
            <li> They do what I wanted, all my stuff is silver and I wanted guards to fit everything. I use them on the bgrc, with 000 blade, its narrow, other blades are wide and wont fit well. I was amazed I could put them on my 5 star senior 0 gapped without grinding the guard when its closed but the fade blade clears the guard when closed. The springs are very tight, I put oil in them. I kind of wish they put in some directions that its best to push the guard from the bottom where the bump is and it will pop right on or off, doing it any other way its easy to pull the whole detachable blade off with the guard.</li>
            <li> great value... takes a little to get used to, a little tricky to use  but you&#x27;ll get the hang of it. Start from the bottom to &amp;#34;hook&amp;#34; onto the blade and push the edges with your thumbs until the comb locks in.</li>
            <li> Needed attachments for trimming my small dog, I googled them, and found the set cheapest at Amazon, Be a past customer, I trusted this order. I received the product in perfect condition. Used them to cut the little guys hair 4 days ago, He is a lot cooler now, Thanks Amazon. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this set but in the pet small comb 9 piece version, which have a different size set up from these, they hv a half guard to each size for example #1,#11/2,#2,#21/2 so on up to 41/2 size. They&#x60;re a quality set of guides but they have their set back which is they dnt fit all clippers which is misleading to say they&#x60;re universal. They fit the wahl clippers great bt when it comes to the andis masters only the bigger guards fits, the #0,#1,#11/2 don&#x27;t fit.On the osters fast feeds they fit ok but some what of a struggle with the smallers guards as well. But with some slight modification they&#x60;ll fit better, that&#x27;s taking some neddle nose pliers and bending the hooks up that connects to the back of the blade slightly even then they are still a tight fit Andis need to make some modifications on these and correct the problem which is the spring action load needs to be loosen up a bit, I mean they will go on any clipper but with a struggle and pulling them back off as well, maybe after some use they will loosen up and be great for all clippers. But these are the exact same comb set as mine with the exception of the sizes they com in and the color which mine are blue, after reading some of these reviews about they&#x60;re not fitting the masters I knew I had the same combs, hope this was helpful.....</li>
            <li> They fit my BRGC perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love them they work great</li>
