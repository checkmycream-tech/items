            <li>Awesome product!  </li>
            <li>So convienent and works great!!</li>
            <li>Best thing to happen to nails since nail polish.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>It looks like a very nice idea.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>Love this thing!</li>
            <li>Every woman needs to own this if they do their nails at home.</li>
            <li>so when you dunk your brush in, you&#x27;re getting to the polish very easily.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s a royal piece of cheap plastic garbage that shouldn&#x27;t be sold.  </li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t give me one for free!</li>
            <li>Glad I searched within Amazon from sellers varied prices.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It holds nearly every bottle type that I have, and believe me, I have a *lot* lol.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails at home the first time I used this</li>
            <li>Well worth buying online.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what my daughter wanted although it did not come in the color it advertised .</li>
            <li>Been looking for this product for years, so glad to finally find it</li>
            <li>I chose the better deal for the same product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very helpful for doing self manicures and it&#x27;s even more helpful when the bottle is running low.</li>
            <li>It works for the nail polish I use (mainly Sinful Colors), but make sure it is on a sturdy flat surface and the weight of the nail polish doesn&#x27;t tip it over.</li>
            <li>When I received this item in the mail, it was already broke, so it seems to me that this isn&#x27;t made very well.</li>
            <li>fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li>I am researching other items that are better quality at this time.</li>
            <li>Works okay, but only for bottles with a specific shape.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Does not work well with bottles that are not round.</li>
            <li>I have natural nails and like to change my nail color often.</li>
            <li>nod gets me closer to the look of a professional mani/pedi.</li>
            <li>About the only type of bottle it struggles to grip are the large rectangle-ish ones, like the ones by Cult Nails and such, but other than that, it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li>This silly little contraption is a great help</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long it will last or if it can&#x27;t be tipped over, but it works &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It was cheap plastic that will be broken after a few uses,</li>
            <li> The product was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be metal.  </li>
            <li> I thought the base would be metal, to make it more substantial.  </li>
            <li> It just falls down.</li>
            <li> (Round)</li>
            <li> It even holds the really small bottles.</li>
            <li> No more spills on the table or anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Price was unbelievable deal.</li>
            <li> Just looking at it makes me angry that I spent anything at all on this.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t equip the base with suction cups to help hold it upright.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is horribly made.</li>

            <li> Does not work well with bottles that are not round. But I still like it</li>
            <li> This is just a flimsy, crappy piece of plastic that will not hold a bottle upright without tipping over.  The arm will not hold the bottle in place.  It just falls down. They don&#x27;t equip the base with suction cups to help hold it upright. The \\&quot;grips\\&quot; won&#x27;t hold the bottle. It falls out. Honestly, it&#x27;s a royal piece of cheap plastic garbage that shouldn&#x27;t be sold.  It looks like a very nice idea.  Unfortunately, it is horribly made. Just looking at it makes me angry that I spent anything at all on this.  You couldn&#x27;t give me one for free! The only reason it gets one star is because there is no option for no stars.</li>
            <li> I like this nail polish holder.</li>
            <li> Works okay, but only for bottles with a specific shape. (Round)</li>
            <li> I have natural nails and like to change my nail color often. This silly little contraption is a great help nod gets me closer to the look of a professional mani/pedi.</li>
            <li> When I received this item in the mail, it was already broke, so it seems to me that this isn&#x27;t made very well. I am researching other items that are better quality at this time. GT-Illinois</li>

            <li> Awesome product!  So convienent and works great!!</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It holds nearly every bottle type that I have, and believe me, I have a *lot* lol. It even holds the really small bottles. About the only type of bottle it struggles to grip are the large rectangle-ish ones, like the ones by Cult Nails and such, but other than that, it&#x27;s very versatile. It&#x27;s very helpful for doing self manicures and it&#x27;s even more helpful when the bottle is running low. The arm is fully adjustable, so if the bottle is real low, you can position it so that it will well up so when you dunk your brush in, you&#x27;re getting to the polish very easily. I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Best thing to happen to nails since nail polish. Love this thing! Every woman needs to own this if they do their nails at home.</li>
            <li> fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li> It was exactly what my daughter wanted although it did not come in the color it advertised . She uses it a lot.</li>
            <li> This is Grip &amp; Tip Nail polish Holder is a life saver.  No more spills on the table or anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Been looking for this product for years, so glad to finally find it</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and product was well protected. The product was what I expected. Price was unbelievable deal. Well worth buying online. Glad I searched within Amazon from sellers varied prices. I chose the better deal for the same product. Recommend this seller. BUT! the holder does&#x27;nt hold the OPI and bigger bottles as well. It drops lower and lower as you use it.</li>
            <li> love it.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I expected it to be metal.  It was cheap plastic that will be broken after a few uses, something you would expect to buy at a Dollar store.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails at home the first time I used this I was blown away nothing like having a extra hand . I love it</li>
            <li> Product not sturdy at all...waisted my money.</li>
            <li> I thought the base would be metal, to make it more substantial.  Don&#x27;t know how long it will last or if it can&#x27;t be tipped over, but it works &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;</li>
