            <li>That&#x27;s the best way I can put it.</li>
            <li>Best texture</li>
            <li>We were impressed and happy by the results of this cream.  </li>
            <li>Price is great compared to pharmacy prices.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It is a great replacement for just about any skin care product you use.</li>
            <li>Works great on tips of my fingers also...</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>I tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you for a great product and outstanding service.</li>
            <li>This is seriously amazing.</li>
            <li>The pedicurist even told me I have nice feet</li>
            <li>SO I BOUGHT THIS CREAM BEACUSE OF ALL THE NICE REVIEWS.</li>
            <li>Have had great success with it.</li>
            <li>In any case, I&#x27;d easily prefer the lotion that works to make my skin quality better than the one that smells good.</li>
            <li>This cream has softened my heels better than a spa pedicure.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been this pleased with a skin product.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes it all smooth like a baby!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times she has thanked me for turning her on to it.</li>
            <li>I immediately started seeing a change for the better</li>
            <li>So glad we can buy it OTC now.  </li>
            <li>I WILL NOT BE BUYING ANY MORE FROM THIS COMPANY OR THIS BRAND.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used dermadoctor KP duty (very pricy) for years, and when I was looking at replenishing my supply, I stumbled across a review that recommended this cream as a good alternative to it.  </li>
            <li>The price is fair and it really works.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s available over-the-counter.  </li>
            <li>She had tried most everything without success until this.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find I could buy it on line without prescription and at much lower cost.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was fourteen years old (22 now).</li>
            <li>This cream was exactly what I wanted, the product  was outstanding and the price was reasonable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great to soften dry skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad, either.</li>
            <li>The scabs are healing beautifully, and seemingly at a faster rate than usual, too.</li>
            <li>Worth trying it.</li>
            <li>After three to four weeks applying twice&lt;br /&gt;daily, I now have soft, healthy feeling feet.</li>
            <li>also think it is a fair value compared to other Amm.</li>
            <li>Got it right away</li>
            <li>And the price is right too.  </li>
            <li>MY RIGHT.</li>
            <li>Thanks for quick service.</li>
            <li>Doing this every night the first week gets rid of all the yucky stuff.</li>
            <li>Wow! I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for about 10 days, and my arms already look better than they have in years (or maybe even ever!).  </li>
            <li>Just this week, I had my first go-see with a modeling agency, so I hurried and started using this as directed, twice a day on my arms three days before the visit.</li>
            <li>I have KP, and so this stuff works pretty well to reduce the bumps on my skin.</li>
            <li>The magic is to let your feet DRY then apply the cream.</li>
            <li>this cream works wonders and I ended up giving some away because you get a large tube.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and it is EXACTLY the same as Amlactin Ultra Cream and works great on the Keratosis Pilaris I have on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>The product is priced reasonably and it works.</li>
            <li>so it really sticks to your skin.</li>
            <li>The KP duty was okay, and it kept my KP somewhat under control, but it never really got rid of it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s really soaking</li>
            <li>The cream really helped.  </li>
            <li>BUT I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED.</li>
            <li>This generic version is VERY economical compared to the brand name lotions and creams.&lt;br /&gt;It is also recommended for Keratosis Pilaris.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it really makes my feet stay soft and is much cheaper than the prescription brand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Amlactin for years and paying the high prices for their &amp;#34;ultra cream&amp;#34; when I found this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Same product as brand name, larger size for less cost means it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>Even a great face and neck cream and only a very small amount is needed.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to use sunscreen to protect your new sun sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been to a dermatologist for dry skin, this used to be available only by prescription...</li>
            <li>It helps them as well as making them soft.</li>
            <li>Been using it every day 1-2x a day since, and wow - my arms are smoother than I ever remember them being.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I bought this to keep my feet feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>product is very effective and lasts me at least a few months (I apply once a day after showering).</li>
            <li>I had previously used AmLactin XL with great results (softer, smoother, younger looking skin) and tried this one because the basic ingredient is the same and the cost was substantially less.</li>
            <li>The new product, they say, is just a re-branding of their XL product, but it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li>The cream works very well for dry, cracked skin and helps relieve the itch associated with the condition.</li>
            <li>No other Ammonium Lactate lotion measures up, but this is as close as any that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>(the only way I could really tell it was doing something was by discontinuing use and seeing that my skin actually got worse), but the difference in my skin with this cream is astonishing.  </li>
            <li>To me, this is the only way to get smooth skin like all those other people I&#x27;m so jealous of!!!</li>
            <li>so this review is for Ammonium Lactate 12% in general.</li>
            <li>It was clear enough that I wasn&#x27;t asked any questions, and got signed.</li>
            <li>and she wishes all her customers came in with such soft feet.</li>
            <li>product is a fraction of the cost of the prescription - only slightly less powerful.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really committed to it at first, but each time I&#x27;d use it, my arms seemed to get a little less redder.</li>

            <li> Actually this was prescription product for my husbands dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was using a version of this cream (not the same brand, but the same product) because my dermatologist prescribed it for the little red bumps on the backs of my upper arms.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while using it for it to clear it up (getting some sun here and there helps too)</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to keep my heel soft as i have a spur in my heel.</li>
            <li> This is not clear on the web page as the</li>
            <li> Once again let the skin DRY before applying.</li>
            <li> It is just what I&#x27;ve needed for my dry flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> worked wonders on the dry, callused areas on soles of my feet.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended my using this product for the dry skin on the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and use this along with other body creams so that it doesn&#x27;t look like a snow storm when I get undressed at night from dry skin flaking.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> Prescribed by my dermatologist for people with VERY dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone who suffers from KP and it is the exact same product as Amlactin at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> Using a pumice stone after soaking my feet to remove topical dead skin allows the cream to penetrate my dry skin.</li>
            <li> it stated it would help with the little red bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li> also started using this on my face, being careful to avoid the eyes and lips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on a few scabs and recent scars.</li>
            <li> We supply it for our son who resides in a care center.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the lotion and other creams the Dr. recommended this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> Other than prescribed pills, maybe.</li>
            <li> Once I started putting cream on my arms, which was so rough!</li>
            <li> The formula is non greasy and goes on thick but instantly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> I usually suffer from extremely dry itchy skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li> No more cracking or dry areas.</li>
            <li> I swear by Ammonium Lactate for Keratosis Polaris (little bumps on skin)</li>
            <li> IF you have little bumps...try this stuff.</li>
            <li> Use a loofah in the bath/shower to remove dead skin before applying to the affected areas.</li>
            <li> Use it twice a day and no more nagging your stocking.</li>
            <li> the pic is too small to read the size, and the shipping weight is listed as 1 lb.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, because the last time that I stopped using the KP duty in favor of a cheaper alternative, my KP got really bad, so I switched back.  </li>
            <li> This is a less expensive alternative that has helped a lot -- for a lot less!!</li>
            <li> Besides, I recommend using this at night since it&#x27;s not good for sun exposure.</li>
            <li> There is no smell and the cream is very thick</li>
            <li> I USUALLY WOULD NOT GIVE A BAD REVIEW</li>
            <li> Seems like this has been some sort of secret!</li>
            <li> AND SADLY THIS PRODUCT HAS NOT IMPROVED OR GOT RID OF MY PROBLEM.</li>
            <li> I was using DermaDoctor for my KP but found it to be too expensive.</li>
            <li> Was very expensive, so ordered from Amazon as an OTC medication.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I HATE HOW IT LOOKS</li>

    <ol>
            <li> AmLactin discontinued XL. The new product, they say, is just a re-branding of their XL product, but it&#x27;s not the same. Too bad. No other Ammonium Lactate lotion measures up, but this is as close as any that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS CREAM FOR MY FEET AND IT WORKS WONDERS.  IT MOISTURIZES AND HELPS RELIEVE THE PAIN IN MY FEET.  I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TRY IT.</li>
            <li> This cream has softened my heels better than a spa pedicure. Using a pumice stone after soaking my feet to remove topical dead skin allows the cream to penetrate my dry skin. The magic is to let your feet DRY then apply the cream. I choose to do this routine in the evening and put on a pair of socks to let my body heat help the cream penetrate. I awaken to smoother heels and feet. Doing this every night the first week gets rid of all the yucky stuff. I use regular creamy body lotion on my feet after each bath/shower THEN I only need to do this cream once a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price at the local drug store is almost FORTY DOLLARS. Do yourself a favor and get the value priced cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know this is an alpha-hydroxy-acid (AHA) at the same concentration of some dermatologist recommended over the counter branded BEAUTY products. This generic version is VERY economical compared to the brand name lotions and creams.&lt;br /&gt;It is also recommended for Keratosis Pilaris. Use a loofah in the bath/shower to remove dead skin before applying to the affected areas. Once again let the skin DRY before applying. Don&#x27;t forget to use sunscreen to protect your new sun sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! My skin is very dry. I have tried so many products. The Amonium Lactate Cream was recommended by my dermatologist. The product is priced reasonably and it works. There is no glamour to the package, or the tube but the product works. That is all I wanted. My skin does not crack when I use this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Thanks for quick service. My doctor prescribes this for my heels and feet. It helps them as well as making them soft. Use it twice a day and no more nagging your stocking.</li>
            <li> I was using a version of this cream (not the same brand, but the same product) because my dermatologist prescribed it for the little red bumps on the backs of my upper arms.  When the drugstore stopped ordering the product, I came to Amazon, and found that this is actually $5 cheaper than what I was paying at the drugstore - and this actually ships to my house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very effective and lasts me at least a few months (I apply once a day after showering).</li>
            <li> The only product I&#x27;ve ever found to help with super-dry cracked skin. Price is great compared to pharmacy prices. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I had previously used AmLactin XL with great results (softer, smoother, younger looking skin) and tried this one because the basic ingredient is the same and the cost was substantially less. This cream gives the same results but doesn&#x27;t feel as moisturizing as the AmLactin.  This lotion however does not have an objectionable odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Amlactin for years and paying the high prices for their &amp;#34;ultra cream&amp;#34; when I found this. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and it is EXACTLY the same as Amlactin Ultra Cream and works great on the Keratosis Pilaris I have on my arms and legs. There is no smell and the cream is very thick so it really sticks to your skin. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who suffers from KP and it is the exact same product as Amlactin at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> This is a prescription strength cream for a fraction of the price.  I usually suffer from extremely dry itchy skin in the winter.  I used to pay an arm and a leg for prescription cream....this cream works wonders and I ended up giving some away because you get a large tube.</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for about 10 days, and my arms already look better than they have in years (or maybe even ever!).  I&#x27;d used dermadoctor KP duty (very pricy) for years, and when I was looking at replenishing my supply, I stumbled across a review that recommended this cream as a good alternative to it.  I was skeptical, because the last time that I stopped using the KP duty in favor of a cheaper alternative, my KP got really bad, so I switched back.  The KP duty was okay, and it kept my KP somewhat under control, but it never really got rid of it (the only way I could really tell it was doing something was by discontinuing use and seeing that my skin actually got worse), but the difference in my skin with this cream is astonishing.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was telling a friend of mine how cracked my heels were that it was ripping my stockings. She recommended Ammonium Lactate but said you need a prescription. So I went online to find out about the product and here is Amazon selling this stuff. So I ordered it. Got it right away and it&#x27;s FANTASTIC! I have my heels back in no time.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to keep my heel soft as i have a spur in my heel. By using this cream, i do not need to go for surgery.</li>
            <li> This is seriously amazing. I just recently started using this on my upper arms for keratosis pilaris (tiny red bumps) after my doctor recommended it. I wasn&#x27;t really committed to it at first, but each time I&#x27;d use it, my arms seemed to get a little less redder. Just this week, I had my first go-see with a modeling agency, so I hurried and started using this as directed, twice a day on my arms three days before the visit. It was clear enough that I wasn&#x27;t asked any questions, and got signed. I was worried my KP would be a deal breaker, but with this, I passed! Been using it every day 1-2x a day since, and wow - my arms are smoother than I ever remember them being. It looks like the KP might disappear entirely at this rate. I wish I took a before photo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started using this on my face, being careful to avoid the eyes and lips. WOW. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was fourteen years old (22 now). My skin looks way healthier and rejuvenated. That&#x27;s the best way I can put it. Best texture it&#x27;s been in a while - my face is smoother than ever. My pores look smaller, and my wrinkles have smoothed out. I texted my mom a photo of this and told her this is the fountain of youth. Seems like this has been some sort of secret! I&#x27;ve never been this pleased with a skin product. I had results overnight. I do exfoliate my face with St. Ives and my arms with an exfoliating towel, too, however - so I think it&#x27;s really soaking in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on a few scabs and recent scars. The scabs are healing beautifully, and seemingly at a faster rate than usual, too. I have a big scab/scar on my knee that I&#x27;ve been worrying about (going to have to show legs modeling soon) - but after using this on it for a week, it&#x27;s finally starting to heal again! For a while, it looked like it just paused healing and wasn&#x27;t changing at all, but ever since using this, it&#x27;s gotten lighter in color and the healing process seems to be continuing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eh, the smell isn&#x27;tfantastic, but it&#x27;s not bad, either. I&#x27;ve always preferred unscented products for my face anyway. In any case, I&#x27;d easily prefer the lotion that works to make my skin quality better than the one that smells good. Besides, I recommend using this at night since it&#x27;s not good for sun exposure. I use Cetaphil and BB Cream with SPF during the day for my face, and this at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommend. I did get a generic at my university pharmacy for about $7-8 … so this review is for Ammonium Lactate 12% in general. I almost want to just stock up on a ton of these before word gets out and the price goes up!</li>
            <li> The cream really helped.  I recommend it.  We were impressed and happy by the results of this cream.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep my feet feeling soft.  My husband received a prescription for the same thing even though he went to the doctor for a totally unrelated thing.  Anyway, it really makes my feet stay soft and is much cheaper than the prescription brand.  The pedicurist even told me I have nice feet and she wishes all her customers came in with such soft feet.</li>
            <li> Works great to soften dry skin. I use this on the dry bumps on the back of my childs arm. The formula is non greasy and goes on thick but instantly absorbs into the skin. Compared to the lotion and other creams the Dr. recommended this is the one to get. The price is fair and it really works.</li>
            <li> I swear by Ammonium Lactate for Keratosis Polaris (little bumps on skin) I get them on my arms, butt and back of thighs. This stuff makes it all smooth like a baby! It takes a little while using it for it to clear it up (getting some sun here and there helps too) I&#x27;ve heard of some people saying this does not work for their bumps, but to me it&#x27;s a miracle. Worth trying it. NOTHING else gets rid of KP. Other than prescribed pills, maybe. I also used those once, but the pills gave me a rash. To me, this is the only way to get smooth skin like all those other people I&#x27;m so jealous of!!! IF you have little bumps...try this stuff. put it on twice a day if you have to.</li>
            <li> When I looked this medication put it stated it would help with the little red bumps on my arms. They are caused by the hair growing sideways instead of up. Like a ingrown hair. This lotion didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It is just what I&#x27;ve needed for my dry flaky skin.  And the price is right too.  I used to have to pay $38.00 for only one tube of the cream.  Affordable and \\&quot;just what the doctor ordered\\&quot;!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been to a dermatologist for dry skin, this used to be available only by prescription...but now it&#x27;s available over-the-counter.  I use daily, especially on my legs.</li>
            <li> I have KP, and so this stuff works pretty well to reduce the bumps on my skin. I personally prefer Lac-Hydrin Five, it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling after applying it like this does.</li>
            <li> My wife has used it for almost two years on her feet. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times she has thanked me for turning her on to it. She had tried most everything without success until this. Finally something that works.</li>
            <li> Prescribed by my dermatologist for people with VERY dry skin. It works overall(arms,back,legs,) etc.especially on feet !Have used for 1 year</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on a callous on the side of my heal per doctor&#x27;s recommendation. I immediately started seeing a change for the better but I am noticing some sensitivity to rubbing, even with a wash cloth in the shower. Just a part of the process?&lt;br /&gt;I also think it is a fair value compared to other Amm. Lact. products but FYI, the product is 5oz/140g. This is not clear on the web page as the I don&#x27;t think it is mentioned in the product description and the pic is too small to read the size, and the shipping weight is listed as 1 lb.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and use this along with other body creams so that it doesn&#x27;t look like a snow storm when I get undressed at night from dry skin flaking.  My doctor recommended it.  I haven&#x27;t found a price anywhere that beats Amazon!</li>
            <li> We use this for softening the skin on our feet after using a pumice stone.  This product use to be prescription only.  So glad we can buy it OTC now.  We supply it for our son who resides in a care center.  If used morning and night will keep your feet from cracking.  No need to cover your feet with socks after as it is non greasy.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I BEEN LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT FOR MY KERATOSIS PILARI. I ONLY HAVE IT ON ONE ARM MY RIGHT. I HATE HOW IT LOOKS AND FEELS SO I BOUGHT THIS CREAM BEACUSE OF ALL THE NICE REVIEWS. BUT I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED. I USUALLY WOULD NOT GIVE A BAD REVIEW UNLESS I MEANT IT. AND SADLY THIS PRODUCT HAS NOT IMPROVED OR GOT RID OF MY PROBLEM. MY ARMS ARE THE SAME SINCE I STARTED USING IT AND IVE BEEN ON THIS CREAM FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS. I WILL NOT BE BUYING ANY MORE FROM THIS COMPANY OR THIS BRAND. NO RESULTS DONT SPEND MONEY ON A PRODUCT THAT WONT HELP OR IMPROVE YOUR PROBLEM. HOPE YOU THINK TWICE BEFORE SPENDING YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> This cream was exactly what I wanted, the product  was outstanding and the price was reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product and outstanding service.</li>
            <li> Same product as brand name, larger size for less cost means it&#x27;s a great value. Will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> The Ammonium Lactate Cream was prescribed by my family physician for skin treatment following a severe case of poison ivy. The cream works very well for dry, cracked skin and helps relieve the itch associated with the condition.</li>
            <li> product is a fraction of the cost of the prescription - only slightly less powerful.  Have had great success with it.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Actually this was prescription product for my husbands dry skin. I tried it and loved it. I was thrilled to find I could buy it on line without prescription and at much lower cost. It is a great replacement for just about any skin care product you use. The product comes in cream or lotion but I prefer the richness of the cream. I definitely improves the texture, look and feel of my skin. Even a great face and neck cream and only a very small amount is needed. I have used this product for several years.</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic and this cream was perscribed by my Podiatrist. Was very expensive, so ordered from Amazon as an OTC medication.&lt;br /&gt;Has worked wonders on the dry, callused areas on soles of my feet. After three to four weeks applying twice&lt;br /&gt;daily, I now have soft, healthy feeling feet. No more cracking or dry areas. Feel and look like they did when I was a kid! Works great on tips of my fingers also...</li>
            <li> Once I started putting cream on my arms, which was so rough! I notice a change within a day or two!! I&#x27;m so please with this product and I will be purchasing again!!</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended my using this product for the dry skin on the bottom of my feet. Since I have been using it, my skin is softer.</li>
            <li> I was using DermaDoctor for my KP but found it to be too expensive. This is a less expensive alternative that has helped a lot -- for a lot less!!</li>
