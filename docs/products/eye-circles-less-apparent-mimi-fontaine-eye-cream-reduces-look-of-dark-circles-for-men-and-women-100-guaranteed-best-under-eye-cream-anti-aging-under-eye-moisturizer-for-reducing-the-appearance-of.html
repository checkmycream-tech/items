            <li>The pump makes dispensing easy.  </li>
            <li>The pump makes dispensing easy and you do not have to unscrew a lid to get to the product out of the bottle.</li>

            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to blend around the eye area.</li>
            <li>It is a low scent (I love scents) which is great for my face.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t oily at all, and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>It does not have a strong fragrance, nor does it have a scent that will put off men from using the product.</li>
            <li>It goes on so nice and smoothly and really absorbs quickly, I love that it has helped make</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation as a result of use, and am very very pleased with how little I need to use to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li>Adding in the fine lines around my eyes, I decided to shop around for some anti aging creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fine lines are no where in sight.</li>
            <li>I did try it on my hand, and there was an immediate visible improvement in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It plumps the skin around the eyes to reduce fine lines, crowfeet, wrinkles and bags.</li>
            <li>The eye cream is full of ingredients that work wonders for aging skin and protects young skin to keep everyone looking and feeling great about their face.</li>
            <li>I have crows feet and fine lines in my under eye area.</li>
            <li>It is one of the very best anti-aging eye creams on the market that not only helps restore a youthful look to your eyes by reducing fine lines and wrinkles, but also greatly reduces your dark circles and puffiness all while moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li>Instead, it has a nice and subtle citrus scent to it that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I also liked that it contains healthy, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>After cleansing my face I put a dab under both eyes and massage lightly around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it is paraben free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got the perfect balance of moisturizing without being heavy and oily.</li>

            <li>This is a nice, lightweight cream that really helped to soften my aging eye skin.</li>
            <li>I received free product for review purposes.</li>
            <li>monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately, this is a fantastic eye cream</li>
            <li>I loved that the eye area stayed soft overnight afteruusing this cream.</li>
            <li>What better time to put the product to the test, right?</li>
            <li>Overall a very nice product much welcome in this dry climate (AZ).</li>
            <li>This eye cream is rich and luxurious.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was blessed with good genetics when it comes to skin aging, so I don&#x27;t have much in the way of wrinkles, but the lack of sleep really shows around my eyes.</li>
            <li>a few days ago I love it has shown great results.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and applied to clean skin in the morning and in the evening.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed low scent creams works best on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream for a short time and am really impressed with the results so far.</li>
            <li>That makes for super easy application and the cap keeps it fresh.</li>
            <li>Over all it makes a good under eye moisturizer that goes on feeling smooth and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>(I also jump on the trampoline to get the lymphatic circulation going, but my eyes really do look better.)  </li>
            <li>The Mimi Fontaine cream has really reduced the puffiness, and I have been told I look more alert and awake-even on days when I haven&#x27;t slept at all...</li>
            <li>I instead start the morning off with well hydrated, smooth under eye skin and a smile.</li>
            <li>Dispenser bottle puts out just the right amount and makes it easy to keep the product fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to receive this anti-aging eye cream by Mimi Fontaine at a discount in exchange for my honest evaluation of the product and to post my results here in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it and  highly recommend it to try out.</li>
            <li>so my eyes have been more puffier than normal.</li>
            <li>It works great for my dark circles underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>a day before i got sick and thankfully had it here beside me for when i got well enough to use it, sometimes products are just perfectly timed and this one was definitely perfectly timed.</li>
            <li>Well when I was offered this Eye Circles Less Apparent product from Perfection Products for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I love a good eye cream &amp; I have been testing out some really good ones lately and this Anti Aging Eye Cream that Mimi Fontaine sent me to review is definitely one of them.  </li>
            <li>my opinion, this is a wonderful cream that soothes my eyes, reduces puffiness and dark circles and so far (knock on wood)</li>
            <li>Such cute packaging!</li>
            <li>- Elastin lets the skin resume its shape after stretching/contracting, as is it does when you smile.</li>
            <li>When absorbed into the skin, it promotes collagen production and cell rejuvenation, and decreases pore size, so the skin around your eyes looks younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I use it for laugh lines and bags under and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite eye creams and I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works in the years to come.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>As I mentioned earlier, the packaging is adorable, and it has a really convenient pump top with a cap.</li>
            <li>It feels so nice on my eye area and gives an instant soothing feeling when applied.</li>
            <li>I was recently asked to try this product and give the manufacture my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I am able to easily apply my eye makeup over it without a single thought.</li>
            <li>Mimi Fontaine eye cream does wonders for my dark circles and fine lines-they look more vibrant and my eyes look more awake.</li>
            <li>and sometimes you don&#x27;t use that product right away</li>
            <li>works great, has helped me reduce the dark circles under my eyes really fast.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for the next best eye cream to help with puffy eyes and dark circles.</li>
            <li>so I really appreciate a clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the best luck in my search previously, so I accepted the offer in order to receive a discount on my initial order.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get the Mimi Fontaine Eye Cream at a promotion price to try and Iâ€™m glad I took them up on their offer.</li>
            <li>But overall I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in under eye darkness or fine lines.</li>
            <li>It has been very gentle when applied around my eye area.</li>
            <li>This cream is very light feeling and women can definitely wear it under their makeup.</li>
            <li>I love the pump top and that it takes about half a pump to cover my whole eye area.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>This is the first time trying this product.</li>
            <li>I look forward to seeing how this continues to work with consistent use.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>The product was not tested on animals, is completely cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this, and definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li>Haha they didn&#x27;t know I was using this product!  </li>
            <li>I like to use it first thing in the morning after washing my face.</li>
            <li>I just tried it for the first time today and I am AMAZED.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more and telling my family and friends about this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32, but many late nights in my younger years were not so kind to my undereyes!  </li>
            <li>I love that this cream is thick and silky smooth!  </li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>It is not very thick and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I made sure to take a before picture to better evaluate any subtle changes.</li>
            <li>That was my first thought when I first opened up my highly anticipated package from Amazon.</li>
            <li>When I was younger it was easy to conceal with makeup.</li>
            <li>Retinyl palmitate is a form of vitamin A. Studies have shown it safe when used with ordinary care to avoid overexposure to ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>The eye cream is white in color, non-greasy and spreads easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying make up for years and all that tugging on my eyes has certainly made them look baggy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my main concern when it comes to eye cream!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easily absorbed leaving the skin soft &amp; hydrated.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a whole lot to cover both of your eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get much sleep these days</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an unusual scent that was noticeable.</li>
            <li>Also, the seller really ensured that orders were shipped promptly</li>
            <li>What I really like is there is no noticeable scent and the eye cream</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and greaseless.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is creaming yet light enough</li>
            <li>and it has really started to show.</li>
            <li>so I know I&#x27;m really taking care of the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much either.  </li>
            <li>This is a very moisturizing eye cream and does not migrate into your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, this is a fantastic eye cream</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few weeks on my wrinkling areas on the side of my eyes as well as between my brows, and it&#x27;s been great!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and so far I&#x27;ve ha no bad reactions to this cream.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I am really loving this eye cream.</li>
            <li>my eye area more plumper and the dark circles seem to have started to fade already.</li>
            <li>I love trying new products to lessen dark circles.</li>
            <li>It accurately pumps out just the right amount needed every time without waste or contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream is really thick and feels smooth and rich going on, which creates a pampered feeling.</li>
            <li>The design of the packaging is nice as well ; although quite similar to the other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older these dark circles aren&#x27;t so easy to cover up.</li>
            <li>Normally I have hardcore bags under my eyes and walk around looking like a raccoon.  </li>
            <li>cream is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>I did manage to get a tiny bit into my eye, and had mild stinging but nothing unexpected.</li>
            <li>I am always on the lookout for new beauty products to keep my eyes (and skin) looking youthful.</li>
            <li>So for me, Mimi Fontaine is my new go to anti-aging, skin soothing eye cream.</li>
            <li>It helps with all of my eye issues everything from dark circles &amp; puffines to fine lines &amp; wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to everyone who want to lessen their fine lines and dark eye circles.</li>
            <li>It visibly reduces fine lines and dark circles leaving your skin looking heatlhy.</li>
            <li>I suffer with dark baggy eyes and fine lines and within 2 weeks of applying the cream I started noticing my bags</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, it did not bother my skin at all, and it soaked in immediately, without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>However, my dark circles are genetic so that may be why i haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have also been using it on my fine lines and I like the fact that it makes them look less visible.</li>
            <li>Contains vitamin E - Vitamin E supplements the skin&#x27;s natural antioxidant defenses and provides protection against ultraviolet radiation and other free radicals.</li>
            <li>Makeup settles in the cracks and I look old!</li>
            <li>I plan on staying young forever, and hopefully this Mimi Fontaine Anti-Aging Eye Cream will help me achieve that goal!</li>
            <li>As you can see in the photos, the fine lines on the outer edge of my eye are less visible and</li>
            <li>It produces a significant improvement on dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li>were a little tighter, the darkness around my eyes was lighter and my fine little lines were filled in a bit.</li>
            <li>I must admit that, though I like it (writing on my son&#x27;s account) and it certainly moisturizes the eye area, it also burns briefly.</li>
            <li>I recently have started caring a little more about my appearance.</li>
            <li>I have now been using this for a few days and notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>There were several things I really like about this</li>
            <li>but it also helps protect the sensitive skin around my eyes from harmful UV rays as well.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on smoothly over the eye cream and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been getting much sleep since having my third child (two years ago!)</li>
            <li>I love that it lightens the dark circles that I always have after long days of work and class.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with dark circles or fine lines.</li>
            <li>It is made from a proprietary blend of ingredients including hydrolyzed collagen to reduce the fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles while plumping your skin; hydrolyzed elastin which allows your skin to return to a younger looking you reducing the look of &#x27;crows feet&#x27; caused from your skin stretching over the years when you smile for example; licorice root extract traditionally used to treat pigmentation and dark circles; Vitamin E provides protection against UV rays or other free radicals; retinyl palmitate (a form of Vitamin A) promotes the production of collagen and cell rejuvenation while decreasing the size of your pores...</li>
            <li>This particular brand is from Mimi Fontaine whom is renowned in the Hollywood industry for the last 20+ years for her anti aging products.</li>
            <li>I was really amazed that after a long day, I washed my face, massaged the lotion around both eyes and could immediately feel relief.</li>
            <li>(reduces dark circles or other pigment issues), and more.</li>
            <li>It will definitely become a new part of my skin care regiment.</li>
            <li>The smell is soft and subtle and the cream itself is very mild.</li>
            <li>My dark circles seem to be less noticeable and the skin around my eyes seem more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a few days, but I can absolutely see a difference in the dark circles, and the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but I received a discount for an honest review.</li>
            <li>This cream spreads to smoothly and evenly that a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>This cream is also the gentlest of any I&#x27;ve tried - I usually get a mild reaction when I put any cream too close to my lower lashes, but I had nothing like that with this product.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream goes on very smooth and does not feel like a watered down eye cream like some I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>It felt gentle to my skin without any stinging or other untoward reactions.  </li>
            <li>I only need to use a small amount, it absorbs and dries quickly and is not sticky.</li>
            <li>It really works on puffiness and dark circles around the eye</li>
            <li>Gradually I have been getting dark circles under my eyes with too much of a puffy look.</li>
            <li>They get really puffy, both below the eye and on the eye lid, and I develop dark rings.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen major improvement as of yet with wrinkles and under eye circles unfortunately, but will continue to use and hope to be able to change my 4 star rating to five stars.</li>

            <li> The pump makes dispensing easy.  </li>
            <li> The pump makes dispensing easy and you do not have to unscrew a lid to get to the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It also seems to help reduce the effects of varying humidity during the winter months, and it&#x27;s easy to make it a part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to blend around the eye area.</li>
            <li> It is a low scent (I love scents) which is great for my face.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t oily at all, and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> It does not have a strong fragrance, nor does it have a scent that will put off men from using the product.</li>
            <li> It goes on so nice and smoothly and really absorbs quickly, I love that it has helped make</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation as a result of use, and am very very pleased with how little I need to use to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li> Adding in the fine lines around my eyes, I decided to shop around for some anti aging creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fine lines are no where in sight.</li>
            <li> I did try it on my hand, and there was an immediate visible improvement in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>

            <li> The eye cream is full of ingredients that work wonders for aging skin and protects young skin to keep everyone looking and feeling great about their face.</li>
            <li> I have crows feet and fine lines in my under eye area.</li>
            <li> It is one of the very best anti-aging eye creams on the market that not only helps restore a youthful look to your eyes by reducing fine lines and wrinkles, but also greatly reduces your dark circles and puffiness all while moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li> Instead, it has a nice and subtle citrus scent to it that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I also liked that it contains healthy, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> After cleansing my face I put a dab under both eyes and massage lightly around the eyes.</li>

            <li> I received free product for review purposes.</li>
            <li> monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately, this is a fantastic eye cream</li>
            <li> I loved that the eye area stayed soft overnight afteruusing this cream.</li>
            <li> What better time to put the product to the test, right?</li>
            <li> Overall a very nice product much welcome in this dry climate (AZ).</li>
            <li> This eye cream is rich and luxurious.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I was blessed with good genetics when it comes to skin aging, so I don&#x27;t have much in the way of wrinkles, but the lack of sleep really shows around my eyes.</li>
            <li> a few days ago I love it has shown great results.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and applied to clean skin in the morning and in the evening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed low scent creams works best on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for a short time and am really impressed with the results so far.</li>
            <li> That makes for super easy application and the cap keeps it fresh.</li>
            <li> Over all it makes a good under eye moisturizer that goes on feeling smooth and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> (I also jump on the trampoline to get the lymphatic circulation going, but my eyes really do look better.)  </li>
            <li> The Mimi Fontaine cream has really reduced the puffiness, and I have been told I look more alert and awake-even on days when I haven&#x27;t slept at all...</li>
            <li> I instead start the morning off with well hydrated, smooth under eye skin and a smile.</li>
            <li> Dispenser bottle puts out just the right amount and makes it easy to keep the product fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive this anti-aging eye cream by Mimi Fontaine at a discount in exchange for my honest evaluation of the product and to post my results here in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it and  highly recommend it to try out.</li>
            <li> so my eyes have been more puffier than normal.</li>
            <li> It works great for my dark circles underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> a day before i got sick and thankfully had it here beside me for when i got well enough to use it, sometimes products are just perfectly timed and this one was definitely perfectly timed.</li>
            <li> Well when I was offered this Eye Circles Less Apparent product from Perfection Products for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love a good eye cream &amp; I have been testing out some really good ones lately and this Anti Aging Eye Cream that Mimi Fontaine sent me to review is definitely one of them.  </li>
            <li> my opinion, this is a wonderful cream that soothes my eyes, reduces puffiness and dark circles and so far (knock on wood)</li>
            <li> Such cute packaging!</li>
            <li> - Elastin lets the skin resume its shape after stretching/contracting, as is it does when you smile.</li>
            <li> When absorbed into the skin, it promotes collagen production and cell rejuvenation, and decreases pore size, so the skin around your eyes looks younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I use it for laugh lines and bags under and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite eye creams and I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works in the years to come.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> As I mentioned earlier, the packaging is adorable, and it has a really convenient pump top with a cap.</li>
            <li> It feels so nice on my eye area and gives an instant soothing feeling when applied.</li>
            <li> I was recently asked to try this product and give the manufacture my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I am able to easily apply my eye makeup over it without a single thought.</li>
            <li> Mimi Fontaine eye cream does wonders for my dark circles and fine lines-they look more vibrant and my eyes look more awake.</li>
            <li> and sometimes you don&#x27;t use that product right away</li>
            <li> works great, has helped me reduce the dark circles under my eyes really fast.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for the next best eye cream to help with puffy eyes and dark circles.</li>
            <li> so I really appreciate a clean scent.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the best luck in my search previously, so I accepted the offer in order to receive a discount on my initial order.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get the Mimi Fontaine Eye Cream at a promotion price to try and Iâ€™m glad I took them up on their offer.</li>
            <li> But overall I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in under eye darkness or fine lines.</li>
            <li> It has been very gentle when applied around my eye area.</li>
            <li> This cream is very light feeling and women can definitely wear it under their makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the pump top and that it takes about half a pump to cover my whole eye area.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This is the first time trying this product.</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing how this continues to work with consistent use.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> The product was not tested on animals, is completely cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this, and definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Haha they didn&#x27;t know I was using this product!  </li>
            <li> I like to use it first thing in the morning after washing my face.</li>
            <li> I just tried it for the first time today and I am AMAZED.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more and telling my family and friends about this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32, but many late nights in my younger years were not so kind to my undereyes!  </li>
            <li> I love that this cream is thick and silky smooth!  </li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> It is not very thick and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I made sure to take a before picture to better evaluate any subtle changes.</li>
            <li> That was my first thought when I first opened up my highly anticipated package from Amazon.</li>
            <li> When I was younger it was easy to conceal with makeup.</li>
            <li> Retinyl palmitate is a form of vitamin A. Studies have shown it safe when used with ordinary care to avoid overexposure to ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is white in color, non-greasy and spreads easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying make up for years and all that tugging on my eyes has certainly made them look baggy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my main concern when it comes to eye cream!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easily absorbed leaving the skin soft &amp; hydrated.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a whole lot to cover both of your eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get much sleep these days</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an unusual scent that was noticeable.</li>
            <li> Also, the seller really ensured that orders were shipped promptly</li>
            <li> What I really like is there is no noticeable scent and the eye cream</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and greaseless.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is creaming yet light enough</li>
            <li> and it has really started to show.</li>
            <li> so I know I&#x27;m really taking care of the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much either.  </li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing eye cream and does not migrate into your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, this is a fantastic eye cream</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few weeks on my wrinkling areas on the side of my eyes as well as between my brows, and it&#x27;s been great!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and so far I&#x27;ve ha no bad reactions to this cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I am really loving this eye cream.</li>
            <li> my eye area more plumper and the dark circles seem to have started to fade already.</li>
            <li> I love trying new products to lessen dark circles.</li>
            <li> It accurately pumps out just the right amount needed every time without waste or contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream is really thick and feels smooth and rich going on, which creates a pampered feeling.</li>
            <li> The design of the packaging is nice as well ; although quite similar to the other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m older these dark circles aren&#x27;t so easy to cover up.</li>
            <li> Normally I have hardcore bags under my eyes and walk around looking like a raccoon.  </li>
            <li> cream is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> I did manage to get a tiny bit into my eye, and had mild stinging but nothing unexpected.</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for new beauty products to keep my eyes (and skin) looking youthful.</li>
            <li> So for me, Mimi Fontaine is my new go to anti-aging, skin soothing eye cream.</li>
            <li> It helps with all of my eye issues everything from dark circles &amp; puffines to fine lines &amp; wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone who want to lessen their fine lines and dark eye circles.</li>
            <li> It visibly reduces fine lines and dark circles leaving your skin looking heatlhy.</li>
            <li> I suffer with dark baggy eyes and fine lines and within 2 weeks of applying the cream I started noticing my bags</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, it did not bother my skin at all, and it soaked in immediately, without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> However, my dark circles are genetic so that may be why i haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I have also been using it on my fine lines and I like the fact that it makes them look less visible.</li>
            <li> Contains vitamin E - Vitamin E supplements the skin&#x27;s natural antioxidant defenses and provides protection against ultraviolet radiation and other free radicals.</li>
            <li> Makeup settles in the cracks and I look old!</li>
            <li> I plan on staying young forever, and hopefully this Mimi Fontaine Anti-Aging Eye Cream will help me achieve that goal!</li>
            <li> As you can see in the photos, the fine lines on the outer edge of my eye are less visible and</li>
            <li> It produces a significant improvement on dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> were a little tighter, the darkness around my eyes was lighter and my fine little lines were filled in a bit.</li>
            <li> I must admit that, though I like it (writing on my son&#x27;s account) and it certainly moisturizes the eye area, it also burns briefly.</li>
            <li> I recently have started caring a little more about my appearance.</li>
            <li> I have now been using this for a few days and notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> There were several things I really like about this</li>
            <li> but it also helps protect the sensitive skin around my eyes from harmful UV rays as well.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on smoothly over the eye cream and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been getting much sleep since having my third child (two years ago!)</li>
            <li> I love that it lightens the dark circles that I always have after long days of work and class.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with dark circles or fine lines.</li>
            <li> It is made from a proprietary blend of ingredients including hydrolyzed collagen to reduce the fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles while plumping your skin; hydrolyzed elastin which allows your skin to return to a younger looking you reducing the look of &#x27;crows feet&#x27; caused from your skin stretching over the years when you smile for example; licorice root extract traditionally used to treat pigmentation and dark circles; Vitamin E provides protection against UV rays or other free radicals; retinyl palmitate (a form of Vitamin A) promotes the production of collagen and cell rejuvenation while decreasing the size of your pores...</li>
            <li> This particular brand is from Mimi Fontaine whom is renowned in the Hollywood industry for the last 20+ years for her anti aging products.</li>
            <li> I was really amazed that after a long day, I washed my face, massaged the lotion around both eyes and could immediately feel relief.</li>
            <li> (reduces dark circles or other pigment issues), and more.</li>
            <li> It will definitely become a new part of my skin care regiment.</li>
            <li> The smell is soft and subtle and the cream itself is very mild.</li>
            <li> My dark circles seem to be less noticeable and the skin around my eyes seem more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days, but I can absolutely see a difference in the dark circles, and the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but I received a discount for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This cream spreads to smoothly and evenly that a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> This cream is also the gentlest of any I&#x27;ve tried - I usually get a mild reaction when I put any cream too close to my lower lashes, but I had nothing like that with this product.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream goes on very smooth and does not feel like a watered down eye cream like some I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It felt gentle to my skin without any stinging or other untoward reactions.  </li>
            <li> I only need to use a small amount, it absorbs and dries quickly and is not sticky.</li>
            <li> It really works on puffiness and dark circles around the eye</li>
            <li> Gradually I have been getting dark circles under my eyes with too much of a puffy look.</li>
            <li> They get really puffy, both below the eye and on the eye lid, and I develop dark rings.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen major improvement as of yet with wrinkles and under eye circles unfortunately, but will continue to use and hope to be able to change my 4 star rating to five stars.</li>
            <li> Contains licorice root extract - Licorice root extract is a natural ingredient traditionally used to treat overpigmentation caused by inflammation, eczema, and other skin disorders.</li>
            <li> I have used other creams that have helped a little but they seem to only help so much.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I apply this in the morning and let it dry, then apply my regular makeup.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered with episodes of insomnia and with three young children, I get even less sleep during those times.</li>
            <li> I admit that I&#x27;m not the girliest of girls, but I take my skin care pretty seriously.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always nice to know when it will go bad.</li>
            <li> and I think this will last a few months which helps in justifying the expense of reordering it in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and think my purple circles are a little lighter!</li>
            <li> cause I&#x27;m single and in my 30s</li>
            <li> Since I started using this product the skin around my eyes is definitely brighter and the dark circles aren&#x27;t as noticeable.  </li>
            <li> After using this product just at night my dark spots and overall puffiness have started fading.  </li>
            <li> This makes the skin around the eyes less likely to age prematurely and wrinkle.</li>
            <li> It has no particular scent on it which I like about it.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes is definitely brighter and the dark circles aren&#x27;t as noticeable!</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It helps with inflammation, eczema and other skin conditions.</li>
            <li> This product is guaranteed money back to you if you are not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> As usual, I didn&#x27;t sleep much last night.</li>
            <li> I bought it to help dark circles, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in puffiness and dark circles in just 2 days.</li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Mimi Fontaine Eye Cream ingredients include collagen - that plumps up skin, licorice root extract - to help with dark circles and Vitamins E and A.</li>
            <li> It looks like the dark circles are responding.</li>
            <li> The ingredients include collagen - that plumps up skin, licorice root extract - to help with dark circles and Vitamins E and A.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles though has not changed</li>
            <li> I had a dark circle problems with my eyes.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have those dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I forgot to mention it has some kinda ingredients that help to sooth and col down the eye</li>
            <li> I use this cream twice a day, daily, and apply a small amount around my eyes by dabbing it (no rubbing!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and have noticed a slight reduction in the wrinkles around my eyes as well as the darkness underneath.  </li>
            <li> My eyes feel brighter and even less puffy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting slight wrinkles</li>
            <li> Whatever the case is, little things bother me that I never paid attention to before, like dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> my puffiness went down and the dark circles were fading!</li>
            <li> After a few days the dark circles started to lighten.  </li>
            <li> (A couple people gave me compliments when they noticed my eyes looked less puffy and dark!)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting any results, much less immediate ones, but within a few minutes after applying the cream I could feel a slight tightness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Unlike other creams which I&#x27;ve used in the past that can burn if/when they get into your eye, this cream has an added benefit that it doesn&#x27;t burn and allows to be painlessly washed out.</li>
            <li> It contains Vitamins A &amp; E, Jojoba seed oil, cucumber fruit extract and licorice root extract, just to name a few.</li>
            <li> It seemed to firm the area around my eyes and make them smoother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad enough my eyes are slightly deep set.</li>
            <li> It makes it worse that I&#x27;m a single mom to 4.</li>
            <li> So lately those slightly noticeable dark circles appear to me like I got sucker punched!</li>
            <li> Just one small pump covers a lot of area, so use sparingly!&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> The small molecules of hydrolyzed elastin penetrate the skin&#x27;s surface and improve its elasticity.</li>
            <li> and we know how badly it plays with your eyes so much so that they look dull and lifeless</li>
            <li> The consistency of the eye cream is fairly thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, moisturize well.</li>
            <li> I was lucky and got it at a promotion but take this review into account and try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I wake up without tired, puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable or painful at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad.</li>
            <li> I decided to take another photo and was shocked to see a difference.</li>
            <li> after washing my face this morning and using my serum i placed this on my eyes i have been sick for almost 2 weeks</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received the Anti aging eye cream a few days ago I love it has shown great results. I would definitely recommand it to another Amazon customer.</li>
            <li> After trying the product for about two weeks I&#x27;m very happy with it. Results are noticeable. Very big difference prior to its use</li>
            <li> I love a good eye cream &amp; I have been testing out some really good ones lately and this Anti Aging Eye Cream that Mimi Fontaine sent me to review is definitely one of them.  It helps with all of my eye issues everything from dark circles &amp; puffines to fine lines &amp; wrinkles.  The consistency of the eye cream is fairly thick but it&#x27;s easily absorbed leaving the skin soft &amp; hydrated.  I love how it seems to smooth out &amp; fill in the fine lines!&lt;br /&gt;I also love that the Anti Aging Eye Cream by Mimi Fontaine is also Paraben free and they do not test on animals.</li>
            <li> Mimi Fontaine Eye cream is a great cream. Although I prefer serums over creams because of consistency, I like this cream. It is not very thick and absorbs quickly. You don&#x27;t need a whole lot to cover both of your eyes. After cleansing my face I put a dab under both eyes and massage lightly around the eyes. It gives and instant firmness to eye area. This cream contains collagen, elastin, Vitamin E and Vitamin A in  the form of Retinyl Palmitate. All these ingredients are proven to enhance skin elasticity. I can see a difference in the skin around my eyes and will continue to use it. Another plus is that it is paraben free.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this eye cream. Absolutely in love. It has been very gentle when applied around my eye area. Most eye creams sting my eye area and makes it go cray red - but not this brand! I have also been using it on my fine lines and I like the fact that it makes them look less visible. It really works on puffiness and dark circles around the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself. Iâ€™m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end userâ€™s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I am really loving this eye cream. It&#x27;s got the perfect balance of moisturizing without being heavy and oily. And I am not waking up with puffy eyes in the morning. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using this product for a month.  I bought it to help dark circles, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This cream is really thick and feels smooth and rich going on, which creates a pampered feeling. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and have noticed a slight reduction in the wrinkles around my eyes as well as the darkness underneath.  The pump feature is nice for application.  I have sensitive skin and so far I&#x27;ve ha no bad reactions to this cream. Love it!</li>
            <li> As a woman in my 40&#x27;s, I have started the battle to stave off wrinkles.  The skin around your eyes requires a special kind of moisturizer so when I was given the opportunity to purchase this Mimi Fontaine eye cream at a reduced price to test for quality, I was ecstatic.  There were several things I really like about this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The pump makes dispensing easy.  I like that you do not have to unscrew a lid to get to the product.&lt;br /&gt;2.  A little goes a long way.  One pump dispenses enough for both eyes.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The cream absorbs well and without any greasy feel leaving my skin feeling silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;4.  There is no stinging or burning.  I was able to use it on the sides of my eyes as well as underneath.&lt;br /&gt;5.  I noticed a visible reduction in the bags under my eyes.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles to attest to wrinkle reduction but I have confidence that this will help prevent the formation of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is one of the best eye creams I have tried.  It will definitely become a new part of my skin care regiment.</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> It feels nice under my eyes, and moisturizers well. But overall I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in under eye darkness or fine lines. However, my dark circles are genetic so that may be why i haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference. Over all it makes a good under eye moisturizer that goes on feeling smooth and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have noticed a difference in puffiness and dark circles in just 2 days.</li>
            <li> Gradually I have been getting dark circles under my eyes with too much of a puffy look. I have used other creams that have helped a little but they seem to only help so much. I figured it cannot hurt to see if this one would work better. This particular brand is from Mimi Fontaine whom is renowned in the Hollywood industry for the last 20+ years for her anti aging products. It is one of the very best anti-aging eye creams on the market that not only helps restore a youthful look to your eyes by reducing fine lines and wrinkles, but also greatly reduces your dark circles and puffiness all while moisturizing your skin. It is made from a proprietary blend of ingredients including hydrolyzed collagen to reduce the fine lines, wrinkles, dark circles while plumping your skin; hydrolyzed elastin which allows your skin to return to a younger looking you reducing the look of &#x27;crows feet&#x27; caused from your skin stretching over the years when you smile for example; licorice root extract traditionally used to treat pigmentation and dark circles; Vitamin E provides protection against UV rays or other free radicals; retinyl palmitate (a form of Vitamin A) promotes the production of collagen and cell rejuvenation while decreasing the size of your pores...all these ingredients work together to make your eyes look younger than ever. I have now been using this for a few days and notice a huge difference. (A couple people gave me compliments when they noticed my eyes looked less puffy and dark!) I am confident that this eye cream will continue to improve the look of my skin and do recommend you trying this!! (I received a great deal on this product through a promotion in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.  The information provided is solely my opinion and based on my personal experience.)</li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes. When I was younger it was easy to conceal with makeup. Now that I&#x27;m older these dark circles aren&#x27;t so easy to cover up. Adding in the fine lines around my eyes, I decided to shop around for some anti aging creams.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is nice and thick. It is easy to apply and blends in thoroughly to the spots that need the most care. The smell is soft and subtle and the cream itself is very mild. I did not experience any irritation at all. Just one small pump covers a lot of area, so use sparingly!&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product, my eyes look more youthful. The skin around my eyes is definitely brighter and the dark circles aren&#x27;t as noticeable! Fine lines are no where in sight. When I put my makeup on over this cream, it doesn&#x27;t clump or effect the application of my concealer. I absolutely love this product and will be buying more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad. It hurt my eyes. Do not buy it</li>
            <li> I am always looking for the next best eye cream to help with puffy eyes and dark circles. Well when I was offered this Eye Circles Less Apparent product from Perfection Products for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I decided to give it a try. I followed the instructions and applied to clean skin in the morning and in the evening. I didn&#x27;t have any reactions or itchy eyes so that&#x27;s great. My skin reacted just like it was supposed to...my puffiness went down and the dark circles were fading! I love this product from Perfection Products and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> This eye cream goes on very smooth and does not feel like a watered down eye cream like some I have used in the past. It does seem to take away the puffiness under my eyes and around my eye lids as well. I don&#x27;t get much sleep these days so my eyes have been more puffier than normal. The bottle is really cute also and easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> Mimi Fontaine Eye Cream ingredients include collagen - that plumps up skin, licorice root extract - to help with dark circles and Vitamins E and A. The pump makes dispensing easy and you do not have to unscrew a lid to get to the product out of the bottle. A little bit goes a long way, a half a pump dispenses enough for both my eyes. It absorbs well without any greasy feeling on my skin and leaving it feeling silky smooth. I didnâ€™t have any stinging or burning around my eyes and was able to use it on the sides of my eyes as well as underneath. Since I started using this product the skin around my eyes is definitely brighter and the dark circles aren&#x27;t as noticeable.  When I put my makeup on over this cream, it works well with my application of the concealer I use. I was lucky enough to get the Mimi Fontaine Eye Cream at a promotion price to try and Iâ€™m glad I took them up on their offer.</li>
            <li> AMAZING eye cream. The only one i use.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t change the appearance of lunes and circles under my eyes one bit</li>
            <li> This is the first time trying this product. It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but I received a discount for an honest review. It does work....slowly. I have seen improvement. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks from when I started using the product. I use it twice a day.  The application dispenser is excellent  that avoids wastefulness of tubes. It doesn&#x27;t have an unusual scent that was noticeable. I don&#x27;t like creams with odors especially when applying to my face so I really appreciate a clean scent.  It absorbs quickly and my own concealer applies evenly afterwards. It felt gentle to my skin without any stinging or other untoward reactions.  This is a paraben free product without any animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are impressive and this description is found on their Mimi Fontaine homepage:&lt;br /&gt;Hydrolyzed collagen - Hydrolyzed collagen plumps up the skin and reduces the look of fine lines, wrinkles, and bags under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Hydrolyzed elastin - Elastin lets the skin resume its shape after stretching/contracting, as is it does when you smile. The small molecules of hydrolyzed elastin penetrate the skin&#x27;s surface and improve its elasticity. so you can keep your naturally beautiful smile without worrying about &amp;#34;crowsfeet&amp;#34; forming at the corners of your eyes.Contains licorice root extract - Licorice root extract is a natural ingredient traditionally used to treat overpigmentation caused by inflammation, eczema, and other skin disorders. It produces a significant improvement on dark circles under the eyes.Contains vitamin E - Vitamin E supplements the skin&#x27;s natural antioxidant defenses and provides protection against ultraviolet radiation and other free radicals. This makes the skin around the eyes less likely to age prematurely and wrinkle. Also contains retinyl palmitate. Retinyl palmitate is a form of vitamin A. Studies have shown it safe when used with ordinary care to avoid overexposure to ultraviolet light. When absorbed into the skin, it promotes collagen production and cell rejuvenation, and decreases pore size, so the skin around your eyes looks younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of it goes a long way and I think this will last a few months which helps in justifying the expense of reordering it in the future. I look forward to seeing how this continues to work with consistent use.</li>
            <li> I got a discount coupon for trying this eye cream and all opinions are my own. This is a nice, lightweight cream that really helped to soften my aging eye skin. I loved that the eye area stayed soft overnight afteruusing this cream. I also liked that it contains healthy, natural ingredients. I did manage to get a tiny bit into my eye, and had mild stinging but nothing unexpected. I haven&#x27;t seen major improvement as of yet with wrinkles and under eye circles unfortunately, but will continue to use and hope to be able to change my 4 star rating to five stars. I did try it on my hand, and there was an immediate visible improvement in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The skin also looked healthier and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> Very nice texture. Melts into the skin - no blurry vision. Hydration lasts. Overall a very nice product much welcome in this dry climate (AZ). Dispenser bottle puts out just the right amount and makes it easy to keep the product fresh and clean. My under eye area looks better - It looks like the dark circles are responding.</li>
            <li> I love that this cream is thick and silky smooth!  I love the way this cream feels.  I don&#x27;t mind using it all over my face. The dispenser is nicely made and works perfectly.  Also, the seller really ensured that orders were shipped promptly (mine was) and that the customer was happy.  I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and think my purple circles are a little lighter!</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for new beauty products to keep my eyes (and skin) looking youthful. I was fortunate enough to receive this anti-aging eye cream by Mimi Fontaine at a discount in exchange for my honest evaluation of the product and to post my results here in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I&#x27;d like to mention that this product ships quickly and arrived on my doorstep on time and in excellent condition, packaged properly. Next, I was really impressed with the pump dispenser. It accurately pumps out just the right amount needed every time without waste or contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this anti-aging eye cream day and night after I wash my face. I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how wonderful this cream feels on my eyes! I was really amazed that after a long day, I washed my face, massaged the lotion around both eyes and could immediately feel relief. I&#x27;m also an allergy sufferer as well and anything that soothes my eyes is a welcomed product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this is a wonderful cream that soothes my eyes, reduces puffiness and dark circles and so far (knock on wood) no wrinkles! I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am with this formula. It contains Vitamins A &amp; E, Jojoba seed oil, cucumber fruit extract and licorice root extract, just to name a few. Not only does it soothe and improve the overall look, feel &amp; appearance of my eyes but it also helps protect the sensitive skin around my eyes from harmful UV rays as well. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve been using it under my makeup so that my skin is protected all day and before bed so my skin can soak up all that wonderful hydration. I wake up looking and feeling younger. Because you know what they say, when you look good, you feel good. So for me, Mimi Fontaine is my new go to anti-aging, skin soothing eye cream. This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Mimi Eye Cream was provided at a discount for my review.  Opinions are my own and this is my honest review.  I am impressed with this product.  The ingredients include collagen - that plumps up skin, licorice root extract - to help with dark circles and Vitamins E and A.  It comes well sealed in a bottle that is protected from sunlight and is dispensed using a pump.  The eye cream is white in color, non-greasy and spreads easily.  What I really like is there is no noticeable scent and the eye cream does not cause any sting or discomfort to my skin.  I only need to use a small amount, it absorbs and dries quickly and is not sticky. I apply this in the morning and let it dry, then apply my regular makeup. My makeup goes on smoothly over the eye cream and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. I also use this before bed and I like the results I am seeing. My dark circles seem to be less noticeable and the skin around my eyes seem more hydrated.  No animal testing is done with this product and it comes with a no questions asked money back guarantee.  I honestly feel confident recommending giving it a try. I definitely plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> Normally I have hardcore bags under my eyes and walk around looking like a raccoon.  I have used this cream for several days now and I do notice an improvement.  (I also jump on the trampoline to get the lymphatic circulation going, but my eyes really do look better.)  This cream is also the gentlest of any I&#x27;ve tried - I usually get a mild reaction when I put any cream too close to my lower lashes, but I had nothing like that with this product.  All in all, I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I must admit that, though I like it (writing on my son&#x27;s account) and it certainly moisturizes the eye area, it also burns briefly. I do confirm that it has helped my eye area, but it&#x27;s not as refreshing as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few weeks on my wrinkling areas on the side of my eyes as well as between my brows, and it&#x27;s been great! I can tell the difference even in this short of a period of time. It also seems to help reduce the effects of varying humidity during the winter months, and it&#x27;s easy to make it a part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I received this anti-aging eye cream for a product review and I love it. My husband LOVES it more. He has crowfeet and worry wrinkles around his eyes and hates them. So he uses this for those conditions and I use it for laugh lines and bags under and around my eyes. This cream is so great. It plumps the skin around the eyes to reduce fine lines, crowfeet, wrinkles and bags. I love that it lightens the dark circles that I always have after long days of work and class. It helps with inflammation, eczema and other skin conditions. It is very lightweight and greaseless. It does not have a strong fragrance, nor does it have a scent that will put off men from using the product. The purpose of this product is to lighten circles, fill in lines and wrinkles, decrease pore size to enhance eyes, rejuvenate cell and collagen production and protect skin. This cream is very light feeling and women can definitely wear it under their makeup. This cream spreads to smoothly and evenly that a little bit goes a very long way. The eye cream is full of ingredients that work wonders for aging skin and protects young skin to keep everyone looking and feeling great about their face. Some of the ingredients of this cream are hydrolyzed collagen (plumps your skin), hydrolyzed elastin (helps skin resume its shape after stretching like when smiling or yawning), vitamins A and E, licorice root extract (reduces dark circles or other pigment issues), and more. It is paraben free, though! The product was not tested on animals, is completely cruelty free. This product is guaranteed money back to you if you are not completely satisfied. I have been very happy with this product and think that anyone that tries it will completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I recently have started caring a little more about my appearance. Maybe it&#x27;s cause I&#x27;m single and in my 30s lol. Whatever the case is, little things bother me that I never paid attention to before, like dark circles under my eyes. It&#x27;s bad enough my eyes are slightly deep set. It makes it worse that I&#x27;m a single mom to 4. And to add insult to injury, I work night shift and never get a good nights rest! So lately those slightly noticeable dark circles appear to me like I got sucker punched! I knew I needed to focus on this area and bought this eye cream just for that reason. After using it every night for a week or two I can honestly say I have seen great improvement! I definitely do not feel as though I need to get the bag of peas out of the freezer and ice my wounds anymore. My eyes feel brighter and even less puffy. I love this cream and would recommend it to all those considering buying it. I was lucky and got it at a promotion but take this review into account and try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love trying new products to lessen dark circles. This eye cream is creaming yet light enough so it&#x27;s easy to blend around the eye area. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two days now and I have noticed that my eye bags aren&#x27;t as puffy throughout the day. My dark circles though has not changed but I&#x27;m sure by continuing using this product, I would see results. I especially love the fact that there is an expiration date on the bottom of the bottle because some products do not even have that and sometimes you don&#x27;t use that product right away so it&#x27;s always nice to know when it will go bad. This product could last a while since you only need a pea size to apply around the eyes. I recommend this product to everyone who want to lessen their fine lines and dark eye circles.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer cream which helps distressed wrinkles under your eyes. Unlike other creams which I&#x27;ve used in the past that can burn if/when they get into your eye, this cream has an added benefit that it doesn&#x27;t burn and allows to be painlessly washed out.</li>
            <li> NOthing works harder to prevent skin damage and reduce the signs of aging around your eyes then the Mimi Fontaine eye cream. It visibly reduces fine lines and dark circles leaving your skin looking heatlhy. It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly to work great.</li>
            <li> I loved the coverage of this lotion. It seemed to firm the area around my eyes and make them smoother. Definitely a win for me.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is rich and luxurious. It is thicker than most eye creams, but feels light and airy once applied. I love the pump top and that it takes about half a pump to cover my whole eye area. I use this cream twice a day, daily, and apply a small amount around my eyes by dabbing it (no rubbing!) around my eyes starting with my trouble area under my eye/near the bridge of my nose and working my way up around the entirety of my eye. (including my eye lid)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mimi Fontaine eye cream does wonders for my dark circles and fine lines-they look more vibrant and my eyes look more awake. The eye cream has also helped my puffy eyes in the morning. I haven&#x27;t been getting much sleep since having my third child (two years ago!) and it has really started to show. The Mimi Fontaine cream has really reduced the puffiness, and I have been told I look more alert and awake-even on days when I haven&#x27;t slept at all... I am extremely happy with my results using this eye cream and love that it is paraben free and full of healthy and natural ingredients so I know I&#x27;m really taking care of the skin around my eyes. This is by far one of my favorite eye creams and I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works in the years to come.</li>
            <li> As you can see , it comes in an airless pump applicator. I just Checked that it doesn&#x27;t have any straw attached with it ; I wonder this is how it works!! The design of the packaging is nice as well ; although quite similar to the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an anti-aging eye cream , so you can guess it&#x27;s great for matured skin. A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s hydrating but not so moisturiseng. It has no particular scent on it which I like about it. But the formula quite remind me Bobbi Brown hydrating eye cream that I have finished recently!! It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky at all- it&#x27;s my main concern when it comes to eye cream! It&#x27;s a 15 ml bottle tht last 3/4 months for me. I forgot to mention it has some kinda ingredients that help to sooth and col down the eye area!&lt;br /&gt;I love it and  highly recommend it to try out.</li>
            <li> works great, has helped me reduce the dark circles under my eyes really fast. excellent cream.. smells great also :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying make up for years and all that tugging on my eyes has certainly made them look baggy. I&#x27;m getting slight wrinkles and I&#x27;m only 20! I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and I can already tell a difference. After I wash my face at night, I apply this under my eyes and go to sleep while this cream does all the work. The skin definitely does look firmer and I feel that with enough time all my make up applying damage will be gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, moisturize well. great eye cream</li>
            <li> This eye cream has done an amazing job on my eyes. I suffer with dark baggy eyes and fine lines and within 2 weeks of applying the cream I started noticing my bags were a little tighter, the darkness around my eyes was lighter and my fine little lines were filled in a bit. I am so amazed! I have so much more confidence and I don&#x27;t have to wear 3 pounds of foundation/concealer to hide my problem eyes..thank you!!</li>
            <li> I had a dark circle problems with my eyes.  Noticed I said HAD.  After using this product just at night my dark spots and overall puffiness have started fading.  Love that it goes on smooth and is not sticky after application. It is a low scent (I love scents) which is great for my face.  I&#x27;ve noticed low scent creams works best on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this brand but my friend swore by it. I took the plunge and tried it out. I have crows feet and fine lines in my under eye area. Makeup settles in the cracks and I look old! This stuff almost works as an eye primer too! Without makeup I look years younger, with makeup, even better!!! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excited to have started using this!  I&#x27;m 32, but many late nights in my younger years were not so kind to my undereyes!  Glad I bought this, and definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  It goes on so nice, no sticky.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  After a few days the dark circles started to lighten.  Great product.  It doesn&#x27;t take much either.  Non-greasy also.  I would definitely recommend anyone to try and you&#x27;ll buy again.  I love it.  I never told my kids I was using it and after 3 days they said mom you must of got enough rest you don&#x27;t have those dark circles.  Haha they didn&#x27;t know I was using this product!  Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for a short time and am really impressed with the results so far. It goes on so nice and smoothly and really absorbs quickly, I love that it has helped make my eye area more plumper and the dark circles seem to have started to fade already. It makes me feel so much better about myself! I received free product for review purposes.</li>
            <li> after washing my face this morning and using my serum i placed this on my eyes i have been sick for almost 2 weeks and we know how badly it plays with your eyes so much so that they look dull and lifeless, i got this product actually a day before i got sick and thankfully had it here beside me for when i got well enough to use it, sometimes products are just perfectly timed and this one was definitely perfectly timed. not only did i look well rested people were giving me compliments on it saying they just loved how i looked rested and my eyes were so bright after being sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It works great for my dark circles underneath my eyes. After one week of using this cream,they disappeared already! I just reordered because it is so great:)</li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing eye cream and does not migrate into your eyes.  Has no smell and is in a pump so you don&#x27;t put your fingers in it and it is clean each time and not contaminated!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days, but I can absolutely see a difference in the dark circles, and the fine lines around my eyes. I applied it before my make up in the morning and before bed. A tiny bit goes a very long way. I have very sensitive skin, it did not bother my skin at all, and it soaked in immediately, without leaving a greasy feeling. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with dark circles or fine lines.</li>
            <li> Such cute packaging! That was my first thought when I first opened up my highly anticipated package from Amazon. I admit that I&#x27;m not the girliest of girls, but I take my skin care pretty seriously. I plan on staying young forever, and hopefully this Mimi Fontaine Anti-Aging Eye Cream will help me achieve that goal! It shipped out to me very quickly and arrived in great shape. As I mentioned earlier, the packaging is adorable, and it has a really convenient pump top with a cap. That makes for super easy application and the cap keeps it fresh. I like to use it first thing in the morning after washing my face. It feels so nice on my eye area and gives an instant soothing feeling when applied. It isn&#x27;t oily at all, and absorbs very quickly. Because of this, I am able to easily apply my eye makeup over it without a single thought. It is also great to use at night. I wake up without tired, puffy eyes. I instead start the morning off with well hydrated, smooth under eye skin and a smile. I admit that I was a bit worried when the ingredients mentioned licorice root. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of licorice scent, but I actually don&#x27;t smell it at all! Instead, it has a nice and subtle citrus scent to it that is very pleasant. I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation as a result of use, and am very very pleased with how little I need to use to get the desired effect. I highly recommend trying this for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m including a list of ingredients because I am a huge ingredient reader, being that I have so many allergies. The list is actually quite impressive:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purified water, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, caprylic/capric triglyceride, cyclomethicone, glycerin, cetyl alcohol, jojoba seed oil, tocopheryl acetate ( vitamin e), hydroxyethyl acrylate/ sodium acryloydimethyl taurate copolymer, squalene, glyceryl stearate, peg-100 stearate, sodium hyluronate, dimethicone, phenoxyethanol, bilberry fruit leaf extract, cucumber fruit extract, wheat germ oil, licorice root extract, polysorbate 60, sugar cane extract, camellia oleifera leaf extract, hydolyzed collagen, hydrolized elastin, retinyl palmitate (vitamin a), xanthan gum, fragrance, orange fruit extract, lemon fruit extract, sugar maple extract, methylisothiazolinone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, this is a fantastic eye cream and I plan to continue to incorporate it into my daily routine.

            <li> I am going to be 33 layer this year and, while I am far from &amp;#34;old,&amp;#34; I have been searching for a great under eye cream for years. I have always suffered with episodes of insomnia and with three young children, I get even less sleep during those times. Fortunately, I was blessed with good genetics when it comes to skin aging, so I don&#x27;t have much in the way of wrinkles, but the lack of sleep really shows around my eyes. They get really puffy, both below the eye and on the eye lid, and I develop dark rings. I was recently asked to try this product and give the manufacture my honest opinion. I haven&#x27;t had the best luck in my search previously, so I accepted the offer in order to receive a discount on my initial order. I just tried it for the first time today and I am AMAZED. As usual, I didn&#x27;t sleep much last night. After showing and washing my face, I noticed how puffy my eyes looked. What better time to put the product to the test, right? I made sure to take a before picture to better evaluate any subtle changes. I wasn&#x27;t expecting any results, much less immediate ones, but within a few minutes after applying the cream I could feel a slight tightness around my eyes. It wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable or painful at all. I decided to take another photo and was shocked to see a difference. My son looked smoother and more supple already. As you can see in the photos, the fine lines on the outer edge of my eye are less visible and the puffiness of the upper portion of the lid is reduced! I will definitely be buying more and telling my family and friends about this.</li>
