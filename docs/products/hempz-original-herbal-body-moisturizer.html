            <li>I love this stuff.</li>

            <li>This is my second bottle and this has been the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>For now, this is the best I&#x27;ve found at providing simple moisturization to the skin.</li>
            <li>I love the product itself.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a better lotion than this.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Ladies love the smell :)</li>

            <li>I buy this every year, I love the smell</li>
            <li>and I love how it makes my skin feel after I have been in the sun.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating and smells great.</li>
            <li>Smells great (sorta sweet and herbally), does not feel oily, and quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this since all the reviews are so great and so far so good.</li>
            <li>It also has a very unique scent that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>very nice smell and very silky.</li>
            <li>a shame that this seller is ruining the reputation of HEMPZ since the real scent is actually very nice.</li>
            <li>Let me first just say that the lotion does smell amazing, by far the best smelling lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Very original product.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and moisturized and smells sooooo good!</li>
            <li>got the original kind</li>
            <li>For it to be original but so fragrant kind of threw me off.</li>
            <li>It is thinner lotion, not as creamy &amp; rich as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>We love the original scent!</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>Just a nice clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great product, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a great lotion.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this for men or women and it is at a great price compard to the stores around here.</li>
            <li>It moisturizers really well and smells great but has too strong of a scent and makes my eczema act up</li>
            <li>absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I got a free sample from a salon and love it so much I was happy to find it on amozon.</li>
            <li>it moisturized my skin pretty good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll help you keep your tan for a long time, and it has the best smell out of anything in this world.</li>
            <li>&gt; The price is also pretty good on amazon.</li>
            <li>Kind of like bubble gum - fruity and sweet.  </li>
            <li>I like the herbal smell and good for daily moisture, might more good for combination skin</li>
            <li>Loved it so much that I bought the gallon refill jug!</li>
            <li>I loved finding it for much cheaper and the same great stuff!</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THE ORIGINAL HEMPTZ LOTION</li>
            <li>GREAT light feeling lotion and the scent was fresh and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>On the bright side, it does seem to moisturize really well, and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Excellent for the winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This product matches my requirements and is excellent for moisturizing my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Hempz cream in the jar before that I received as a gift, so I thought I was safe in ordering the lotion version as the description mentions nothing about the extremely strong, floral scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells nice, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>Really pleasant tactile experience, very absorbent.</li>
            <li>This, plus the wonderfully creamy texture, make this cream a delight for anyone suffering with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay by its too strong for me.</li>
            <li>It does not work as well on severely dry skin as I had hoped it would but still a great lotion!</li>
            <li>i love this stuff and the smell is not to strong.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing and smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and smells nice.</li>
            <li>love the scent, light, but lovely.  </li>
            <li>Nice soothing scent, great for back rubs!</li>
            <li>This not only makes your skin feel smooth but smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s also kind of fun to see the faces on my coworkers when they realize that the lotion on my desk has a pot leaf on the label :) )</li>
            <li>It has such a great scent and really does keep your skin hydrated, super great product!</li>
            <li>I am not one to like a real floral smell either, but prefer a more clean, fresh scent, so I will keep looking for a lotion that has both a good smell and is a good body lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s thinner than most lotions, but still fine by me.</li>
            <li>The best product for dry skin!  </li>
            <li>I love the way it absorbs quickly!  </li>
            <li>The cost is the best I have seen as I have looked around many other stores and websites for this product.</li>
            <li>I love the strawberry banana scent of the origional lotion but the other scents are great too!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, it smells great, and makes my skin super soft!!!</li>
            <li>but it has a very strong and sweet smell.</li>
            <li>The lotion smells amazing and is really moisturizing!!</li>
            <li>LOVE the fragrance, which is refreshing and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic, nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Overall very good product</li>
            <li>Its great , helps my psoriasis and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on the scent of it, which I would describe as almost a light banana smell.</li>
            <li>Love the Fragrance of the Moisturizer and skin gets really smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since switched to Kiss My Face Fragrance Free which I like a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the lotion and it definately makes your skin smooth and silky but my pump broke off in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Love this product and smells fantastic</li>
            <li>Best money I&#x27;ve spent on lotion.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, makes my skin feels smooth</li>
            <li>Smells great and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Olay body lotions for quite time which makes me moistured with light scents, and I guess I&#x27;m okay with that lotion.</li>
            <li>it smell great and makes my skin so soft even after tanning all the time i even use it on my daughters skin</li>
            <li>I have said this before, Hempz is the best lotion I have ever used and will continue as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>My sinuses filled up almost immediately, giving me a headache that lasted all night, even after I was finally able to wash it</li>
            <li>My skin was outrageously healthy looking and felt smooth to touch.</li>
            <li>Love how smooth it makes my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, leaves my skin so soft and has an amazing smell to it!</li>
            <li>It smells good, without smelling too much.</li>
            <li>but I loved it so much</li>
            <li>The smell is great, the price is not bad at all, and it makes your skin feel very moist.</li>
            <li>Therefore I much rather have a good quality lotion.</li>
            <li>Hempz seems to do the trick and seems to be just as good, but I still prefer the cetaphil cream for my really rough/dry wintery days.</li>
            <li>Product came fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li>smells so good and really moisturizes without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Good scent for summer (very banana-y).</li>
            <li>Got what I ordered at a good price, much lower than retail.  </li>
            <li>Great lotion for dry skin with a nice scent that is not over powering.  </li>
            <li>This product smells very clean and light, applys smoothly and stays with you most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Since oils tend to hold in heat, I originally purchased this lotion just for my legs, preferring to just deal with the dryness over most of my body because I don&#x27;t handle heat well.</li>
            <li>Such a good lotion!</li>
            <li>my original bottle has a cucumber smell, this stuff also has a more of a greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li>I was originally introduced to this line of lotion by a nail technician, and fell in love with the feel and the scent.</li>
            <li>The Hempz Herbal Moisturizer is a unique lotion that has many perks for the skin.</li>
            <li>Love the original scent</li>
            <li>I thought original would have been more of a lotion smell with no scent.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products to see how awesome they are.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the original lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have tried endless numbers of skin moisturizers and this is the best I have ever found.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product based on all the reviews saying that the smell is pleasant and they are very picky about smells.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and nice and looks so smooth and clean and rich.</li>
            <li>so I can get to it easily.</li>
            <li>The label describes the perfume as cucumber and jasmine, and I can detect that in a very mild way.</li>
            <li>and it absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li>We all loved the smell and its great for her dried out hands.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to spread on the skin and feels supremely luxurious.</li>
            <li>It is simply so easy to rub that overuse is inevitable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t tacky or gummy and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>One reviewer mentioned that she didn&#x27;t like the scent, but as it wasn&#x27;t specific and so many others wrote about how great this is--I ordered it.</li>
            <li>it moisturizes and can be easily applied to your skin---</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week now and my skin is velvety smooth, it feels incredible.</li>

            <li>We received a sample bottle a couple years ago, and now we have purchased this &amp;#34;king sized&amp;#34; version and it&#x27;s in an strategic place in our living room for easy access.</li>
            <li>I keep this on my desk at work  for easy use.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion and the price was perfect, because this is not cheap lotion.  </li>
            <li>It rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy afterwards.</li>

            <li>It has a nice, light scent and it is quickly absorbed and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Glad I finally found a GREAT lotion that does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>The lotion soaks in very quickly and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The contents are filled with a CHEAP bubblegum scented lotion as many of the reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li>Scent is really strong.</li>
            <li>Strong smell for me, gave it to my wife.</li>
            <li>This lotion was way to strong for my senses.</li>
            <li>I like putting the moisturizer on before I go to bed don&#x27;t like strong smells as they distract me and keep me</li>
            <li>The Material Safety Data Sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney</li>
            <li>Remove the strong scent and make a guy scent, and I will order a bunch along with 5 stars.</li>
            <li>But when I started using it over the weekend, it has a EXTREMELY strong scent.  </li>
            <li>strawberry banana and the scent isn&#x27;t too strong, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Some may not find it overly feminine, but it was overly strong, which for me is a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>Has a strong feminine, flowery smell.</li>

            <li>I strongly recommend this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The appeal for men is strong in this one.</li>

            <li>I LOVE this lotion it smells so good and leaves my skin really soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My husband also likes the scent, so it&#x27;s a great general household lotion.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>As many have remarked, this has a really sweet smell that I didn&#x27;t like at all.  </li>
            <li>she liked it so much, so I had to order myself another one!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice when you first put it on</li>
            <li>This is a nice product, of course we first bought it for the name.</li>
            <li>Not only does this lotion smell AMAZING, but it also leaves skin silky smooth and is wonderful if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer; creamier than other popular brands.  </li>
            <li>My mom used to use this, and I remember exactly how it smelled, which I liked, which is why I ordered this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best body moisturizer I ever used hands down.</li>
            <li>The scent is delicious and it it super moisturizing to my dry winter skin....</li>
            <li>it is hands down the best lotion out there.</li>
            <li>Hands down this is the best lotion we have ever used.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a pleasant smelling quick absorbing multi-purpose lotion, this is it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product; it&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic, from the sweet way it smells to the smooth way it feels!</li>
            <li>I had the pomegranate version of this lotion and tolerated it fine.</li>
            <li>, however I use the lotion all over my body, and just use a stronger lotion for my hands, and that works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>moisturizes fine, but it&#x27;s scent is pervasive.  </li>
            <li>A fine product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent, I always get compliments on the scent because its light and sweet.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t fine the correct place to contact Amazone regarding the shipping condition, I will definetly order again, but will re think the shipping...</li>
            <li>It got to me really quickly!</li>
            <li>The word about this is spreading to our family members quickly!  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re so overpowering, but this is mild &amp; lovely.</li>
            <li>quick as well!&lt;br /&gt;smells delish!</li>
            <li>it keeps my skin super moisturized and also reminds me of my wedding whenever I smell it :)</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and safely.  </li>
            <li>This lotion smells cheap... too strongly of bubble gum.  </li>
            <li>Not sticky, absorbs quickly and smells devine!</li>
            <li>but I tend to go through it quickly :)</li>
            <li>Super Saver wasn&#x27;t a saver at ALL!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, arrived quickly and sealed.</li>
            <li>The areas most inflamed quickly felt soothed.</li>
            <li>Luckily my boyfriend found it on here for 12!</li>
            <li>Smells SO STRONG just like cheap bubblegum.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s usually not even a good scent.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and smells light and lovely.</li>
            <li>It smells very light and fresh- not overpowering or anything.</li>
            <li>However, they have other scents if you don&#x27;t like this kind!!</li>
            <li>this hemp lotion has a very intense , perfume-like scent!!</li>
            <li>This lotion is incredible, hands down -- and every other body part too -- the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Best lotion hands down!</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I think the &amp;#34;bubble-gummy&amp;#34; description people have is fairly accurate.</li>
            <li>was paraben free, gluten free, 100% vegan and THC drug free, as stated on its labels when I read it</li>
            <li>Love Hempz products, this one has a nice soft sent to it.</li>
            <li>I bought a huge thing of it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s description accurately fits the product.</li>
            <li>I put it on all the time and my skin is so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Feels great, moisturizes and smells terrific!</li>
            <li>Free, Gluten Free, 100%</li>
            <li>Free, Gluten Free, 100%</li>
            <li>how light  it feels.</li>
            <li>I adore the smell, so I use this, but I combine it with a deep moisturizing cream, and the combination works great.  </li>
            <li>Hempz Herbal Moisturizer makes your skin feel silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist always gave out free samples of this lotion around Christmas</li>
            <li>the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really a great lotion, just not for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and smooth.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizing lotion that over time has actually improved the quality of a couple of scars and blemishes on my skin!</li>
            <li>paraben free.</li>
            <li>It was wrapped with plenty of bubble wrap which left it in great condition.</li>
            <li>The bottle says \\&quot;fragrance of fresh breezy floral, strawberry and banana,\\&quot; but we think it smells more like candy.</li>
            <li>Great product I buy from here several times a year</li>
            <li>lotion is lightly scented and smells</li>
            <li>There were some comments regarding counterfeit product on the market, but this vendor appears to have sent me the real article, with each bottle nicely shrink-wrapped and packaged.  </li>
            <li>This lotion smells like cheap bubble gum, don&#x27;t be decieved.</li>
            <li>DOES THAT SOUND ALL OVER YOUR BODY ??</li>
            <li>but not everyone will enjoy the smell.  </li>
            <li>If you are a fan of synthetic, supermarket smells then maybe you&#x27;ll enjoy this</li>
            <li>I have used many different lotions-this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>it is excellent to use if you get a lot of sun exposure or you expose your skin to a lot of harsh conditions.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m very content with how amazing it smells and feels on your skin.</li>
            <li>and it rubs into your skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoy using this lotion.</li>
            <li>When warmed up, a great facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback to this great lotion is the faulty pumps they use.  </li>
            <li>I bought 3 bottles to take advantage of the free shipping, so now I have 1 at work and 2 at home.</li>
            <li>This product is a cheap knock off...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>and my skin feels so smooth for hours and hours after.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at moisturizing especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li>I used to always get it as a free sample at tanning salons</li>
            <li>my husband feels comfortable wearing-</li>
            <li>Cheap and smells like bubble gum.  </li>

            <li>, I finally got it, it&#x27;s the summer season, and the smell part is great.</li>
            <li>This lotion  is light yet moisturizing.  </li>

            <li>It has a fruity light scent.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a wonderful smell and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great moisturizer that even my boyfriend started using it.</li>
            <li>Smells like bubblegum, but I confirmed that it is supposed to smell like that.</li>
            <li>and i enjoy it, but wouldn&#x27;t buy again because it smells like Pez.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviews said this had a light, fruity scent.  </li>

            <li>And it smells great with all the different botanical herbs.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this lotion, it is very hydrating and it is not greasy but rather smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I like the fragrance which makes me feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect everyday lotion.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll give it to a college kid to enjoy.</li>
            <li>they refill cheap lotion in it.</li>
            <li>I use it on a daily basis and it is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not tropical, it&#x27;s more of a freshly cut lawn scent and it doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it feels so smooth</li>
            <li>Absorbs nice and fast.  </li>
            <li>It is never greasy and leaves my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, is light in texture</li>
            <li>but overall still great.</li>
            <li>This lotion does not contain Parabens - I found that not all Hemp lotions are paraben free</li>
            <li>and it rubs into your skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>I use this lotion as my face lotion everyday and it has a perfect balance for my skin, its moisturizing but not oily.</li>
            <li>And with amazon when I buy a couple things the shipping is completely free.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a light banana-ish, melon-y smell and moisturizes without leaving a greasy, slippery feeling.</li>
            <li>I  have a student grab my arm just to enjoy the scent</li>
            <li>smooth to my body .IS</li>
            <li>YOU WILL ENJOY..</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t say that lightly.</li>
            <li>Smells, however, like cheap candy (banana bubblegum?).</li>
            <li>I enjoy products made from hemp but this smells cheap</li>
            <li>It smells really good and it makes my hands feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I like Hempz as far as being a good moisturizing lotion, what I do not like is the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much, it smells good and really works</li>
            <li>Nice light texture that really soaks in.</li>
            <li>tried a lot of body lotions and this one is one of the good one that has natural contents.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>its smells so good and makes my skin so soft .</li>
            <li>I buy this lotion because it smells so good (and I&#x27;m fairly sensitive to smells).</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>It seems like a good product so far i just prefer unscented</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily and dries fast and has such a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell pleasant and moisturize the skin in a not-greasy kind of way, but it really has been helping my stretch marks!</li>
            <li>The reason why I got this was the price was right for me to be able to qualify for free shipping</li>
            <li>It is pretty strong fruity, floral smell (more feminine).</li>
            <li>And I love that that the scent doesn&#x27;t wear off right away.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and the price is WAY better than at the tanning salon!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why this product has so many positive reviews!</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, clean and warm, but totally unisex.</li>
            <li>When the lotion came on the package the plastic cover over the top of the lotion was messed with and some of the lotion had spelt in the box but other than that I was happy with the price and smell of lotion.</li>
            <li>scent is too sweet and strong</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t stand the BANANA fragrance!!!</li>
            <li>Gave me the confidence to return my Amazon order, which is a first for me, and will be going out Monday!!</li>
            <li>I very rarely write reviews for anything</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, light pleasant fragrance and most importantly, soothing for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and works great for dry hands, worth the price for sure, I highly recommend using it!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product and I love the subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Familiar scent, smooth on my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li>Sure, at first this might look like a nice, reasonably gender neutral, hemp-infused lotion.  </li>
            <li>But it really does provide a wonderful, light moisture that lasts quite a long time.  </li>
            <li>This lotion smells amazing, it makes your skin super soft, and was really cheap to buy!</li>
            <li>It smells so good and leaves my skin soft for a full day.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase this again from this seller because the lotion and value is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion so much!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the smell of the original.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>original scent smells like bananas,</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good general moisturizer for a man.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still my favorite, great smell (not too much and neutral enough for a man) conditions skin well and absorbs without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>and I was SO glad to find it on Amazon for so much cheaper than in the store!</li>
            <li>,it is better than any store brand lotion ive tried for a higher price.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to see that I could get it on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I use nothing else since discovering Hempz Original....</li>
            <li>I was familiar with the product as I use it.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to order Hempz Herbal Body Moisturizer (Original) because I thought it would smell like hemp.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in original scent and I am not the biggest fan of it.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure this lotion will do</li>
            <li>Excited to try it, I put some on my hands as I was leaving the house.  </li>
            <li>First, the lotion was leaking out of the top when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>Lesson learned, buy a product you are familiar with.  </li>
            <li>oh my gosh what a steal compared to what i was originally buying it at.</li>
            <li>and I love how it can moisturise for 12hrs straight!</li>
            <li>THE ORIGINAL SCENT AS WELL AS</li>
            <li>Not even close to the original.  </li>
            <li>and I can tell a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a smell in the world like that of Hempz original.</li>
            <li>I had originally gotten hempz lotion from the person who cuts my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought HEMPZ Original Body Lotion.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Original scent 17oz bottle which has a strawberry banana scent.</li>
            <li>I went on the original website and they said that the smell was floral and banana.</li>
            <li>Not the original scent.</li>
            <li>I suspect that most of the reviewers here are first time buyers</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent is light and not feminine and it&#x27;s not greasy and very effective on dry skin and even sunburn.</li>
            <li>I get dry skin from time to time and this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>This  product is lightly scented and absorbs quickly, without a greasy or slippery feel.</li>
            <li>I found this lotion great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>On top of all that, it makes my skin look and feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>But, lo and behold, 5 months later, I think this is by far one of the best moisturizers I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This product is great for moisturizing your dry skin.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t enough words in this world to describe how much I love this lotion, honestly, there isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It is a great product for dry and chapped skin, on hands, legs or wherever.  </li>
            <li>Try the pomegranate hempz lotion for a more feminine scent or if you desire a significant other to kiss your body,, scent is good and taste is ok ;)</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve come to my senses and learned to love my natural skin tone, I still love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and has a light, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Really does a great job of keeping your hands soft.  </li>
            <li>This is a great lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>a lot more such a great price shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>should excel in, it does have one really good redeeming quality: Its not even remotely greasy.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite lotion!</li>
            <li>The original scent is a bit sweet for me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>By far my favorite lotion out there!</li>
            <li>this stuff is great for dry skin!</li>
            <li>After using many other products over the years, discovered Hempz and am delighted with the results..</li>
            <li>Great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Even though this formula is somewhat light it absorbs very quickly and still provides excellent long lasting</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong and no matter how good the lotion is, we just can&#x27;t tolerate having it on for very long.</li>
            <li>It does a very good job moisturizing, even in the dead of winter.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and has a unique smell.</li>
            <li>I love this produt, very highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li>The quality of the lotion is very much like the cheap lotions that the nail salons use and buy in bulk for a cheap price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be great as a gift (even though the packaging is not that attractive), as an everyday lotion, and as aromatherapy, especially after a bath.</li>
            <li>It smells great, not really like ganja.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, recieved it quicker than expected.</li>
            <li>Its amazing how soft and velvety this lotion is.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and my hands are so soft because of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been a Cetaphil user for years and it worked great at first but over time, it wasn&#x27;t enough for the winter months.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this lotion but the fragrance is overwhelmingly sweet, so much that I would have passed on this product if I had known what to expect.</li>
            <li>Its so soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>To me it smells like sweet tarts.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel nice and soft with no oily stickiness.</li>
            <li>but most just don&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>....once you get under the shower you can tell your skin was covered with something soft and moisturizing...smells nice...</li>
            <li>This lotion is thick, non-greasy and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>: the smell of this lotion is a sort of sweet smell- if you consider this feminine, and if you avoid seemingly feminine products at all costs, avoid this.</li>
            <li>Sweet Pea, maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sweet even.</li>
            <li>Hempz herbal lotion dries quick and makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li>If your a guy you may not like the sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Smells soooo good and the moisture seems to last all day.</li>
            <li>, they turn out too sweet and unnatural smelling (like in this case)?</li>
            <li>After reading the ingredients, I decided to purchase this with the hopes of having a more gentle fragrance for at the office.</li>
            <li>There are multiple uses for it, it is good for all of us, so lets try and educate ourselves before we jump to conclusions.</li>
            <li>makes my skin nice and soft after the shower.</li>
            <li>I have used it before and when i saw it for such a good price i had to purchase it</li>
            <li>i personally have not used it, but the elders have said good things.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li>and I have always loved it and wanted to buy a big bottle.</li>
            <li>I could never make myself pay the full price before</li>
            <li>I paid the full price at the tanning salon at $23 and see that it&#x27;s a lot cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to order more.</li>
            <li>it definitely works buts not as good as say gold bond or cerave.</li>
            <li>The scent smells sweet like candy.</li>
            <li>Cool product.</li>
            <li>Sweet but not too sweet.</li>
            <li>My absolute FAVORITE lotion....</li>
            <li>used to buy this at Ulta, but it is much cheaper on Amazon :)</li>
            <li>Packaging was kind of sketchy with clear evidence of having been refilled.</li>
            <li>I really thought the smell would be a lot better than what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can purchase it here on Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It also shipped really fast :)</li>
            <li>I compared the lotion I received with the full price lotion I purchased at a salon.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had several people compliment me on how good I smell when I&#x27;ve used this lotion.</li>
            <li>Overall a good body lotion, gets the job done.</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t ask for more in a lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells nice, leaves my skin soft and moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good price compared to stores such as Ulta which is selling it for $23 a pop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad for the rest of the body though.</li>
            <li>i love the smell it is very girly and sweet.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and leaves my skin super soft and hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it&#x27;s mild and smells very tropical.</li>
            <li>love this lotion, makes skin very soft and smooth</li>
            <li>This has a great smell, light and clean, and works wonders for my skin year round.</li>
            <li>My order was easy to place, and the product was exactly as they described.  </li>
            <li>It does have a sweet smell but that fades quickly and it does not bother me anyway.</li>
            <li>This product smells really good, it is smooth and lightweight, however my hands tend to be super dry and this product does not give y hands the moisture they need</li>
            <li>It has a pretty strong scent and reminds me of bananas.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer works well, stays on a long time and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>Very nice pump delivery system, works even when the bottle is practically empty</li>
            <li>love this lotion and its very cheap on amazon compared to its regular price in stores</li>
            <li>I tend to like fresh, clean scents as opposed to fruity or sweet smelling things</li>
            <li>So I decided why not give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;First off the scent for the original formula is described as a fresh breezy floral with strawberry and banana.</li>
            <li>Any other product that should control fly aways</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion, due to the use of hemp which is rich but easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>I originally found it while searching for a good after-tan moisturizer, cuz my skin was getting dry and itchy after I used a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best lotion ever!</li>
            <li>I only have really dry skin in between my knuckles and my hand itself and used to use Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair which was the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, I use it almost everyday it smells great and helps to eliminate my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>I am serious it smells delicious.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mild smell.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>It does have a scent, but that scent dissipates rather quickly.</li>
            <li>But it does absorbs quickly and it is a lightweight formula.</li>
            <li>Has an interesting smell but it is definitely one of the better lotions I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Was wary of it not being authentic, but it was perfect.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy more as I need it in the future</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is probably the best lotion I&#x27;ve used in the last ten years...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overpowering super fruity smell either.</li>
            <li>SUPER TRANSACTION....</li>
            <li>Target&#x27;s cocoa butter one does a better job of actually covering but takes more to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 3 bottles arrived quickly and well packaged.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs in your skin quickly &amp; does not leave you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>absorbs quick.</li>
            <li>Great daily moisturizer, especially on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more :)</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild, never overpowering.</li>
            <li>PRICE AND QUICK DELIVERY</li>
            <li>formula itself was what really suprised me, it is 100% paraben free, gluten free and vegan.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It also has a mild scent.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and I appreciate that.</li>
            <li>No greasy feeling, it does absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>If you choose a highly-rated seller you are more likely to get a genuine product!</li>
            <li>Amazon produced my lotion as ordered quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Soaks in quick.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>so I luckily got two of these as gifts for Christmas and hopefully won&#x27;t have to buy any anytime soon.</li>
            <li>Super moisture with yummy smell.</li>
            <li>This lotion is super moisturizing and smells like honey suckle.  </li>
            <li>I loved the clean and fresh, but not overpowering scent of the original hempz lotion, and upon first putting this lotion on I thought it smelled the same...</li>
            <li>I feel so excited to have found the right product.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re the type of person who doesn&#x27;t like a highly fragrant lotion then this may not be for you, but the quality of the lotion is phenomenal...</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product in the past at drug stores, but the price was very good on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Not a strong smell (I dislike overwhelming scents) but a really good smell.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product not only as a moisturizer,  but it does keep pesky gnats away as a friend told me it would.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use my normal moisturizers I buy specifically for my face :)</li>
            <li>it has a great smell to it but the moisturizing part of it is just average.</li>
            <li>Also offered at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Love the hempz loition but the bottle didn&#x27;t come wrapped like they normally do and the pump was cracked and it had leaked out a bit.</li>
            <li>It shipped very fast!</li>
            <li>;-) Enjoy....</li>
            <li>The original is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It honestly smells better then any other lotion that I have tried.</li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I can&#x27;t use it (especially as a full body lotion) because of the smell.</li>
            <li>lotion is fairly \\&quot;wet\\&quot; and you will feel as if your fingers are dripping with water unless you rub continuously for a long time.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really good the next day after using it, and that&#x27;s honestly the only result I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It is the absolute best lotion for extra dry skin! :)</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is easy to apply, easy on the skin, and nearly scent-free.  </li>
            <li>It would not raise up so that i can push it down and have the lotion come out (NO HOMO LOL).</li>
            <li>This product does have hemp seed oil and shea butter in it (which typically does not agree with me) but my skin happens to be doing great this hot Virginia summer with this light soothing lotion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very pleased with this item, and as a regular tanner it really helped my skin &amp; tan!!</li>
            <li>This may be my new addiction... :)</li>
            <li>Its my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Would be great if they could have less unnatural substances in it or come up with a 100% organic line.</li>
            <li>lotion itself is very moisturizing and the pump bottle makes it convenient and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>and I still love it as much now as I did when I first started.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and find it works better than most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It has a strong fragrance that I wasn&#x27;t really expecting.</li>
            <li>Its really good for people who have severe dry skin and/or eczema.</li>
            <li>It was really good for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not greasy, not watery, and not too thick - it smells nicely without being overpowering and feels great - highly recommended</li>
            <li>My ultimate favorite lotion of all time!</li>
            <li>a bit pricey compared to other products, but a nice addition!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Be aware, there are no returns once you purchase!  </li>
            <li>will definitely be stocking up on this lovely stuff!</li>
            <li>My teenage sons even love it!</li>
            <li>I am purchasing my 3rd bottle today, I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>and I will be back to buy more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great in the winter, especially if you live in a cold/dry area like I do.</li>
            <li>Lotion smells great but not too smelly and really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Clearly this is not an issue for others, but if you don&#x27;t care for the strong smell ordniarily found in cheap lotions, you probably won&#x27;t like this either.</li>
            <li>I freely admit I am a moisturizer snob, I&#x27;ve tried 1000s of different ones from drugstore to department store and this one is hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Product smells AMAZING (like a banana and strawberry smoothie), moisturizes really  well, and leaves skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li>This is a great product, however im not sure this is the original that i was looking for .</li>
            <li>a 100% pure chemical free lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though the smell is a little off, the lotion still works great</li>
            <li>Very thick and smells great!</li>
            <li>The scent is a little girly but the good thing is its light and fades by the time I leave the house.</li>
            <li>Love this product and have been a frequent user/buyer ever since the first trial!</li>
            <li>This is a fairly large bottle for the price, so to me very worth it</li>
            <li>help calm, sooth and condition</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and the only lotion I will use.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer for year round use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only fault for this product is the synthetic fragrance, if it weren&#x27;t for that this would be an amazing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whole body is smooth after a couple uses.</li>
            <li>but the skin does feel gentle and smooth, as one would expect from a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This works great year round and haven&#x27;t had cracked knuckles in the 3 years I have used this.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth and very moisturizing without being greasy or leaving residue.</li>
            <li>Now i have two amazing lotions that I just can&#x27;t get enough of.</li>
            <li>Very moisturing as well as fantastic smelling.</li>
            <li>Not greasy or oily, smells great and use everyday.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for everyday use.</li>
            <li>And, not only does it give me that softness on my face, it is amazing nurishment on my hands, arms, feet, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used alot of moisturizers and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I found this to be a nice \\&quot;In between\\&quot; compliment to the body butter as I do not use the Body Butter daily.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m always looking for the most natural products out there</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s \\&quot;fresh breezy floral, strawberry and banana\\&quot;, according to the Hempz company website.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell either.</li>
            <li>by far one of my favorite lotions out there.</li>
            <li>It is by far our favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Coating your skin with these synthetic&#x27;s become absorbed into the blood stream where they cause  oxidation of the cells and poison the body.</li>
            <li>and I actually used it and liked it that was like 2 years ago&lt;</li>
            <li>It just smells fresh</li>
            <li>WOW, I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Goes on non-sticky and fresh.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent, and your hands feel so soft and hydrated after using it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>So nice, I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li>Ok, the name may suggest &#x27;dirty hippie&#x27;, but I have yet to find a lotion that has this wonderful of a smell.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed by the skin</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive and most lotions burn when I put it on, this lotion does not.  </li>
            <li>Love the natural ingredients, the smell, texture, everything.</li>
            <li>I find myself just tickling my side at times because my skin is so incredibly soft that I love feeling it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it isn&#x27;t heavy, but the smell is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The only issue was that it was incredible greasy and left residue on the leather in my car and on desk.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how soft my skin feels after applying the lotion.</li>
            <li>for me, but as far as moisturizing it does an OK job.</li>
            <li>Powerfully feminine.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny</li>
            <li>I love this lotion but wish they would find a natural alternative to the propylene glycol.</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion it makes my hands soft.  </li>
            <li>marijuana has many healing attributes and nothing else had worked so far.  </li>
            <li>I had to dig my old one out of the garbage to be able to use it.</li>
            <li>i got this and am not crazy about the scent since i am a guy.</li>
            <li>My whole family loves it so much that I had to order 4 more bottles</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li>I think is smells like a fresh shower.</li>
            <li>rarely return products that I buy</li>
            <li>After that has been absorbed, I apply Hempz to my face and neck, and then I apply my make up.  </li>
            <li>I love the light scent and how it actually hydrates my skin w/o leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion by far.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a nice fragrance to carry with you all day.</li>
            <li>It actually keeps my hands nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it makes my skin feel extra smooth.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I had to get a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>I found it as an &amp;#34;aftersun&amp;#34; lotion 12 years ago when I was tanning for my wedding, it has a nice mild scent (I like the original over other scented versions)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily, is absorbed easily, and has a soft, sweet smell.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past, but just found it to pricey and luckily found them at a great price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had dermatitis problems with other lotions (especially if they have fragrance), so this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>Wife loves the Hempz and have purchased it i other outlets but have come to use Amazon regularly as they have the best price and service.  </li>
            <li>Having dry skin, with continued use I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>and it dissipates pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs pretty quickly and keeps your skin hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>First of all, the shipping speed is so quick.</li>
            <li>This lotion absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>it smells decent but works fast and gets that skin healthy again</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to everyone who wants a fresh feeling and clean smelling lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly, smelled clean (my bottle smelled weirdly bubble gummy).  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily, absorbs quickly and keeps my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Very  easy to apply,absorbs readily and leaves my skin feeling soft all  day.</li>
            <li>There are other lotions out there that will do as good of a job moisturizing without knocking you out with the fragrance.</li>
            <li>For me the scent is quite nice, but I&#x27;m not crazy about it because it does sometimes come off a little bit too strong for my taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff works really nice and goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t make a greasy mess on the hands.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it&#x27;s delivered to my door...</li>
            <li>The smell is just right, men and women can use it because it isn&#x27;t a flower smell.</li>
            <li>Right after a shower.  </li>
            <li>I use it right after I shower &amp; right b4</li>
            <li>SOAKS RIGHT IN!&lt;br /&gt;TRY</li>
            <li>I read lots of reviews on this lotion before i bought it, and everyone is right.</li>
            <li>Right now I can still smell the Hermessence Vetiver Tonka that I sprayed on three hours ago.  </li>
            <li>I use this lotion once in the morning, once after I tan and usually right before I go to sleep as well.</li>
            <li>break outs, no clogged pores and absorbes right into</li>
            <li>it came right on time.</li>
            <li>If you want to smell like fruity bubble gum then this may be the right product for you.  </li>
            <li>then no time of the day is the right occasion to smell like mother nature&#x27;s treasures of the land.  </li>
            <li>Not to greasy, just right.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s right there on the bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay scent, but after multiple uses it became too overwhelmingly sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li>Well, I was more than surprised when I first put Hempz on my skin.</li>
            <li>Its great for my skin and helps hold the little color I have in!</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews, I expected a much better quality product with a much better scent.  </li>
            <li>this is sweet like candy and highly mousterizing BUT absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting smooth skin</li>
            <li>the dry skin (which had begun to crack and bleed) was, for the most part cleared up!  </li>
            <li>I feel super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>And the scent is mild enough that perfume/cologne can be worn without too many over-powering scents.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave that thick film afterwards and it absorbs quickly and smells great.</li>
            <li>The best part is that I actually notice that my skin stayed moisturized and smooth hours after I have applied it, where as most body lotions just sit on the skin or wears off in an hour or so leaving your skin right where you started, dry and tight.</li>
            <li>A very lightweight, softening lotion with a very soft smell as well; nothing too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer that actually absorbed into my face without leaving a film on it .</li>
            <li>I should have done a better job reading because the &amp;#34;100% pure natural hemp seed oil&amp;#34; was below the &amp;#34;enriched with&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this every night right after i get out of the shower, and every morning i wake up with smooth, soft skin!</li>
            <li>original fragrance of fresh breezy floral, strawberry and banana creates an inviting aroma and entices your senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Shea Butter, Ginseng and natural extracts help calm, sooth and condition</li>
            <li>, I bought the large size for home and the travel size for traveling!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try this product and had high hopes for it..</li>
            <li>It feels great when you put it on, doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy, smells good but not girly so even a man could use it and not feel bad about it, and leaves your skin hydrated for hours.</li>
            <li>The real lotion has a mild banana scent to it.  </li>
            <li>This is surprising because most expensive natural lotions I see on store shelves don&#x27;t have such a great smell like burt&#x27;s bees and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lotion feels so nice on my dry skin and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The price was great this product is more expensive at spa&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s such a great deal</li>
            <li>The smell of this lotion is different for sure, but the moisturizing effects are hand over fist worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Given there are five of us, I think it lasted very well for such a popular product.</li>
            <li>The pricing was very, very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Found it on Amazon for a very reasonable price</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and I can use it all over my body.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is THC free and has other extracts/oils associated with healthy skin as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the citrus blossom but didn&#x27;t really like that smell as much as the original.</li>
            <li>good thing about this lotion is that a little goes a LOOOOOONG way.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this lotion, but this bottle seemed a little off and not as moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Its a good moisturizer but smells a little weird.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We are addicted to this FABULOUS lotion - it is smooth, creamy, and not greasy - nothing is better than this!</li>
            <li>highly recommended this hemp based lotion its smells like bubblegum and makes my wife skin so soft and adorable.</li>
            <li>But as we all know, little tanning salons are very expensive, so I was really happy when I was able to find it on Amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li>a real winner - smooth, non greasy application - leaves the skin instantly smooth and soft and absorbs as soon as you apply without leaving any smeary residue - highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I do plan on ordering the Tea Tree version of this lotion next time i run out though :)</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>My hands look younger and feel better now that I use this product .Great for my sensetive skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Whole family uses it!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion especially in the summertime.</li>
            <li>I believe the first time I tried it was @</li>
            <li>I think even generic brand lotions provide more moisture.  </li>
            <li>First off I got a bottle with a faulty pump.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different ones</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different products, and have had it get better</li>
            <li>I was really pleased with this purchase overall.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be buying more when I start running low.</li>
            <li>I use Hempz on my heels after each shower and now my heels are soft and smooth, and no cracked skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>item is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>It is so much better than anything you can buy at your local grocery store.</li>
            <li>when you first apply the lotion-</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Will definitely be getting more</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the way it makes my girlfriend&#x27;s body so soft.</li>
            <li>I first came across this lotion at my hair salon.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I ever want to go back to cheap lotion!</li>
            <li>Made me very itchy!</li>
            <li>I bought and used this for the first time and beginning tanning again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I finally did!</li>
            <li>I used to love the Body Shop&#x27;s Body Butter, but I have definitely switched.</li>
            <li>IT WAS EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Our daughter bought it first</li>
            <li>and it smelled great and was thick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but it&#x27;s just so heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>definitely will be getting more</li>
            <li>Overall I would definitely recommend this to someone who&#x27;s looking for a great moisturizer and isn&#x27;t sensitive to sweet scents.</li>
            <li>My daughter gave me my first one</li>
            <li>I bought the gallon size after my first 18oz ran out.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft, smooth, and good-smelling.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I am so glad he told me to try it out because I will never use a different lotion again!</li>
            <li>I love this smell, it smells like bubble gum, a year later it hasn&#x27;t clotted or changed in anyway</li>
            <li>This was my first hempz herbal moisturizer that I bought.</li>
            <li>I love several things about this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion...can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li>Also pretty oily, adding to the stripper appeal</li>
            <li>This was exactly what it says it is</li>
            <li>Love this product, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>If I apply the lotion at night, I wake up the next day and can still smell it for most of the morning.</li>
            <li>First -- to clarify something -- another reviewer said this is not a Hempz product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product but probably too thick for the pump.  </li>
            <li>,it is not greasy and smells great.you will notice the diffrence the first time you use it,give it a try and you will be hooked for life!!!this</li>
            <li>My skin is wonderfully soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to Hempz Lotion while visiting a tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I first found out about through my nail salon.</li>
            <li>I love the scent (banana-strawberry) as it is different from all the floral-scented lotions these days.</li>
            <li>The original formula smells great--like bananas--and moisturizes better than any other lotion I have tried.  </li>
            <li>What I first smelled was bananas followed by strawberries.  </li>
            <li>If you wear perfume or cologne, the smell of the moisturizer will most likely not interfere with the fragrance you are wearing.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>but it is the EXACT lotion as in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really a lotion kind of person.</li>
            <li>After trying so many body lotions, I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>just as much!</li>
            <li>will return the item and most likely reorder and hope for a better quality next time.</li>
            <li>Nothing like the REAL product, and their marketing gimmick (packaging may vary), is where they suck you in!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind as much if it was just another $5 drug store lotion, but it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li>at first</li>
            <li>Show some love for us male hemp</li>
            <li>Exactly how it was described, works wonders</li>
            <li>I have salon one and this one, The only difference is the salon charges a lot more for this</li>
            <li>I first found Hempz lotion while living in Nebraska.</li>
            <li>lotion is smooth, thick and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>First used this at a cousin&#x27;s house and came home wanting to get some myself.  </li>
            <li>Love this and will definitely get it again when it runs out, which will probably be soon.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this moisturizer and use it on my legs daily.  </li>
            <li>It dries in about a minute and moisturizes instantly :)</li>
            <li>This lotion works pretty well on my hands.</li>
            <li>I absolutely lovve this product!</li>
            <li>Saw this in a local tanning salon and fell in love with the smell.  </li>
            <li>They are also used as caged-bird feed, for it is a moderate source of nutrients for most birds.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Although it is not a horrible smell, I&#x27;m definitely not a fan of the scent.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but unlike many reviewers I actually like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>The bottle size is generous and the price was better than I&#x27;d seen at local stores.....</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overpowering, but definitely a lil fruity :)</li>
            <li>Use as a daily moisturizer , likes the way  it makes my skin feel better.</li>
            <li>I buy Hempz all the time and this product is the real thing!</li>
            <li>sure enough it looks like the picture.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it smelled too  feminine</li>
            <li>All Ingredients don&#x27;t sound natural, but I&#x27;m no expert.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li>Very fragranted!</li>
            <li>better luck with a completely different product line - Avalon Organics.</li>
            <li>this is EXACTLY the product and scent</li>
            <li>After going through the tons of bath and body works lotions gifted to me a while back</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good &#x27;all year round&#x27; lotion.</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of a strawberry banana smoothie I used to get from this awesome place that closed down.  </li>
            <li>once you get more than halfway done with the bottle, but turning the bottle upside down and unscrewing the pump still allows you to get every drop of this fabulous lotion.</li>
            <li>(they&#x27;re okay, but I find them to be very heavy of scent and somewhat greasy), I finally got around to getting the stuff I love most: Hempz.</li>
            <li>I know it already says in the description that it&#x27;s fruity, but nevertheless, I expected something much more mild given the color and packaging of this product.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, as everyone says and really has helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin hydrated and looking great, especially during dry weather.</li>
            <li>I had a few problems with dry skin and this lotion is the best I have ever used, problems are all&lt;br /&gt;gone.</li>
            <li>Just love the smell of this product, not perfumey, very natural and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have a bottle of the real thing right here</li>
            <li>I use a tanning bed and it seems to really moisturize my skin afterwards and also right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>i have only tried the orignal and as far as the scent goes, i love it!</li>
            <li>the other hand, it did leave my skin soft and supple.  :P</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and is extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ll never use any other kind of lotion again.</li>
            <li>it also is kind of greasy compared to other lotions,</li>
            <li>The fragrance of this one, which is the original one, is so soft and fresh...not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells so much, I use a different lotion for first application and use this after.</li>
            <li>works well, but has a kind of weird sweet (almost candy?) scent to it that most guys probably won&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or gross but if you are looking for products that won&#x27;t contribute flowery smells to your hands, there are other hemp oil products that better fit the bill.</li>
            <li>is hard to get absorbed, which is strange for a hemp product, they normally are the best at absorbing quickly.</li>
            <li>Was hoping this would of been a great lotion,somewhat organic and naturally light on the skin, I was wrong, its greasy like a pork sandwich and the scent is so overpowering that you cant escape it.</li>
            <li>Really makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>it actually gives the perfume a different smell and thats in a good way.  </li>
            <li>The best smell and such a thick, quality moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is much better than your hands feeling greasy and slimy for a long period of time, exactly the reason why using lotion can be a challenge.</li>
            <li>I used to sell this at my old work and it was always my favorite lotion because of the Hemp Oil being closest to the natural oils of your skin.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both it use daily, it is good for your entire body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just thick enough and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many lotions on the market, even the ones people swear by and which are geared towards/advertised as able to heal eczema or at least keep it at bay.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have found this for such a reasonable price on amazon</li>
            <li>It is doing a good job of moisturizing but is heavy and does not soak into skin very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion for soft feeling skin and a fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li>Seriously smells great and leaves my skin feeling super soft!</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews I thought I would try this lotion out.</li>
            <li>Great product, i got it with all my other shaving and hair care related products i ordered</li>
            <li>and this keeps me moisturized so long and on top of it-</li>
            <li>Well I have not ordered from Amazon, but I buy this lotion at a salon, and it smells nothing like bubblegum, so be aware that the real thing does not smell like that.  </li>
            <li>and we liked it so much there is a bottle at all our sinks!</li>
            <li>shipping was fast and the product was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>someone who really hates lotion, the scent of this makes it pretty bearable.</li>
            <li>Long time favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>They have several fragrances, but we like the fresh original.  </li>
            <li>In comparison to brands like Aveeno, Nivea etc., it is pretty reasonably priced for what it</li>
            <li>Regardless of the price, I pretty much swear by this lotion now.</li>
            <li>I love to take long bubble baths and read in the tub.</li>
            <li>thanks much to my sister in law for introducing me to it!</li>
            <li>more like a strange bannanaish scent...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I have used this lotion in the past &amp; always loved the results..</li>
            <li>Which would be really cute if I were younger but for a 46 year old I would rather smell fresh.  </li>
            <li>Far too sweet.  </li>
            <li>Rich without being greasy, has a great smell and just plain works for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This product is unreasonably highly rated and I&#x27;m starting to think many of the 5-star reviews are coming from hippies that appreciate the body odor masking scent.</li>
            <li>I have used many different moisturizers throughout the years but I always come back to Original Hempz.</li>
            <li>I just think that people should probably try a sample of it first or a smaller size before you go out and buy a huge bottle of it...</li>
            <li>original scent is my favorite  half the price than in the stores absorbs quickly  better than any other lotion</li>
            <li>I have really dry hands with more wrinkles than I think I should have at age 52.I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super sensitive to lotions but this lotion doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need more time, maybe my hands are just that dry, but I&#x27;m not overly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smelled like bubble gum and arrived with a hot pink pump and top..  </li>
            <li>The smell is lovely and it doesnt dry your skin out at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve gotten a knock off product on Amazon, guess I have to be more careful.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this product on my constantly dry hands.</li>
            <li>favorite for fighting dry winter weather in Wisconsin.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I have dry skin..who knows what I might do...or worse,,,an innocent house guest might use it and I might have to insist they take a shower to get it off..</li>
            <li>For me as a man, it&#x27;s NOT something I&#x27;ll use in the morning though, because it has such a strong scent.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that the smell is sooooo strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a strong scent of bubblegum.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a big bottle.</li>
            <li>I cannot use it as the scent is SO strong it actually makes me a bit queasy...</li>
            <li>I am male and this does not have a strong sent nor is the sent feminine in anyway.</li>
            <li>The sent is almost similar to bubble gum but not to strong.</li>
            <li>The strong fruity smell can give you a headache, it doesn&#x27;t feel as moisturizing as the Gold Bond Ultimate Softening Lotion with Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember the last time I heard a man getting compliments on how his passion fruit aroma is complementing his strong manhood.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint--the perfume is extremely strong</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really frugal about spending that many $$&#x27;s on a lotion but after putting a sample of it on my skin and then putting it back on the shelf after seeing the high pricetag,  </li>
            <li>you need is pure organic hemp oil</li>
            <li>And the fact that it was 100% pure organic hemp seed oil, had pomegranate extract, shea butter, vitmins A, C, E,</li>
            <li>This was a large bottle.</li>
            <li>It does wear off to a certain point throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and it still doesn&#x27;t lotion up certain spots.</li>
            <li>I am almost certain that the reviews are paid marketing result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The leaf is pure marketing and you shouldn&#x27;t pay salon cost.</li>
            <li>I certainly won&#x27;t be putting it on my body</li>
            <li>There was a large dent in the side of the bottle, so it doesnt stand well on my counter</li>
            <li>To a certain extent, that&#x27;s why I decided to try this stuff...</li>
            <li>This lotion makes my dry skin feel radiantly nice and soft - No sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>Dry skin becomes supple and no one I know has developed any kind of allergies.  </li>
            <li>I usually get it from my tanning salon and pay upwards of $20 a bottle, so its great that I was able to find it here for less!</li>
            <li>I was careful to choose the one labeled Original vs. the ones that mentioned fragrance, thinking to avoid the sweet scent, but</li>
            <li>Smells pretty decent.  </li>
            <li>, I love that it absorbs super fast and doesn&#x27;t re-appear after few hours.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and have tried many products to help with flaky skin.</li>
            <li>My wife had a little sampler of the stuff and just catching a whiff of it</li>
            <li>I use this year around and it keeps my hands and body nice and soft even during the winter when your skin can become very dry.</li>
            <li>Would have been much better off with an orderless product or at least something that does not smell like  a cheap fruity bubble gum.</li>
            <li>Daughters say its very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>We wash our hands often and this is very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t handle very scented lotions because I get hives</li>
            <li>It really does hydrate for 12-hours, so I apply it in the morning, and also in the evening after my shower and after 2-weeks</li>
            <li>: Smooth generously over entire body daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Smooth generously over entire body daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that this is the real solution for me.</li>
            <li>I really do like this lotion, but I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>It slides and glides on and gently caresses your skin.  </li>
            <li>really to \\&quot;manly\\</li>
            <li>Moisturizes very well&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really see any signs of depletion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, the color of my top is PINK ??</li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>The cream was much cheaper than buying it at a retail store.</li>
            <li>People really like the way my cheeks feel.</li>
            <li>It is very fragrant.  </li>
            <li>This seller shipped it immediately and the price was extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li>Although I do like the consistency of this lotion the fragrance is a bit much for me.</li>
            <li>Maybe too much for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very light.&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li>Really fruity.</li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>They heal much faster with this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>but it really does help.  </li>
            <li>and she loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Straight up smells like Pepto Bismol and isn&#x27;t very hydrating</li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t really stand the smell.</li>
            <li>I really, truly can&#x27;t stomach this smell anymore.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years hand and body, really like it...  </li>
            <li>It is not irritating to the skin like some lotions can be.</li>
            <li>My skin feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom&lt;br /&gt;but smells much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lotion ever for real though&lt;</li>
            <li>highly recommend Hempz products!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost too much.  </li>
            <li>It is too much if you&#x27;re not a perfume person.  </li>
            <li>but it moisturizes really well</li>
            <li>My dad has neuropathy which leaves his skin very ashy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>they have aches and arthritis and were very complementary about this product which is why i have purchased another two.</li>
            <li>Really helps keep a tan on you when you moisturize often.</li>
            <li>and well it smells like bubble gum it really does&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than the products sold at my airbrush shop and is cheaper to buy on amazon than at Ulta</li>
            <li>AND it really works.  </li>
            <li>Really works wonders on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Besides the fragrance there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much else to comment on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She told me how much she, and her husband like it on her.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>in all, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and you cant beat the price.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>This is not the real lotion.</li>
            <li>Thanks for 2 day delivery.  </li>
            <li>High ratings deserved!</li>
            <li>Thanks again guys.</li>
            <li>I have never broken out like that before with hempz.</li>
            <li>You really have to gauge how much you put on.</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this lotion as do her friends.</li>
            <li>It does really smell like *CANDY</li>
            <li>I used to use this years ago and found it for sooo much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Smells like bananas and really moisturizes</li>
            <li>It also moisturizes very well and as&lt;br /&gt;someone</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this lotion brings the colors on it alive again and it stays looking fresh for longer.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper to buy online then at the store.</li>
            <li>However, the pump is a real pain and broke after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much can be said about a skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>but I believe this one to be real.</li>
            <li>but it dosnt smell and feel like the the real stuff when compared to my Salon bought Hempz.</li>
            <li>Works really well to heal diabetic legs.  </li>
            <li>The shipping on this was also really fast.</li>
            <li>I have very ashy skin</li>
            <li>It is very not-overpowering</li>
            <li>This moisturizer absorbs into the skin very rapidly, creating a protective barrier that lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li>You can never put on too much.</li>
            <li>There are only two lotions that absorb and leave my skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>The scent is so yummy, very soothing and calming smell.</li>
            <li>My skin really misses it when I run out.</li>
            <li>Reordered for my wife as she absolutely loves this lotion.</li>
            <li>I really do like this lotion.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d much rather have a non greasy lotion that I have to reapply than one that is greasy.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Shipped out fast.</li>
            <li>Just as we hoped thanks.</li>
            <li>;  I tell myself, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s not like I need a metallic blue bottle just to feel secure in my masculinity&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It was too much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li>The scent of this lotion is nice and light, fades after a few hours, but the moisture definitely stays in your skin.</li>
            <li>Who *wants*</li>
            <li>I should have read through the reviews more carefully -</li>
            <li>And I thought this moisturizer fits my skin very well.</li>
            <li>Always purchase enough for free shipping and arrives on time every time.  </li>
            <li>I like the Hemp lotion, just not the scent so much....</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>I hope you like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Smells really yummy, almost too yummy.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this lotion!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Smell like the land of ooo from adventure time and is really gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Hemp seed oil is very beneficial for your skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product and so does everyone that comes over and tries it; I find my friends commenting how they like the feel and smell of it.  </li>
            <li>and this works really well.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really find a fault with it.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping from seller.</li>
            <li>stores are selling it for twice as much</li>
            <li>I was amazed, it really works, it lives up to it&#x27;s name, \\&quot;Moisturizer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, and this coming from a beauty product junky!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend this product as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>EM&#x27;!!!!!Thanks</li>
            <li>This lotion is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>the lotion really does what it says.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I just saw a whole display of Hempz products at Marshall&#x27;s on Thursday.</li>
            <li>Lotion arrived fast.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping-Great price-</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and hydrating...</li>
            <li>Smells nothing like the real thing.</li>
            <li>Really keep your skin from drying out.</li>
            <li>although I mostly use this on my legs so that&#x27;s not much of an issue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and the lotion</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>Item moisturizes very well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I believe that this is the real product based on what I read on Hempz website.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>I REALLY like the smell of this</li>
            <li>Avalon Organics Hand and Body Lotion, Aloe Unscented, soaks in well, is gentle on skin and smells like ALOE (which dissipates and doesn&#x27;t linger all day or infuse your clothes like HEMPZ does).</li>
            <li>Thanks for prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li>My nose has gotten more sensitive the last year</li>
            <li>thought that with the quality of the ingredients used that there would be a subtle pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Good lotion, but did not really like the smell associated, well thats a personal choice,</li>
            <li>I purchased this based only on the outstanding reviews here on Amazon and feel obligated to share my complete satisfaction with this product.</li>
            <li>Hempz Herbal Moisturizer covers nicely without a heavy film.  </li>
            <li>It felt good, not too greasy or thick but not really thin either.</li>
            <li>If you have extremely dry skin, I would recommend trying something a little more suitable.</li>
            <li>Not sure the operation as a whole is worthy of so many 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li>It (the scent) doesn&#x27;t last a super long time, but that&#x27;s OK with me because it means the lotion won&#x27;t conflict with any fragrance I was planning to wear (</li>
            <li>Hempz ingredient cured my psoriasis completely!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and has a light fresh scent that won&#x27;t clash with perfumes or other scents I wear.  </li>
            <li>I read that it is a &amp;#34;fresh breezy floral, strawberry and banana fragrance&amp;#34; but it fades so quickly after putting it on, that is barely noticeable it</li>
            <li>but it has a full on sweet flower fragrance like other lotions.</li>
            <li>The lotion is absorbed very quickly, it is very healthy with no harmful ingredients, made with hemp which is a big plus for me because i believe too many people get the wrong idea when they think of marijuana.</li>
            <li>Hydrates skin better than any other lotion.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other lotions out there</li>
            <li>Love this product unlike some of the other Hempz products.  </li>
            <li>This will last me a long time and it&#x27;s such a great price.</li>
            <li>Bought it originally as a &amp;#34;joke&amp;#34; product but decided to open up the container and use it.</li>
            <li>I get the original only</li>
            <li>my kids think it smells like gum or candy much better than other Hemp- based products.</li>
            <li>Was exceptionally pleased with the price as I had checked other sites.</li>
            <li>Most other lotions dont set in well, but not Hempz.  </li>
            <li>As other reviews have stated, the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>like so many other moisturizers I have tried.  </li>
            <li>What more can you say about lotion other</li>
            <li>This is not the same as the &#x27;original&#x27; product.</li>
            <li>I bought it originally to use after getting some sun outside, but now I use it all the time.</li>
            <li>When I tried going back to my original lotion (Aveeno Naturals, Unscented), I was itching at my dry-feeling skin by the afternoon.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs way better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>one of the many reasons I prefer Amazon.com to other retailers and e-tailers.</li>
            <li>I have the original as well, but feel like they should hold off on the scent, because sometimes we just don&#x27;t need such a fragrant lotion.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for the past 5 years and I just love it!</li>
            <li>Other people may be able to  smell it within a 15 - 20 foot radius.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the high praises on amazon.com, I certainly don&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li>Though the lotion had a sweet, fruity scent, the feeling of the product left much to be desired.</li>
            <li>and it gets dry easily.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing effects of this lotion is pretty good and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a particularly sticky film like many other lotions I have used.</li>
            <li>the mild, faint, natural scent of Hempz Original is so nice.  </li>
            <li>especially the retail price is pretty high for a body lotion, luckily amazon sells this for more than half the price.</li>
            <li>you have a bad nose or don&#x27;t mind strong scents, this is a great lotion.</li>
            <li>try many lotions and creams for dry sensitive hands with no luck even after appying over and over throught out the day.</li>
            <li>The texture of this moisturizer is thick and smooth; it absorbs easily into your skin, leaving it moist but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Like most, it is too strong and mixes poorly with anything else you may be wearing (after shave, cologne)..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used very expensive lotions; however,  Hempz Lotion is the best!  </li>
            <li>My wife loves the stuff and she&#x27;s got some pretty soft skin now.</li>
            <li>This lotion is MUCH thicker and moisturizes much more than any regular lotion that you are going to find at your local grocery store.</li>
            <li>far, I have yet to find a fault with this product and the first day of use</li>
            <li>Better than average body lotion.</li>
            <li>It smells like bubble gum, if you can get past the horrendous smell, I&#x27;d say it is an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, buy it here, but do check out the fragrances first somewhere.  </li>
            <li>May not really be bad, but it was a big miss from my expectation.</li>
            <li>A little oily when first applying but is soaks in quickly and leaves a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>As everyone stayed, absorbs quickly, very light yet moisturizing, leaves skin soft, expected a thicker constistancy lotion</li>
            <li>Hempz moisturizer is my favorite lotion, hands down.</li>
            <li>Hands down i love it and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best for daily moisturizing - if you have cracked feet or other cracked skin, try something a little on the Vaseline-type side.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes better than any other lotion i have ever had!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sent is light and fresh but a little fruity- banana and strawberry.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this moisturizer in Colorado!</li>
            <li>One product I do not want to live without!</li>
            <li>The smell is very fresh and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It works on my wife who as a redhead has very sensitive and has issues with many other products.</li>
            <li>The best part of this lotion, is it has completely cleared up my upper/back arm bumps (chicken skin).</li>
            <li>Not greases a all it soaks into the skin leaving you smoth and dry free.</li>
            <li>Not even my legs look dry anymore, and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>This lotion has made my skin less itchy by putting more moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li>I had skin cancer surgery on the top of my head three and one half years ago.</li>
            <li>To me it doesn&#x27;t smell at all like strawberries even though it says so on the bottle; I get more of the earthy shea butter with some slight fruitiness to it.</li>
            <li>Still a decent smell, but</li>
            <li>I will purchase again mainly for the scent.</li>
            <li>the lotion itself, it has decent staying power.  </li>
            <li>my skin (at an advanced age [male]) soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I loved the Green Tea Hempz, which is what prompted me to buy this, but I will definitely not be buying this &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; scent again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell</li>
            <li>They were selling this particular size and scent for like $20-25.</li>
            <li>Mild enough for your face, the results will amaze you...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised by all the positive reviews of this lotion.</li>
            <li>Big container is a good value and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Hempz is a mixture of cheap ingredients and my skin isnt dry, its normal.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>then made me understand why the price was so high.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get high, but I did get moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>While this had been highly rated here and elsewhere, I just couldn&#x27;t get over the scent.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it for those who go tanning as an after tanning lotion, it is known to help keep the tan and help preserve it longer.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;d be high as balls 24/7</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for guys looking for manly hygienic products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>highly recomment it to all people everywhere.</li>
            <li>and I HIGHLY recommend...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly moisturizing, but non greasy.</li>
            <li>The price is competitive and a high quality product.</li>
            <li>The bottle does not last me very long because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>When winter hit my hand tend to get dried out due to no humidity and washing with soap, so I have been using this product for 3 years and it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried, Eucerin, Cetaphil, and basically any other lotion that&#x27;s on the market, but none have made my skin feel so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>i have really dry skin on my hands and so far only this has proven to be effective</li>
            <li>I have used other lotions from Bath &amp; Body, and this is by far much better.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I thought that natural oils might be better than the synthetic junk found in other moisturizers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lotion is gentle enough for me yet strong enough for my husband!</li>
            <li>I go to sells the same exact bottle for $25, so this is a steal!</li>
            <li>But if you are not a fragrance person or sensitive to it, it is NOT for you!!</li>
            <li>They sell this at tanning salons - and a little more pricey.</li>
            <li>This does not mean &amp;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, but my husband complains that the smell is a little overwhelming for his taste.</li>
            <li>This lotion really relieves the dry skin quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Durability - This thing lasts a good 8 hours at the very least.</li>
            <li>smell, on the other hand, is incredibly strong.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep that baby soft skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin moisturized and soft and smelling very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE</li>
            <li>The smell and texture is ok, though it does keep your skin long lasting moisture.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin hydrated the entire day and with consistent use really rejuvenates your skin.</li>
            <li>I had used it a few years ago but had not been able to find it.</li>
            <li>The smell, although overwhelming initially, doesn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li>and this is pretty much the only lotion that solves this issue.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, it will definitely be my life long buy.</li>
            <li>It also moisturizers quite well for a lotion, whereas normally I prefer creams or butters.</li>
            <li>This definitely wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase price.  </li>
            <li>My favorite post tan and everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem like normal hemp lotion to me....</li>
            <li>Hempz is definitely worth the extra money!</li>
            <li>I finally ordered a replacement after a couple years through Amazon as it is much cheaper here then at the salon where I got my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>It makes me wonder if people leaving negative reviews own salons.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think Aveeno daily moisturizer does a far better job at keeping my skin moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was normal.  </li>
            <li>that my bf likes.&lt;br /&gt;overall, good, but not great.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this lotion at a spa and the price was $20, so being able to purchase it at almost half the prize at amazon.com allows me to use this lotion on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I also purchased a small size perfect for my small purse!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, but the pump broke half way through!</li>
            <li>I love this product so you can imagine my excitement when I checked Amazon &amp; found it for half the price!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff - especially with my really dry skin.</li>
            <li>I put it on and didn&#x27;t wash it off right away, and 10 minutes later I couldn&#x27;t feel that texture on my hands.</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion I use and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>The price is right and the product is above all others  I have used.</li>
            <li>Oh right, that&#x27;s the last thing.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li>Her pediatrician had recommended many lotions that had no effect on her skin, but the Hempz cleared the &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34;  and dried chafed areas completely!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because when something gets so popular somebody wants to buy the company and the next company starts cutting corners for more profit.</li>
            <li>The formula is very light weight, smooth and is not greasy nor does it leave any sort of uncomfortable residue after application.</li>
            <li>I have trouble believing a product is natural with that much scent to it, also it does not say all natural on the product so if you are looking for that you may look elsewhere or do more research into this.  </li>
            <li>Smells like sweet candy or something, but since it&#x27;s so strong, it&#x27;s not really pleasant.</li>
            <li>, I enjoy the smell but some other people do not.</li>
            <li>Like other reviews said, it made me feel like it&#x27;s a cheap lotion product.</li>
            <li>I live in Dallas Texas and the heat and humidity here can make you feel slimy when you wear lotion but not this one.</li>
            <li>New cologne.</li>
            <li>She loves it and cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I needed a new moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The smell evokes the feeling of the topics even though I&#x27;m in New England.</li>
            <li>and so I gave the new ones to family members for Christmas.</li>
            <li>The product was new, unopened and was as stated in the description.</li>
            <li>My daughter has suffered with eczema for years and #2 I live in the desert...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried this lotion, it is something to live by.</li>
            <li>I live in CO</li>
            <li>This is certainly not the original.  </li>
            <li>I had to mix it 1:3 with a fragrance free lotion just so I wouldn&#x27;t have to waste the whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We recently purchased Hempz Moisturizer which we had been purchasing locally and found it on Amazon at a lower price and with free shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the cheap stuff starting at a couple of bucks and worked up to the stuff that costs around $20 and none of them seemed to work, or if they worked it was short term, or</li>
            <li>unfortunately none worked.&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago I decided to go cruelty free and found that many of the products that I had been using were tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>This product makes fabulous Christmas Gifts tooour, for your female and male friends.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally super dry skin</li>
            <li>MY HEMPZ, MY LOVELY LITTLE HEMPZ!</li>
            <li>MY HEMPZ, MY LOVELY LITTLE HEMPZ!</li>
            <li>No other lotion really seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It feels very liquid at the first moment but it is very moisturizing than other lotions I tried, and the skin was not itchy anymore.</li>
            <li>and my hands are very soft.</li>
            <li>My husband is diabetic so his skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>It makes your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Smell is NOT overpowering, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to that.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling very soft afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is hydrating and makes your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I have even been using it on my face and my face is usually very sensitive to lotions....</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t even use perfume.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my face all the time and have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Right on the back it states that it is \\&quot;soft breezy floral, strawberry and banana\\</li>
            <li>With the first few whiffs I&#x27;ve had of it, it was actually kinda pleasant because I&#x27;m getting over a cold and the menthol kind of helped clear my nose, but after awhile, it feels like I rubbed on melted fruity/tropical Halls cough drops all over me.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a lotion that will moisturize your skin and leave it feeling soft then thiscould be for you!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used Lubriderm(non scent), and like some other lotions, but this one definitey feels a lot better and smells</li>
            <li>Historically I have purchased this lotion in my local tanning salon (for double the price), and love it.</li>
            <li>Saw this at a local spa for a much higher price.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing but not too thin or too thick and absorbs perfectly.</li>
            <li>was expecting an all natural hemp formulation .... not my preference at all!</li>
            <li>Overall a pretty rad product.</li>
            <li>but the one I received is exactly the same as the one in the store.  </li>
            <li>So many body moisturizers claim to not be greasy but they usually are.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand and plan to buy this lotion as well as other products in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately this is my first and last time using Hempz.</li>
            <li>and I saw this exact same product for sale there for over $20!</li>
            <li>While I had to wait about 24 hours for my lotion to thaw out due to the freezing temps in which it was left, I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also all natural, no parabens!</li>
            <li>I even took a tiny bit on my pinky and rubbed it into my wrist - the lotion at Marshall&#x27;s smelled and felt exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>But it absorbs into your skin and your skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>I was VERY pleasantly surprised at the price!  </li>
            <li>The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was a bit more pricey than the other hemp lotions i have found in stores.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft - not greasy or sticky at all!  </li>
            <li>Only thing is that we will need to buy a new one very quickly because she uses it every single day.</li>
            <li>this lotion feels rich and creamy without ever feeling greasy and you only have to use it once during the day.&lt;br /&gt;the scent is clean, simple, and won&#x27;t overpower other scents you may want to put on and it works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a fine moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and it gives the skin a glow and shine that last for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle is pretty heavy, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, but the smell is kind of weird and tends to linger.</li>
            <li>I live in the SW where daily lotion is a necessity, and I am absolutely hooked on this stuff</li>
            <li>my wife LOVES this lotion - initially purchased it from her hair-stylist for $21 and absolutely couldnt live without it.  </li>
            <li>you still have not found the right lotion for dry ,itchy skin..</li>
            <li>The big issue is that so far... this lotion works really, really well and leaves me with very soft skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have a little one with celiac and these lotions are gluten free...  </li>
            <li>it is mild enough for my sensitive skin, never stings or anything, it is thick, very moisturizing (not liquidy like some lotions!!!)  </li>
            <li>I have VERY dry skin, and this is the only moisturizer I have found that makes my face smooth and soft...</li>
            <li>It works really well to keep my skin soft, especially in a Wisconsin winter.  </li>
            <li>I have Psoriasis and after using this for about a week it started to clear up the flakes and cracks.</li>

            <li>This lotion totally surprised me.</li>
            <li>but they fixed the problem in a timely manner</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>all natural lotion.</li>
            <li>I am surprised that there are people out there  who like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have REALLY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I shook the lotion, i moved the pump in all possible directions -- i even unscrewed the whole thing and tested it pumping water (</li>
            <li>Alcohol is frequently used as a solvent.</li>
            <li>When your husband tells you how soft your skin feels, it must be working.</li>
            <li>This product leaves your skin soft and silky but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old</li>
            <li>my skin was so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this lotion does not irritate.</li>
            <li>I smelled like an old lady .. tried washing it off with soap - no luck..  </li>
            <li>My husband is 71 years old and gets the marks on his arms from years of sun damage.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a all natural moisturizer and thought this one will be it when reading the product description.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it moisturize really well</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re the type of person who&#x27;s sensitive to those types of scents you might not want to buy it.</li>
            <li>The skin feels so soft and protected after you apply it.</li>
            <li>one for myself and another for my cousin with sensitive skin to try it out.</li>
            <li>I use it for before and after tanning and after the shower and it leaves my skin feeling so soft</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll save at least 50% or more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the ingredient that makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves everything so soft, yet not greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>My 5-yr old got an allergic reaction to the hemp oil in this product.</li>
            <li>This is the big indicator to me that this isn&#x27;t a real hempz product.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion since the early 90&#x27;s when my mom took me to the tanning salon when I was a preteen</li>
            <li>Buy this lotion and have a soft wife like I do.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft, and not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It smells kinda musty and old to me once you put it on your skin.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this if you are looking for a real Hempz lotion or you will make the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Nearly gives me a headache.</li>
            <li>it is no harsh and helps with her eczema.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin so soft</li>
            <li>and I always get compliments of how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;No need to spend a fortune on moisturizers as they only hold in what you put in thru your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Soft feeling.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft all day.</li>
            <li>There is no heavy, oily feel to it at all.</li>
            <li>This lotion is made for a 7 year old girl.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants to stay younger looking.</li>
            <li>Also, I have sensitive skin, this passed the test.  </li>
            <li>also, it is made from all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>It has a soft fruity smell that my coworkers believe smells like bananas.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels silky and soft, even my children have noticed.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft all day.  </li>
            <li>Not just soft because you just applied the lotion but soft throughout the day</li>
            <li>my skin was so soft.</li>
            <li>I would much rather pay 10$ for this than the 20$ I have paid sometimes at the local salon.</li>
            <li>I think that the natural shea butter thats in this Hempz moisturizer is what makes it work wonders.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and keeps your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find a store near me that sells this lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly soft as well.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>you baby soft</li>
            <li>Natural scent.</li>
            <li>It reminded me of a cheap store brand lotion that didn&#x27;t provide all day hydration and would find my skin ashy in a few hours after application.</li>
            <li>I was completely out</li>
            <li>It is a medium weight lotion, one press of the dispenser is actually too much for me.</li>
            <li>Smell is very fruity and lingers - Big Time.</li>
            <li>Hands feel so soft</li>
            <li>like others say, it&#x27;s not greasy and it rubs in immediately, leaving your skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and always paid at least $20/bottle in tanning salons.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really an item worth returning, so I&#x27;m rating 2 stars because it came in a bottle with \\&quot;Hempz\\&quot; and it&#x27;s lotion</li>
            <li>Also the lotion is not greasy or heavy feeling, I tried this from a friend awhile back and just HAD to have my own finally.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too sweet, and doesn&#x27;t last long, but the moisture does.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a birthday gift a few years back, and when I ran out I wanted to get some more, until I found out</li>
            <li>I hate oily lotion and this stuff is perfect</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too thick or thin, and it gives you a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>So when I was exposed to dry climate, my skin started becoming very very dry.  </li>
            <li>Cannabis is so far down in the ingredient list that it&#x27;s pretty much non-existent.</li>
            <li>It is a great lotion though, sinks right into your skin and isn&#x27;t the least bit heavy.  </li>
            <li>The original is a little on the fruity side</li>
            <li>It just sinks right into my skin.</li>
            <li>this stuff sinks right in.  </li>
            <li>At first I really did not understand how people can rave so much about a lotion, I mean its just lotion after all - all lotion is pretty much the same as long as it moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>Helps our dry skin SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>It smells very fresh and natural without being overpowering or grossly saccharine like some other herbal/floral scented lotions.</li>
            <li>You can easily expect it to last through a typical work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost</li>
            <li>Perhaps that will smell less strong, but this definitely does not match the scent of the Hempz cream in the jar.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Hemp Seed Oil is one of nature&#x27;s richest sources of Essential Fatty Acids and Key Amino Acids containing natural proteins, vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals vital for healthy skin</li>
            <li>Note, the forms of alcohol used in cosmetics are not necessarily those used in alcoholic drinks, and may be much more dangerous.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty heavy though, so if you don&#x27;t like scents you should really avoid this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did, as long as I remember to apply this lotion everyday</li>
            <li>I bought a small sample of this lotion in my local pharmacy and fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes well without being greasy and has a nice, if a little bit odd, scent.</li>
            <li>Has this little sweet scent to it.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion since it had such high reviews.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and we are on our second bottle.</li>
            <li>See a difference with first application - haven&#x27;t had long enough for any long term critique but if the first weeks are any indication, it&#x27;s  </li>
            <li>so they are not aware of the high quality of Hempz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very dissapointed and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m against using marijuana for medicinal purposes, but because the giant hemp leaf on the front seemed too much like a gimmick/marketing ploy to the point where it would either be a useless novelty item or it would have to be an amazing product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could use this lotion over and over all day long, but you really don&#x27;t need to it stays moisturized.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing effect lasts whole day long.</li>
            <li>and once you use it a few times, it actually moistens your hands so you don&#x27;t need to keep using it multiple times a day :)</li>
            <li>I have tried a large number of moisturizers because I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I had to use Benadryl to calm it down.  </li>
            <li>The smell, consistency and results are exactly the same which means to me , I got the real Hempz at half the price that the salons charge.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little thick, but it smells so good.  </li>
            <li>As a guy, I&#x27;d like for it to have less of a frangrancy smell, but it does the trick way better than any other lotion that I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>The Shea Butter, Ginseng and natural extracts help calm, soothe without the red irritation that i used to get with other lotions.</li>
            <li>live in the humid South and would definitely recommend Hempz.</li>
            <li>My tattoo artist actually recommended it for using on new tatts, so I&#x27;ve been doing that as well.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years--it works really well for me, my skin is on the dry side, even my daughter uses it</li>
            <li>It really helps with the dry skin problem.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really do much for my dry skin</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, and since moving to the desert over 10 years ago, it has been a real challenge for me to keep moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It may be too soon to see if it really help with my dry skin</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I used a similar product made by a local vender that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this lotion because it does everything a lotion is supposed to do and has a fresh, slightly &amp;#34;peachy&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>I hate to rate a moisturizer based on the scent, but when it&#x27;s this strong, overwhelming, and stubborn, it completely overshadows the moisturizing effects of the lotion since I don&#x27;t even want to be near it anymore.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am prone to eczema, and this not only does not irritate my skin, but helps keep eczema at bay.  </li>
            <li>left my skin feeling very soft and moursurized, I&#x27;m in the sun alot</li>
            <li>Been using it 2008 and no other cream will do for me.</li>
            <li>Having been used to the scent of Jergens, Nivea and a ton of other mainstream moisturizers, I was taken aback the first time I used Hempz.</li>
            <li>but im not sure if mine is an original or a knock off,</li>
            <li>The vey first time I tried it the pump seemed to break as stated in some of the other reviews</li>
            <li>The only thing I do not love is how strong the scent is</li>
            <li>I have used this product previously and it is always the right choice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hempz Original Herbal Body Moisturizer is enriched with 100% Pure Natural Hemp Seed Oil and blended with natural extracts to provide dramatic skin hydration and nourishment to help improve the overall health and condition of skin.</li>
            <li>It is a rich source of essential fatty acids and amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals.  </li>
            <li>High sensitivity to that ingredient after using it a long time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that bad, but not that great</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and it seems, at least to me, to have a cool(temp) texture that helps it soothe irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>and you generally do end up liking it.</li>
            <li>It definitely keeps my skin soft for aleast 24 hrs</li>
            <li>After shaving I have been putting this on my face, It really is not greasy and dries really fast.</li>
            <li>In short, the smell is the antithesis of what the product is supposed to represent: natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had multiple people just stop and go \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>I contacted the maker of this product concerning the fragrance used in the lotion was either natural or synthetic, I never got a response back which has me assuming it&#x27;s synthetic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have looked at several salons and the price is extremely reasonable and the same lotion as sold elsewhere for double the price.</li>
            <li>so apparently she likes it too.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I can&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li>It actually makes the skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>ingredients lists don&#x27;t match and Hempz only has two direct to consumer venues that they use.</li>
            <li>but then I unscrewed the pump completely off, put it back on</li>
            <li>First of all I have spent tons of money on lotions for several reasons..</li>
            <li>I also ordered from Green Web, as did the highest useful comment stated.</li>
            <li>Love the lotion, however the pump was broken, and some of the product oozed out....</li>
            <li>I was wrong and am amazed at how popular this lotion is.</li>
            <li>I considered returning it, but with the costs and the trouble involved, it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>Smell was subtle; not too strong.</li>
            <li>The bottom portion was bubble wrapped but the top was not and the pump was broken on arrival.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little bit of the strawberry banana smell that it claims to have right on the bottle for those who are complaining of the smell...</li>
            <li>The shipping was done quickly, and i actually received the product a little dented.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this lotion for dry skin, and problem skin.</li>
            <li>who suffers from dry skin, this product is great.</li>
            <li>a few hours after application, even when putting my arm right up to my daughter&#x27;s nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some other scents from this line at Sephora and they all have exactly the same feel in hands as lotion, so I believe it is legit, just look out for what seller you&#x27;re buying from</li>
            <li>Definitely not authentic hempz which has a mild scent and nothing like bubble gum.</li>
            <li>it does seem to absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an excessive amount of grease</li>
            <li>the cheap and strong sense make me so sick even headache.</li>
            <li>My skin stays hydrated for much longer than any other lotion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about other reviewers claiming it&#x27;s a knock-off, but my order was the real deal.</li>
            <li>Once you start using Hempz, you&#x27;ll realize how much your other lotions have been letting you down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft likely due to the dankest of dank extracts used in this particular lotion.</li>
            <li>Live in AZ where the climate is soooo dry.</li>
            <li>On the other hand that is about the only positive thing I have to say about it.  </li>
            <li>and yes, Amazon does have a lot of third parties peddling counterfeit products, which is why I suggest either buying direct from the company (in this case Hempz) or finding out what the approved vendors are for this company&#x27;s products and buying only from those vendors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your skin like some lotions.</li>
            <li>it smells very artificial to me and TOO strong!!!  </li>
            <li>and now I am a little sick of the smell, but it was awesome while it lasted.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li>It has a very strong, overpowering odor of fake strawberries.  </li>
            <li>I thought the because of the low price that I was going to get a watered down version but got the real deal!</li>
            <li>My skin is always so dry, I was surprised to have found one that works!  </li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t really see a big difference from other lotions (nivea,vaseline,dove)</li>
            <li>The smell is very relaxing and its different from other lotions.</li>
            <li>I have used a prescription lotion, but this apparently works equally well for my eczema.</li>
            <li>Starting to get into the Hempz line and have NO regrets.</li>
            <li>however the feeling of the lotion is really, too densed, thick, i don&#x27;t want to put on my body as much amount as I used to put on for regular body lotions.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado, which has a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>it smells like old floral (perhaps from the jasmine mentioned in the ingredients very far down), but for a lotion that you use all over your body it permeates everything including adding the scent to your clothing, as well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, per se, but it is very strong and lingers the whole day.</li>
            <li>Smelled great, the texture was slightly less thick than usual, but i figured the thickness would vary with each batch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty religious about lotion everyday though.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very large and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product especially for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far my knuckles have improved but still get dry if I don&#x27;t reapply regularly.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the lotion is a bit on the thinner side and dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Good for anyone that suffers from dry skin.</li>
            <li>We have used this lotion in the past and been absolutely thrilled with it, but they either changed the product as suggested in other posts or this is NOT original Hempz product.  </li>
            <li>However the pump was broken but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is a little much for me.</li>
            <li>However it has a very strong sickening sweet scent to it.</li>

            <li> Ladies love the smell :)</li>

            <li> I buy this every year, I love the smell</li>
            <li> and I love how it makes my skin feel after I have been in the sun.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hydrating and smells great.</li>
            <li> Smells great (sorta sweet and herbally), does not feel oily, and quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this since all the reviews are so great and so far so good.</li>
            <li> It also has a very unique scent that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> very nice smell and very silky.</li>
            <li> a shame that this seller is ruining the reputation of HEMPZ since the real scent is actually very nice.</li>
            <li> Let me first just say that the lotion does smell amazing, by far the best smelling lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Very original product.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and moisturized and smells sooooo good!</li>
            <li> got the original kind</li>
            <li> For it to be original but so fragrant kind of threw me off.</li>
            <li> It is thinner lotion, not as creamy &amp; rich as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> We love the original scent!</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> Just a nice clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great product, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a great lotion.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this for men or women and it is at a great price compard to the stores around here.</li>
            <li> It moisturizers really well and smells great but has too strong of a scent and makes my eczema act up</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I got a free sample from a salon and love it so much I was happy to find it on amozon.</li>
            <li> it moisturized my skin pretty good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll help you keep your tan for a long time, and it has the best smell out of anything in this world.</li>
            <li> &gt; The price is also pretty good on amazon.</li>
            <li> Kind of like bubble gum - fruity and sweet.  </li>
            <li> I like the herbal smell and good for daily moisture, might more good for combination skin</li>
            <li> Loved it so much that I bought the gallon refill jug!</li>
            <li> I loved finding it for much cheaper and the same great stuff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THE ORIGINAL HEMPTZ LOTION</li>
            <li> GREAT light feeling lotion and the scent was fresh and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li> On the bright side, it does seem to moisturize really well, and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This product matches my requirements and is excellent for moisturizing my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Hempz cream in the jar before that I received as a gift, so I thought I was safe in ordering the lotion version as the description mentions nothing about the extremely strong, floral scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells nice, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> Really pleasant tactile experience, very absorbent.</li>
            <li> This, plus the wonderfully creamy texture, make this cream a delight for anyone suffering with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay by its too strong for me.</li>
            <li> It does not work as well on severely dry skin as I had hoped it would but still a great lotion!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff and the smell is not to strong.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and smells nice.</li>
            <li> love the scent, light, but lovely.  </li>
            <li> Nice soothing scent, great for back rubs!</li>
            <li> This not only makes your skin feel smooth but smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s also kind of fun to see the faces on my coworkers when they realize that the lotion on my desk has a pot leaf on the label :) )</li>
            <li> It has such a great scent and really does keep your skin hydrated, super great product!</li>
            <li> I am not one to like a real floral smell either, but prefer a more clean, fresh scent, so I will keep looking for a lotion that has both a good smell and is a good body lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thinner than most lotions, but still fine by me.</li>
            <li> The best product for dry skin!  </li>
            <li> I love the way it absorbs quickly!  </li>
            <li> The cost is the best I have seen as I have looked around many other stores and websites for this product.</li>
            <li> I love the strawberry banana scent of the origional lotion but the other scents are great too!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it smells great, and makes my skin super soft!!!</li>
            <li> but it has a very strong and sweet smell.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells amazing and is really moisturizing!!</li>
            <li> LOVE the fragrance, which is refreshing and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic, nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Overall very good product</li>
            <li> Its great , helps my psoriasis and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on the scent of it, which I would describe as almost a light banana smell.</li>
            <li> Love the Fragrance of the Moisturizer and skin gets really smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since switched to Kiss My Face Fragrance Free which I like a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the lotion and it definately makes your skin smooth and silky but my pump broke off in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this product and smells fantastic</li>
            <li> Best money I&#x27;ve spent on lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, makes my skin feels smooth</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Olay body lotions for quite time which makes me moistured with light scents, and I guess I&#x27;m okay with that lotion.</li>
            <li> it smell great and makes my skin so soft even after tanning all the time i even use it on my daughters skin</li>
            <li> I have said this before, Hempz is the best lotion I have ever used and will continue as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> My sinuses filled up almost immediately, giving me a headache that lasted all night, even after I was finally able to wash it</li>
            <li> My skin was outrageously healthy looking and felt smooth to touch.</li>
            <li> Love how smooth it makes my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, leaves my skin so soft and has an amazing smell to it!</li>
            <li> It smells good, without smelling too much.</li>
            <li> but I loved it so much</li>
            <li> The smell is great, the price is not bad at all, and it makes your skin feel very moist.</li>
            <li> Therefore I much rather have a good quality lotion.</li>
            <li> Hempz seems to do the trick and seems to be just as good, but I still prefer the cetaphil cream for my really rough/dry wintery days.</li>
            <li> Product came fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li> smells so good and really moisturizes without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Good scent for summer (very banana-y).</li>
            <li> Got what I ordered at a good price, much lower than retail.  </li>
            <li> Great lotion for dry skin with a nice scent that is not over powering.  </li>
            <li> This product smells very clean and light, applys smoothly and stays with you most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Since oils tend to hold in heat, I originally purchased this lotion just for my legs, preferring to just deal with the dryness over most of my body because I don&#x27;t handle heat well.</li>
            <li> Such a good lotion!</li>
            <li> my original bottle has a cucumber smell, this stuff also has a more of a greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> I was originally introduced to this line of lotion by a nail technician, and fell in love with the feel and the scent.</li>
            <li> The Hempz Herbal Moisturizer is a unique lotion that has many perks for the skin.</li>
            <li> Love the original scent</li>
            <li> I thought original would have been more of a lotion smell with no scent.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products to see how awesome they are.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the original lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have tried endless numbers of skin moisturizers and this is the best I have ever found.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product based on all the reviews saying that the smell is pleasant and they are very picky about smells.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and nice and looks so smooth and clean and rich.</li>
            <li> so I can get to it easily.</li>
            <li> The label describes the perfume as cucumber and jasmine, and I can detect that in a very mild way.</li>
            <li> and it absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li> We all loved the smell and its great for her dried out hands.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to spread on the skin and feels supremely luxurious.</li>
            <li> It is simply so easy to rub that overuse is inevitable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t tacky or gummy and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> One reviewer mentioned that she didn&#x27;t like the scent, but as it wasn&#x27;t specific and so many others wrote about how great this is--I ordered it.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes and can be easily applied to your skin---</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week now and my skin is velvety smooth, it feels incredible.</li>

            <li> I keep this on my desk at work  for easy use.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and the price was perfect, because this is not cheap lotion.  </li>

            <li> It has a nice, light scent and it is quickly absorbed and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Glad I finally found a GREAT lotion that does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The lotion soaks in very quickly and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The contents are filled with a CHEAP bubblegum scented lotion as many of the reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Scent is really strong.</li>
            <li> Strong smell for me, gave it to my wife.</li>
            <li> This lotion was way to strong for my senses.</li>
            <li> I like putting the moisturizer on before I go to bed don&#x27;t like strong smells as they distract me and keep me</li>
            <li> The Material Safety Data Sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney</li>
            <li> Remove the strong scent and make a guy scent, and I will order a bunch along with 5 stars.</li>

            <li> It was wrapped with plenty of bubble wrap which left it in great condition.</li>
            <li> The bottle says \\&quot;fragrance of fresh breezy floral, strawberry and banana,\\&quot; but we think it smells more like candy.</li>
            <li> Great product I buy from here several times a year</li>
            <li> lotion is lightly scented and smells</li>
            <li> There were some comments regarding counterfeit product on the market, but this vendor appears to have sent me the real article, with each bottle nicely shrink-wrapped and packaged.  </li>

            <li> This product is a cheap knock off...</li>

            <li> Absorbs nice and fast.  </li>

            <li> and it rubs into your skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion as my face lotion everyday and it has a perfect balance for my skin, its moisturizing but not oily.</li>
            <li> And with amazon when I buy a couple things the shipping is completely free.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a light banana-ish, melon-y smell and moisturizes without leaving a greasy, slippery feeling.</li>
            <li> I  have a student grab my arm just to enjoy the scent</li>
            <li> smooth to my body .IS</li>
            <li> YOU WILL ENJOY..</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t say that lightly.</li>
            <li> Smells, however, like cheap candy (banana bubblegum?).</li>
            <li> I enjoy products made from hemp but this smells cheap</li>
            <li> It smells really good and it makes my hands feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I like Hempz as far as being a good moisturizing lotion, what I do not like is the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much, it smells good and really works</li>
            <li> Nice light texture that really soaks in.</li>
            <li> tried a lot of body lotions and this one is one of the good one that has natural contents.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> its smells so good and makes my skin so soft .</li>
            <li> I buy this lotion because it smells so good (and I&#x27;m fairly sensitive to smells).</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> It seems like a good product so far i just prefer unscented</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily and dries fast and has such a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell pleasant and moisturize the skin in a not-greasy kind of way, but it really has been helping my stretch marks!</li>
            <li> The reason why I got this was the price was right for me to be able to qualify for free shipping</li>
            <li> It is pretty strong fruity, floral smell (more feminine).</li>
            <li> And I love that that the scent doesn&#x27;t wear off right away.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and the price is WAY better than at the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why this product has so many positive reviews!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, clean and warm, but totally unisex.</li>
            <li> When the lotion came on the package the plastic cover over the top of the lotion was messed with and some of the lotion had spelt in the box but other than that I was happy with the price and smell of lotion.</li>
            <li> scent is too sweet and strong</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t stand the BANANA fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> Gave me the confidence to return my Amazon order, which is a first for me, and will be going out Monday!!</li>
            <li> I very rarely write reviews for anything</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy, light pleasant fragrance and most importantly, soothing for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing and works great for dry hands, worth the price for sure, I highly recommend using it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and I love the subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Familiar scent, smooth on my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> Sure, at first this might look like a nice, reasonably gender neutral, hemp-infused lotion.  </li>
            <li> But it really does provide a wonderful, light moisture that lasts quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> This lotion smells amazing, it makes your skin super soft, and was really cheap to buy!</li>
            <li> It smells so good and leaves my skin soft for a full day.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this again from this seller because the lotion and value is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion so much!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the smell of the original.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> original scent smells like bananas,</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good general moisturizer for a man.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still my favorite, great smell (not too much and neutral enough for a man) conditions skin well and absorbs without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> and I was SO glad to find it on Amazon for so much cheaper than in the store!</li>
            <li> ,it is better than any store brand lotion ive tried for a higher price.</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to see that I could get it on amazon.  </li>
            <li> I use nothing else since discovering Hempz Original....</li>
            <li> I was familiar with the product as I use it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order Hempz Herbal Body Moisturizer (Original) because I thought it would smell like hemp.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in original scent and I am not the biggest fan of it.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure this lotion will do</li>
            <li> Excited to try it, I put some on my hands as I was leaving the house.  </li>
            <li> First, the lotion was leaking out of the top when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> Lesson learned, buy a product you are familiar with.  </li>
            <li> oh my gosh what a steal compared to what i was originally buying it at.</li>
            <li> and I love how it can moisturise for 12hrs straight!</li>
            <li> THE ORIGINAL SCENT AS WELL AS</li>
            <li> Not even close to the original.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a smell in the world like that of Hempz original.</li>
            <li> I had originally gotten hempz lotion from the person who cuts my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought HEMPZ Original Body Lotion.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Original scent 17oz bottle which has a strawberry banana scent.</li>
            <li> I went on the original website and they said that the smell was floral and banana.</li>
            <li> Not the original scent.</li>
            <li> I suspect that most of the reviewers here are first time buyers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent is light and not feminine and it&#x27;s not greasy and very effective on dry skin and even sunburn.</li>
            <li> I get dry skin from time to time and this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> This  product is lightly scented and absorbs quickly, without a greasy or slippery feel.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> On top of all that, it makes my skin look and feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> But, lo and behold, 5 months later, I think this is by far one of the best moisturizers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This product is great for moisturizing your dry skin.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t enough words in this world to describe how much I love this lotion, honestly, there isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for dry and chapped skin, on hands, legs or wherever.  </li>
            <li> Try the pomegranate hempz lotion for a more feminine scent or if you desire a significant other to kiss your body,, scent is good and taste is ok ;)</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve come to my senses and learned to love my natural skin tone, I still love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and has a light, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Really does a great job of keeping your hands soft.  </li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> a lot more such a great price shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> should excel in, it does have one really good redeeming quality: Its not even remotely greasy.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite lotion!</li>
            <li> The original scent is a bit sweet for me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> By far my favorite lotion out there!</li>
            <li> this stuff is great for dry skin!</li>
            <li> After using many other products over the years, discovered Hempz and am delighted with the results..</li>
            <li> Great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Even though this formula is somewhat light it absorbs very quickly and still provides excellent long lasting</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong and no matter how good the lotion is, we just can&#x27;t tolerate having it on for very long.</li>
            <li> It does a very good job moisturizing, even in the dead of winter.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and has a unique smell.</li>
            <li> I love this produt, very highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li> The quality of the lotion is very much like the cheap lotions that the nail salons use and buy in bulk for a cheap price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be great as a gift (even though the packaging is not that attractive), as an everyday lotion, and as aromatherapy, especially after a bath.</li>
            <li> It smells great, not really like ganja.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, recieved it quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> Its amazing how soft and velvety this lotion is.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and my hands are so soft because of this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been a Cetaphil user for years and it worked great at first but over time, it wasn&#x27;t enough for the winter months.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this lotion but the fragrance is overwhelmingly sweet, so much that I would have passed on this product if I had known what to expect.</li>
            <li> Its so soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> To me it smells like sweet tarts.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel nice and soft with no oily stickiness.</li>
            <li> but most just don&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> ....once you get under the shower you can tell your skin was covered with something soft and moisturizing...smells nice...</li>
            <li> This lotion is thick, non-greasy and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> : the smell of this lotion is a sort of sweet smell- if you consider this feminine, and if you avoid seemingly feminine products at all costs, avoid this.</li>
            <li> Sweet Pea, maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sweet even.</li>
            <li> Hempz herbal lotion dries quick and makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li> If your a guy you may not like the sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Smells soooo good and the moisture seems to last all day.</li>
            <li> , they turn out too sweet and unnatural smelling (like in this case)?</li>
            <li> After reading the ingredients, I decided to purchase this with the hopes of having a more gentle fragrance for at the office.</li>
            <li> There are multiple uses for it, it is good for all of us, so lets try and educate ourselves before we jump to conclusions.</li>
            <li> makes my skin nice and soft after the shower.</li>
            <li> I have used it before and when i saw it for such a good price i had to purchase it</li>
            <li> i personally have not used it, but the elders have said good things.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li> and I have always loved it and wanted to buy a big bottle.</li>
            <li> I could never make myself pay the full price before</li>
            <li> I paid the full price at the tanning salon at $23 and see that it&#x27;s a lot cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to order more.</li>
            <li> it definitely works buts not as good as say gold bond or cerave.</li>
            <li> The scent smells sweet like candy.</li>
            <li> Cool product.</li>
            <li> Sweet but not too sweet.</li>
            <li> My absolute FAVORITE lotion....</li>
            <li> used to buy this at Ulta, but it is much cheaper on Amazon :)</li>
            <li> Packaging was kind of sketchy with clear evidence of having been refilled.</li>
            <li> I really thought the smell would be a lot better than what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can purchase it here on Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It also shipped really fast :)</li>
            <li> I compared the lotion I received with the full price lotion I purchased at a salon.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had several people compliment me on how good I smell when I&#x27;ve used this lotion.</li>
            <li> Overall a good body lotion, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t ask for more in a lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells nice, leaves my skin soft and moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good price compared to stores such as Ulta which is selling it for $23 a pop.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad for the rest of the body though.</li>
            <li> i love the smell it is very girly and sweet.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and leaves my skin super soft and hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it&#x27;s mild and smells very tropical.</li>
            <li> love this lotion, makes skin very soft and smooth</li>
            <li> This has a great smell, light and clean, and works wonders for my skin year round.</li>
            <li> My order was easy to place, and the product was exactly as they described.  </li>
            <li> It does have a sweet smell but that fades quickly and it does not bother me anyway.</li>
            <li> This product smells really good, it is smooth and lightweight, however my hands tend to be super dry and this product does not give y hands the moisture they need</li>
            <li> It has a pretty strong scent and reminds me of bananas.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works well, stays on a long time and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> Very nice pump delivery system, works even when the bottle is practically empty</li>
            <li> love this lotion and its very cheap on amazon compared to its regular price in stores</li>
            <li> I tend to like fresh, clean scents as opposed to fruity or sweet smelling things</li>
            <li> So I decided why not give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;First off the scent for the original formula is described as a fresh breezy floral with strawberry and banana.</li>
            <li> Any other product that should control fly aways</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion, due to the use of hemp which is rich but easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I originally found it while searching for a good after-tan moisturizer, cuz my skin was getting dry and itchy after I used a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best lotion ever!</li>
            <li> I only have really dry skin in between my knuckles and my hand itself and used to use Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair which was the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, I use it almost everyday it smells great and helps to eliminate my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I am serious it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mild smell.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> It does have a scent, but that scent dissipates rather quickly.</li>
            <li> But it does absorbs quickly and it is a lightweight formula.</li>
            <li> Has an interesting smell but it is definitely one of the better lotions I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Was wary of it not being authentic, but it was perfect.</li>
            <li> I love it and will buy more as I need it in the future</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is probably the best lotion I&#x27;ve used in the last ten years...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overpowering super fruity smell either.</li>
            <li> SUPER TRANSACTION....</li>
            <li> Target&#x27;s cocoa butter one does a better job of actually covering but takes more to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 3 bottles arrived quickly and well packaged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs in your skin quickly &amp; does not leave you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> absorbs quick.</li>
            <li> Great daily moisturizer, especially on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more :)</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild, never overpowering.</li>
            <li> PRICE AND QUICK DELIVERY</li>
            <li> formula itself was what really suprised me, it is 100% paraben free, gluten free and vegan.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It also has a mild scent.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> No greasy feeling, it does absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> If you choose a highly-rated seller you are more likely to get a genuine product!</li>
            <li> Amazon produced my lotion as ordered quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> Soaks in quick.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> so I luckily got two of these as gifts for Christmas and hopefully won&#x27;t have to buy any anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Super moisture with yummy smell.</li>
            <li> This lotion is super moisturizing and smells like honey suckle.  </li>
            <li> I loved the clean and fresh, but not overpowering scent of the original hempz lotion, and upon first putting this lotion on I thought it smelled the same...</li>
            <li> I feel so excited to have found the right product.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re the type of person who doesn&#x27;t like a highly fragrant lotion then this may not be for you, but the quality of the lotion is phenomenal...</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past at drug stores, but the price was very good on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not a strong smell (I dislike overwhelming scents) but a really good smell.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product not only as a moisturizer,  but it does keep pesky gnats away as a friend told me it would.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use my normal moisturizers I buy specifically for my face :)</li>
            <li> it has a great smell to it but the moisturizing part of it is just average.</li>
            <li> Also offered at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Love the hempz loition but the bottle didn&#x27;t come wrapped like they normally do and the pump was cracked and it had leaked out a bit.</li>
            <li> It shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> ;-) Enjoy....</li>
            <li> The original is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It honestly smells better then any other lotion that I have tried.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I can&#x27;t use it (especially as a full body lotion) because of the smell.</li>
            <li> lotion is fairly \\&quot;wet\\&quot; and you will feel as if your fingers are dripping with water unless you rub continuously for a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really good the next day after using it, and that&#x27;s honestly the only result I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It is the absolute best lotion for extra dry skin! :)</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is easy to apply, easy on the skin, and nearly scent-free.  </li>
            <li> It would not raise up so that i can push it down and have the lotion come out (NO HOMO LOL).</li>
            <li> This product does have hemp seed oil and shea butter in it (which typically does not agree with me) but my skin happens to be doing great this hot Virginia summer with this light soothing lotion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very pleased with this item, and as a regular tanner it really helped my skin &amp; tan!!</li>
            <li> This may be my new addiction... :)</li>
            <li> Its my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Would be great if they could have less unnatural substances in it or come up with a 100% organic line.</li>
            <li> lotion itself is very moisturizing and the pump bottle makes it convenient and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and I still love it as much now as I did when I first started.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and find it works better than most moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It has a strong fragrance that I wasn&#x27;t really expecting.</li>
            <li> Its really good for people who have severe dry skin and/or eczema.</li>
            <li> It was really good for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not greasy, not watery, and not too thick - it smells nicely without being overpowering and feels great - highly recommended</li>
            <li> My ultimate favorite lotion of all time!</li>
            <li> a bit pricey compared to other products, but a nice addition!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Be aware, there are no returns once you purchase!  </li>
            <li> will definitely be stocking up on this lovely stuff!</li>
            <li> My teenage sons even love it!</li>
            <li> I am purchasing my 3rd bottle today, I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> and I will be back to buy more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great in the winter, especially if you live in a cold/dry area like I do.</li>
            <li> Lotion smells great but not too smelly and really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Clearly this is not an issue for others, but if you don&#x27;t care for the strong smell ordniarily found in cheap lotions, you probably won&#x27;t like this either.</li>
            <li> I freely admit I am a moisturizer snob, I&#x27;ve tried 1000s of different ones from drugstore to department store and this one is hands down the best.</li>
            <li> Product smells AMAZING (like a banana and strawberry smoothie), moisturizes really  well, and leaves skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, however im not sure this is the original that i was looking for .</li>
            <li> a 100% pure chemical free lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though the smell is a little off, the lotion still works great</li>
            <li> Very thick and smells great!</li>
            <li> The scent is a little girly but the good thing is its light and fades by the time I leave the house.</li>
            <li> Love this product and have been a frequent user/buyer ever since the first trial!</li>
            <li> This is a fairly large bottle for the price, so to me very worth it</li>
            <li> help calm, sooth and condition</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and the only lotion I will use.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for year round use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only fault for this product is the synthetic fragrance, if it weren&#x27;t for that this would be an amazing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whole body is smooth after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> but the skin does feel gentle and smooth, as one would expect from a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This works great year round and haven&#x27;t had cracked knuckles in the 3 years I have used this.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth and very moisturizing without being greasy or leaving residue.</li>
            <li> Now i have two amazing lotions that I just can&#x27;t get enough of.</li>
            <li> Very moisturing as well as fantastic smelling.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or oily, smells great and use everyday.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for everyday use.</li>
            <li> And, not only does it give me that softness on my face, it is amazing nurishment on my hands, arms, feet, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used alot of moisturizers and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a nice \\&quot;In between\\&quot; compliment to the body butter as I do not use the Body Butter daily.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m always looking for the most natural products out there</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s \\&quot;fresh breezy floral, strawberry and banana\\&quot;, according to the Hempz company website.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell either.</li>
            <li> by far one of my favorite lotions out there.</li>
            <li> It is by far our favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Coating your skin with these synthetic&#x27;s become absorbed into the blood stream where they cause  oxidation of the cells and poison the body.</li>
            <li> and I actually used it and liked it that was like 2 years ago&lt;</li>
            <li> It just smells fresh</li>
            <li> WOW, I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Goes on non-sticky and fresh.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, and your hands feel so soft and hydrated after using it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> So nice, I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> Ok, the name may suggest &#x27;dirty hippie&#x27;, but I have yet to find a lotion that has this wonderful of a smell.</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed by the skin</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive and most lotions burn when I put it on, this lotion does not.  </li>
            <li> Love the natural ingredients, the smell, texture, everything.</li>
            <li> I find myself just tickling my side at times because my skin is so incredibly soft that I love feeling it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it isn&#x27;t heavy, but the smell is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The only issue was that it was incredible greasy and left residue on the leather in my car and on desk.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and how soft my skin feels after applying the lotion.</li>
            <li> for me, but as far as moisturizing it does an OK job.</li>
            <li> Powerfully feminine.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny</li>
            <li> I love this lotion but wish they would find a natural alternative to the propylene glycol.</li>
            <li> It is by far my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion it makes my hands soft.  </li>
            <li> marijuana has many healing attributes and nothing else had worked so far.  </li>
            <li> I had to dig my old one out of the garbage to be able to use it.</li>
            <li> i got this and am not crazy about the scent since i am a guy.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves it so much that I had to order 4 more bottles</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li> I think is smells like a fresh shower.</li>
            <li> rarely return products that I buy</li>
            <li> After that has been absorbed, I apply Hempz to my face and neck, and then I apply my make up.  </li>
            <li> I love the light scent and how it actually hydrates my skin w/o leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion by far.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a nice fragrance to carry with you all day.</li>
            <li> It actually keeps my hands nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it makes my skin feel extra smooth.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, I had to get a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I found it as an &amp;#34;aftersun&amp;#34; lotion 12 years ago when I was tanning for my wedding, it has a nice mild scent (I like the original over other scented versions)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily, is absorbed easily, and has a soft, sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past, but just found it to pricey and luckily found them at a great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dermatitis problems with other lotions (especially if they have fragrance), so this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> Wife loves the Hempz and have purchased it i other outlets but have come to use Amazon regularly as they have the best price and service.  </li>
            <li> Having dry skin, with continued use I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> and it dissipates pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs pretty quickly and keeps your skin hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> First of all, the shipping speed is so quick.</li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> it smells decent but works fast and gets that skin healthy again</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone who wants a fresh feeling and clean smelling lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly, smelled clean (my bottle smelled weirdly bubble gummy).  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily, absorbs quickly and keeps my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> Very  easy to apply,absorbs readily and leaves my skin feeling soft all  day.</li>
            <li> There are other lotions out there that will do as good of a job moisturizing without knocking you out with the fragrance.</li>
            <li> For me the scent is quite nice, but I&#x27;m not crazy about it because it does sometimes come off a little bit too strong for my taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff works really nice and goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t make a greasy mess on the hands.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it&#x27;s delivered to my door...</li>
            <li> The smell is just right, men and women can use it because it isn&#x27;t a flower smell.</li>
            <li> Right after a shower.  </li>
            <li> I use it right after I shower &amp; right b4</li>
            <li> SOAKS RIGHT IN!&lt;br /&gt;TRY</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews on this lotion before i bought it, and everyone is right.</li>
            <li> Right now I can still smell the Hermessence Vetiver Tonka that I sprayed on three hours ago.  </li>
            <li> I use this lotion once in the morning, once after I tan and usually right before I go to sleep as well.</li>
            <li> break outs, no clogged pores and absorbes right into</li>
            <li> it came right on time.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like fruity bubble gum then this may be the right product for you.  </li>
            <li> then no time of the day is the right occasion to smell like mother nature&#x27;s treasures of the land.  </li>
            <li> Not to greasy, just right.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s right there on the bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay scent, but after multiple uses it became too overwhelmingly sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was more than surprised when I first put Hempz on my skin.</li>
            <li> Its great for my skin and helps hold the little color I have in!</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I expected a much better quality product with a much better scent.  </li>
            <li> this is sweet like candy and highly mousterizing BUT absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting smooth skin</li>
            <li> the dry skin (which had begun to crack and bleed) was, for the most part cleared up!  </li>
            <li> I feel super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> And the scent is mild enough that perfume/cologne can be worn without too many over-powering scents.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave that thick film afterwards and it absorbs quickly and smells great.</li>
            <li> The best part is that I actually notice that my skin stayed moisturized and smooth hours after I have applied it, where as most body lotions just sit on the skin or wears off in an hour or so leaving your skin right where you started, dry and tight.</li>
            <li> A very lightweight, softening lotion with a very soft smell as well; nothing too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer that actually absorbed into my face without leaving a film on it .</li>
            <li> I should have done a better job reading because the &amp;#34;100% pure natural hemp seed oil&amp;#34; was below the &amp;#34;enriched with&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this every night right after i get out of the shower, and every morning i wake up with smooth, soft skin!</li>
            <li> original fragrance of fresh breezy floral, strawberry and banana creates an inviting aroma and entices your senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Shea Butter, Ginseng and natural extracts help calm, sooth and condition</li>
            <li> , I bought the large size for home and the travel size for traveling!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try this product and had high hopes for it..</li>
            <li> It feels great when you put it on, doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy, smells good but not girly so even a man could use it and not feel bad about it, and leaves your skin hydrated for hours.</li>
            <li> The real lotion has a mild banana scent to it.  </li>
            <li> This is surprising because most expensive natural lotions I see on store shelves don&#x27;t have such a great smell like burt&#x27;s bees and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion feels so nice on my dry skin and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hydrating and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The price was great this product is more expensive at spa&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s such a great deal</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is different for sure, but the moisturizing effects are hand over fist worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Given there are five of us, I think it lasted very well for such a popular product.</li>
            <li> The pricing was very, very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Found it on Amazon for a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and I can use it all over my body.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is THC free and has other extracts/oils associated with healthy skin as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the citrus blossom but didn&#x27;t really like that smell as much as the original.</li>
            <li> good thing about this lotion is that a little goes a LOOOOOONG way.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this lotion, but this bottle seemed a little off and not as moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Its a good moisturizer but smells a little weird.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We are addicted to this FABULOUS lotion - it is smooth, creamy, and not greasy - nothing is better than this!</li>
            <li> highly recommended this hemp based lotion its smells like bubblegum and makes my wife skin so soft and adorable.</li>
            <li> But as we all know, little tanning salons are very expensive, so I was really happy when I was able to find it on Amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li> a real winner - smooth, non greasy application - leaves the skin instantly smooth and soft and absorbs as soon as you apply without leaving any smeary residue - highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I do plan on ordering the Tea Tree version of this lotion next time i run out though :)</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> My hands look younger and feel better now that I use this product .Great for my sensetive skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Whole family uses it!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion especially in the summertime.</li>
            <li> I believe the first time I tried it was @</li>
            <li> I think even generic brand lotions provide more moisture.  </li>
            <li> First off I got a bottle with a faulty pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different ones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different products, and have had it get better</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with this purchase overall.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be buying more when I start running low.</li>
            <li> I use Hempz on my heels after each shower and now my heels are soft and smooth, and no cracked skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> item is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> It is so much better than anything you can buy at your local grocery store.</li>
            <li> when you first apply the lotion-</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Will definitely be getting more</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the way it makes my girlfriend&#x27;s body so soft.</li>
            <li> I first came across this lotion at my hair salon.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I ever want to go back to cheap lotion!</li>
            <li> Made me very itchy!</li>
            <li> I bought and used this for the first time and beginning tanning again.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I finally did!</li>
            <li> I used to love the Body Shop&#x27;s Body Butter, but I have definitely switched.</li>
            <li> IT WAS EXACTLY</li>
            <li> Our daughter bought it first</li>
            <li> and it smelled great and was thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but it&#x27;s just so heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> definitely will be getting more</li>
            <li> Overall I would definitely recommend this to someone who&#x27;s looking for a great moisturizer and isn&#x27;t sensitive to sweet scents.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me my first one</li>
            <li> I bought the gallon size after my first 18oz ran out.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft, smooth, and good-smelling.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am so glad he told me to try it out because I will never use a different lotion again!</li>
            <li> I love this smell, it smells like bubble gum, a year later it hasn&#x27;t clotted or changed in anyway</li>
            <li> This was my first hempz herbal moisturizer that I bought.</li>
            <li> I love several things about this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion...can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> Also pretty oily, adding to the stripper appeal</li>
            <li> This was exactly what it says it is</li>
            <li> Love this product, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> If I apply the lotion at night, I wake up the next day and can still smell it for most of the morning.</li>
            <li> First -- to clarify something -- another reviewer said this is not a Hempz product.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product but probably too thick for the pump.  </li>
            <li> ,it is not greasy and smells great.you will notice the diffrence the first time you use it,give it a try and you will be hooked for life!!!this</li>
            <li> My skin is wonderfully soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Hempz Lotion while visiting a tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I first found out about through my nail salon.</li>
            <li> I love the scent (banana-strawberry) as it is different from all the floral-scented lotions these days.</li>
            <li> The original formula smells great--like bananas--and moisturizes better than any other lotion I have tried.  </li>
            <li> What I first smelled was bananas followed by strawberries.  </li>
            <li> If you wear perfume or cologne, the smell of the moisturizer will most likely not interfere with the fragrance you are wearing.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> but it is the EXACT lotion as in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a lotion kind of person.</li>
            <li> After trying so many body lotions, I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> just as much!</li>
            <li> will return the item and most likely reorder and hope for a better quality next time.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the REAL product, and their marketing gimmick (packaging may vary), is where they suck you in!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind as much if it was just another $5 drug store lotion, but it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li> at first</li>
            <li> Show some love for us male hemp</li>
            <li> Exactly how it was described, works wonders</li>
            <li> I have salon one and this one, The only difference is the salon charges a lot more for this</li>
            <li> I first found Hempz lotion while living in Nebraska.</li>
            <li> lotion is smooth, thick and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> First used this at a cousin&#x27;s house and came home wanting to get some myself.  </li>
            <li> Love this and will definitely get it again when it runs out, which will probably be soon.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this moisturizer and use it on my legs daily.  </li>
            <li> It dries in about a minute and moisturizes instantly :)</li>
            <li> This lotion works pretty well on my hands.</li>
            <li> I absolutely lovve this product!</li>
            <li> Saw this in a local tanning salon and fell in love with the smell.  </li>
            <li> They are also used as caged-bird feed, for it is a moderate source of nutrients for most birds.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Although it is not a horrible smell, I&#x27;m definitely not a fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but unlike many reviewers I actually like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> The bottle size is generous and the price was better than I&#x27;d seen at local stores.....</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overpowering, but definitely a lil fruity :)</li>
            <li> Use as a daily moisturizer , likes the way  it makes my skin feel better.</li>
            <li> I buy Hempz all the time and this product is the real thing!</li>
            <li> sure enough it looks like the picture.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it smelled too  feminine</li>
            <li> All Ingredients don&#x27;t sound natural, but I&#x27;m no expert.</li>
            <li> Will purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li> Very fragranted!</li>
            <li> better luck with a completely different product line - Avalon Organics.</li>
            <li> this is EXACTLY the product and scent</li>
            <li> After going through the tons of bath and body works lotions gifted to me a while back</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good &#x27;all year round&#x27; lotion.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of a strawberry banana smoothie I used to get from this awesome place that closed down.  </li>
            <li> once you get more than halfway done with the bottle, but turning the bottle upside down and unscrewing the pump still allows you to get every drop of this fabulous lotion.</li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re okay, but I find them to be very heavy of scent and somewhat greasy), I finally got around to getting the stuff I love most: Hempz.</li>
            <li> I know it already says in the description that it&#x27;s fruity, but nevertheless, I expected something much more mild given the color and packaging of this product.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, as everyone says and really has helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin hydrated and looking great, especially during dry weather.</li>
            <li> I had a few problems with dry skin and this lotion is the best I have ever used, problems are all&lt;br /&gt;gone.</li>
            <li> Just love the smell of this product, not perfumey, very natural and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have a bottle of the real thing right here</li>
            <li> I use a tanning bed and it seems to really moisturize my skin afterwards and also right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> i have only tried the orignal and as far as the scent goes, i love it!</li>
            <li> the other hand, it did leave my skin soft and supple.  :P</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and is extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ll never use any other kind of lotion again.</li>
            <li> it also is kind of greasy compared to other lotions,</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this one, which is the original one, is so soft and fresh...not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells so much, I use a different lotion for first application and use this after.</li>
            <li> works well, but has a kind of weird sweet (almost candy?) scent to it that most guys probably won&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or gross but if you are looking for products that won&#x27;t contribute flowery smells to your hands, there are other hemp oil products that better fit the bill.</li>
            <li> is hard to get absorbed, which is strange for a hemp product, they normally are the best at absorbing quickly.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would of been a great lotion,somewhat organic and naturally light on the skin, I was wrong, its greasy like a pork sandwich and the scent is so overpowering that you cant escape it.</li>
            <li> Really makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> it actually gives the perfume a different smell and thats in a good way.  </li>
            <li> The best smell and such a thick, quality moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This is much better than your hands feeling greasy and slimy for a long period of time, exactly the reason why using lotion can be a challenge.</li>
            <li> I used to sell this at my old work and it was always my favorite lotion because of the Hemp Oil being closest to the natural oils of your skin.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both it use daily, it is good for your entire body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just thick enough and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lotions on the market, even the ones people swear by and which are geared towards/advertised as able to heal eczema or at least keep it at bay.  </li>
            <li> Glad to have found this for such a reasonable price on amazon</li>
            <li> It is doing a good job of moisturizing but is heavy and does not soak into skin very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion for soft feeling skin and a fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li> Seriously smells great and leaves my skin feeling super soft!</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I thought I would try this lotion out.</li>
            <li> Great product, i got it with all my other shaving and hair care related products i ordered</li>
            <li> and this keeps me moisturized so long and on top of it-</li>
            <li> Well I have not ordered from Amazon, but I buy this lotion at a salon, and it smells nothing like bubblegum, so be aware that the real thing does not smell like that.  </li>
            <li> and we liked it so much there is a bottle at all our sinks!</li>
            <li> shipping was fast and the product was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> someone who really hates lotion, the scent of this makes it pretty bearable.</li>
            <li> Long time favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> They have several fragrances, but we like the fresh original.  </li>
            <li> In comparison to brands like Aveeno, Nivea etc., it is pretty reasonably priced for what it</li>
            <li> Regardless of the price, I pretty much swear by this lotion now.</li>
            <li> I love to take long bubble baths and read in the tub.</li>
            <li> thanks much to my sister in law for introducing me to it!</li>
            <li> more like a strange bannanaish scent...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I have used this lotion in the past &amp; always loved the results..</li>
            <li> Which would be really cute if I were younger but for a 46 year old I would rather smell fresh.  </li>
            <li> Far too sweet.  </li>
            <li> Rich without being greasy, has a great smell and just plain works for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product is unreasonably highly rated and I&#x27;m starting to think many of the 5-star reviews are coming from hippies that appreciate the body odor masking scent.</li>
            <li> I have used many different moisturizers throughout the years but I always come back to Original Hempz.</li>
            <li> I just think that people should probably try a sample of it first or a smaller size before you go out and buy a huge bottle of it...</li>
            <li> original scent is my favorite  half the price than in the stores absorbs quickly  better than any other lotion</li>
            <li> I have really dry hands with more wrinkles than I think I should have at age 52.I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super sensitive to lotions but this lotion doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need more time, maybe my hands are just that dry, but I&#x27;m not overly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smelled like bubble gum and arrived with a hot pink pump and top..  </li>
            <li> The smell is lovely and it doesnt dry your skin out at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve gotten a knock off product on Amazon, guess I have to be more careful.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product on my constantly dry hands.</li>
            <li> favorite for fighting dry winter weather in Wisconsin.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I have dry skin..who knows what I might do...or worse,,,an innocent house guest might use it and I might have to insist they take a shower to get it off..</li>
            <li> For me as a man, it&#x27;s NOT something I&#x27;ll use in the morning though, because it has such a strong scent.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the smell is sooooo strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a strong scent of bubblegum.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a big bottle.</li>
            <li> I cannot use it as the scent is SO strong it actually makes me a bit queasy...</li>
            <li> I am male and this does not have a strong sent nor is the sent feminine in anyway.</li>
            <li> The sent is almost similar to bubble gum but not to strong.</li>
            <li> The strong fruity smell can give you a headache, it doesn&#x27;t feel as moisturizing as the Gold Bond Ultimate Softening Lotion with Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember the last time I heard a man getting compliments on how his passion fruit aroma is complementing his strong manhood.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint--the perfume is extremely strong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really frugal about spending that many $$&#x27;s on a lotion but after putting a sample of it on my skin and then putting it back on the shelf after seeing the high pricetag,  </li>
            <li> you need is pure organic hemp oil</li>
            <li> And the fact that it was 100% pure organic hemp seed oil, had pomegranate extract, shea butter, vitmins A, C, E,</li>
            <li> This was a large bottle.</li>
            <li> It does wear off to a certain point throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and it still doesn&#x27;t lotion up certain spots.</li>
            <li> I am almost certain that the reviews are paid marketing result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The leaf is pure marketing and you shouldn&#x27;t pay salon cost.</li>
            <li> I certainly won&#x27;t be putting it on my body</li>
            <li> There was a large dent in the side of the bottle, so it doesnt stand well on my counter</li>
            <li> To a certain extent, that&#x27;s why I decided to try this stuff...</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my dry skin feel radiantly nice and soft - No sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> Dry skin becomes supple and no one I know has developed any kind of allergies.  </li>
            <li> I usually get it from my tanning salon and pay upwards of $20 a bottle, so its great that I was able to find it here for less!</li>
            <li> I was careful to choose the one labeled Original vs. the ones that mentioned fragrance, thinking to avoid the sweet scent, but</li>
            <li> Smells pretty decent.  </li>
            <li> , I love that it absorbs super fast and doesn&#x27;t re-appear after few hours.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and have tried many products to help with flaky skin.</li>
            <li> My wife had a little sampler of the stuff and just catching a whiff of it</li>
            <li> I use this year around and it keeps my hands and body nice and soft even during the winter when your skin can become very dry.</li>
            <li> Would have been much better off with an orderless product or at least something that does not smell like  a cheap fruity bubble gum.</li>
            <li> Daughters say its very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> We wash our hands often and this is very hydrating.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t handle very scented lotions because I get hives</li>
            <li> It really does hydrate for 12-hours, so I apply it in the morning, and also in the evening after my shower and after 2-weeks</li>
            <li> : Smooth generously over entire body daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Smooth generously over entire body daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that this is the real solution for me.</li>
            <li> I really do like this lotion, but I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> It slides and glides on and gently caresses your skin.  </li>
            <li> really to \\&quot;manly\\</li>
            <li> Moisturizes very well&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really see any signs of depletion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, the color of my top is PINK ??</li>
            <li> I really do.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> The cream was much cheaper than buying it at a retail store.</li>
            <li> People really like the way my cheeks feel.</li>
            <li> It is very fragrant.  </li>
            <li> This seller shipped it immediately and the price was extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li> Although I do like the consistency of this lotion the fragrance is a bit much for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe too much for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very light.&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li> Really fruity.</li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> They heal much faster with this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> but it really does help.  </li>
            <li> and she loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Straight up smells like Pepto Bismol and isn&#x27;t very hydrating</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t really stand the smell.</li>
            <li> I really, truly can&#x27;t stomach this smell anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years hand and body, really like it...  </li>
            <li> It is not irritating to the skin like some lotions can be.</li>
            <li> My skin feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom&lt;br /&gt;but smells much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lotion ever for real though&lt;</li>
            <li> highly recommend Hempz products!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost too much.  </li>
            <li> It is too much if you&#x27;re not a perfume person.  </li>
            <li> but it moisturizes really well</li>
            <li> My dad has neuropathy which leaves his skin very ashy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> they have aches and arthritis and were very complementary about this product which is why i have purchased another two.</li>
            <li> Really helps keep a tan on you when you moisturize often.</li>
            <li> and well it smells like bubble gum it really does&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than the products sold at my airbrush shop and is cheaper to buy on amazon than at Ulta</li>
            <li> AND it really works.  </li>
            <li> Really works wonders on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Besides the fragrance there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much else to comment on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She told me how much she, and her husband like it on her.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> in all, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and you cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> This is not the real lotion.</li>
            <li> Thanks for 2 day delivery.  </li>
            <li> High ratings deserved!</li>
            <li> Thanks again guys.</li>
            <li> I have never broken out like that before with hempz.</li>
            <li> You really have to gauge how much you put on.</li>
            <li> Too much</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this lotion as do her friends.</li>
            <li> It does really smell like *CANDY</li>
            <li> I used to use this years ago and found it for sooo much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells like bananas and really moisturizes</li>
            <li> It also moisturizes very well and as&lt;br /&gt;someone</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this lotion brings the colors on it alive again and it stays looking fresh for longer.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper to buy online then at the store.</li>
            <li> However, the pump is a real pain and broke after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much can be said about a skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> but I believe this one to be real.</li>
            <li> but it dosnt smell and feel like the the real stuff when compared to my Salon bought Hempz.</li>
            <li> Works really well to heal diabetic legs.  </li>
            <li> The shipping on this was also really fast.</li>
            <li> I have very ashy skin</li>
            <li> It is very not-overpowering</li>
            <li> This moisturizer absorbs into the skin very rapidly, creating a protective barrier that lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li> You can never put on too much.</li>
            <li> There are only two lotions that absorb and leave my skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> The scent is so yummy, very soothing and calming smell.</li>
            <li> My skin really misses it when I run out.</li>
            <li> Reordered for my wife as she absolutely loves this lotion.</li>
            <li> I really do like this lotion.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d much rather have a non greasy lotion that I have to reapply than one that is greasy.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> Shipped out fast.</li>
            <li> Just as we hoped thanks.</li>
            <li> ;  I tell myself, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s not like I need a metallic blue bottle just to feel secure in my masculinity&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It was too much.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> The scent of this lotion is nice and light, fades after a few hours, but the moisture definitely stays in your skin.</li>
            <li> Who *wants*</li>
            <li> I should have read through the reviews more carefully -</li>
            <li> And I thought this moisturizer fits my skin very well.</li>
            <li> Always purchase enough for free shipping and arrives on time every time.  </li>
            <li> I like the Hemp lotion, just not the scent so much....</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> I hope you like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Smells really yummy, almost too yummy.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this lotion!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Smell like the land of ooo from adventure time and is really gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Hemp seed oil is very beneficial for your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product and so does everyone that comes over and tries it; I find my friends commenting how they like the feel and smell of it.  </li>
            <li> and this works really well.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really find a fault with it.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping from seller.</li>
            <li> stores are selling it for twice as much</li>
            <li> I was amazed, it really works, it lives up to it&#x27;s name, \\&quot;Moisturizer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, and this coming from a beauty product junky!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really recommend this product as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> EM&#x27;!!!!!Thanks</li>
            <li> This lotion is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> the lotion really does what it says.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I just saw a whole display of Hempz products at Marshall&#x27;s on Thursday.</li>
            <li> Lotion arrived fast.  </li>
            <li> Fast Shipping-Great price-</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing and hydrating...</li>
            <li> Smells nothing like the real thing.</li>
            <li> Really keep your skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> although I mostly use this on my legs so that&#x27;s not much of an issue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the lotion</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Item moisturizes very well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I believe that this is the real product based on what I read on Hempz website.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> I REALLY like the smell of this</li>
            <li> Avalon Organics Hand and Body Lotion, Aloe Unscented, soaks in well, is gentle on skin and smells like ALOE (which dissipates and doesn&#x27;t linger all day or infuse your clothes like HEMPZ does).</li>
            <li> Thanks for prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li> My nose has gotten more sensitive the last year</li>
            <li> thought that with the quality of the ingredients used that there would be a subtle pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Good lotion, but did not really like the smell associated, well thats a personal choice,</li>
            <li> I purchased this based only on the outstanding reviews here on Amazon and feel obligated to share my complete satisfaction with this product.</li>
            <li> Hempz Herbal Moisturizer covers nicely without a heavy film.  </li>
            <li> It felt good, not too greasy or thick but not really thin either.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely dry skin, I would recommend trying something a little more suitable.</li>
            <li> Not sure the operation as a whole is worthy of so many 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> It (the scent) doesn&#x27;t last a super long time, but that&#x27;s OK with me because it means the lotion won&#x27;t conflict with any fragrance I was planning to wear (</li>
            <li> Hempz ingredient cured my psoriasis completely!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and has a light fresh scent that won&#x27;t clash with perfumes or other scents I wear.  </li>
            <li> I read that it is a &amp;#34;fresh breezy floral, strawberry and banana fragrance&amp;#34; but it fades so quickly after putting it on, that is barely noticeable it</li>
            <li> but it has a full on sweet flower fragrance like other lotions.</li>
            <li> The lotion is absorbed very quickly, it is very healthy with no harmful ingredients, made with hemp which is a big plus for me because i believe too many people get the wrong idea when they think of marijuana.</li>
            <li> Hydrates skin better than any other lotion.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other lotions out there</li>
            <li> Love this product unlike some of the other Hempz products.  </li>
            <li> This will last me a long time and it&#x27;s such a great price.</li>
            <li> Bought it originally as a &amp;#34;joke&amp;#34; product but decided to open up the container and use it.</li>
            <li> I get the original only</li>
            <li> my kids think it smells like gum or candy much better than other Hemp- based products.</li>
            <li> Was exceptionally pleased with the price as I had checked other sites.</li>
            <li> Most other lotions dont set in well, but not Hempz.  </li>
            <li> As other reviews have stated, the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> like so many other moisturizers I have tried.  </li>
            <li> What more can you say about lotion other</li>
            <li> This is not the same as the &#x27;original&#x27; product.</li>
            <li> I bought it originally to use after getting some sun outside, but now I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> When I tried going back to my original lotion (Aveeno Naturals, Unscented), I was itching at my dry-feeling skin by the afternoon.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs way better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> one of the many reasons I prefer Amazon.com to other retailers and e-tailers.</li>
            <li> I have the original as well, but feel like they should hold off on the scent, because sometimes we just don&#x27;t need such a fragrant lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for the past 5 years and I just love it!</li>
            <li> Other people may be able to  smell it within a 15 - 20 foot radius.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the high praises on amazon.com, I certainly don&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> Though the lotion had a sweet, fruity scent, the feeling of the product left much to be desired.</li>
            <li> and it gets dry easily.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing effects of this lotion is pretty good and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a particularly sticky film like many other lotions I have used.</li>
            <li> the mild, faint, natural scent of Hempz Original is so nice.  </li>
            <li> especially the retail price is pretty high for a body lotion, luckily amazon sells this for more than half the price.</li>
            <li> you have a bad nose or don&#x27;t mind strong scents, this is a great lotion.</li>
            <li> try many lotions and creams for dry sensitive hands with no luck even after appying over and over throught out the day.</li>
            <li> The texture of this moisturizer is thick and smooth; it absorbs easily into your skin, leaving it moist but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Like most, it is too strong and mixes poorly with anything else you may be wearing (after shave, cologne)..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used very expensive lotions; however,  Hempz Lotion is the best!  </li>
            <li> My wife loves the stuff and she&#x27;s got some pretty soft skin now.</li>
            <li> This lotion is MUCH thicker and moisturizes much more than any regular lotion that you are going to find at your local grocery store.</li>
            <li> far, I have yet to find a fault with this product and the first day of use</li>
            <li> Better than average body lotion.</li>
            <li> It smells like bubble gum, if you can get past the horrendous smell, I&#x27;d say it is an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, buy it here, but do check out the fragrances first somewhere.  </li>
            <li> May not really be bad, but it was a big miss from my expectation.</li>
            <li> A little oily when first applying but is soaks in quickly and leaves a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> As everyone stayed, absorbs quickly, very light yet moisturizing, leaves skin soft, expected a thicker constistancy lotion</li>
            <li> Hempz moisturizer is my favorite lotion, hands down.</li>
            <li> Hands down i love it and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best for daily moisturizing - if you have cracked feet or other cracked skin, try something a little on the Vaseline-type side.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes better than any other lotion i have ever had!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sent is light and fresh but a little fruity- banana and strawberry.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this moisturizer in Colorado!</li>
            <li> One product I do not want to live without!</li>
            <li> The smell is very fresh and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It works on my wife who as a redhead has very sensitive and has issues with many other products.</li>
            <li> The best part of this lotion, is it has completely cleared up my upper/back arm bumps (chicken skin).</li>
            <li> Not greases a all it soaks into the skin leaving you smoth and dry free.</li>
            <li> Not even my legs look dry anymore, and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> This lotion has made my skin less itchy by putting more moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li> I had skin cancer surgery on the top of my head three and one half years ago.</li>
            <li> To me it doesn&#x27;t smell at all like strawberries even though it says so on the bottle; I get more of the earthy shea butter with some slight fruitiness to it.</li>
            <li> Still a decent smell, but</li>
            <li> I will purchase again mainly for the scent.</li>
            <li> the lotion itself, it has decent staying power.  </li>
            <li> my skin (at an advanced age [male]) soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I loved the Green Tea Hempz, which is what prompted me to buy this, but I will definitely not be buying this &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; scent again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell</li>
            <li> They were selling this particular size and scent for like $20-25.</li>
            <li> Mild enough for your face, the results will amaze you...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by all the positive reviews of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Big container is a good value and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Hempz is a mixture of cheap ingredients and my skin isnt dry, its normal.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> then made me understand why the price was so high.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get high, but I did get moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> While this had been highly rated here and elsewhere, I just couldn&#x27;t get over the scent.</li>
            <li> really high</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If it is a knock off, it&#x27;s definitely a high quality one, to where I am not displeased one bit.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> highly recommend for before &amp; after tanning.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> moisturizes nicely -  highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend Hempz Body Butter which I use on the backs of my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for those who go tanning as an after tanning lotion, it is known to help keep the tan and help preserve it longer.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;d be high as balls 24/7</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for guys looking for manly hygienic products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> highly recomment it to all people everywhere.</li>
            <li> and I HIGHLY recommend...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly moisturizing, but non greasy.</li>
            <li> The price is competitive and a high quality product.</li>
            <li> The bottle does not last me very long because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> When winter hit my hand tend to get dried out due to no humidity and washing with soap, so I have been using this product for 3 years and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried, Eucerin, Cetaphil, and basically any other lotion that&#x27;s on the market, but none have made my skin feel so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> i have really dry skin on my hands and so far only this has proven to be effective</li>
            <li> I have used other lotions from Bath &amp; Body, and this is by far much better.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought that natural oils might be better than the synthetic junk found in other moisturizers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion is gentle enough for me yet strong enough for my husband!</li>
            <li> I go to sells the same exact bottle for $25, so this is a steal!</li>
            <li> But if you are not a fragrance person or sensitive to it, it is NOT for you!!</li>
            <li> They sell this at tanning salons - and a little more pricey.</li>
            <li> This does not mean &amp;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, but my husband complains that the smell is a little overwhelming for his taste.</li>
            <li> This lotion really relieves the dry skin quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Durability - This thing lasts a good 8 hours at the very least.</li>
            <li> smell, on the other hand, is incredibly strong.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep that baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin moisturized and soft and smelling very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE</li>
            <li> The smell and texture is ok, though it does keep your skin long lasting moisture.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin hydrated the entire day and with consistent use really rejuvenates your skin.</li>
            <li> I had used it a few years ago but had not been able to find it.</li>
            <li> The smell, although overwhelming initially, doesn&#x27;t stay long</li>
            <li> and this is pretty much the only lotion that solves this issue.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it will definitely be my life long buy.</li>
            <li> It also moisturizers quite well for a lotion, whereas normally I prefer creams or butters.</li>
            <li> This definitely wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase price.  </li>
            <li> My favorite post tan and everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem like normal hemp lotion to me....</li>
            <li> Hempz is definitely worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> I finally ordered a replacement after a couple years through Amazon as it is much cheaper here then at the salon where I got my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> It makes me wonder if people leaving negative reviews own salons.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think Aveeno daily moisturizer does a far better job at keeping my skin moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was normal.  </li>
            <li> that my bf likes.&lt;br /&gt;overall, good, but not great.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this lotion at a spa and the price was $20, so being able to purchase it at almost half the prize at amazon.com allows me to use this lotion on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I also purchased a small size perfect for my small purse!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, but the pump broke half way through!</li>
            <li> I love this product so you can imagine my excitement when I checked Amazon &amp; found it for half the price!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - especially with my really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I put it on and didn&#x27;t wash it off right away, and 10 minutes later I couldn&#x27;t feel that texture on my hands.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I use and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> The price is right and the product is above all others  I have used.</li>
            <li> Oh right, that&#x27;s the last thing.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> Her pediatrician had recommended many lotions that had no effect on her skin, but the Hempz cleared the &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34;  and dried chafed areas completely!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because when something gets so popular somebody wants to buy the company and the next company starts cutting corners for more profit.</li>
            <li> The formula is very light weight, smooth and is not greasy nor does it leave any sort of uncomfortable residue after application.</li>
            <li> I have trouble believing a product is natural with that much scent to it, also it does not say all natural on the product so if you are looking for that you may look elsewhere or do more research into this.  </li>
            <li> Smells like sweet candy or something, but since it&#x27;s so strong, it&#x27;s not really pleasant.</li>
            <li> , I enjoy the smell but some other people do not.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews said, it made me feel like it&#x27;s a cheap lotion product.</li>
            <li> I live in Dallas Texas and the heat and humidity here can make you feel slimy when you wear lotion but not this one.</li>
            <li> New cologne.</li>
            <li> She loves it and cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a new moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The smell evokes the feeling of the topics even though I&#x27;m in New England.</li>
            <li> and so I gave the new ones to family members for Christmas.</li>
            <li> The product was new, unopened and was as stated in the description.</li>
            <li> My daughter has suffered with eczema for years and #2 I live in the desert...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried this lotion, it is something to live by.</li>
            <li> I live in CO</li>
            <li> This is certainly not the original.  </li>
            <li> I had to mix it 1:3 with a fragrance free lotion just so I wouldn&#x27;t have to waste the whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We recently purchased Hempz Moisturizer which we had been purchasing locally and found it on Amazon at a lower price and with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the cheap stuff starting at a couple of bucks and worked up to the stuff that costs around $20 and none of them seemed to work, or if they worked it was short term, or</li>
            <li> unfortunately none worked.&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago I decided to go cruelty free and found that many of the products that I had been using were tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> This product makes fabulous Christmas Gifts tooour, for your female and male friends.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally super dry skin</li>
            <li> MY HEMPZ, MY LOVELY LITTLE HEMPZ!</li>
            <li> MY HEMPZ, MY LOVELY LITTLE HEMPZ!</li>
            <li> No other lotion really seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It feels very liquid at the first moment but it is very moisturizing than other lotions I tried, and the skin was not itchy anymore.</li>
            <li> and my hands are very soft.</li>
            <li> My husband is diabetic so his skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> It makes your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Smell is NOT overpowering, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to that.</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling very soft afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is hydrating and makes your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I have even been using it on my face and my face is usually very sensitive to lotions....</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t even use perfume.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my face all the time and have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Right on the back it states that it is \\&quot;soft breezy floral, strawberry and banana\\</li>
            <li> With the first few whiffs I&#x27;ve had of it, it was actually kinda pleasant because I&#x27;m getting over a cold and the menthol kind of helped clear my nose, but after awhile, it feels like I rubbed on melted fruity/tropical Halls cough drops all over me.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a lotion that will moisturize your skin and leave it feeling soft then thiscould be for you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used Lubriderm(non scent), and like some other lotions, but this one definitey feels a lot better and smells</li>
            <li> Historically I have purchased this lotion in my local tanning salon (for double the price), and love it.</li>
            <li> Saw this at a local spa for a much higher price.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing but not too thin or too thick and absorbs perfectly.</li>
            <li> was expecting an all natural hemp formulation .... not my preference at all!</li>
            <li> Overall a pretty rad product.</li>
            <li> but the one I received is exactly the same as the one in the store.  </li>
            <li> So many body moisturizers claim to not be greasy but they usually are.  </li>
            <li> I love this brand and plan to buy this lotion as well as other products in the future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately this is my first and last time using Hempz.</li>
            <li> and I saw this exact same product for sale there for over $20!</li>
            <li> While I had to wait about 24 hours for my lotion to thaw out due to the freezing temps in which it was left, I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also all natural, no parabens!</li>
            <li> I even took a tiny bit on my pinky and rubbed it into my wrist - the lotion at Marshall&#x27;s smelled and felt exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> But it absorbs into your skin and your skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> I was VERY pleasantly surprised at the price!  </li>
            <li> The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was a bit more pricey than the other hemp lotions i have found in stores.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft - not greasy or sticky at all!  </li>
            <li> Only thing is that we will need to buy a new one very quickly because she uses it every single day.</li>
            <li> this lotion feels rich and creamy without ever feeling greasy and you only have to use it once during the day.&lt;br /&gt;the scent is clean, simple, and won&#x27;t overpower other scents you may want to put on and it works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a fine moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and it gives the skin a glow and shine that last for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is pretty heavy, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but the smell is kind of weird and tends to linger.</li>
            <li> I live in the SW where daily lotion is a necessity, and I am absolutely hooked on this stuff</li>
            <li> my wife LOVES this lotion - initially purchased it from her hair-stylist for $21 and absolutely couldnt live without it.  </li>
            <li> you still have not found the right lotion for dry ,itchy skin..</li>
            <li> The big issue is that so far... this lotion works really, really well and leaves me with very soft skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a little one with celiac and these lotions are gluten free...  </li>
            <li> it is mild enough for my sensitive skin, never stings or anything, it is thick, very moisturizing (not liquidy like some lotions!!!)  </li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin, and this is the only moisturizer I have found that makes my face smooth and soft...</li>
            <li> It works really well to keep my skin soft, especially in a Wisconsin winter.  </li>
            <li> I have Psoriasis and after using this for about a week it started to clear up the flakes and cracks.</li>

            <li> Makes your skin feel so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This lotion totally surprised me.</li>
            <li> but they fixed the problem in a timely manner</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> all natural lotion.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that there are people out there  who like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I shook the lotion, i moved the pump in all possible directions -- i even unscrewed the whole thing and tested it pumping water (</li>
            <li> Alcohol is frequently used as a solvent.</li>
            <li> When your husband tells you how soft your skin feels, it must be working.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your skin soft and silky but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old</li>
            <li> my skin was so soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this lotion does not irritate.</li>
            <li> I smelled like an old lady .. tried washing it off with soap - no luck..  </li>
            <li> My husband is 71 years old and gets the marks on his arms from years of sun damage.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a all natural moisturizer and thought this one will be it when reading the product description.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it moisturize really well</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re the type of person who&#x27;s sensitive to those types of scents you might not want to buy it.</li>
            <li> The skin feels so soft and protected after you apply it.</li>
            <li> one for myself and another for my cousin with sensitive skin to try it out.</li>
            <li> I use it for before and after tanning and after the shower and it leaves my skin feeling so soft</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll save at least 50% or more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the ingredient that makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves everything so soft, yet not greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> My 5-yr old got an allergic reaction to the hemp oil in this product.</li>
            <li> This is the big indicator to me that this isn&#x27;t a real hempz product.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion since the early 90&#x27;s when my mom took me to the tanning salon when I was a preteen</li>
            <li> Buy this lotion and have a soft wife like I do.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft, and not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It smells kinda musty and old to me once you put it on your skin.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this if you are looking for a real Hempz lotion or you will make the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Nearly gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> it is no harsh and helps with her eczema.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin so soft</li>
            <li> and I always get compliments of how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;No need to spend a fortune on moisturizers as they only hold in what you put in thru your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Soft feeling.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft all day.</li>
            <li> There is no heavy, oily feel to it at all.</li>
            <li> This lotion is made for a 7 year old girl.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants to stay younger looking.</li>
            <li> Also, I have sensitive skin, this passed the test.  </li>
            <li> also, it is made from all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> It has a soft fruity smell that my coworkers believe smells like bananas.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels silky and soft, even my children have noticed.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft all day.  </li>
            <li> Not just soft because you just applied the lotion but soft throughout the day</li>
            <li> my skin was so soft.</li>
            <li> I would much rather pay 10$ for this than the 20$ I have paid sometimes at the local salon.</li>
            <li> I think that the natural shea butter thats in this Hempz moisturizer is what makes it work wonders.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and keeps your skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find a store near me that sells this lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly soft as well.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> you baby soft</li>
            <li> Natural scent.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of a cheap store brand lotion that didn&#x27;t provide all day hydration and would find my skin ashy in a few hours after application.</li>
            <li> I was completely out</li>
            <li> It is a medium weight lotion, one press of the dispenser is actually too much for me.</li>
            <li> Smell is very fruity and lingers - Big Time.</li>
            <li> Hands feel so soft</li>
            <li> like others say, it&#x27;s not greasy and it rubs in immediately, leaving your skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and always paid at least $20/bottle in tanning salons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really an item worth returning, so I&#x27;m rating 2 stars because it came in a bottle with \\&quot;Hempz\\&quot; and it&#x27;s lotion</li>
            <li> Also the lotion is not greasy or heavy feeling, I tried this from a friend awhile back and just HAD to have my own finally.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too sweet, and doesn&#x27;t last long, but the moisture does.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday gift a few years back, and when I ran out I wanted to get some more, until I found out</li>
            <li> I hate oily lotion and this stuff is perfect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick or thin, and it gives you a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> So when I was exposed to dry climate, my skin started becoming very very dry.  </li>
            <li> Cannabis is so far down in the ingredient list that it&#x27;s pretty much non-existent.</li>
            <li> It is a great lotion though, sinks right into your skin and isn&#x27;t the least bit heavy.  </li>
            <li> The original is a little on the fruity side</li>
            <li> It just sinks right into my skin.</li>
            <li> this stuff sinks right in.  </li>
            <li> At first I really did not understand how people can rave so much about a lotion, I mean its just lotion after all - all lotion is pretty much the same as long as it moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> Helps our dry skin SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> It smells very fresh and natural without being overpowering or grossly saccharine like some other herbal/floral scented lotions.</li>
            <li> You can easily expect it to last through a typical work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost</li>
            <li> Perhaps that will smell less strong, but this definitely does not match the scent of the Hempz cream in the jar.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Hemp Seed Oil is one of nature&#x27;s richest sources of Essential Fatty Acids and Key Amino Acids containing natural proteins, vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals vital for healthy skin</li>
            <li> Note, the forms of alcohol used in cosmetics are not necessarily those used in alcoholic drinks, and may be much more dangerous.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty heavy though, so if you don&#x27;t like scents you should really avoid this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did, as long as I remember to apply this lotion everyday</li>
            <li> I bought a small sample of this lotion in my local pharmacy and fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well without being greasy and has a nice, if a little bit odd, scent.</li>
            <li> Has this little sweet scent to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion since it had such high reviews.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and we are on our second bottle.</li>
            <li> See a difference with first application - haven&#x27;t had long enough for any long term critique but if the first weeks are any indication, it&#x27;s  </li>
            <li> so they are not aware of the high quality of Hempz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very dissapointed and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m against using marijuana for medicinal purposes, but because the giant hemp leaf on the front seemed too much like a gimmick/marketing ploy to the point where it would either be a useless novelty item or it would have to be an amazing product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could use this lotion over and over all day long, but you really don&#x27;t need to it stays moisturized.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing effect lasts whole day long.</li>
            <li> and once you use it a few times, it actually moistens your hands so you don&#x27;t need to keep using it multiple times a day :)</li>
            <li> I have tried a large number of moisturizers because I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I had to use Benadryl to calm it down.  </li>
            <li> The smell, consistency and results are exactly the same which means to me , I got the real Hempz at half the price that the salons charge.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little thick, but it smells so good.  </li>
            <li> As a guy, I&#x27;d like for it to have less of a frangrancy smell, but it does the trick way better than any other lotion that I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter, Ginseng and natural extracts help calm, soothe without the red irritation that i used to get with other lotions.</li>
            <li> live in the humid South and would definitely recommend Hempz.</li>
            <li> My tattoo artist actually recommended it for using on new tatts, so I&#x27;ve been doing that as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years--it works really well for me, my skin is on the dry side, even my daughter uses it</li>
            <li> It really helps with the dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really do much for my dry skin</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and since moving to the desert over 10 years ago, it has been a real challenge for me to keep moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It may be too soon to see if it really help with my dry skin</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I used a similar product made by a local vender that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it does everything a lotion is supposed to do and has a fresh, slightly &amp;#34;peachy&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> I hate to rate a moisturizer based on the scent, but when it&#x27;s this strong, overwhelming, and stubborn, it completely overshadows the moisturizing effects of the lotion since I don&#x27;t even want to be near it anymore.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am prone to eczema, and this not only does not irritate my skin, but helps keep eczema at bay.  </li>
            <li> left my skin feeling very soft and moursurized, I&#x27;m in the sun alot</li>
            <li> Been using it 2008 and no other cream will do for me.</li>
            <li> Having been used to the scent of Jergens, Nivea and a ton of other mainstream moisturizers, I was taken aback the first time I used Hempz.</li>
            <li> but im not sure if mine is an original or a knock off,</li>
            <li> The vey first time I tried it the pump seemed to break as stated in some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not love is how strong the scent is</li>
            <li> I have used this product previously and it is always the right choice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hempz Original Herbal Body Moisturizer is enriched with 100% Pure Natural Hemp Seed Oil and blended with natural extracts to provide dramatic skin hydration and nourishment to help improve the overall health and condition of skin.</li>
            <li> It is a rich source of essential fatty acids and amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals.  </li>
            <li> High sensitivity to that ingredient after using it a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad, but not that great</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and it seems, at least to me, to have a cool(temp) texture that helps it soothe irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> and you generally do end up liking it.</li>
            <li> It definitely keeps my skin soft for aleast 24 hrs</li>
            <li> After shaving I have been putting this on my face, It really is not greasy and dries really fast.</li>
            <li> In short, the smell is the antithesis of what the product is supposed to represent: natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had multiple people just stop and go \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> I contacted the maker of this product concerning the fragrance used in the lotion was either natural or synthetic, I never got a response back which has me assuming it&#x27;s synthetic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have looked at several salons and the price is extremely reasonable and the same lotion as sold elsewhere for double the price.</li>
            <li> so apparently she likes it too.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I can&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> It actually makes the skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> ingredients lists don&#x27;t match and Hempz only has two direct to consumer venues that they use.</li>
            <li> but then I unscrewed the pump completely off, put it back on</li>
            <li> First of all I have spent tons of money on lotions for several reasons..</li>
            <li> I also ordered from Green Web, as did the highest useful comment stated.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion, however the pump was broken, and some of the product oozed out....</li>
            <li> I was wrong and am amazed at how popular this lotion is.</li>
            <li> I considered returning it, but with the costs and the trouble involved, it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> Smell was subtle; not too strong.</li>
            <li> The bottom portion was bubble wrapped but the top was not and the pump was broken on arrival.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little bit of the strawberry banana smell that it claims to have right on the bottle for those who are complaining of the smell...</li>
            <li> The shipping was done quickly, and i actually received the product a little dented.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this lotion for dry skin, and problem skin.</li>
            <li> who suffers from dry skin, this product is great.</li>
            <li> a few hours after application, even when putting my arm right up to my daughter&#x27;s nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other scents from this line at Sephora and they all have exactly the same feel in hands as lotion, so I believe it is legit, just look out for what seller you&#x27;re buying from</li>
            <li> Definitely not authentic hempz which has a mild scent and nothing like bubble gum.</li>
            <li> it does seem to absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an excessive amount of grease</li>
            <li> the cheap and strong sense make me so sick even headache.</li>
            <li> My skin stays hydrated for much longer than any other lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other reviewers claiming it&#x27;s a knock-off, but my order was the real deal.</li>
            <li> Once you start using Hempz, you&#x27;ll realize how much your other lotions have been letting you down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft likely due to the dankest of dank extracts used in this particular lotion.</li>
            <li> Live in AZ where the climate is soooo dry.</li>
            <li> On the other hand that is about the only positive thing I have to say about it.  </li>
            <li> and yes, Amazon does have a lot of third parties peddling counterfeit products, which is why I suggest either buying direct from the company (in this case Hempz) or finding out what the approved vendors are for this company&#x27;s products and buying only from those vendors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does not dry out your skin like some lotions.</li>
            <li> it smells very artificial to me and TOO strong!!!  </li>
            <li> and now I am a little sick of the smell, but it was awesome while it lasted.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> It has a very strong, overpowering odor of fake strawberries.  </li>
            <li> I thought the because of the low price that I was going to get a watered down version but got the real deal!</li>
            <li> My skin is always so dry, I was surprised to have found one that works!  </li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t really see a big difference from other lotions (nivea,vaseline,dove)</li>
            <li> The smell is very relaxing and its different from other lotions.</li>
            <li> I have used a prescription lotion, but this apparently works equally well for my eczema.</li>
            <li> Starting to get into the Hempz line and have NO regrets.</li>
            <li> however the feeling of the lotion is really, too densed, thick, i don&#x27;t want to put on my body as much amount as I used to put on for regular body lotions.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado, which has a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> it smells like old floral (perhaps from the jasmine mentioned in the ingredients very far down), but for a lotion that you use all over your body it permeates everything including adding the scent to your clothing, as well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, per se, but it is very strong and lingers the whole day.</li>
            <li> Smelled great, the texture was slightly less thick than usual, but i figured the thickness would vary with each batch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty religious about lotion everyday though.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very large and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product especially for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far my knuckles have improved but still get dry if I don&#x27;t reapply regularly.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the lotion is a bit on the thinner side and dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Good for anyone that suffers from dry skin.</li>
            <li> We have used this lotion in the past and been absolutely thrilled with it, but they either changed the product as suggested in other posts or this is NOT original Hempz product.  </li>
            <li> However the pump was broken but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is a little much for me.</li>
            <li> However it has a very strong sickening sweet scent to it.</li>
            <li> Not greasy goes on thick but once absorbed leaves</li>
            <li> There is a slight fruity scent, and to me it smells a little like strawberry/banana yogurt, which does not bother me especially since sweet scents will give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion makes me really break out in certain areas due to it being thick etc.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft during a long, dry winter, without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hands feeling so soft and smooth without the oily feeling that other moisturizers leave behind.  </li>
            <li> The Arizona sun sucks the moisture right off me but a couple of applications a day on my arms and legs seems to mitigate that.  </li>
            <li> I like that the consistency is not too thick that I feel like I&#x27;m going to stick to anything, but it seems to soak right in.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve seen her hands completely clear up while using Hempz, something that hasn&#x27;t happened with other lotions.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and moist for longer than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended but not this one sold her, it is certainly not original.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go bad or loose the scent which is pleasant.</li>
            <li> this is not the Hempz I have bought in the past, it is light, not as heavy or as scented.</li>
            <li> Long lasting effect, even days later.</li>
            <li> I purchased this large bottle after getting a small purse-size one from my salon.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone who is looking for an everyday, all-over body lotion.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, not greasy, &amp; makes your skin so soft and keeps the dryness away!</li>
            <li> The bottle last a very long time if used daily.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, very little smell to it, and I have one by every sink in the house.</li>
            <li> that well, it could be that i need a different one of hempz like for extra dry skin</li>
            <li> Whoever said this lotion is the same as Dove or Vaseline intensive care obviously does not have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I really am not a lotion fan in general.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got real hempz lotion.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the negative reviews, I knew this had to be the real stuff!</li>
            <li> long lasting moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s texture and long lasting qualities.</li>
            <li> and it is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> The smell last a long time throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Its moisturizing ability is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I live in Colorado and use it year round.</li>
            <li> The lotion is moisturizing, though not quite enough for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it all over my body after my shower, and the next day, I can see dry skin on my legs and arms again.  </li>
            <li> and it is the only lotion that helps her dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, not too dry and gets rid of the bumps on the back of my arms.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that works on my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I have heard from various sources that lotions with hemp oil help with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m athletic &amp; spend a lot of time outside in the dry Arizona desert.</li>
            <li> it kill my dry skin especially in winter time.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t burn her dry chapped hands.</li>
            <li> Since I moved up north my hands and lips have constantly been cracked and dry, but this stuff took care of that in a matter of days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I only tan in the summer, but I find myself using this moisturizer even in the winter just for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It not only moisturizes my dry skin but, leaves not oily residue</li>
            <li> it just won&#x27;t suffice I need to have a wet not dry vice&lt;</li>
            <li> you use too much, it can seem a bit thick and my only advice would be to use it sparingly...</li>
            <li> However, the smell is so strong which I don&#x27;t like it, just like a fake fragrance.</li>
            <li> Original scent is far and away the best...stay away from the watermelon scent as it smells like a dirty dishrag.</li>
            <li> She has tried so many other expensive brands, and none of them compare to HEMPZ.</li>
            <li> I originally began using Hempz several years ago when I lived in Hawaii and was obsessed with laying out in the sun.</li>
            <li> My skin actually feels moisturized after using it, and I don&#x27;t have to slather it on, or constantly keep up on it, like some other stuff.</li>
            <li> The flowers (and to a lesser extent the leaves, stems, and seeds) contain psychoactive and physiologically active chemical compounds known as cannabinoids that are consumed for recreational, medicinal, and spiritual purposes.</li>
            <li> and it goes so fast its hard to justify buying it these days.</li>
            <li> At $12 is a great expensive buy (this is why only 4 stars and not 5...because it is expensive).</li>
            <li> Cheap FAKE lotion</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, if you don&#x27;t mind cheap smelling cheesy products, then maybe this is for you.</li>
            <li> It never leaves me feeling greasy but moisturizes all day long.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough in the winter and not really into the smell.  </li>
            <li> It especially helps with rough elbows.</li>
            <li> The company also sells a wide varity of different types of lotions, after sun lotions lip balm.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT NATURAL.</li>
            <li> This will be my lotion of choice as long as I&#x27;m on amazon.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way and doesn&#x27;t have the oily sensation.</li>
            <li> Not even on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;The smell stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> I apply it after the shower and it moisturizes all day long.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Life long buyer here</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin moisturized for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hempz is a product I will use for as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Lasts long.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I plan on using the HEMPZ for a long time.</li>
            <li> it works well for vastly different types of skin and in different climates.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s made with hemp seed oil and extract that helps skin retain moisture and it has essential fatty acids and amino acids that helps encourage the health of your skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep my skin moisturized for long, but the smell makes up for that.</li>
            <li> and  I am incredibly sensitive to smells, this is on of few I can tolerate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good lotion, I just hate the bubblegum smell</li>
            <li> so it soaks in right away but not so thin you feel like you put nothing on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten bad or fake versions of this lotion from other sites, but this one is genuine, and a much better price than at the store!  </li>
            <li> I have just purchased my second bottle and plan to try the other scents too.</li>
            <li> whenever I looked at other lotions, my nose kept coming back to THIS lotion.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me moisturized all day long, even on the driest of days!</li>
            <li> You will instantly forget all the other moisturizers you have used once you try this one.</li>
            <li> Alternately, there are other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; in this brand that I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li> I may try other brand next time.</li>
            <li> I only use it when my skin gets dry from either the season or due to soap or solvents.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> but I dont think the moisture lasts very long.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hands through the winter and it&#x27;s hard for me to find a nice solid lotion that&#x27;s vegan and that is heavy enough without feeling greasy or weird.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it also for his dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly dry skin.</li>
            <li> Whatchya gonna do with all that dry, all that dry up on them handz?</li>

            <li> I keep severely dry hands, legs, and feet.  </li>

            <li> Goes on dry.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> Relief for dry skin lasts 8-12 hours.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re stil going to have ashy, dry or whatever skin</li>
            <li> A lotion I buy that doesn&#x27;t leave my hands dry.</li>
            <li> My hands and legs are dry</li>
            <li> so I am always fighting dry skin.</li>
            <li> NOT MOISTURIZING for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and this product keeps my skin moist through out the day.</li>
            <li> and I bought this lotion because my hands get so dry in winter, but the smell is not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> do you have extremly dry skin?</li>
            <li> then this is it!!!!!Hempz is absolutley the answer to your dry skin</li>
            <li> It soothes my extremely dry chapped hands</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like smelling like lotion, but I also don&#x27;t like dry skin.</li>
            <li> the winter, my shins sometimes get dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> also use it on my hands after working in the garage with solvents like gas or brake cleaner or the pumice shop soaps that completely dry your hands out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps my tan moist and doesn&#x27;t let it dry out at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to sticky after applying &amp; repairs her dry skin &amp; mine within a couple days.</li>
            <li> I have fairly dry hands since I wash them a lot at my job.  </li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin</li>
            <li> but sometimes my hands get so dry</li>
            <li> We have dry air</li>
            <li> It cools my summer feet and keeps them from being so dry.</li>
            <li> I found it in my tanning salon, helps dry skin improve immediately.  </li>
            <li> my skin can sometimes be dry because of this</li>
            <li> I still feel dry.</li>
            <li> It works well for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every moisturizer out there for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Once, in desperation when my hair was too dry to control, I tried some of my sister&#x27;s HEMPZ Moisturizer on my hands, then ran my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me too oily and doesn&#x27;t dry me up.</li>
            <li> to sum up my review, Hempz Herbal Moisturizer, is creamy and absorbs immediately, there is no greasy or oily film to stain or ruin clothing, softens and heals scaly dry skin, and protects me from all the drying effects of living in the desert.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have dry skin anymore because of this</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t ever let this product go away, it helps to dry up  the sun damage on my arms.  </li>
            <li> For me, I&#x27;d rather suffer with dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown a lot bigger now than when I got my tattoo a few years back</li>
            <li> since that seems to be the main complaint on here.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely texture, not too thin not too thick.</li>
            <li> I could not live without this</li>
            <li> I use this every single day and would recommend it to anyone that needs a lotion, buy this one.</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin truly moisturized, where other moisturizers, cheap ones, seem to fail in doing that.</li>
            <li> Next time though, I may look at other options!</li>
            <li> but when your skin hurts from being dry like from snowboarding all day or getting sun burnt, you gotta do something!</li>
            <li> got here just in time for dreaded dry winter skin!</li>
            <li> When nothing else worked for my daughter&#x27;s dry &amp;#34;allergy&amp;#34; bumps on her arms, this was THE lotion!  </li>
            <li> It is my staple buy for dry skin!</li>
            <li> I had dry skin on my arms and after applying it for three days, there is absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> This was half the price I paid for it at a local store.</li>
            <li> I have very dry itchy skin and this lotion truly helps.</li>
            <li> , she has very dry cracking hands.</li>
            <li> My hands get very very dry</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I am a very dry one</li>
            <li> and so it is very, very dry.</li>
            <li> Helps moisturize my skin but not as long as the other lotion.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Really too bad about the super fruity and clinging smell (AND Retinyl palmitate.</li>
            <li> a get get get get it wet, get that dry wet with my MY HEMPZ, MY HEMPZ</li>
            <li> The lotion smells a little different</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, I just didn&#x27;t love it and wished I had ordered the body butter.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t love the smell, but it isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I feel calm after each application and sometimes find that if I put it on too late I am prone to late night eating.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint was it had come open in shippment and 1/3 of it spilled out all over bottle.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and silky without having that icky sticky feel.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful where you buy it.</li>
            <li> I have to mention it was thoroughly and carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle on my desk and everyone tries it and loves it, never had anyone have an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> It shipped quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> Please be careful.</li>
            <li> AS I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> It works really well without leaving any greasy feel behind.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not too over-powering and the smell does dissipate in a few minutes, so it&#x27;s not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL.  </li>
            <li> Anyways the salon closed and I switched up.</li>
            <li> Not real.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days</li>
            <li> Received it wicket than expected.</li>
            <li> What a drag.</li>
            <li> Also the smell is minimal.</li>
            <li> It deeply moisturizes but does not leave a sticky feeling once it has dried.  </li>
            <li> It smells like bubble gum - not like hemp like I expected.</li>
            <li> , it arrived in a pink bottle.  </li>
            <li> The powerful scent of fake bananas overwhelmed my senses, and stayed with me for hours.  </li>
            <li> This is a scam and is NOT real Hempz lotion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please check seller feedback carefully before making a purchase.  </li>
            <li> The product came broken and smelled really funky.</li>
            <li> I just went to my eye doctor who shares an office, I&#x27;m assuming, with a skin center.</li>
            <li> so I was curious and checked the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my skin feel extremely soft and it&#x27;s not too thick or too runny, it&#x27;s in-between.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Think of it - the same thing for half the price - what a deal!</li>
            <li> Seriously, one little dab covers my whole face sufficiently.</li>
            <li> This was the right product but wrong item...</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading about people that had received a different lotion that smelled like bubblegum, but this is the same product sold at tanning salons for a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> And, the price is less than half of what I paid at several department stores!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t as unpleasant as cough medicine, but it does still smell a little like medication (mostly like cough drops, as mentioned) - this isn&#x27;t something I can stand for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old complained about it even though I only put a small amount on my legs.</li>
            <li> And , while it&#x27;s not scientifically proven and may not be true for everyone, it really seems to keep those miserable deep South</li>
            <li> That being said, I do like the lotion itself, so I&#x27;m curious about the other scents that they offer.</li>
            <li> Other remedies had taken between 2wks-1 month for minimal results and this stuff worked</li>
            <li> Be careful of other online ordering of the HEMP Z product...</li>
            <li> only complaint with Hempz is that if your skin is severely dry, a few applications may be necessary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with raw shea butter next time.</li>
            <li> I was never one for listening to the highest useful comments usually because they were outdated, but I should had this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was still a little rough, but it wasn&#x27;t dry to the point of causing pain or opening and bleeding.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s concentrated and a little bit goes a long way without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Like the fragrance and that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I showed it to my sister, then she started using it in her hair (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> not sure if it has enough moisturizer for winter skin, but I will find out.</li>
            <li> This has never happened to me before with any other lotion bottle.</li>
            <li> This is not the fault of the product, this is how it&#x27;s always been and they make other lotions and products that don&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s tried other hemp-based lotions, but none of them have stacked up to the Hempz brand.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other lotion...</li>
            <li> Plus, being so expensive you would expect a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> I have even tried the other scents and like them all.</li>
            <li> Have a small bottle in my car, and big bottles at work and in home bathroom.</li>
            <li> She put it on in the other room</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m throwing all the other lotions I have away.</li>
            <li> any other lotion that I have tried.</li>
            <li> We were already fans of other products containing  hemp.</li>
            <li> I want to try their other scents, but I have a feeling</li>
            <li> I spray tan and your not supposed to use any lotions with oil and other ingredients</li>
            <li> I thought it was a disgusting smell to be honest!</li>
            <li> I first received it as a gift from my dad (I&#x27;m a girl) and was skeptical that I&#x27;d like a lotion that he uses.</li>
            <li> Yet I am still considering trying other scents as well.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other lotion.</li>
            <li> You can find it other places besides tanning salons but Amazon is the cheapest I have found,</li>
            <li> I think that it smells like Plumeria flower, my husband on the other hand thinks it smells like Smarties candies.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other lotion.</li>
            <li> other words, hydration comes from drinking water.</li>
            <li> At other beauty stores in runs upwards of $20.</li>
            <li> With body butter, I have to use it with other body oil.</li>
            <li> All different kinds of mositureizers in the past</li>
            <li> I usually buy it at my local tanning salon</li>
            <li> Once you try Hempz, you wont want any other lotion brand.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews, it smells like bubblegum or cotton candy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that watered-down feeling like some other lotions.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is extremely moisturizing and I have never owned a product quite like this.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t repeat what other reviewers are saying about the quality of this lotion.</li>
            <li> I almost took a bite out of my arm the other day because it smelled so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I will probably be repurchasing this again and trying some of the other scents they offer.</li>
            <li> not much else to say!</li>
            <li> and it says on wikipedia and other websites that \\&quot;Its seeds are chiefly used to make hempseed oil which can be used for cooking, lamps, lacquers, or paints.</li>
            <li> Butter by Nubian Heritage does the same job (if not better) w/o all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> it usually turns red and peels but not with Hempz!</li>
            <li> I would like to try it unscented next, as I usually don&#x27;t like scents.</li>
            <li> If on the other hand you&#x27;re a man like me</li>
            <li> My hands used to peel and crack during the winters here due to the dryness but after using this lotion I have seen a noticeable decrease in the problems.</li>
            <li> I wont be using any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers are correct in stating that it does smell like bubblegum, which didn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> Need to read very carefully.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad smell, it&#x27;s just one that strongly reminds you that you smell like strawberries.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> It gives off a slight scent of strawberries that&#x27;s not really a distraction to me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t appreciate the smell a whole much but not enought o hate</li>
            <li> Add to that fact that I live in a desert, and we have some serious dryness!</li>
            <li> I noticed that my legs and feet were very dry and peeling of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I work lifting heavy objects and with a lot of mail; often I have to worry about my job making my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> your skin feels soft and does not get dried out all day!&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li> the formula used to be a little less harsher, but they seemed to have changed the formula up a little to make it last a little longer.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this classic from Hempz!</li>
            <li> i found b&amp;b is relatively too hard to apply.</li>
            <li> (they get pretty bad when it&#x27;s 10 degrees outside).  </li>
            <li> It made my skin feel like it had light burns that were quite painful.</li>
            <li> you aren&#x27;t left with that icky, tacky feeling.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many expensive facial skin care products and hand creams, all to my disappointment.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine from Dark Tans.</li>
            <li> Ordered from Dark tans and I like it.</li>
            <li> That is wrong, the bottles I&#x27;ve received are absolutely Hempz products, not a knock off at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the product, however, I ordered the wrong version.</li>
            <li> Not weirdo college pot-smoking dark smell either.</li>
            <li> no fun.</li>
            <li> I use it daily, not too thick</li>
            <li> might think this lotion&#x27;s not cheap but for the quality it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re giving it away at 20$ a bottle (not really, but it ain&#x27;t Kiehls).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s fine to sell hyper-feminine lotions for people who can stomach the smell of fake fruit, but there should at least be a warning on the product page!  </li>
            <li> got lotion on lock down can&#x27;t seem to put my HUH?</li>
            <li> i rubbed down in it and got into bed.</li>
            <li> I switched from Dove to Hempz, and now that my Hempz bottle is gone when I tried to use my Dove again it seems so watered down.  </li>
            <li> i rubbed down in it and got into bed.</li>
            <li> She loves it when I rub down her body after she showers..</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can see the ingredients if you scroll down the product page.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the lotion leaves no greasy or unpleasant feel on the skin after application, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> No more dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> No more dry, flakey, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Plus, this is half the price that they charge at my salon.</li>
            <li> so I could care less.</li>
            <li> I get half way through the bottle of lotion and the pump stops working.  </li>
            <li> Amazon price was almost 50% less than retail.</li>
            <li> My skin was healthier in less than 1 week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion previously and I stumbled across it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I previously used bath and body body butter, but after I tried this item, I decided to switch.</li>
            <li> otherwise half your tan scrubs off in the shower if you don&#x27;t moisturize, and this product&#x27;s made for that purpose - which is why you see it a lot at tanning salons.</li>
            <li> I could at least take my pump off my old bottle and put it on the damaged one at least.</li>
            <li> and I got it for half the price.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars, but the pump does not work after using half the bottle.</li>
            <li> Half the cost.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already half way done with the bottle</li>
            <li> I was a little wary about buying this lotion from here because several people said it wasn&#x27;t the same thing you buy from the salon</li>
            <li> arrived before expected, small bottles in stores and spas run $4.99.</li>
            <li> A very thick cream, the lotion soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a grease slick behind.</li>
            <li> Little pricey at drug stores but Giselle Cosmetics on Amazon sells for about half price of retail stores.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a lotion for the winter months that would keep my hands from being dry and cracking.  </li>
            <li> however I discovered just a little bit goes a long way because it is so thick.  </li>
            <li> Least a very long time.</li>
            <li> It was here in just a few days, and cost so much less.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell!  </li>
            <li> This lotion is not greasy, it moisturizes well, and a little goes</li>
            <li> the bottle itself was inside of a little baggy almost like the style bag that pool toys come in.</li>
            <li> and what happens when you put little on your body?</li>
            <li> Not sure what some of those other people are complaining about.  </li>
            <li> but my arms were literally covered in a little rash that itched like the dickens...</li>
            <li> This lotion seems to be a little thinner than what I get.</li>
            <li> a little at a time.</li>
            <li> all natural&amp;#34; type of product, maybe smell like patchouli a little or something like that</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews that said this lotion was not authentic.</li>
            <li> the bottle itself was inside of a little baggy almost like the style bag that pool toys come in.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary about trying this product out.  </li>
            <li> A little too scented for me.</li>
            <li> so she runs out a little fatter</li>
            <li> I keep a little bottle in my diaper bag too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it is not particularly cheap, it is definitely a lot less expensive than some of the other luxurious brands.</li>
            <li> This is not a great moisturizer and on top of that it smells bad.</li>
            <li> This is cheap knock off crap.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t sunburn for years after moisturizing with this everyday for 6mos.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy on the skin and the fragrance is not overbearring.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now</li>
            <li> It gets worse during pregnancy (I am expecting my third in september)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, you don&#x27;t know what you are missing.</li>
            <li> I received it as a gift years ago and when it came to reorder, I shopped a few places.</li>
            <li> but now I use it all year round after my shower.  </li>
            <li> /ashey all year round.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday after I shower.</li>
            <li> Smell is sickening, it&#x27;s an ok product but way overpriced.</li>
            <li> However the pump broke after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> It is too sticky and heavy for me.</li>
            <li> Only 3 stars because I didn&#x27;t get to try the product because the lotion arrived with a broken pump (the tip about 1/2 in.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what you get for trying to save a few bucks;</li>
            <li> I will use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it all year round.</li>
            <li> Received this moisturizer as a gift several years ago and must confess, I am addicted.</li>
            <li> I sort of tried to find something wrong with it, but unless you&#x27;re completely against using marijuana for its healing attributes&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this product is one of the few moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t cause an outbreak.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes you don&#x27;t even notice it.  </li>
            <li> Everyday</li>
            <li> I am 27 and began using a retinol cream a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I also use it everyday on myself morning and night</li>
            <li> The fragrance is slightly heavy and will linger a while -</li>
            <li> I came home and found it on Amazon for MUCH LESS than the salon!</li>
            <li> Of course, being as pale as I was when I started, I burnt quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing this from amazon since a few reviews said it wasn&#x27;t the same product, but it definitely was when i receieved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I noticed a dramatic difference on my legs, and the same thing after applying it elsewhere on my body.</li>
            <li> And it is not a strong smell where the guys will be embarrassed.</li>
            <li> Not a strong smell.</li>
            <li> In cold Midwest winters we need a long lasting moisturizer.</li>
            <li> However the shipment I received was a mess!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this formula is different that the previous ones I have had.  </li>
            <li> This stuff WORKS, especially for my upstate NY cold dry hands.</li>
            <li> The larger bottle was too expensive for me and when I checked here it was $5.00 less.</li>
            <li> this product smell really really bad and for the first time I used it,</li>
            <li> A very very overpowering, sickly feminine smell.</li>
            <li> Its a little expensive that why I only use it every night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not great for super-dry skin.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s not too thin or thick, It doesn&#x27;t disappear into the skin like some lotions, but after briefly working  HEMPZ into the skin, there was no oily residue, no particulates, no aftermath at all.</li>
            <li> I used this little guy up in a month!</li>
            <li> and I really wanted it to work, but the smell was so bad for me that I couldn&#x27;t keep it.</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t gave it a bad review.</li>
            <li> I used to buy it from a salon or beauty supply store which was usually about $25.</li>
            <li> have ordered a few bottles because of the review!</li>
            <li> I went to pay for it at the clerk&#x27;s cash register, she also exclaimed initially how expensive it was</li>
            <li> Not sure if I give this product a 5 star rating.  </li>
            <li> Its thick and this bottle is 17 oz, but plan to buy another soon if you&#x27;re using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I love the smell which is a bonus because I would use this lotion if it was the worst smelling lotion on this planet just because it works so well.</li>
            <li> The pump that actually delivers the lotion was extremely difficult to get working.  </li>
            <li> It smells like bubblegum and i&#x27;m not sure how I feel about that...</li>
            <li> I usually cannot wear anything scented, but this product does not bother me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure in they have an unscented version or something, but I&#x27;m going to be on the lookout for it.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to decide whether or not I liked the smell or not.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed and actually just sent the product back in order to get a refund and re-purchase.</li>
            <li> It smells like bubblegum and i&#x27;m not sure how I feel about that.</li>
            <li> It smells like bubble gum to me and that is not appealing.  </li>
            <li> ill be a regular purchase for us.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure for me it lived up to the hype in the reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i dont usually use moisturizers, but this stuff works awesome.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I cannot get past the smell.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if it&#x27;s my lack of memory or not,</li>
            <li> My bottle at home lists it as propenadiol ( I probably spelled that wrong) but its the same thing as propylene glycol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I went to my usual tanning salon</li>
            <li> and yes, it does have a small amount of hemp oil in it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this lotion at friends&#x27; houses in the past but never bought it for myself since it tends to be pricy in the stores.</li>
            <li> I use this product year round even when not tanning!</li>
            <li> it the same one as the stores, just not as expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Hempz lotion from a registered retailer in the past</li>
            <li> Witch is kinda noticeable but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> and I use this everyday and it helps keep my skin from drying out!</li>
            <li> I decided to look for it on Amazon because I am lazy like that</li>
            <li> I am usually allergic to fragrance</li>
            <li> Using this stuff, even on a small area, makes you smell like sweet-tart candy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid to try new lotions, because I hate that feeling of too much lotion.  </li>
            <li> We use this everyday during the cold winter months of West Virginia and totally helps with chapping.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that the pump doesn&#x27;t reach the bottom so you would be stuck turning the bottle, shaking and squeezing the last 10% of product remaining, which is quite annoying considering the consistency and the hard plastic</li>
            <li> It just gets a little dry in cold weather.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hard to come by overseas.</li>
            <li> I just have a hard time to smell myself after applying this.</li>
            <li> A little too thin.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it just isn&#x27;t quite moisturizing enough for me for brutal winters here in Minnesota.</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled with it having what looks like a pot leaf on the front - my crazy-a Republican husband has not said anything yet, but I keep that side turned toward the wall....</li>
            <li> I would recommend all to try it at least once.</li>
            <li> am returning this product because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s what I ordered, or at least what I was expecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint I read was about the smell.</li>
            <li> Ordering from Anazon is alot cheaper than buying in the stores, at least $15.</li>
            <li> If I had one complaint it would be that sometimes the pump doesn&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li> I found this lotion to be the least moisturizing lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hempz for at least a decade now.</li>
            <li> Ive never liked the feel of moisturizer or putting creams on my skin, my dad used to try to make me sample it at stores</li>
            <li> Will this have negative effect on our body in anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not making a big difference in extremely cold weather.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how i missed the negative review warning of the smell..</li>
            <li> i hate it so much.  </li>
            <li> If your skin is oily it would probably be too thick for you.</li>
            <li> But hate to pay so much at salons.</li>
            <li> This lotion is thick so it should cover up.</li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of thick, sticky lotions and</li>
            <li> This lotion is not too thick, doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling at all oily, yet it is plenty moisturizing.</li>
            <li> not too greasy, not too thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s about the consistency I would expect for a lotion -- not too watery but not as thick as a body butter,</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t thick or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> the lotion/cream would be greasy or too thick, too thin and in some cases they just plain did not work.  </li>
            <li> I would never use any other lotion!!!!</li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;ve always been a late eater.  </li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to go around smelling like a teeny bopper.</li>
            <li> Do not buy anything from them unless you want to waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I mean like the citrus smell not smelly.</li>
            <li> I mean the stench of this product.</li>
            <li> I had seen this lotion in places like Ulta and a couple of other specialty stores before, but sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to take a product seriously when it has a pot leaf on the label.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, if you&#x27;re thinking about buying it, just do it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less expensive too.  </li>
            <li> If you sweat it&#x27;s ridiculously oily.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle smell without being purfumey.  </li>
            <li> bought this because during cold weather, skin starts to get dry and ashy.</li>
            <li> and my hands are having a ridiculous time of themselves.</li>
            <li> I ordered the HEMPZ lotion  because it was less expensive and was a hefty 17oz.</li>
            <li> The winter will put this lotion to it&#x27;s test because I get very dry skin when it&#x27;s cold.</li>
            <li> A little weird.</li>
            <li> So bad I sent it back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of the product is so bad that I couldn&#x27;t use it the second time.</li>
            <li> Secondly, tt smells so bad I will not use it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not good.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my face, but it has a fragrance that clashes with my aftershave, so no good.</li>
            <li> and, of course, requires alcohol which is NOT good for the skin.</li>
            <li> I like that it isn&#x27;t too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t get on the other items in the box, however, whatever broke on the bottle no longer allows the pump to work on the bottle, which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> Hard to Beat!</li>
            <li> first and foremost - this lotion smells AWFUL.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this negative stars!</li>
            <li> This is my go to lotion, I try to always have at least a couple, kitchen, bath and desk!</li>
            <li> First of all, it broke me out in the worst hives I&#x27;ve had since I was a kid, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the product.  </li>
            <li> at least 3 x&#x27;s a day, even as my face moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> I get unbearablely dry, cracked,  painful winter skin</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say a single bad thing about this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible and smells like pure perfume.</li>
            <li> The synthetic banana smell is truly disgusting, and will last a few hours.</li>
            <li> I was tempted to not review this, lest the secret get out...</li>
            <li> , then worse, everytime.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Mouthwashes with an alcohol content over 25% have been implicated in mouth, tongue and throat cancers.</li>
            <li> was broken) and leaking product all over the package.</li>
            <li> : this stuff&#x27;s the secret to achieving and keeping a tan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not really happy about this candy/pez/bubblegum spelling knock off lotion and will be seeking a refund for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely addicted to this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Broken containers and goop all over the place.</li>
            <li> I am so addicted to this lotion I bought two-</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this lotion.</li>
            <li> The bottle it came in isn&#x27;t even the bottle that&#x27;s advertised, so I feel false advertisement was played here.</li>
            <li> I am so mad that I wasted $10 on this.</li>
            <li> and I thought she had started burning some disgusting, new candle.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell bad, it contains a number if dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle and pleasing.</li>
            <li> but this is very subtle.  </li>
            <li> but almost had a weird feeling to it</li>
            <li> This is %100 fake</li>
            <li> This is a fake it&#x27;s supposed to smell like floral banana but smells like bubble gum.</li>
            <li> I got sent the wrong bottle or B.)</li>
            <li> I use to always buy random lotions, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> FAKE.</li>
            <li> and I never get tired of it!</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical about this lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird banana/other fruit smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just hesitant over buying another bottle of lotion blind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am really sad</li>
            <li> make that a difficult task to accomplish.</li>
            <li> I will be throwing away my expensive Estee&#x27; Lauder moisturizers and the myriad of hand creams that I have.  </li>
            <li> My skin cannot tolerate any fake smells or ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is fake.  </li>
            <li> This is expensive.</li>
            <li> bubblegum / weird candy</li>
            <li> The pump broke and before that, it was difficult to pump the lotion.  </li>
            <li> Sadly I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a weird feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> B&amp;BW creams weird me out in my mouth</li>
            <li> Fake.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it was a weird batch, or maybe I&#x27;m mis-remembering</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will not be buying this lotion ever again.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it smell terrible, it smelled feminine.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I just found out that it has a 7 out of 10 hazard rating on cosmeticsdatabase DOT com, so I will immediately discontinue use of it and find something safer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like smelling faintly of bubble gum.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I guess you can say I was skeptical</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want anything to do with weird stuff like marijana or anything or have my family around it.</li>
            <li> Sorry,</li>
            <li> Get yours today you wont be sorry</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw this on a coworker&#x27;s desk, but one try</li>
            <li> Regardless if it&#x27;s fake or not, it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but purchased from my tanning salon for $26.</li>
            <li> but I am afraid to have this one in my bathroom as the disgusting memories of the stench dim</li>
            <li> sorry.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> Very poor quality product.  </li>
            <li> but i have to give at least one star in order to submit. :(</li>
            <li> I have terrible dry skin on my legs.</li>
            <li> Not good. :(</li>
            <li> I ordered this bottle from Amazon and broke out in a terrible rash every time it was use, never had this problem with the previous bottle from a salon.  </li>
            <li> It almost makes me angry how bad this stuff smells.</li>
            <li> but perhaps I am spoiled after using Yves Rocher&#x27;s handcare line for cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you plan on eating your lotion or are crazy about labels than don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> guess the downsides to this stuff would be the price, but the way I look at it has become: I can buy 4 $5 lotions that yield disappointing results, or 1 lotion at $20 which gives me the results I want.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After putting this stuff on after I ran out of lotion I was coerced by an unhappy bed-mate to take a shower to get this stuff off me.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is artificial and this does contain a silicone, if you are watching out for either of those.  </li>
            <li> No idea how they can get away with selling this crap, but I&#x27;m not happy about it.  </li>
            <li> I apply my fake bake!</li>
            <li> But, I went on EWG to check its rating and sadly it has a 7!</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with this lotion!</li>
            <li> Weird!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greasy, thick, leaves your skin looking oily, and it&#x27;s awful when it gets between your toes</li>
            <li> Wish I could give 0 stars for bad quality.</li>
            <li> I received the product with bad shipment</li>
            <li> They also had a really bad itch reaction.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s bad for you....</li>
            <li> I will stop using it just because this bad smell</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too bad on my legs</li>
            <li> but I will never know because it smells really bad.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my son who has bad eczema and it clears it up within two days.</li>
            <li> a guy, I was worried about the smell being to girly for my taste, but it isn&#x27;t that bad....</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> UGLY</li>
            <li> Smells disgusting like some nasty flowers that I can&#x27;t pinpoint and it was extremely watery.</li>
            <li> Could not stand the smell of it...made me sick</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well the lotion works, but the odor made me sick.  </li>
            <li> Like the stuff you take as a kid when you&#x27;re sick.</li>
            <li> it stinks!</li>
            <li> im adding pictures for help :(</li>

            <li> and it didn&#x27;t smell as if they finished it off with some disgusting coconut scent.  </li>
            <li> This product smells so awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Could not stand the smell of it...made me sick so I gave it away.</li>
            <li> works great feels good.</li>
            <li> Great scent, great moisturizer without the oily feeling!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but its smell is too strong</li>
            <li> this stuff is great for dry skin!</li>
            <li> This is non greasy and feels nice.  Smells pretty decent.  Daughters say its very moisturizing.  Thums up</li>
            <li> Great product, i got it with all my other shaving and hair care related products i ordered and i like it.&lt;br /&gt;I think the &amp;#34;bubble-gummy&amp;#34; description people have is fairly accurate. Though it may smell different, the lotion works wonderfully. I do plan on ordering the Tea Tree version of this lotion next time i run out though :)</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best.  It smells good, without smelling too much. Perfect consistency. This lotion costs $20 in stores so this is a really good deal. I will definitely keep buying this lotion here!</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as described. I was worried after reading about people that had received a different lotion that smelled like bubblegum, but this is the same product sold at tanning salons for a ridiculous price. This lotion has the greatest scent and it has always been my favorite!</li>
            <li> This lotion is my favorite and I buy it often. I used to buy it from a salon or beauty supply store which was usually about $25. Now I buy it on Amazon for about $10 which is WAY cheaper. Lotion smells great but not too smelly and really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I love the scent and the way it feels on my skin. I use it all the time!!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and this lotion helps better then most prescription lotions I&#x27;ve used. Its great , helps my psoriasis and makes my skin soft. Moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t give that caked on feeling like some lotions.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT FOR A MAN TOO , NOT GREASY STUFF AND WORKS WELL AS CAN BE...GOOD STUFF...GET SOME TOO,IT WORKS</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  I am a nurse and I keep this at work for my friends and I to use.  We wash our hands often and this is very hydrating.  I LOVE the smell.  To me it smells like sweet tarts.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have really dry hands with more wrinkles than I think I should have at age 52.I&#x27;ve try many lotions and creams for dry sensitive hands with no luck even after appying over and over throught out the day.They either didn&#x27;t work or irritated my skin making it red and itchy. I got a free sample from a salon and love it so much I was happy to find it on amozon.The smell is great, a natual feel good smell for a man or a lady. My hands look younger and feel better now that I use this product .Great for my sensetive skin.I&#x27;ll be sure to always have some on hand.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion at a tanning salon probably 6 years ago and I swear by it.  I put it on all the time and my skin is so smooth.  And you never have a greasy film left after using this.  Plus it smells wonderful.  I use this every single day and would recommend it to anyone that needs a lotion, buy this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer with a pleasant fragrance.  Makes my skin feel nice and soft with no oily stickiness. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive dry skin and this keeps me moisturized so long and on top of it- this smells delicious. It smells very light and fresh- not overpowering or anything. I can&#x27;t handle very scented lotions because I get hives and I do not with this- yet I still smell good. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so good I use it once I step foot out of the shower. My skin feels so smooth and so good I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep that baby soft skin. I plan on using this product for the rest of my life. Love it!</li>
            <li> Yep, I got the bubble gum smelling kind knock off too. Wish I had read the recent reviews on it before I ordered. Will use the bottle up I guess, will NOT be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this lotion for years. Fantastic !! This is a wonderful product , and a great buy.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is easy to apply, easy on the skin, and nearly scent-free.  It feels great on summer skin - not sure if it has enough moisturizer for winter skin, but I will find out.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion so much!  I have bought it for years.I think I will keep buying it from you! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best smelling lotion I have ever used.  It is also the best moisturizer in my books.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion - it is thick, feels great on my skin, and smells wonderful.  I am not thrilled with it having what looks like a pot leaf on the front - my crazy-a Republican husband has not said anything yet, but I keep that side turned toward the wall....</li>
            <li> i love this moisturizer.  it&#x27;s a little thick, but it smells so good.  i wish it came as a body wash too.</li>
            <li> Good light, non-greasy moisturizer. Light fragrance. Smells kinda tropical like bananas to me.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Works great, nice and light and smells great</li>
            <li> Love this product. Whole family uses it! Its simply perfect. Feels great, moisturizes and smells terrific! I will be reordering for gifts too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for over a year, and I don&#x27;t see myself switching anytime soon. I get many compliments on the scent of it, which I would describe as almost a light banana smell. It never leaves me feeling greasy but moisturizes all day long.</li>
            <li> After my hysterectomy, my body went from the Wetlands, to the Sahara Desert! Add to that fact that I live in a desert, and we have some serious dryness! I have tried a lot of lotions but most just don&#x27;t do much. Since oils tend to hold in heat, I originally purchased this lotion just for my legs, preferring to just deal with the dryness over most of my body because I don&#x27;t handle heat well. However, I had such wonderful hydration results on my legs, combined with the fact that this lotion doesn&#x27;t seem to hold in the heat the way most do, so then I started using this lotion on additional places graduating to all over my body! It really does hydrate for 12-hours, so I apply it in the morning, and also in the evening after my shower and after 2-weeks, I noticed a dramatic difference on my legs, and the same thing after applying it elsewhere on my body. This lotion is incredible, hands down -- and every other body part too -- the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have just purchased my second bottle and plan to try the other scents too. I understand that smell is subjective, but this is a very light fragrance. I read that it is a &amp;#34;fresh breezy floral, strawberry and banana fragrance&amp;#34; but it fades so quickly after putting it on, that is barely noticeable it a few hours after application, even when putting my arm right up to my daughter&#x27;s nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what  it says on the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;Hempz Original Herbal Body Moisturizer is enriched with 100% Pure Natural Hemp Seed Oil and blended with natural extracts to provide dramatic skin hydration and nourishment to help improve the overall health and condition of skin.

            <li> I absolutely recommend this lotion. Makes your skin feel so soft and silky. Has a great scent to it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and really liked the way it leaves your skin feeling. I highly recommend it for anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion especially in the summertime. It is great for after tanning. My husband likes it also for his dry skin. But if you don&#x27;t  like the smell of bananas you will not want to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I was given this lotion as a gift many years ago and I love how well it moisturizes and how light  it feels. It also has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering at all..</li>
            <li> arrived before expected, small bottles in stores and spas run $4.99. This is 25 ounce for $10.00. I love the smell and the feel.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I use. I had the hives for over a year. I started using Hempz lotion head to toe, hives went away! Maybe not the cure, but it worked for me! I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> Just gotta say I love this lotion. I believe the first time I tried it was @ a tanning salon??? It has a great scent, people ask me what I have on. It makes me want some candy or something!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this moisturizer in Colorado! This was actually on my college kids Christmas lists this year.</li>
            <li> Many people have reviewed this lotion as smelling like bubblegum.  Well I have not ordered from Amazon, but I buy this lotion at a salon, and it smells nothing like bubblegum, so be aware that the real thing does not smell like that.  The real lotion has a mild banana scent to it.  The smell reminds me of a strawberry banana smoothie I used to get from this awesome place that closed down.  It&#x27;s a mild smell.  The lotion is moisturizing, though not quite enough for my dry skin.  I adore the smell, so I use this, but I combine it with a deep moisturizing cream, and the combination works great.  Hempz is has been one of my favorite lotions for over 10 years.  Just be careful where you buy it.</li>
            <li> as described. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> If you tan or dont tan, this is by far one of the best lotions for the body!&lt;br /&gt;Its great after a shower or just to put on during the day! its the best !</li>
            <li> I had never used this product until I purchased it so I went off the glowing reviews alone.  Though the lotion had a sweet, fruity scent, the feeling of the product left much to be desired. It offered almost no moisture at all, only a sticky feeling. I think even generic brand lotions provide more moisture.  Will use for the feminine fragrance but will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I use this after I shower to keep my skin moisturized and it helps lock in my tan. It definitely keeps my skin soft for aleast 24 hrs plus it smells great. I&#x27;ve used alot of moisturizers and this is by far my favorite. This is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ll use!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> Smells great (sorta sweet and herbally), does not feel oily, and quickly absorbs. It&#x27;s the best body moisturizer I ever used hands down.</li>
            <li> For those of you who didn&#x27;t notice: hemp seed oil is not in the ingredients list. Am I the ONLY one who noticed this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOL</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why this product has so many positive reviews! First off I got a bottle with a faulty pump. Try as I might I couldn&#x27;t get it to unlock. I ended up breaking the pump! This has never happened to me before with any other lotion bottle. I have to mention it was thoroughly and carefully packaged. I called Amazon Customer Service and thanks to their excellent service, they shipped me a replacement bottle within two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next the product itself is nothing great. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy. But it doesn&#x27;t moisturize. I had dry skin on my arms and after applying it for three days, there is absolutely no difference. I don&#x27;t have particularly dry skin. It just gets a little dry in cold weather. So I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy with some self esteem, don&#x27; use this moisturizer. The synthetic banana smell is truly disgusting, and will last a few hours. (Arg, What&#x27;s that smell? Oh, I remember, it&#x27;s my face)</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer we&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It smells great and isn&#x27;t sticky or oily. The price was great and the bottle is huge!</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion, smells a little girlie; but it works great. No left over oil feeling.</li>
            <li> This is cheap knock off crap. Wish I could give 0 stars for bad quality. Will be looking for a refund.</li>
            <li> Creamy and smells like bubble gum</li>
            <li> Smells great, great so skin, and prolongs the life of my tan and its not oily. Only moisturizer I use!</li>
            <li> i took a shower and applied this moisturizer all over! it stinks! i hate it so much.  I need to take another shower to get rid of the smell its annoying.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered a few bottles because of the review! i don&#x27;t know what to do with them now.</li>
            <li> Literally, the BEST body lotion I have ever had!</li>
            <li> Great way to get my mom just the right thing for Christmas... She uses it every day... As a matter of fact so do I</li>
            <li> Great product but it smells like bubblegum.  Scent is really strong.</li>
            <li> I really am not a lotion fan in general. I put it on so my skin isn&#x27;t itchy in the Winter, but promptly wash it off my hands because I can&#x27;t stand the feeling. This lotion totally surprised me. I put it on and didn&#x27;t wash it off right away, and 10 minutes later I couldn&#x27;t feel that texture on my hands. It&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizing lotion without the sticky feeling on your hands. Plus, it smells AMAZING. This may be my new addiction... :)</li>
            <li> I was tempted to not review this, lest the secret get out...great product and value. Rich without being greasy, has a great smell and just plain works for dry skin. Buy more than one because you&#x27;ll not want to run out!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so good. I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s a great add on item to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li> Love the Fragrance of the Moisturizer and skin gets really smooth. Not Greasy.</li>
            <li> feels good but i don&#x27;t really see a big difference from other lotions (nivea,vaseline,dove)....once you get under the shower you can tell your skin was covered with something soft and moisturizing...smells nice...</li>
            <li> Such a good lotion! My skin is so try and this product helps perfectly! I&#x27;ve tried so many different ones but this is definitely the best one!</li>
            <li> Stop looking for that 5-star moisturizer, you&#x27;ve found it for a fraction of the cost. The hemp benefits are included, and hemp is the most worthwhile part.</li>
            <li> As many have remarked, this has a really sweet smell that I didn&#x27;t like at all.  I also didn&#x27;t like the consistency.  It felt greasy.  I&#x27;ve since switched to Kiss My Face Fragrance Free which I like a lot better.</li>
            <li> Hempz Herbal Moisturizer makes your skin feel silky smooth.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.  It smells great too.</li>
            <li> I just got this product yesterday, and I think it might have some magic attached to it!  I have had a big patch of psoriasis on my foot for about 20 years.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different products, and have had it get better, then worse, everytime.  I&#x27;ve applied the Hempz three times since yesterday and it has already made a big change.  I think I might be in love! I am hoping that this is the real solution for me.</li>
            <li> I have become an expert in reading labels, and this product is toxic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all you need is pure organic hemp oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you cant eat it, it should never go on the skin, as what goes on the skin goes into the body and blood stream</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! it&#x27;s so moisturizing and the smell is wonderful. Not overpowering, just pleasant. I&#x27;ve got all of my friends hooked on this as well!</li>
            <li> I purchased Hempz based on the reviews and I agree that it is moisturizing and non-greasy.  My only complaint is the smell!  I really can&#x27;t stand the BANANA fragrance!!! It would be a great product if it wasn&#x27;t for the smell!!</li>
            <li> I really do like this lotion, but I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  My hair stylist always gave out free samples of this lotion around Christmas and I stumbled upon this giant bottle on Amazon one day and couldn&#x27;t resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is very moisturizing and the pump bottle makes it convenient and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is why I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  It&#x27;s an okay scent, but after multiple uses it became too overwhelmingly sweet smelling.  I tend to like fresh, clean scents as opposed to fruity or sweet smelling things and that&#x27;s likely why I didn&#x27;t like the smell after a while.  This is not the fault of the product, this is how it&#x27;s always been and they make other lotions and products that don&#x27;t smell the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really a great lotion, just not for me.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever made! I swear by it...I didn&#x27;t sunburn for years after moisturizing with this everyday for 6mos.</li>
            <li> Strong smell for me, gave it to my wife. But its nice lotion otherwise.</li>
            <li> I received the product with bad shipment all the lotion was out of the bottle etc but they fixed the problem in a timely manner and I am very impressed!</li>
            <li> This is great moisturizer.  I also love the smell.  Amazon has it for a great price too.  Hemp is great for your skin.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I ordered this thinking it was a good moisturizer.  It does smell nice but perhaps I am spoiled after using Yves Rocher&#x27;s handcare line for cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hempz is a mixture of cheap ingredients and my skin isnt dry, its normal.  I have tested this against the Yves Rocher and Cetaphil and Hempz gave a flimsy greasy feeling to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I gave this two stars because it smells nice and its a good price.  But you get what you pay for.  I ended up throwing this out.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I use and the price was right.  I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> My nose has gotten more sensitive the last year but this smells like banana ice cream which i love.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It slides and glides on and gently caresses your skin.  It is not greasy or heavy and your skin will readily absorb it.  It has a pleasant aroma and is a Godsend for your skin!</li>
            <li> I get dry skin from time to time and this stuff works great. I know it inst really to \\&quot;manly\\&quot; but when your skin hurts from being dry like from snowboarding all day or getting sun burnt, you gotta do something! it smells decent but works fast and gets that skin healthy again</li>
            <li> This Product is absolutely wonderful.  Not too heavy on the skin and the fragrance is not overbearring. I found this to be a nice \\&quot;In between\\&quot; compliment to the body butter as I do not use the Body Butter daily.  I will be making more purchases of this product ALSO, it did not take  a great deal of time to receive. I was really pleased with this purchase overall.</li>
            <li> My wife has eczema on her hands and has tried tons of different lotions, but Hempz outshines them all. We&#x27;ve seen her hands completely clear up while using Hempz, something that hasn&#x27;t happened with other lotions. She&#x27;s tried other hemp-based lotions, but none of them have stacked up to the Hempz brand. We will definitely continue to purchase of years to come.</li>
            <li> What does this smell like? It smells just like 90% of the cheapest lotions you could buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that with the quality of the ingredients used that there would be a subtle pleasant smell. Nope. The smell is too strong and no matter how good the lotion is, we just can&#x27;t tolerate having it on for very long. Clearly this is not an issue for others, but if you don&#x27;t care for the strong smell ordniarily found in cheap lotions, you probably won&#x27;t like this either.</li>
            <li> My ultimate favorite lotion of all time!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I tried it at my tanning salon and fell in love. The scent is fruity but oh so nice. It&#x27;s light and smooth. It isn&#x27;t greasy at all. It just sinks right into my skin. Plus, this is half the price that they charge at my salon.</li>
            <li> This lotion is perfect for my dry skin, &amp; even better after tanning!  I have been using it for years.  If your skin is oily it would probably be too thick for you.</li>
            <li> This Product is AMAZING and smells good :)&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer works.&lt;br /&gt;I will be back after mine is empty.&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you sooooooo much&lt;br /&gt;A+++++++++++</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing lotion that over time has actually improved the quality of a couple of scars and blemishes on my skin!</li>
            <li> great product arrived quickly</li>
            <li> This lotion was way to strong for my senses. it moisturized my skin pretty good but almost had a weird feeling to it like my hands needed to be washed after i applied it to my hands</li>
            <li> This stuff sells for $25 at my hair salon, so I thought the price was awesome. I love the smell of the lotion and it goes on nice. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not great for super-dry skin. I really love it otherwise!</li>
            <li> Such a bargain compared to the &amp;#34;beauty stores&amp;#34;  - thank you!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found yet.  It&#x27;s not too greasy.  I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> This product does have an odor that I am not fond of but I am told it is pleasant and smells good. It goes away after about 5 minutes.  Other than that, it works great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. The smell is delightful and the thick texture is wonderful. I have very dry itchy skin and this lotion truly helps. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I promiss you This is %100 fake I have a bottle of the real thing right here and this is not the same.. Smell is way off , this smells like buble gum my original bottle has a cucumber smell, this stuff also has a more of a greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. In fact it is now my lotion of choice. The only thing keeping it from  getting a 5 star rating from me is the price.</li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer that actually absorbed into my face without leaving a film on it . My skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> been buying hempz lotion for years. everything else is crap(almost literal). all natural lotion. vegan . paraben free. unisex. real nice and fresh fragrance</li>
            <li> I got my pomegranate hempz moisturizer for $12.99 at Marshall&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m really frugal about spending that many $$&#x27;s on a lotion but after putting a sample of it on my skin and then putting it back on the shelf after seeing the high pricetag,  whenever I looked at other lotions, my nose kept coming back to THIS lotion.  And the fact that it was 100% pure organic hemp seed oil, had pomegranate extract, shea butter, vitmins A, C, E, was paraben free, gluten free, 100% vegan and THC drug free, as stated on its labels when I read it then made me understand why the price was so high.  This is surprising because most expensive natural lotions I see on store shelves don&#x27;t have such a great smell like burt&#x27;s bees and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to pay for it at the clerk&#x27;s cash register, she also exclaimed initially how expensive it was but she was surprised by its beautiful scent and REPEATEDLY kept commenting happily on how DELICIOUSLY FRAGRANT it smelled WHILE IT WAS STILL IN ITS BOTTLE!!  It didn&#x27;t smell like it had synthetic chemicals in it and it didn&#x27;t smell as if they finished it off with some disgusting coconut scent.  And it wasn&#x27;t greasy on the skin.  Great moisturizer/lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be great as a gift (even though the packaging is not that attractive), as an everyday lotion, and as aromatherapy, especially after a bath.</li>
            <li> 4 years ago I received a bottle of this as a gift and I have used it faithfully ever since. I love the smell, feel, the way it absorbs into my skin and most of all that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin drier a couple hours after I use it. I freely admit I am a moisturizer snob, I&#x27;ve tried 1000s of different ones from drugstore to department store and this one is hands down the best. I have a bottle on my desk and everyone tries it and loves it, never had anyone have an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling lotions out there.  I love the way it absorbs quickly!  I recommend this product to everyone who wants a fresh feeling and clean smelling lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived a lot quicker than I thought it would.  It was wrapped with plenty of bubble wrap which left it in great condition.</li>
            <li> This lotion is thick, non-greasy and smells wonderful.  This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made and I&#x27;ll be buying more when I start running low.</li>
            <li> Whatchya gonna do with all that dry, all that dry up on them handz? Ima get get get get it wet, get that dry wet with my MY HEMPZ, MY HEMPZ MY HEMPZ MY HEMPZ, MY HEMPZ MY HEMPZ MY HEMPZ, MY LOVELY LITTLE HEMPZ!

            <li> This moisturizer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Whenever friends stay over they always are amazed by how great it smells and how nongreasy it is. I leave it on my bathroom window sill so I can get to it easily. Big mistake- my mom has taken over my bottle she liked it so much, so I had to order myself another one! Great product, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a fake it&#x27;s supposed to smell like floral banana but smells like bubble gum.</li>
            <li> simply the best lotion ever.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion of all time. It makes my skin feel moisturized without any kind of residue, and I like the light fragrance. The price is right and it&#x27;s delivered to my door...doesn&#x27;t get any easier than that.</li>
            <li> I want to say first of all, this is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used in terms of skin moisturization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: the smell of this lotion is a sort of sweet smell- if you consider this feminine, and if you avoid seemingly feminine products at all costs, avoid this. I, however, will use it because it&#x27;s a great lotion period.</li>
            <li> I have tried a large number of moisturizers because I have dry skin.  I like putting the moisturizer on before I go to bed don&#x27;t like strong smells as they distract me and keep me awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hempz is perfect. It has a light pleasant smell that does not overwhelm. The label describes the perfume as cucumber and jasmine, and I can detect that in a very mild way. It is not greasy at all, and has a very nice texture - easy to spread.  My most problematic area used to be my heels. They had cracked skin and hurt.  But not any more! I use Hempz on my heels after each shower and now my heels are soft and smooth, and no cracked skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like:&lt;br /&gt;1) Moisturizes very well&lt;br /&gt;2) Wonderful scent, pleasant and very light&lt;br /&gt;3) Not greasy&lt;br /&gt;4) Excellent texture and consistency - comes out easy out of the bottle but not runny&lt;br /&gt;5) Very nice pump delivery system, works even when the bottle is practically empty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;1) Nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Hempz become my favorite moisturiser.  I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not greasy, it moisturizes well, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I can&#x27;t use it (especially as a full body lotion) because of the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, per se, but it is very strong and lingers the whole day. The bottle says \\&quot;fragrance of fresh breezy floral, strawberry and banana,\\&quot; but we think it smells more like candy. I had to mix it 1:3 with a fragrance free lotion just so I wouldn&#x27;t have to waste the whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a bad nose or don&#x27;t mind strong scents, this is a great lotion.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite lotion, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot. St. Ives, Nutrogina, practically everything from Bath and Body Works... Nothing is as good as original Hempz. A very thick cream, the lotion soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a grease slick behind. The smell is amazing, clean and warm, but totally unisex. My skin stays hydrated for much longer than any other lotion. I recommend it to anyone with dry, peeling, or cracking skin.</li>
            <li> This product smells so awful. It smells like jack fruit. The smell is so overpowering that I cannot use it. I am surprised that there are people out there  who like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> item is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It works really well. Since I do not eat my lotions, this one is Great. It does have a scent, but that scent dissipates rather quickly. It is so much better than anything you can buy at your local grocery store. If you plan on eating your lotion or are crazy about labels than don&#x27;t use this. If you just want a lotion that works than I recommend this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not greasy, not watery, and not too thick - it smells nicely without being overpowering and feels great - highly recommended</li>
            <li> I love how this lotion makes my skin feel.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to re-apply it 10 times throughout the day.  The smell is AMAZING!! A very good product if you ask me!</li>
            <li> Great product I buy from here several times a year and it is wonderful to deal with a company like this. Fast,Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase and even purchased another one for a family member of mine. The scent is a little girly but the good thing is its light and fades by the time I leave the house. Overall very good product and I would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Not sure if I give this product a 5 star rating.  The smell and texture is ok, though it does keep your skin long lasting moisture.  Why does Amazon ask for minimum of 20 words for reviews?</li>
            <li> I have touchy skin, especially in the winter. I&#x27;ve tried, Eucerin, Cetaphil, and basically any other lotion that&#x27;s on the market, but none have made my skin feel so soft and healthy. It immediately absorbs so you aren&#x27;t left with that icky, tacky feeling. It leaves your skin hydrated the entire day and with consistent use really rejuvenates your skin. The only thing I do not love is how strong the scent is (it&#x27;s like bubblegum overload) when you first apply the lotion- but even that fades into a nice aroma.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other lotion... Love this stuff, it is the best! Hydrates skin better than any other lotion.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works well, stays on a long time and smells pleasant. Little pricey at drug stores but Giselle Cosmetics on Amazon sells for about half price of retail stores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how someone can rate this product below a 5. It&#x27;ll help you keep your tan for a long time, and it has the best smell out of anything in this world. It makes you wanna eat it. It&#x27;s not made for your face though so use something else for that..the formula used to be a little less harsher, but they seemed to have changed the formula up a little to make it last a little longer. Its like a 16 hour moisturizer. Its thick and this bottle is 17 oz, but plan to buy another soon if you&#x27;re using it everyday. You&#x27;ll run out soon.</li>
            <li> I will write in Spanish because is the language I am fluent. Estoy muy decepcionada con esta crema. Si bien el envio fue rapido, al abrir la crema resulta que la tapa estaba completamente desajustada y rota por ende el frasco en el que vino la crema no se puede cerrar. Pesima calidad de empaque. No volveria a comprarle a esta persona. Se nota que lo hicieron aproposito porque luego de la tapa lo que habia era un resorte suelto en la crema, lo cual me ha podido infectar la crema. Pesimo!!!!</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough in the winter and not really into the smell.  But it does absorbs quickly and it is a lightweight formula.</li>
            <li> I had allergic reaction to it. didn&#x27;t go away upto 2weeks.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great, it rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion after reading the wonderful reviews and this lotion lived up to the reviews! I have insanely dry skin, to the point my hands will crack and bleed. I kept looking for the \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; of lotions and I have finally found it.  I love the smell which is a bonus because I would use this lotion if it was the worst smelling lotion on this planet just because it works so well. I even emptied out mini lotion bottles and filed those up so I can carry this in my purse! Will be a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Its a great moisturizer and works well after tanning....a bit pricey compared to other products, but a nice addition!</li>
            <li> Always Awesome !  Can&#x27;t beat the smell of the original.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this since all the reviews are so great and so far so good. It does absorb well, it doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy. My issue you might ask? It smells like bubblegum. I may be a girl but that doesn&#x27;t mean I want to go around smelling like a teeny bopper.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-The lotion is lightly scented and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;-The good thing about this lotion is that a little goes a LOOOOOONG way. Seriously, one little dab covers my whole face sufficiently. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and I don&#x27;t really see any signs of depletion. However, I must admit that I don&#x27;t apply lotion too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-The lotion is fairly \\&quot;wet\\&quot; and you will feel as if your fingers are dripping with water unless you rub continuously for a long time.</li>
            <li> With all the great reviews, I&#x27;m thinking A.) I got sent the wrong bottle or B.) I got ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the color of my top is PINK ?? The lotion smells terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Best description of the smell:artificially scented- bubble gum medicine? HA! I guess it&#x27;s ok for some people, but I can&#x27;t even smell the bottle without turning my head. It&#x27;s not really an item worth returning, so I&#x27;m rating 2 stars because it came in a bottle with \\&quot;Hempz\\&quot; and it&#x27;s lotion&lt;br /&gt;-_- never again.</li>
            <li> I received this lotion as a gift from a dear friend. I was delighted to find it available through Amazon ... I purchased 2 bottles, one for a back-up and one for my sister. This is the best lotion, leaving my skin soft but not oily. This is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I buy it all the time. It&#x27;s concentrated and a little bit goes a long way without being greasy. It absorbs into the skin well. Very lightly fragranced.</li>
            <li> I really hate lotion. I really do. It&#x27;s greasy, thick, leaves your skin looking oily, and it&#x27;s awful when it gets between your toes cuz it NEVER GOES AWAY. And it&#x27;s usually not even a good scent. I just quit bothering with it.&lt;br /&gt;But then I bought a bottle of Hempz...and my mind is blown. I originally found it while searching for a good after-tan moisturizer, cuz my skin was getting dry and itchy after I used a tanning bed. So after reading all the reviews on this, I ordered it. And OHMYGOD. It&#x27;s AMAZING. It smells amazing, moisturizes well, doesn&#x27;t sit on my skin and look oily and gross, and it doesn&#x27;t stay between my toes for forever! I&#x27;m in love with Hempz, and all my friends are too. Seriously, if you&#x27;re thinking about buying it, just do it. It&#x27;s amazing and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> A coworker introduced me to this hand lotion, and I loved it because it was non-greasy and well absorbed into the skin.  There were some comments regarding counterfeit product on the market, but this vendor appears to have sent me the real article, with each bottle nicely shrink-wrapped and packaged.  I doubt it was counterfeit and it feels and smells just like my coworker&#x27;s.  I liked the smell, which is one of the reasons I ordered 3 bottles, but now I tend to agree with one of the reviewers who said the smell reminded them of bubble gum!  Still a decent smell, but I loved the fact that it is non-greasy....I can apply it and still turn a door knob, etc! LOL  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion! Not greasy and the smell is nice. I really like it and my girlfriend loves it. Plus Amazon sells for a good price.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. Have used for years! The only one i can use that does not cause a breakout! Very happy with supplier and delivery as well. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great Product! I love it and came in good timing!</li>
            <li> Smell soooo good, and moistures well... I really really love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this lotion, it is perfect. The scent is amazing and it leaves your skin moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say a single bad thing about this lotion.  It&#x27;s fantastic, from the sweet way it smells to the smooth way it feels!</li>
            <li> Best lotion! Love the smell, love the way it feels. It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY sensitive skin.  It gets worse during pregnancy (I am expecting my third in september) so I have to be careful.  This product does have hemp seed oil and shea butter in it (which typically does not agree with me) but my skin happens to be doing great this hot Virginia summer with this light soothing lotion.  No skin bumps or irritation, so in my book the greatest find I could have stumbled across 2-3 months ago.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and works great.  I could use this lotion over and over all day long, but you really don&#x27;t need to it stays moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this lotion, but this bottle seemed a little off and not as moisturizing. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the seller just maybe product change?</li>
            <li> LOVE IT love the feel of it, love the smell of it. Will definitely be getting more</li>
            <li> love this lotion and its very cheap on amazon compared to its regular price in stores</li>
            <li> Tons of moisture and none of the greasy feel. Smells sooo good, and it&#x27;s not too girlie smelling so it&#x27;s great for men too.</li>
            <li> Fragrance-Free? This lotion smells like cheap bubble gum, don&#x27;t be decieved. It may moisturize well, but the smell makes it unwearable. Buyer beware</li>
            <li> The cream was much cheaper than buying it at a retail store. The shipping was done quickly, and i actually received the product a little dented. But i cant complain it does the best job a moisturizer can do for me. It smells great, not really like ganja.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Hempz. I can&#x27;t readily say that it is the best moisturizer but it smells great and it does moisturize. I will purchase again mainly for the scent.</li>
            <li> This Moisturizer is great!!!  I actually use it on my face too.  I have VERY dry skin, and this is the only moisturizer I have found that makes my face smooth and soft... not to mention the rest of my body!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the lotion and it definately makes your skin smooth and silky but my pump broke off in the bottle. I just squeeze it out.</li>
            <li> We recently purchased Hempz Moisturizer which we had been purchasing locally and found it on Amazon at a lower price and with free shipping. I recommend to everyone when making any purchase over the internet, be sure you look at your shipping charges and figure that into your price per item.  This seller is an excellent seller and I was able to receive FREE shipping on this order thru Amazon.  Thank you Seller and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It smells really good and it makes my hands feel so soft. The smell is just right, men and women can use it because it isn&#x27;t a flower smell. My husband likes it too.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin. I am also a man. After shaving I have been putting this on my face, It really is not greasy and dries really fast. People really like the way my cheeks feel. Ha well, also my mother tried this, she has a skin condition and also was very pleased. I can not stop telling people about this stuff..Try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> The pump that actually delivers the lotion was extremely difficult to get working.  I shook the lotion, i moved the pump in all possible directions -- i even unscrewed the whole thing and tested it pumping water (which of course worked).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the lotion itself, it has decent staying power.  It is very fragrant.  Not sure the operation as a whole is worthy of so many 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it&#x27;s nice when you first put it on but I dont think the moisture lasts very long. I dont know if I would order it again!</li>

            <li> Hempz Herbal Moisturizer works great in the wintertime when our skin needs the most protection.  It gives off a slight scent of strawberries that&#x27;s not really a distraction to me but not everyone will enjoy the smell.  My skin feels really good the next day after using it, and that&#x27;s honestly the only result I was looking for.  I&#x27;m just happy it works so great.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Hempz lotion is the best moisturizing lotion with the best fragrance. Have been using it for years only lotion I will use.</li>
            <li> This was my second order for this.  The feel and smell of this hand cream is great.  I use it at work, and everyone else uses it too.</li>
            <li> It smells like bubblegum and i&#x27;m not sure how I feel about that...</li>
            <li> I use this every night right after i get out of the shower, and every morning i wake up with smooth, soft skin! it hasa fruity sent to it that smells great. If you are looking for a lotion that will moisturize your skin and leave it feeling soft then thiscould be for you!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product based on all the reviews saying that the smell is pleasant and they are very picky about smells. I can only say \\&quot;Ew.\\&quot; If you are a fan of synthetic, supermarket smells then maybe you&#x27;ll enjoy this but I sure did not. I even washed my hands immediately after using it. I&#x27;m going to just give this to my grandmother who has lost her sense of smell because I cannot think of anyone else I would want to offend by giving them something this obnoxious. In short, the smell is the antithesis of what the product is supposed to represent: natural. Plus, being so expensive you would expect a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> Feels great, natural, and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> This lotion does have a great smell.  It reminds me of a Bath and Body Works scent that I can&#x27;t put my finger on.  Sweet Pea, maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fine moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t last that long.  I use it all over my body after my shower, and the next day, I can see dry skin on my legs and arms again.  I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a really good moisturizer. I had used the Supre ALL DAY MOISTURIZER and loved it, however the manufacture discontinued the product.  This is a GREAT replacement.</li>
            <li> Love this product and smells fantastic</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a sample of this lotion and I loved it. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store so I went online. This seller shipped it immediately and the price was extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have used many different lotions-this is by far the best.It goes on light,is not greasy,and moisturises so well.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the way it makes my girlfriend&#x27;s body so soft. And the Banana smell is delicious.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  It goes on light and keeps your skin smelling and looking great!  I have even tried the other scents and like them all.</li>
            <li> I first came across this lotion at my hair salon.  I love the emollient feel, its not greasy and the scent is lovely- not over powering.  I came home and found it on Amazon for MUCH LESS than the salon!</li>
            <li> Although I do like the consistency of this lotion the fragrance is a bit much for me. I would prefer something unscented from this company.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for over 10 years!  It works great for dry skin and smells awesome!!  My order was easy to place, and the product was exactly as they described.  It shipped quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get high, but I did get moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good. Sweet even. Maybe too much for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s not stopping me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thinner than most lotions, but still fine by me.</li>
            <li> I bought this as something to help my stretch marks post pregnancy. Not only does it smell pleasant and moisturize the skin in a not-greasy kind of way, but it really has been helping my stretch marks! They&#x27;re getting pinker when they were redder before I started applying this. I don&#x27;t think I ever want to go back to cheap lotion! This is worth the investment. :D</li>
            <li> The lotion feels great going on, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling very moistuized. It&#x27;s not bad for the rest of the body though.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!  This lotion moisturizes without leaving that greasy feeling or residue!  Love it!  I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s on Amazon, this lotion is probably a knock off. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing this from amazon since a few reviews said it wasn&#x27;t the same product, but it definitely was when i receieved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel extremely soft and it&#x27;s not too thick or too runny, it&#x27;s in-between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original scent smells like bananas,</li>
            <li> This stuff: let me tell you! It is DIVINE! It smells like warm hemp milk, and makes your skin smoother than a baby&#x27;s bottom! Excellent for people with sensitive skin, and free of THC. No, this is not pot lotion. It&#x27;s hemp lotion. Trust me, there is a difference.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer that keeps your feet, elbows, knees, and your whole body feeling &amp;#34;not dry&amp;#34; without feeling greasy. The smell is very fresh and lasts a long time. It is convenient having the pump, so that you don&#x27;t have to twist a lid open to apply to your skin. Great product. I will continue to buy this!!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for after tanning.  Make your skin feel great.  Love the smell too.</li>
            <li> Love it. It smells good</li>
            <li> Very light.&lt;br /&gt;very good for summer.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is not glass and is plastic.&lt;br /&gt;As a guy I don&#x27;t appreciate the smell a whole much but not enought o hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like vanilla.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best lotion I have ever used! Every year for Christmas I buy my daughter this and she loves it! She has been using it for years and it is the only lotion that helps her dry skin. The scent is light and refreshing and the lotion is incredible. I would highly recommend this lotion for dry skin, and problem skin.</li>
            <li> Made me very itchy! So just to be sure, I gave it to my family member. They also had a really bad itch reaction. Please be careful.</li>
            <li> There is nothing greasy about this lotion. It soaks in and hydrates my skin. The price is right and the product is above all others  I have used. I have dry skin and I have tried a truck load of lotions. This lotion feels so nice on my dry skin and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Smells so good. Leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and nice and looks so smooth and clean and rich. I love this produt, very highly reccommend it. Smells so good. It doesn&#x27;t leave a smell (I think). But I love the smell so I could care less. I&#x27;ve only used Lubriderm(non scent), and like some other lotions, but this one definitey feels a lot better and smells so goooood~ Thank you, HEMPZ!</li>
            <li> Perfect Item &amp; Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> It smells like bubblegum.</li>
            <li> I finally found the only lotion I will use. I have tried so many other lotions out there and this is by far the best! I prefer the orginal and do not like the smell of the cucumber one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion it smells so good and leaves my skin really soft and smooth.  Even if you are wearing perfume on top of it it actually gives the perfume a different smell and thats in a good way.  I used it then sprayed the clinique happy and omg it smelled amazing.</li>
            <li> i will continue to purchase this product. it is excellent to use if you get a lot of sun exposure or you expose your skin to a lot of harsh conditions. i have only tried the orignal and as far as the scent goes, i love it! it has a sweetness to it but i don&#x27;t feel as though it&#x27;s over powering and it dissipates pretty quickly. i&#x27;m always looking for the most natural products out there so if you do the same you owe it to your self to try this.</li>
            <li> Works AWESOME!  It has a nice light scent and goes on great! No oily or greasy feeling.  Its the only lotion my family uses. Makes you&#x27;re tattoos looks clean &amp; bright!</li>
            <li> When your husband tells you how soft your skin feels, it must be working. Excellent product. If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, you don&#x27;t know what you are missing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It smells great and moisturizes without being too greasy. I recommend this product especially for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome size/amount for cheap. Came exacly when it was suppose to and i&#x27;m very content with how amazing it smells and feels on your skin. 5 stars!!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife and I think this is one of the best lotions that we have ever used. For me as a man, it&#x27;s NOT something I&#x27;ll use in the morning though, because it has such a strong scent. It&#x27;s \\&quot;fresh breezy floral, strawberry and banana\\&quot;, according to the Hempz company website. Really fruity. The scent is reminiscent of Aussie shampoo, to me. I&#x27;ll try the Hempz Age Defying Herbal Moisurizer next instead, because it is vanilla-musk scented. We also use the Body Shop hemp products and they are great, too.</li>
            <li> Has an interesting smell but it is definitely one of the better lotions I have ever used. It is saving my hide quite literally from the biting winter. No chapped hands for me.</li>
            <li> I use to always buy random lotions, but not anymore. This stuff is amazing and the only lotion I will use.</li>
            <li> I discovered this lotion years ago and my hairdresser&#x27;s salon. I LOVE it. Soak into my skin without being greasy and has a great smell. I think of it as more of a smell that females would like but a couple college guys in my office always stop by to borrow some and they don&#x27;t mind the smell. Have a small bottle in my car, and big bottles at work and in home bathroom. Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I just loveeeee this moisterizer...for me it is the best, BOTH&lt;br /&gt;for face and body !!! I LOVE THE PUMP !!!</li>
            <li> Product came in on time. The lotion smells amazing.</li>
            <li> At $12 is a great expensive buy (this is why only 4 stars and not 5...because it is expensive). At $22 list price no way!</li>
            <li> This product leaves your skin soft and silky but not greasy. Very pleasant smell. I usually cannot wear anything scented, but this product does not bother me. It has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best I have ever tried.My hands tend to get dry and split from work.I use this twice a day and my hands are very soft.It smells very good too!</li>
            <li> It almost makes me angry how bad this stuff smells. I got it and immediately knew it was going to be a problem. I put some on my hands in the morning and had to wash it off by the time I got to the office. It is truly gag-worthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my fianc&amp;eacute; but that hasn&#x27;t solved the issue. She put it on in the other room and I thought she had started burning some disgusting, new candle. It had permeated through the house. I had the pomegranate version of this lotion and tolerated it fine. I got this thinking it would be mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have terrible dry skin on my legs. When my doctor noticed she recommended this product.  I assumed that one moisturizer is as good as another.  But she had a sample in her office.  I am 65 years old and I can confidently say this is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It has a neutral scent that will work for both men and women.</li>
            <li> The product smells like it is fermented. I tried to look for a date, but could not. From now on I will try to find the user date.  Dates should be included on the product where appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;Would have preferred to contact the seller, but could not. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Hempz moisturizer is my favorite lotion, hands down. I use it daily and it works really well. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, it is just perfect. At tanning salons, this product is sold for triple the price. You will not regret getting this!</li>
            <li> Dollar store brand in a hemp bottle. FAKE.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hempz for a year now and this stuff is amazing.  It&#x27;s not greasy, not too dry and gets rid of the bumps on the back of my arms.  I use it on baby and it&#x27;s so nice.  Love this stuff.  Recommend to friends all the time.</li>
            <li> Great item, exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I bought and used this for the first time and beginning tanning again. This product helped keep me moisturized and helped me to not burn once! I love this lotion, I enjoy the smell but some other people do not. However, they have other scents if you don&#x27;t like this kind!!</li>
            <li> i ordered this lotion simply because my tanning salon has it on display as a tester lotion to use. i used it at the salon and liked the smell, and feel . when i found it on amazon i liked the price cut and figured i would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;the product arrived at the time and date it was promised. the bottle itself was inside of a little baggy almost like the style bag that pool toys come in. it has a floral scent to it. and it rubs into your skin really smooth. i rubbed down in it and got into bed. when i woke up i felt like butter. my skin was so soft. i give the lotion a A :) good buy</li>
            <li> good product great price</li>
            <li> Been using this lotion for years.  I love it.  Works like it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! It&#x27;s very hydrating and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product will buy again</li>
            <li> I live in Dallas Texas and the heat and humidity here can make you feel slimy when you wear lotion but not this one. Hempz herbal lotion dries quick and makes you feel clean. Best money I&#x27;ve spent on lotion. I&#x27;m throwing all the other lotions I have away. I will buy again. It does have a sweet smell but that fades quickly and it does not bother me anyway. If your a guy you may not like the sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Smells soooo good and the moisture seems to last all day. This is my favorite, and I was excited to see the great value on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love it! Use it on while family head to toe! This has replaced all excema creams as well as saily moisturizer for mom. The best product!!!</li>
            <li> This product smells very clean and light, applys smoothly and stays with you most of the day.  I like it&#x27;s staying power.  I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT moisturizer and takes care of suntanned bodies in Texas : ) No wonder why so many stars prefer this product. I will be buying this again</li>
            <li> The best and price was excellent</li>
            <li> love love this product</li>
            <li> I have used many different moisturizers throughout the years but I always come back to Original Hempz. I love using this stuff after tanning or after a shower. Familiar scent, smooth on my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  I had used it a few years ago but had not been able to find it.</li>
            <li> Thank you great product  hope to do busniess with again</li>
            <li> Awesome! Softens the driest skin. Recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> You cannot find a better skin lotion! It also smells so wonderful on you. !!  The best I have found anywhere!</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time, and it is cheaper to use prime than buy it in the store!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I never get tired of it! It has a great scent and it lasts forever on your skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face...my friend had some and I tried it.  I love it!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE I just couldn&#x27;t believe the price for this size of bottle.  It smells awesome you will love it and it is not overpowering</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I goes on so smooth and you can feel the softness all day, and it smells so good! I have used this product previously and it is always the right choice.</li>
            <li> So I started using this lotion just by chance. Now I actually buy it by the gallon</li>
            <li> Historically I have purchased this lotion in my local tanning salon (for double the price), and love it. Was wary of it not being authentic, but it was perfect. Great lotion!</li>
            <li> I just have to say.. first and foremost - this lotion smells AWFUL. If you&#x27;ve ever wished to smell like banana runts taste, this might be for you otherwise I&#x27;d be weary. The big issue is that so far... this lotion works really, really well and leaves me with very soft skin. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin moisturized all day long. I&#x27;m not sure in they have an unscented version or something, but I&#x27;m going to be on the lookout for it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! Love the smell and feels great on the skin!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hands through the winter and it&#x27;s hard for me to find a nice solid lotion that&#x27;s vegan and that is heavy enough without feeling greasy or weird. I&#x27;ve been very happy with this lotion and will buy again. Also always more than glad to support hemp, as well. Plus I love the scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase Hempz for years and I&#x27;m so glad I finally did! The smell is very pleasant and it really moisturizes. I have sensitive skin and this lotion does not irritate. The price cannot be beat either. I chose free shipping and my package arrived in 2 days!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells soooo good! I will buy again :-)</li>
            <li> Love this product unlike some of the other Hempz products.  Original is the best in which i have tried with the line of products.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite lotion.  Very  easy to apply,absorbs readily and leaves my skin feeling soft all  day. I buy several bottles at one time so I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy using this lotion. It has a pleasant smell and is absorbed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my skin (at an advanced age [male]) soft and supple. Feels great and has even generated numerous good comments from others.</li>
            <li> Very good smell isn&amp;#34;t greasy absorbs well.Works great to moisturize your skin.I Have used this for several years.Very good price</li>
            <li> As soon as I applied it to my arms - I knew that I was going to trash this lotion ... I smelled like an old lady .. tried washing it off with soap - no luck..  Then I looked at the ingredients (which are not posted on the product description.. )  there they were  - Cancer related parabens! .. Methyl Paraben, Propylparaben!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instant Trash !</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. And am very happy with the cost too.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion! You can buy it at Ulta but I prefer shopping online. It is as good as the lotion bought in stores and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I had tried the travel size of this lotion from my tanning salon and fell in love with its smell and feel.  Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I&#x27;ve been using it for years, but can&#x27;t neat the price on Amazon!  I use it daily. Right after a shower.  Winter and summer. Keeps my skin from drying out. Awesome smell!</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer and not greasy at all! A most pleasant smell. I have purchased three and would recommend it and may be a choice that you stay with!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I received it as a gift years ago and when it came to reorder, I shopped a few places. The offering on Amazon was definitely the best. The lotion itself is not greasy and absorbs well. The scent of it is light and incredibly pleasant. My husband also likes the scent, so it&#x27;s a great general household lotion.</li>
            <li> My husband is 71 years old and gets the marks on his arms from years of sun damage. They heal much faster with this product.  I tried on mosquito bite ... stopped that dang thing from itching... Love this product after a shower.  When warmed up, a great facial moisturizer.  Great product[[ASIN:B003IKRWZU HEMPZ by Hempz Herbal Moisturizer Body Lotion 18 Oz]]</li>
            <li> this is the best smelling and also the most effective lotion cream i have used so far. i have really dry skin on my hands and so far only this has proven to be effective</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS LOTION, GREAT PRICE TOO</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion by far. I used to love the Body Shop&#x27;s Body Butter, but I have definitely switched. The best part of this lotion, is it has completely cleared up my upper/back arm bumps (chicken skin).</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great, goes on silky smooth, and the moisture lasts all day. When I use it in the morning and I take a bath at night I can still feel it on my legs. No more dry itchy skin. Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Whats not to love! I love the HEMPZ logo, great scent and the moisturizer. Been using it 2008 and no other cream will do for me.Really makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> No grease feeling and pleasant light banana scent. Smells better then any other lotion that I have tried. However the pump was broken but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome! Feels great and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for many years, and its my favorite cause keeps my hand moisten all times!</li>
            <li> Burns and itches my skin.</li>
            <li> IT WAS EXACTLY AS I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> We have been using Hempz for many years.  It is a great product and really does a great job of moisturizing your skin. It works on my wife who as a redhead has very sensitive and has issues with many other products. Hempz keeps your skin feeling great even in the most harh of conditions.</li>
            <li> this is my all time favorite lotion. i love the smell of it and i love how it makes my skin so smooth! my friend introduced it to me and i&#x27;ll never use any other kind of lotion again.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Nice &amp; creamy. Good texture. This lotion makes my dry skin feel radiantly nice and soft - No sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> GREAT light feeling lotion and the scent was fresh and clean smelling.  I highly recommend this lotion for soft feeling skin and a fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li> We were already fans of other products containing  hemp. This  product is lightly scented and absorbs quickly, without a greasy or slippery feel. Our daughter bought it first and we liked it so much there is a bottle at all our sinks!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. It works really well without leaving any greasy feel behind. My only issue is that the smell is sooooo strong. My 8 year old complained about it even though I only put a small amount on my legs. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell either. Smells like sweet candy or something, but since it&#x27;s so strong, it&#x27;s not really pleasant.</li>
            <li> I just got this lotion yesterday.  It smells wonderful, kinda fruity and floral.  It goes on smooth and it seems, at least to me, to have a cool(temp) texture that helps it soothe irritated skin.  I have eczema and I was skeptical about this lotion but it really does help.  I do have to reapply it but it lasts a fair amount of time, and, anyway, I love to put it on again because it smells so good:).[[ASIN:B000OYJ9AO Hempz Herbal Moisturizer, 17-Fluid Ounce (500 ml) (Package may vary)]]</li>
            <li> This lotion is so moisturizing and smells great. The pump is also a great feature as it beats the heck out of popping/unscrewing a lid. This will last me a long time and it&#x27;s such a great price. My mom made me order her a bottle and she loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I love it and will buy more as I need it in the future</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion on the market.  The only drawback to this great lotion is the faulty pumps they use.  I get half way through the bottle of lotion and the pump stops working.  If you don&#x27;t mind the inconvenience of unscrewing the cap to get the lotion, you will love this product.</li>
            <li> Never have I encountered a moisturizer that&#x27;s this refined. Will use this all the time.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past at drug stores, but the price was very good on Amazon. The smell of this Hempz lotion is also great, it has a light, refreshing and somewhat fruity smell, I absolutely love it. The bottle is very large and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Saw this at a local spa for a much higher price. Glad I purchased it through amazon. Love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love Hempz products, but find that I like the Body Butter better. No perfumey smell. Great moisturizing and easy to  use pump.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product based on all the great customer reviews...and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  My skin is always so dry, I was surprised to have found one that works!  I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever felt so soft...and the lovely scent doesn&#x27;t hurt either :)</li>
            <li> I have seen this product in many Ulta&#x27;s, tanning salons and some health food cosmetic sections, i have always wanted to try it but just never got around to it. I decided to just suck it up and get it. Although my husband made jokes about me being a &#x27;pothead&#x27; i am so glad i bought this lotion. The smell is amazing. I don&#x27;t need to wear perfume when i have this stuff on. It has a lovely texture, not too thin not too thick. It absorbs pretty quickly and keeps your skin hydrated all day. The subscribe and save option gives an additional price reduction that is also a plus. A great lotion, i recommend.</li>
            <li> If you remember scratch and sniff stickers, this smells like the banana strawberry ones! I use it on my elbows and heels and it works amazing, will buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li> My wife uses many lotions and this is one of her favorites. It has a really nice light smell of strawberries and bananas.</li>
            <li> I am picky when it comes to lotions, I don&#x27;t like that greasy feeling. This is one of the best lotions I have found, and this is the best price I have found it! I bought 3 bottles to take advantage of the free shipping, so now I have 1 at work and 2 at home. I love the smell too, and have received compliments on it as well. (one person thought it was my perfume)&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret buying this lotion!</li>
            <li> I found this lotion great for dry skin. The scent is really nice and the fragrance remains throughout the day. I have used other lotions from Bath &amp; Body, and this is by far much better. Stops the itching I used to have.</li>
            <li> Hempz!  my family loves this lotion. Im so glad we found it.  Its amazing on our skin and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for about a year now, I love the clean smell of it and its a great consistency</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion and I&#x27;m so happy I don&#x27;t have to order form an overpriced tanning salon! Keeps me moisturized all day long, even on the driest of days!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product not only as a moisturizer,  but it does keep pesky gnats away as a friend told me it would.&lt;br /&gt;I live in the humid South and would definitely recommend Hempz.</li>
            <li> This product is a cheap knock off...&lt;br /&gt;Straight up smells like Pepto Bismol and isn&#x27;t very hydrating</li>
            <li> All around great moisturizer and lotion. Plus it smells nice.</li>
            <li> The Hempz lotion is great stuff, I just wish there was a version that was not so darn fragrant!  The scents are just way too overpowering, and everywhere you go, everyone else is hit with the scent as well.  If you are looking to cover up some of the worst BO, this is the stuff will do it and then some.  Remove the strong scent and make a guy scent, and I will order a bunch along with 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Many reviews that I read stated that the lotion smells really great. I hate to say it, but I disagree. It&#x27;s a weird banana/other fruit smell. However, it&#x27;s not too over-powering and the smell does dissipate in a few minutes, so it&#x27;s not a big deal to me. On the bright side, it does seem to moisturize really well, and I&#x27;m pleased. The tanning salon I go to sells the same exact bottle for $25, so this is a steal! Also, the bottle is pretty heavy, well worth the price. I would have given it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t smell funky! But to each is own, so maybe you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast and the product was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably order this product again, but I&#x27;ll try the pomegranate scent!!!</li>
            <li> The moisturizing effects of this lotion is pretty good and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a particularly sticky film like many other lotions I have used. However, I can&#x27;t really stand the smell. It took me a few days to decide whether or not I liked the smell or not. I know it already says in the description that it&#x27;s fruity, but nevertheless, I expected something much more mild given the color and packaging of this product. Maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t like strawberry-scented things since most of the time, they turn out too sweet and unnatural smelling (like in this case)? In any case, the kicker was the lingering, menthol smell after the strongest of the strawberry smell goes away. With the first few whiffs I&#x27;ve had of it, it was actually kinda pleasant because I&#x27;m getting over a cold and the menthol kind of helped clear my nose, but after awhile, it feels like I rubbed on melted fruity/tropical Halls cough drops all over me. The smell isn&#x27;t as unpleasant as cough medicine, but it does still smell a little like medication (mostly like cough drops, as mentioned) - this isn&#x27;t something I can stand for an extended period of time. Oh right, that&#x27;s the last thing. The scent stays and stays and stays. It would have been great if it was a scent that I liked, but I just don&#x27;t like this scent and throughout the day, I would get a whiff of myself and think, \\&quot;Eugh, cough drops.\\&quot; The smell lingers over my clothes (especially my pajamas)and I really, truly can&#x27;t stomach this smell anymore. I hate to rate a moisturizer based on the scent, but when it&#x27;s this strong, overwhelming, and stubborn, it completely overshadows the moisturizing effects of the lotion since I don&#x27;t even want to be near it anymore. That being said, I do like the lotion itself, so I&#x27;m curious about the other scents that they offer. I&#x27;m just hesitant over buying another bottle of lotion blind.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this lotion you should. Smells great, feels nice on your skin. This was half the price I paid for it at a local store.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product because I already use the Hempz Pomegranate and I absolutely love it. After reading the ingredients, I decided to purchase this with the hopes of having a more gentle fragrance for at the office. Boy, was I disappointed!! This lotion contains A LOT of perfume that makes it just about unbearable. I managed 20 minutes before I had to go wash my hands to get the scent off of me.  If you are considering Hempz, do yourself a favor and go with the Pomegranate one. Way, way better smelling.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well without making my skin break out, great value for a huge bottle, and is unquestionably the best smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever found. It smells very fresh and natural without being overpowering or grossly saccharine like some other herbal/floral scented lotions. It literally turns heads when I walk into a room, even if it&#x27;s been a bit since I applied it. I&#x27;ve had multiple people just stop and go \\&quot;Wow, you smell amazing!\\&quot; (Including several of my female friends, my boyfriend, and my landlady). On top of all that, it makes my skin look and feel soft and healthy. You&#x27;re not going to find a better product.</li>
            <li> Excellent delivery and product</li>
            <li> The product is definitely great, i totally liked it. I liked the smell, though i could see why some people might not. The smell does go away after and hour or so and it isn&#x27;t too strong after the first 10 minutes of applying the product on your skin (if spread our nice and even). The lotion is absorbed very quickly, it is very healthy with no harmful ingredients, made with hemp which is a big plus for me because i believe too many people get the wrong idea when they think of marijuana. There are multiple uses for it, it is good for all of us, so lets try and educate ourselves before we jump to conclusions. I would have given 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that the cap arrived defective. It would not raise up so that i can push it down and have the lotion come out (NO HOMO LOL). I was disappointed and actually just sent the product back in order to get a refund and re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent and feel to this non-greasy lotion. Amazon price was almost 50% less than retail. What a great deal.</li>
            <li> My 1st intro product to Hempz and still loving it after all these years!</li>
            <li> Great lotion! Has this little sweet scent to it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is by far one of the best smelling and silky feeling lotions on the market! This price is unbeatable! I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Luv this cream goes on nicely and goes in, is not greasy..  I have used this for years hand and body, really like it...  Very good price!!!</li>
            <li> Great item at a great price! This was $56 at my tanning salon!</li>
            <li> Is the best body lotion.</li>
            <li> Good lotion, but did not really like the smell associated, well thats a personal choice,</li>
            <li> Best lotion! Smells great, my husband uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL.  This product has CL + ME-ISOTHIAZOLINONE in it.  After using it for 4 months had a patch test because of itchy hivey condition on hands.  High sensitivity to that ingredient after using it a long time.  UGLY</li>
            <li> Disappointing!!!!!  I was looking for a all natural moisturizer and thought this one will be it when reading the product description.  But when I started using it over the weekend, it has a EXTREMELY strong scent.  The description on Amazon didn&#x27;t mention anything about scent!!!!!  But the bottle says fragrance of floral, strawberry and banana....it smells very artificial to me and TOO strong!!!  The moisturizing property of this lotion is ok though.  But if you are not a fragrance person or sensitive to it, it is NOT for you!!</li>
            <li> Smells really good. Improved my skin texture. Helps moisturize my skin but not as long as the other lotion. But I will still recommend this :)</li>
            <li> I really love how this lotion smells. I&#x27;m addicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who really hates lotion, the scent of this makes it pretty bearable. The scent is pretty heavy though, so if you don&#x27;t like scents you should really avoid this. It also lasts all day (both the scent and moisture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The price is also pretty good on amazon. The same bottle costs double in my city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I can&#x27;t wear this lotion because I didn&#x27;t know I had a hemp allergy or something. It made my skin feel like it had light burns that were quite painful. This is caused by any hemp product (so not just the lotions fault), I noticed it happened when I also purchased a hemp body soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really sad I can&#x27;t use this because the scent really is very nice.</li>
            <li> i just love this cream your skin feels amazing &amp; smell awesome  ive used it for many years but paid a lot more such a great price shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> Smells disgusting like some nasty flowers that I can&#x27;t pinpoint and it was extremely watery. I bought this because my mom has some that she got as a gift and it smelled great and was thick. This stuff made my skin itchy immediately and I had to wash it off. I am so mad that I wasted $10 on this.</li>
            <li> I love how this smells, the fragrance is very light. It is very moisturizing but not too thin or too thick and absorbs perfectly. It is not irritating to the skin like some lotions can be. I&#x27;ve also bought the pomegranate and honestly, I like both. makes my skin nice and soft after the shower.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. The smell is wonderful! Great for very dry skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> My skin feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom&lt;br /&gt;but smells much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best lotion ever for real though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes indeed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> To.die.for.  Smells terrific.  Just wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, of course we first bought it for the name. But it is great and I&#x27;m sure because it is hemp, it had lots of good stuff!!</li>
            <li> best lotion ever. by far one of my favorite lotions out there. I would recommend all to try it at least once.</li>
            <li> I love how moisturizing this lotion is. You can feel it automatically and it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it smells like candy...heaven in a bottle! LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Hempz products!</li>
            <li> Best motion out there!</li>
            <li> ...but I can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the best lotion I&#x27;ve used in the last ten years...but the smell is incredibly overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re sensitive to smell, especially perfumed ones, this is absolutely not the lotion for you.  It is a great lotion though, sinks right into your skin and isn&#x27;t the least bit heavy.  But the smell...it&#x27;s almost too much.  It is too much if you&#x27;re not a perfume person.  It&#x27;s like a floral bubble gum.  It&#x27;s pretty, but it&#x27;s just so heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it because it makes my skin feel great, but if there&#x27;s an unscented version, go for that.</li>
            <li> The Hempz (marijuana leaf) line is such a great product!  NO it does not smell of dope... but it does have a great scent!  My friend bought for me as a birthday gift and I have been using it ever sense!  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and it lasts all day.  It doesn&#x27;t go on greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent, light, but lovely.  I keep an extra bottle on hand always.</li>
            <li> Like the headline says, it Smells Great and Moisturizes really Well! I love this stuff! One of my favorite lotions.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff. It&#x27;s light but it moisturizes really well and my skin feels so smooth for hours and hours after. It smells like strawberry banana and the scent isn&#x27;t too strong, in my opinion. I want to try their other scents, but I have a feeling I will always come back to this one. It&#x27;s the best one so far.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have used it before and when i saw it for such a good price i had to purchase it</li>
            <li> Bought it originally as a &amp;#34;joke&amp;#34; product but decided to open up the container and use it. It&#x27;s a really good moisturizer and smells really great! Not a strong smell (I dislike overwhelming scents) but a really good smell. I&#x27;ve now purchased (over time) 6 bottles and I&#x27;m one very happy camper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS-It has NO marijuana odor!</li>
            <li> Love the lotion and the price and also my mother was very happy with it too. I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I love the Hempz Moisturizer!  I keep severely dry hands, legs, and feet.  This moisturizer does not have an overwhelming odor or sticky feel.  It leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.  My dad has neuropathy which leaves his skin very ashy.  We buy this lotion for him.  It works wonders.  It also helps us keep from peeling a lot after sunburns.</li>
            <li> Best. Lotion. Ever. Not only does it moisturize really well, it has the BEST scent of any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I buy a lot of scented lotions from Bath &amp; Body Works, and this stuff is much better. And ounce for ounce it&#x27;s less expensive too.  I recommend this to anyone who likes using scented lotions. Even my husband likes it and he doesn&#x27;t use lotion - ever.</li>
            <li> This lotion has the best scent ever, not too overpowering.  I am a nurse and I am constantly washing my hands.  This lotion keeps my hands from not getting too dry and it&#x27;s smell isn&#x27;t offensive.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this lotion!! My sister got me turned on to it and now my mom loves it too!</li>
            <li> I have been using the HEMPZ lotion for 10 + years now.  I use to only use it after using the tanning salon or going to the beach but now I use it all year round after my shower.  It lasts all day and the scent is amazing.  I highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a great lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, my body loves this lotion, and everyone that has ever tasted my skin would more than agree.. this lotion is one to love</li>
            <li> This lotion has the most amazing smell!  It is like candy.  My kids are always stealing it to use.  Not greasy and feels so luxurious!  I cant be without this during all 4 seasons.</li>
            <li> I hate oily lotion and this stuff is perfect i am a guy and i hate foo-foo smelling lotion this stuff is great for everyone. definitely will be getting more</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for year round use. I like the smell and it works well on my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Like the fragrance and that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisturizers out there.</li>
            <li> I have my doubts as to whether this was legit. Seemed like it had been mixed with another lotion.</li>
            <li> this is not the Hempz I have bought in the past, it is light, not as heavy or as scented.</li>
            <li> Feels great. This is subjective, but it seems to refresh my skin and heal places that are nicks, etc.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> My daughter turned me on to this product and I in turn have turned many others on with this as a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost a year now. It does a great job at moisturizing especially during the winter months. However it has a very strong sickening sweet scent to it. So if you&#x27;re the type of person who&#x27;s sensitive to those types of scents you might not want to buy it. I myself will continue to purchase this despite the scent because it is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I use it on my entire body except my face. It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritations whatsoever. Overall I would definitely recommend this to someone who&#x27;s looking for a great moisturizer and isn&#x27;t sensitive to sweet scents.</li>
            <li> My husband is diabetic so his skin is very sensitive and he needs to moisturize every day. This lotion smells so, so, so good. And it is not a strong smell where the guys will be embarrassed. The skin feels so soft and protected after you apply it. It is by far our favorite lotion. The only negative is that the pump doesn&#x27;t reach the bottom so you would be stuck turning the bottle, shaking and squeezing the last 10% of product remaining, which is quite annoying considering the consistency and the hard plastic make that a difficult task to accomplish.</li>
            <li> My body loves this moisturizer and love ordering them on Amazon.  They make great gifts.  My daughter gave me my first one and I fell in love with Hempz Herbal Moisturizer</li>
            <li> When the lotion came on the package the plastic cover over the top of the lotion was messed with and some of the lotion had spelt in the box but other than that I was happy with the price and smell of lotion. Have bought this stuff before and it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li> I contacted the maker of this product concerning the fragrance used in the lotion was either natural or synthetic, I never got a response back which has me assuming it&#x27;s synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only fault for this product is the synthetic fragrance, if it weren&#x27;t for that this would be an amazing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coating your skin with these synthetic&#x27;s become absorbed into the blood stream where they cause  oxidation of the cells and poison the body. Stay away from anything that just has the label &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> this lotion is wonderful. i personally have not used it, but the elders have said good things. they have aches and arthritis and were very complementary about this product which is why i have purchased another two. one for myself and another for my cousin with sensitive skin to try it out.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. Goes on dry. Smell aweseome all day. New cologne. Whole body is smooth after a couple uses. Ladies love the smell also.</li>
            <li> Approaching 50 and dang my skin is drying out, especially on the heels.  This stuff works really nice and goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t make a greasy mess on the hands.</li>
            <li> the best lotion on the market. smell, moisturizing, price, value, etc. I bought the gallon size after my first 18oz ran out.</li>
            <li> One of our favorites.  The scent is soothing and yummie.</li>
            <li> OM....it soaks right in and great smell!</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizing lotion &amp; smells great.  Really helps keep a tan on you when you moisturize often.</li>
            <li> This is the silkiest smoothest freshest and most lovely lotion in existence.  I feel calm after each application and sometimes find that if I put it on too late I am prone to late night eating.  I mean, I&#x27;ve always been a late eater.  May not be the lotion.  I go through 2 bottles every two weeks (or a bottle a week).  To be fair, I am 348 pounds and that&#x27;s a substantial amount of skin to cover.  It&#x27;s best for daily moisturizing - if you have cracked feet or other cracked skin, try something a little on the Vaseline-type side.  Trust me-I know from experience. I put some on my jimmy crack corn toes and jimmy still cracks.  And. I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and was so happy to find it on Amazon for such a good price.  Great smelling, not greasy and perfect for daily hydration.</li>
            <li> I bought this before and I actually used it and liked it that was like 2 years ago&lt;br /&gt;So I bought it again recently and well it smells like bubble gum it really does&lt;br /&gt;I had flash backs of buying bazooka joe bubblegum as a kid&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t remember it smelling like bubble gum before&lt;br /&gt;Hey if you like bubble gum smell it&#x27;s cool&lt;br /&gt;As for a moisturizer it works,but too bubble gum flavored out for me</li>
            <li> I spray tan and your not supposed to use any lotions with oil and other ingredients so when my airbrush shop told me this was a good alternative I jumped on line to buy it. It is much cheaper than the products sold at my airbrush shop and is cheaper to buy on amazon than at Ulta which is the only place I found it. Also, the Herbal smell is amazing! I only use it on my body not my face! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting on your face I use my normal moisturizers I buy specifically for my face :)</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion. I used to always get it as a free sample at tanning salons and I have always loved it and wanted to buy a big bottle. I could never make myself pay the full price before but I loved it so much I just bought it one day. I paid the full price at the tanning salon at $23 and see that it&#x27;s a lot cheaper on amazon. I will be buying it from here from now on! The scent is a little bit of the strawberry banana smell that it claims to have right on the bottle for those who are complaining of the smell... It&#x27;s not an overpowering super fruity smell either. It just smells fresh and I love it! I just think that people should probably try a sample of it first or a smaller size before you go out and buy a huge bottle of it... Most of the people who use Hempz products have tried it before and really love it!</li>
            <li> As a make up artist this is a good purchase.  It&#x27;s cheap and it smells great AND it really works.  Dry skin becomes supple and no one I know has developed any kind of allergies.  Everyone I know loves the smell.  Would be great if they could have less unnatural substances in it or come up with a 100% organic line.</li>
            <li> Really works wonders on my skin.  It got to me really quickly! Very nice doing business.  I love this product and will buy it again when I run out! Thanks</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and works great for dry hands, worth the price for sure, I highly recommend using it! I was given it as a gift and have been buying it since</li>
            <li> I love it. One of my favorite lotions. I use it for before and after tanning and after the shower and it leaves my skin feeling so soft</li>
            <li> The only moisturizing cream I will ever buy.  No fragrance and it absorbs easily.  Will keep buying, not only in the big size but the travel also.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon!</li>
            <li> smells great and leaves your skin silky smooth :)</li>
            <li> It smells like bubblegum and i&#x27;m not sure how I feel about that. Besides the fragrance there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much else to comment on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* I also ordered from Green Web, as did the highest useful comment stated. It&#x27;s a knock off and smells like bubblegum. I was never one for listening to the highest useful comments usually because they were outdated, but I should had this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/16/2014 It seems this isn&#x27;t the case anymore. If I was sent another sample of the product I could change my review.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not greasy and absorbs in to the skin and stays with you.  The wife loves this lotion and the smell is awesome</li>
            <li> Best feeling and best smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Used this for several years. Buy online, not in salons. You&#x27;ll save at least 50% or more. Don&#x27;t use if you have reaction to silicone. It&#x27;s the ingredient that makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Client I purchased this for loves it.</li>
            <li> Love love this lotion.  Makes your skin soft and smells really nice. I bought 5 of them to keep them in stock at the house. And you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  Getting ready to order more.</li>
            <li> Great smell and not greasy!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! I use it right after I shower &amp; right b4 I apply my fake bake! The 2 products work great together! Love it!</li>
            <li> this hemp lotion has a very intense , perfume-like scent!! was expecting an all natural hemp formulation .... not my preference at all!</li>
            <li> The top review says it&#x27;s fake; I&#x27;ve only bought it twice and maybe I can&#x27;t recognize the difference, but it&#x27;s a great lotion nevertheless. Moisturizes well without being greasy and has a nice, if a little bit odd, scent.</li>
            <li> Yes it is a wonderful product that I use daily all over my body.  It especially helps with rough elbows.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Live in AZ where the climate is soooo dry. This lotion really relieves the dry skin quickly. Bought as christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion.  Great smell for women &amp; men.  Only lotion my husband feels comfortable wearing-doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.  We use this everyday during the cold winter months of West Virginia and totally helps with chapping.  I reccoment this and use nothing else!  Love, love this!</li>
            <li> it has a great smell to it but the moisturizing part of it is just average. it definitely works buts not as good as say gold bond or cerave. it also is kind of greasy compared to other lotions,</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I always use it after showering, and I carry around a mini bottle of this to freshen up my hands after work. The smell is very subtle and pleasing. It leaves your skin feeling soft, smooth, and good-smelling. The best part of it is that you don&#x27;t get a greasy/heavy feeling from it, and the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> SUPER TRANSACTION....WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL LOTION!  NEVER GREASY...SOAKS RIGHT IN!&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT, YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT!  MY SISTER RECOMMENDED IT, AND I&#x27;M VERY GLAD THAT I LISTENED TO HER.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. The best ever, &amp; smells wonderful also. I would recommend thus product to anyone. The company also sells a wide varity of different types of lotions, after sun lotions lip balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super sensitive to lotions but this lotion doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It&#x27;s scent is light and not feminine and it&#x27;s not greasy and very effective on dry skin and even sunburn. Buy it. Use it. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great price love the smell and the way it makes my hands feel</li>
            <li> Best lotion on the market!  Original scent is far and away the best...stay away from the watermelon scent as it smells like a dirty dishrag.</li>
            <li> Long time favorite moisturizer. I love it. It smells great and wears well. Also, it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky, which is a plus</li>
            <li> I was with my daughter when she purchased this for her sister-  She told me how much she, and her husband like it on her.  They have several fragrances, but we like the fresh original.  She paid $25.00 for it at the beauty store, I came home and ordered it from Amazon for $11.00.  I think I know where my girls and me will be ordering it from now on.  Great product, love it!</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer ever!! I get the original only and I know there are others they offer, but this one is my favorite. I hope to always have the option to order this one. Thanks</li>
            <li> Smell is strong/sweet, if it was unscented I would give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> WOW, I love this moisturizer. This is the best Moisturizer that I have ever tried. My favorite thing about it is that it is not greasy and that it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> All good, works well.</li>
            <li> Seriously, best lotion ever! Amazing scent!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves Hemp products so I bought her this for xmas , she has very dry cracking hands. We all loved the smell and its great for her dried out hands.</li>
            <li> I use as a daily moisturizer - my kids think it smells like gum or candy much better than other Hemp- based products.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that I wanted to dislike but eventually caved in! Having been used to the scent of Jergens, Nivea and a ton of other mainstream moisturizers, I was taken aback the first time I used Hempz. I thought it was a disgusting smell to be honest! But, lo and behold, 5 months later, I think this is by far one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. There are multiple reasons for this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture - One of the best! It is so easy to spread on the skin and feels supremely luxurious. You will instantly forget all the other moisturizers you have used once you try this one. It is simply so easy to rub that overuse is inevitable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability - This thing lasts a good 8 hours at the very least. The smell, although overwhelming initially, doesn&#x27;t stay long but the skin does feel gentle and smooth, as one would expect from a moisturizer. You can easily expect it to last through a typical work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost - Although it is not particularly cheap, it is definitely a lot less expensive than some of the other luxurious brands. In comparison to brands like Aveeno, Nivea etc., it is pretty reasonably priced for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only concern would be the smell it emanates, which might not be to everyone&#x27;s liking. However, give it time and you generally do end up liking it. Alternately, there are other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; in this brand that I haven&#x27;t tried. Maybe one of these might be to your liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> After putting up with lotions that basically don&#x27;t help me a bit I happened on this brand and it is wonderful for the skin.  Every one in the family is using it now!</li>
            <li> Scent was amazing and nice emollient feel without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Just love the smell of this product, not perfumey, very natural and soft.  Goes on non-sticky and fresh.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS LOTION! But hate to pay so much at salons. This is a great price. I love it as after tanning lotions. Great price. Only complaint was it had come open in shippment and 1/3 of it spilled out all over bottle. But will always order f/ them.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, my wife loves it. Only thing is that we will need to buy a new one very quickly because she uses it every single day. And you must use allot unless your only going to use it on your hands I guess.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion. I&#x27;ve had dermatitis problems with other lotions (especially if they have fragrance), so this one is perfect. Have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best. I have really dry skin and this is pretty much the only lotion that solves this issue. Shipping was fast and you cant beat the price. I will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great!  It is non-greasy, light pleasant fragrance and most importantly, soothing for very dry skin.  Relief for dry skin lasts 8-12 hours.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you probably have several bottles of half-used lotion in your bathroom cabinet that just don&#x27;t match up to the advertisement you saw on TV. And then I discovered Hempz Herbal Moisturizer. I first received it as a gift from my dad (I&#x27;m a girl) and was skeptical that I&#x27;d like a lotion that he uses. Well, I was more than surprised when I first put Hempz on my skin. I haven&#x27;t used anything else on my skin for over a year now. The texture of this moisturizer is thick and smooth; it absorbs easily into your skin, leaving it moist but not greasy. I apply Hempz at night before going to bed and then very lightly in the morning and my skin stays moist all day. It&#x27;s great in the winter, especially if you live in a cold/dry area like I do. And the scent is mild enough that perfume/cologne can be worn without too many over-powering scents. To put it simply, this is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many expensive facial skin care products and hand creams, all to my disappointment. This stuff is da bomb.com! It is a rich source of essential fatty acids and amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals.  It&#x27;s like skin health in a bottle!  It has been the miracle worker for my hands AND my face! Leaves everything so soft, yet not greasy feeling.  Does not make my face break out at all, but heals and softens it! I will be throwing away my expensive Estee&#x27; Lauder moisturizers and the myriad of hand creams that I have.  This will permanently be the only moisturizer in my home!  I have it at every sink, at my desk, and in my purse/backpack.  Smells amazing!  Kind of like bubble gum - fruity and sweet.  Please, do yourself a favor and try this!  I think you&#x27;ll be hooked, as well!</li>
            <li> Great lotion, recieved it quicker than expected. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very good product for your skin after sun or after bathing. Even throughout the day for your hands to be soothed .</li>
            <li> Cheap and smells like bubble gum.  Very poor quality product.  Do not buy this product!  Will not buy ever again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s n o t the same as what I had before I don&#x27;t like it  it&#x27;s thinner  doesn&#x27;t work as before</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, makes my skin feels smooth and it smells great. Also last time I went to lake the mosquitoes left me alone and bit everybody else😀</li>
            <li> It smells great as well as it is a great moisturizer for your hands and body. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My wife, daughter and I all like this lotion. I&#x27;d tried to find a substitute of Ocean Pacific which I could no longer find and I believe this is it. It&#x27;s a good lotion with a mild fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower or smell like chemicals. Does a great job covering the skin. It isn&#x27;t tacky or gummy and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, and your hands feel so soft and hydrated after using it.  I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> This product works better than any hand lotion that I&#x27;ve tried.  Even takes care of abused mechanics hands...</li>
            <li> Keeps you moisturizer and smells tropical</li>
            <li> Smells so good! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> smells like bubble gum, like everyone else said</li>
            <li> Lotion texture was great and I really wanted it to work, but the smell was so bad for me that I couldn&#x27;t keep it.</li>
            <li> I Just got my Hempz Moisturizer but im not sure if mine is an original or a knock off, im adding pictures for help :( thanks</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion. I have looked at several salons and the price is extremely reasonable and the same lotion as sold elsewhere for double the price. Not too mention it smells great. Not too overpowering. Will definetly buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My 5-yr old got an allergic reaction to the hemp oil in this product. He has never been allergic to anything prior to this.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this negative stars! This is not the real lotion. The smell is horrible and smells like pure perfume. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! Cheap FAKE lotion and I will never order from this company again!!! I ordered mine from Dark Tans. Do not buy anything from them unless you want to waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good general moisturizer for a man. While this had been highly rated here and elsewhere, I just couldn&#x27;t get over the scent. Some may not find it overly feminine, but it was overly strong, which for me is a deal breaker. So bad I sent it back.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell and feel of this lotion. It has no greasy or gritty feeling to it which is great. My only complaint is that the lotion is a bit on the thinner side and dries fairly quickly. I find myself applying often more than once a day. Yet I am still considering trying other scents as well.</li>
            <li> I have trouble believing a product is natural with that much scent to it, also it does not say all natural on the product so if you are looking for that you may look elsewhere or do more research into this.  Has a strong feminine, flowery smell.</li>
            <li> Found this years ago and it&#x27;s still my favorite, great smell (not too much and neutral enough for a man) conditions skin well and absorbs without feeling greasy. What else could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Hempz lotion is my favorite! I will not use any other lotion.</li>
            <li> I was paying a fortune for this at my salon. It was here in just a few days, and cost so much less.</li>
            <li> Nice soothing scent, great for back rubs! Anything rubs! After I rub on my hands there is no greasy feeling. Would def recommend.</li>
            <li> It is the absolute best lotion for extra dry skin! :)Thanks for 2 day delivery.  I&#x27;m no longer a fish out of water</li>
            <li> love this produft  original scent is my favorite  half the price than in the stores absorbs quickly  better than any other lotion</li>
            <li> I could not live without this now it is by far my favorite water based lotion and is perfect for those who get airbrush tanned.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price with prompt shipping</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft likely due to the dankest of dank extracts used in this particular lotion. Overall a pretty rad product.</li>
            <li> i have used 1/2 of this bottle already.  It is soothing and it does smell really nice, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have been religiously using this lotion for 10+ years.  There is nothing else like it.  The best smell and such a thick, quality moisturizer.  I have turned so many people on to this product.  Everyone loves it!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lotions and I was SO glad to find it on Amazon for so much cheaper than in the store! My friend introduced me to this lotion and I think the smell is amazing and it feels so great on your skin! And the big bottle lasts a while. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Excellent for the winter dry skin.  Have one at the office for  hands.  Pleasant scent.  Order the multi pack.  Best deal.</li>
            <li> No moisturizer seems to soften and nourish the skin like this product from hemp. The word about this is spreading to our family members quickly!  High ratings deserved!</li>
            <li> Best lotion hands down!</li>
            <li> Absolutely best moisturizer ever. The only thing that works on my dry winter skin. Long lasting effect, even days later.</li>
            <li> I love Hempz Herbal Moisturizer.  It&#x27;s a good moisturizer for dry skin.  Plus, Amazon offers this product at a very good price.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it&#x27;s light and not greasy feeling on my skin.  I&#x27;m always afraid to try new lotions, because I hate that feeling of too much lotion.  The scent smells sweet like candy.</li>
            <li> Cool product. It worked perfect for us. I would buy it if i were you for sure. Thanks again guys.</li>
            <li> My lotion came on time, all intact, well wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT: the smell. When you Google the brand, they do claim to have a &amp;#34;strawberry banana&amp;#34; smell. That&#x27;s the truth and I do not want to smell like some articificial candy factory.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO THIS IS NOT NATURAL. That is why I wanted to buy it, because it doesn&#x27;t have all the stuff in it that&#x27;s bad for you....BUT IT DOES. If that&#x27;s what you are looking for--look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this product because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s what I ordered, or at least what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no fault with the seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer after having tried it in a store.  I absolutely love it.  It leaves your hands feeling so soft and smooth without the oily feeling that other moisturizers leave behind.  I don&#x27;t know why others are complaining but the one I received is exactly the same as the one in the store.  I especially love the smell!</li>
            <li> I love HEMPZ products!  This is my go to lotion, I try to always have at least a couple, kitchen, bath and desk!</li>
            <li> Not only does this lotion smell AMAZING, but it also leaves skin silky smooth and is wonderful if you have sensitive skin! (This brand was actually recommended to me by my dermatologist). I am so glad he told me to try it out because I will never use a different lotion again!</li>
            <li> This was a large bottle. This product is great for moisturizing your dry skin. It&#x27;s sent is light and fresh but a little fruity- banana and strawberry.</li>
            <li> I put a bottle of this on my desk at work and EVERYBODY was coming to use it. The fragrance is light but extremely pleasant, and the moisturizer works without making you feel greasy or slippery.</li>
            <li> The lotion works great, however the smell isn&#x27;t the best. It does wear off to a certain point throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a little one with celiac and these lotions are gluten free...  I love the smell and the way it makes your skin feel!</li>
            <li> I like Hempz as far as being a good moisturizing lotion, what I do not like is the smell.  It smells like bubble gum to me and that is not appealing.  I am not one to like a real floral smell either, but prefer a more clean, fresh scent, so I will keep looking for a lotion that has both a good smell and is a good body lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  This lotion is amazing.  Smells wonderful and lasts all day! Great price for the size too!</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my skin soft. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years and I don&#x27;t intend on changing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice lotion...simple and unscented always good for guys in my opinion! My skin was healthier in less than 1 week and I literally used lotion..like never! This will be my lotion of choice as long as I&#x27;m on amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used very expensive lotions; however,  Hempz Lotion is the best!  Very inexpensive as well a very good product.</li>
            <li> Some people might not like the smell otherwise a very good lotion</li>
            <li> Thought I was ordering a different variety of this lotion.  Do not like scent of this one. May not really be bad, but it was a big miss from my expectation.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace the Gold Bond for men because I felt the Gold Bond was too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Hempz isn&#x27;t as greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Nice hydrated feeling on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It has a strong scent of bubblegum.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a big bottle.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer smells amazing. Does not smell too feminine either in my opinion. A great body moisturizer, for hands or anywhere else. A wonderful moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this smell, it smells like bubble gum, a year later it hasn&#x27;t clotted or changed in anyway,it is better than any store brand lotion ive tried for a higher price. I love this lotion, it will definitely be my life long buy.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this lotion. It smells great and is very moisturizing. I want to try the hempz lip balm next.</li>
            <li> The only time I&#x27;ve ever gotten this was at a salon where a friend worked at. She hooked it up on the price. Don&#x27;t judge me... Anyways the salon closed and I switched up. The reason why I got this was the price was right for me to be able to qualify for free shipping and I was running out of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What alarms me about this product is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Shrink wrap it comes in. It was so not done well. Kind of sent alarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I use it and it still doesn&#x27;t lotion up certain spots. This lotion is thick so it should cover up. Target&#x27;s cocoa butter one does a better job of actually covering but takes more to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. This lotion makes me really break out in certain areas due to it being thick etc. It clogs the skin. This is the big indicator to me that this isn&#x27;t a real hempz product. I have never broken out like that before with hempz. Or they changed the formula. If you sweat it&#x27;s ridiculously oily. Again not the hempz product from before,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. You really have to gauge how much you put on. Too much and you&#x27;re going to have greese/oil/layer or whatever it is. Not enough and you&#x27;re stil going to have ashy, dry or whatever skin but you&#x27;re going to still smell like a spearmint rhino stripper. Don&#x27;t judge me</li>
            <li> Love the lotion, however the pump was broken, and some of the product oozed out.... but I had another pump I could use...  thanks</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisturizers I have used. Originally bought from my Salon in pomegranate, but this reg fragrance is awesome. Always get nice comments on it.</li>
            <li> A lotion I buy that doesn&#x27;t leave my hands dry.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for dry skin with a nice scent that is not over powering.  The price was great this product is more expensive at spa&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This was at the top of my college daughter&#x27;s Christmas List for 2012.  Arrived in 2 days!  She absolutely loves this lotion as do her friends. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> After using many other products over the years, discovered Hempz and am delighted with the results.. I&#x27;ll never go back</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion since the early 90&#x27;s when my mom took me to the tanning salon when I was a preteen (I didn&#x27;t say she was a good mom,) and they had this lotion there.  It is a very pleasant smell.  A little oily when first applying but is soaks in quickly and leaves a fresh scent.  My preteen (whom I don&#x27;t take to the tanning salon) steals my lotion from me all the time so apparently she likes it too. You can find it other places besides tanning salons but Amazon is the cheapest I have found,</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion. My wife loves the stuff and she&#x27;s got some pretty soft skin now. Buy this lotion and have a soft wife like I do.</li>
            <li> Like:&lt;br /&gt;Pump&lt;br /&gt;Big bottle&lt;br /&gt;Can use for up to six months with daily use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike:&lt;br /&gt;the scent is too sweet and strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again</li>
            <li> great price for this.  tho i felt it didnt moisturzie my skin that well, it could be that i need a different one of hempz like for extra dry skin</li>
            <li> I have heard from various sources that lotions with hemp oil help with dry skin. My hands and legs are dry/ashey all year round. I read alot of great reviews on this product and decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;m so glad I did, as long as I remember to apply this lotion everyday I have no signs of that dry/ashey skin. Biggest complaint I read was about the smell. This is up for debate at my house. I think that it smells like Plumeria flower, my husband on the other hand thinks it smells like Smarties candies. Overall it&#x27;s a pleasant smell to me and the product works great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this lotion. It makes your skin very soft. I definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> My skin cannot tolerate any fake smells or ingredients. And I have untreated well water with lots of minerals so I am always fighting dry skin. Hempz is the best at 1. immediate relief and 2. long lasting moisturizing.  And , while it&#x27;s not scientifically proven and may not be true for everyone, it really seems to keep those miserable deep South no see ums ( gnats to the rest of you) at bay ! The original is a little on the fruity side but it sure smells better and is so much better for you, than bug spray . Love it. And the after sun gel is fantastic after a day on the water !</li>
            <li> This was my first hempz herbal moisturizer that I bought. I&#x27;ve been planning to buy but all the salons tagged them with really high prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well, I finally got it, it&#x27;s the summer season, and the smell part is great. It does really smell like *CANDY*. all my friends loves the smell even strangers asks me what type of lotion i&#x27;m wearing. however the feeling of the lotion is really, too densed, thick, i don&#x27;t want to put on my body as much amount as I used to put on for regular body lotions. As ya&#x27;ll know, for tan maniacs, moisturizer is #1 must have items for all tanners. and what happens when you put little on your body? your body cracks like some kind of parched land!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Olay body lotions for quite time which makes me moistured with light scents, and I guess I&#x27;m okay with that lotion. The only thing that I like about this lotion is candy smell that my bf likes.&lt;br /&gt;overall, good, but not great.</li>
            <li> The smell is good, my skin is smooth. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Do you like skittles?&lt;br /&gt;Do you like to touch rainbows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion smells so good I&#x27;m not even kidding. Sweet but not too sweet. So nice, I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> My 3 bottles arrived quickly and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;This is very good lotion for itchy skin, and I now have plenty of spare bottles at a good price now.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It is the best stuff I have ever used... and I have tried a lot of different kinds. The smell is great, the price is not bad at all, and it makes your skin feel very moist.</li>
            <li> Been using this lotion for YEARS, and absolutely love it.  It leaves your skin soft, and not greasy feeling. AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. This is my 3rd times buying it. Smells great and works awesome. Recommend to anyone. You&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing though not at all heavy - I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of thick, sticky lotions and this stuff sinks right in.  Nice light scent.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Hempz products. It&#x27;s what they use in my tanning salon so I knew it would work well. It leaves your skin very smooth and hydrated. All of the smells are nice and I like that it&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy. Love it. Use it everyday after I shower.</li>
            <li> This is fake.  I just finished my bottle that I bought from a salon supply store and I was so excited to see that I could get it on amazon.  It doesn&#x27;t smell or feel the same.  It smells kinda musty and old to me once you put it on your skin. It also doesn&#x27;t rub in properly and feels waxy almost.  It&#x27;s really not good.  Do not buy this if you are looking for a real Hempz lotion or you will make the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face and hands after a shower for years. Best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Makes my skin feel great at a great price.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product!</li>
            <li> great find, great product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay I like the smelly ones better. I mean like the citrus smell not smelly. It does work good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and I love the subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I used to use this years ago and found it for sooo much cheaper on Amazon. Very creamy, Hydrates skin and smells soooo good!! got here just in time for dreaded dry winter skin!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, it has a very light scent to it which is nice because the scent of some lotions can be overpowering. It also moisturizers quite well for a lotion, whereas normally I prefer creams or butters.</li>
            <li> Became acquainted with this while in CO Love it&#x27;s texture and long lasting qualities. ill be a regular purchase for us.</li>
            <li> Yummy aroma this lotion has and once you use it a few times, it actually moistens your hands so you don&#x27;t need to keep using it multiple times a day :)</li>
            <li> My absolute FAVORITE lotion....I use nothing else since discovering Hempz Original....has to be the &#x27;Original&#x27; though!!</li>
            <li> Smell is sickening, it&#x27;s an ok product but way overpriced.</li>
            <li> I have been using this forever.  I apply this  every morning after shower.  It just feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Ok, the name may suggest &#x27;dirty hippie&#x27;, but I have yet to find a lotion that has this wonderful of a smell. It&#x27;s so unique and good! Somewhat flowery and fruity but not musky at all. Also the lotion is not greasy or heavy feeling, I tried this from a friend awhile back and just HAD to have my own finally.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a beautiful scent.  I order the original and I would like to order other scents, but I&#x27;m not sure which ones I would like to try.  The scent smells like bananas and vanilla.  It moisturize and feels good on my skin.  I am ordering more, but I wish the price was lower.  This is expensive.</li>
            <li> I love several things about this lotion.  First of all, it smells wonderful.  Secondly, it works well as a moisturizer for your skin.  The cost is the best I have seen as I have looked around many other stores and websites for this product.</li>
            <li> was using a neutragena product &amp; wasn&#x27;t really happy with it. Bought this and it I will not go back. Also got the pomegrant &amp; age defying.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever. I had a hard time finding a lotion for the winter months that would keep my hands from being dry and cracking.  This works great year round and haven&#x27;t had cracked knuckles in the 3 years I have used this.  It is the same bottle I got from the salon but now 1/2 the price online.  I order 10 to 12 bottles at a time because my family also loves this stuff so we go through it in about 6 months. It doesn&#x27;t go bad or loose the scent which is pleasant. Don&#x27;t even need to wear perfume or body spray.</li>
            <li> It moisturizers really well and smells great but has too strong of a scent and makes my eczema act up</li>
            <li> I love this lotion...can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> I buy it because the reviews are great. After I received it, it works well but the smell is really awful. This smell is like bubble gum not any herb-smell. I will stop using it just because this bad smell</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. I like the fragrance and the feel. Highly recommend this product. You want be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The Hempz Herbal Moisturizer made me smell like a strawberry banana milkshake. Also pretty oily, adding to the stripper appeal</li>
            <li> Apparently, I can&#x27;t use this. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to lotion before, but this made me break out after daily use. As soon as I stopped using this, the rash went away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a picky person by nature.  This lotion is the best I&#x27;ve encountered.  I even give it as a Christmas gift for my family.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what it says it is and I am very happy with it!! I have never tried this product and am I glad I could find it cheaper on amazon!</li>
            <li> This product smells really good, it is smooth and lightweight, however my hands tend to be super dry and this product does not give y hands the moisture they need, however I use the lotion all over my body, and just use a stronger lotion for my hands, and that works just fine for me.  Love this product, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - especially with my really dry skin. Works well and smells even better!!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  The smell is mild and pleasant.  This lotion  is light yet moisturizing.  This was a great discovery.</li>
            <li> Whoever said this lotion is the same as Dove or Vaseline intensive care obviously does not have dry skin.  This lotion is MUCH thicker and moisturizes much more than any regular lotion that you are going to find at your local grocery store. I switched from Dove to Hempz, and now that my Hempz bottle is gone when I tried to use my Dove again it seems so watered down.  Hempz is not at all greasy and smells really good.  I live in the SW where daily lotion is a necessity, and I am absolutely hooked on this stuff, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> After opening and using this product. I noticed the fragrance was not the same as the one I was using!</li>
            <li> In love with this. The smell is amazing</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this classic from Hempz! I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years and still enjoy the scent and thickness of it. Great buy!</li>
            <li> My skin is used to a lot of humidity. So when I was exposed to dry climate, my skin started becoming very very dry.  After a lot of research I found this product on Amazon. I do not like using products with chemicals on my skin, so I wanted to buy herbal product which is softer on the skin. This product matches my requirements and is excellent for moisturizing my dry skin.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure what some of those other people are complaining about.  I absolutely LOVE this lotion.  The smell is wonderful!!!  And I love that that the scent doesn&#x27;t wear off right away.  I am middle aged and don&#x27;t feel like this product is just for young girls.  My husband loves the scent too!!!  Great Product and it&#x27;s not greasy.....just Perfect.  I&#x27;ll be buying this in the gallon size going forward.</li>
            <li> Smooth with a nice scent. Leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Smells like bananas and really moisturizes well. 5/5 would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> NOT MOISTURIZING for my dry skin.I would go back to cetaphil.not sure why people race about this</li>
            <li> Ordered from Dark tans and I like it. Everyone is talking about a bubblegum smell. Although mine does smell kind of like that, I&#x27;ve never tried this lotion beforehand to compare. It&#x27;s like a banana/bubblegum scent. The product absorbs into your hand quick with no greasy feeling and gives great nourishment for the day which is why I give it 5 stars. If it is a knock off, it&#x27;s definitely a high quality one, to where I am not displeased one bit. I&#x27;ve tried some other scents from this line at Sephora and they all have exactly the same feel in hands as lotion, so I believe it is legit, just look out for what seller you&#x27;re buying from and they&#x27;re ratings.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It goes on very smoothly on the skin.  It also moisturizes very well and as&lt;br /&gt;someone who suffers from dry skin, this product is great.</li>
            <li> Smells like bubble gum. The lotion is great, not greasy feeling - refreshing and the smell is really wonderful. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer, with a mild scent, that truly lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Best lotion out there for my money...love the scent - not medicinal!</li>
            <li> Lotion itself is great. Not oily. Goes on smoothly. The scent however is overpowering and unnatural, and it doesn&#x27;t smell particularly nice - kind of like bubblegum / weird candy / something you&#x27;d find at Bath &amp; Body Works that they&#x27;ve since discontinued. If I apply the lotion at night, I wake up the next day and can still smell it for most of the morning. Nearly gives me a headache. I loved the Green Tea Hempz, which is what prompted me to buy this, but I will definitely not be buying this &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; scent again.</li>
            <li> First -- to clarify something -- another reviewer said this is not a Hempz product.  That is wrong, the bottles I&#x27;ve received are absolutely Hempz products, not a knock off at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, my wife has been using this for years -- I love how it smells and she loves how it works@  Great product, well worth the price!</li>
            <li> This stuff absorbs into my skin like a sponge. The Shea Butter, Ginseng and natural extracts help calm, soothe without the red irritation that i used to get with other lotions. Its doesn&#x27;t just moisturizer either, its good for my skin with vitamins A, C and E. What more can i say? Paraben-free, Gluten-free, 100% Vegan.THC drug-free.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance: Floral &amp; Banana, like ripe banana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy this at Ulta, but it is much cheaper on Amazon :)</li>
            <li> Amazing shipping and amazing product!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used. I have dry skin, and this product keeps my skin moist through out the day. And, It smells good!</li>
            <li> I love HEMPZ it smell great and makes my skin so soft even after tanning all the time i even use it on my daughters skin it is no harsh and helps with her eczema.</li>
            <li> Very nice. It helps my hands. Every time I use it, my hands stop hurting. Whether its carpal tunnel or nerve damage; I don&#x27;t know. This lotion help s!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the fast shipping. I was familiar with the product as I use it. Was exceptionally pleased with the price as I had checked other sites. The pricing was very, very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Love, love this stuff and I really love the way it feels and smells wonderful. I would buy this again and again! Great value for the amount and dollar!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  There are many flavor variations, but I like the OG sent myself.  One of the best things about Hempz is that it doesnt feel &amp;#34;greezy &amp;#34;.  Most other lotions dont set in well, but not Hempz.  It gets absorbed by the skin very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My go to Lotion.  Get it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much, it smells good and really works I highly recommend it to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> Great lotion! Awesome for sunburn, safe for newborns and great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, great for after tan and even if you don&#x27;t tan</li>
            <li> I really like the product, however, I ordered the wrong version. I wanted the Herbal Age Defying formula. To me it has the fragrance I like the most. Will order that next time...</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic. I specially love the effect it&#x27;s had on my tattoo. I&#x27;ve grown a lot bigger now than when I got my tattoo a few years back and this lotion brings the colors on it alive again and it stays looking fresh for longer. Did I mention it smells really good?</li>
            <li> Hempz lotion is the best and does exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li> One of the best lotions ever.  I use this product daily and it is long lasting.  It is not greasy or perfume in scent.  Love this product and have been a frequent user/buyer ever since the first trial!</li>
            <li> Best smelling lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Hydrates skin.&lt;br /&gt;silky when put on, and skin feels and smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;well worth the price. Love it.</li>
            <li> I like this most for it&#x27;s great smell. The smell last a long time throughout the day. It is much cheaper to buy online then at the store.</li>
            <li> I am a guy and put on lotion every time I get out of the shower and this is the best brand and product I have used. It goes a long way and doesn&#x27;t have the oily sensation.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It really moistens skin and smells good too! Also offered at a very reasonable price! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> Great after tan product. Hard to Beat!</li>
            <li> Ah, this is one of my fav lotions. The smell is great and I feel hydrated all day. i dont use it on my face, only my body.</li>
            <li> This is a great and affordable moisturizer. My skin does feel visibly smoother after applying it for a month. I am very happy. However, the pump is a real pain and broke after 3 weeks. Now I have to squeeze the lotion out of the bottle, which is another pain. But the lotion itself is excellent. I wish Amazon would sell Hempz in larger size so that I don&#x27;t have to keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but probably too thick for the pump.  The pump broke and before that, it was difficult to pump the lotion.  Otherwise, this is a great moisturizer for body and face.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for a couple of years and am very happy with it. My daughter and son-in-law always request a bottle for Christmas!  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A lot of people who write reviews for this lotion, sing its praises. I&#x27;m not sure for me it lived up to the hype in the reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is however a good lotion. I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell and I bought this lotion because my hands get so dry in winter, but the smell is not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it does the greatest job of moisturizing your hands. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for two weeks now and I don&#x27;t feel as if my hands are where they should be. Maybe I need more time, maybe my hands are just that dry, but I&#x27;m not overly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it lacks in the one area it&#x27;s should excel in, it does have one really good redeeming quality: Its not even remotely greasy. Once you get it nice and rubbed in, you don&#x27;t feel it on your hands at all. This is much better than your hands feeling greasy and slimy for a long period of time, exactly the reason why using lotion can be a challenge. In my day, I sit and use a computer quite a bit. Trying to use a mouse, or type on a keyboard with slimy hands is just not acceptable, and this lotion is out of your way in no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re priority is the quality of moisturization you may want to look elsewhere. But if you&#x27;re more concerned about getting rid of the greasy feeling right away, this is a good candidate! Next time though, I may look at other options!</li>
            <li> do you have extremly dry skin? and have you tried every product you could find?if you still have not found the right lotion for dry ,itchy skin..then this is it!!!!!Hempz is absolutley the answer to your dry skin,it is not greasy and smells great.you will notice the diffrence the first time you use it,give it a try and you will be hooked for life!!!this is my wifes new best friend.i ordered it for her as a gift and she loves it,she has all of her friends using it...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much can be said about a skin moisturizer.  If it keeps your skin from drying out, what else is there?  This keeps my skin from drying out.  &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
            <li> What the hell is this?  This bubblegum smelling, greasy, oily slop is not Hempz lotion.  No idea how they can get away with selling this crap, but I&#x27;m not happy about it.  The lotion had dumped all over the box, and my hands are still greasy five minutes after I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do, for whatever reason, buy this crap, and it smells like bubblegum, you got RIPPED OFF.  Not real.</li>
            <li> I have used a Hempz cream in the jar before that I received as a gift, so I thought I was safe in ordering the lotion version as the description mentions nothing about the extremely strong, floral scent. One reviewer mentioned that she didn&#x27;t like the scent, but as it wasn&#x27;t specific and so many others wrote about how great this is--I ordered it. I cannot use it as the scent is SO strong it actually makes me a bit queasy... it smells like old floral (perhaps from the jasmine mentioned in the ingredients very far down), but for a lotion that you use all over your body it permeates everything including adding the scent to your clothing, as well. It is a nice moisturizer and absorbs well, but at the expense of making the wearer smell so strong it caused a comment from someone nearby. I see that they now have one with pomegranate and almond. Perhaps that will smell less strong, but this definitely does not match the scent of the Hempz cream in the jar.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I LOVED the body butter and it smelled so good.  The lotion smells a little different and I was disappointed.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, I just didn&#x27;t love it and wished I had ordered the body butter.  I liked the idea of the pump.  The lotion itself seems to work well and soaks in.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, which is nice.  I just don&#x27;t love the smell, but it isn&#x27;t bad and I will use it.</li>
            <li> Please DO NOT listen to all the compliments. I am almost certain that the reviews are paid marketing result.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product is so bad that I couldn&#x27;t use it the second time. Not even on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;The smell stays for a long time. My hands smelled like perfumed plastic even after I washed them. I had to wash them twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to share the ingredients of the product before I throw the bottle away:&lt;br /&gt;water, Propanediol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Sorbitan Palmitate, Dimenthicone, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) butter, Clycerin, Stearic Acid, PEG-100 Stearate, Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, Retinyl Palmitate, Ascorbic Acid, Symphytum Offiicinale Leaf Extract...The list goes on forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at all the chemicals!!! Please do not buy this product for your own sake.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff as a daily moisturizer. I have heard that many merchants will refill these bottles but I believe this one to be real.</li>
            <li> Great scent, great dealer</li>
            <li> My nail salon gave me this lotion as a Christmas gift today and I LOVE it!  My skin is really sensitive and most lotions burn when I put it on, this lotion does not.  It soothes my extremely dry chapped hands and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite lotion. I buy it for him every couple years but I can&#x27;t help but sneak some every once in a while. The smell is lovely. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the marijuana leaf on the front. If you&#x27;re buying it to say you have lotion made out of pot, you&#x27;d be mistaken. Cannabis is so far down in the ingredient list that it&#x27;s pretty much non-existent. Buy it for the quality but buy it from Amazon. The leaf is pure marketing and you shouldn&#x27;t pay salon cost.</li>
            <li> Smells great and love it!</li>
            <li> I always buy this lotion. The smell is great and makes my body feel smooth! Hempz lotion is a good product.</li>
            <li> Very light and fragrant moisturizer, I apply on face too, does not feel greasy at all. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Got this for post-tattoo healing.  Everyone else in the house used it up on me.  The wife and daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Using this for many years now and wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything else. My skin is wonderfully soft and smooth This lotion is wonderful</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days and I can already tell the difference in my skin</li>
            <li> But they weren&#x27;t.  This definitely wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase price.  We have used this lotion in the past and been absolutely thrilled with it, but they either changed the product as suggested in other posts or this is NOT original Hempz product.  i would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a must have in our house.  It leaves your skin soft and moisturized and smells sooooo good! For men and women!</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin so soft i love it ill never use another lotion again and its not greasy to.touch</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the moisturizing quality of this lotion. I live in Colorado, which has a very dry climate. This lotion is not too thick, doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling at all oily, yet it is plenty moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Makes my skin feel so soft and silky without having that icky sticky feel.  I will be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> Received in good condition and quickly.  I&#x27;ve always loved this lotion.  It&#x27;s nice and thick, wonderful fragrance.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the Hempz Herbal Moisturizer, 17-Fluid Ounce. This is the perfect lotion for the summertime, not too heavyand it smells fantastic. Ordering from Anazon is alot cheaper than buying in the stores, at least $15.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and is extremely moisturizing. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years!</li>
            <li> Amazing, great price, and quick shipping!!!! This is by far my favorite lotion!</li>
            <li> The scent of this is amazing!</li>
            <li> Awesome scent. Spreads smooth. Leaves skin hydrated and pliable.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and I always get compliments of how soft my skin is. I won&#x27;t use any other lotion.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and texture</li>
            <li> This has a great smell, light and clean, and works wonders for my skin year round. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best</li>
            <li> This lotion by Hempz is the best lotion we have ever used. We love the original scent! We would recommend this to all our family and friends!</li>
            <li> The best handcream I have used.  Tried it at a friend&#x27;s house who could only get it online.  Had to get it for myself.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for years and will continue.&lt;br /&gt;I have given many as gifts and have them all convinced that it is the best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion previously and I stumbled across it here on Amazon. I&#x27;m hooked. I love the smell and I love the texture.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion since it had such high reviews. But, I went on EWG to check its rating and sadly it has a 7! Not good. :(</li>
            <li> Smells good, Hydrates the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Moderate price. Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;No need to spend a fortune on moisturizers as they only hold in what you put in thru your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;In other words, hydration comes from drinking water.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Hempz Lotion while visiting a tanning salon. But as we all know, little tanning salons are very expensive, so I was really happy when I was able to find it on Amazon for a great price. It&#x27;s not too thick or thin, and it gives you a wonderful scent. You probably won&#x27;t need to put any perfume on!</li>
            <li> Smells great work gear I&#x27;m going to buy more</li>
            <li> It smells like bubble gum and the scent is not comforting. Like other reviews said, it made me feel like it&#x27;s a cheap lotion product. Sadly I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever! Received it wicket than expected.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got real hempz lotion. Packaging was kind of sketchy with clear evidence of having been refilled. Smells good and is nice lotion but it dosnt smell and feel like the the real stuff when compared to my Salon bought Hempz. A little too thin. But for 11$ am I suprised ...uh no.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product both me and my husband use it. I would recommend it to all my friends. I first found out about through my nail salon.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this formula is different that the previous ones I have had.  What I really hate is the sugary smell of the lotion.  Not buying again.  What a drag.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great like perfume and really moisturizes your skin. good to use all over and the bottle lasted me a good couple of months before i ran out. i would definitely suggest this.</li>
            <li> Works really well to heal diabetic legs.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t leave a weird feeling on your skin. Also the smell is minimal. I don&#x27;t like smelling like lotion, but I also don&#x27;t like dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love it. This not only makes your skin feel smooth but smells wonderful. It does not dry out your skin like some lotions. I would never use any other lotion!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this large bottle after getting a small purse-size one from my salon. I love the scent (banana-strawberry) as it is different from all the floral-scented lotions these days. It doesn&#x27;t have mineral oil or petroleum in it and the hemp does a great job of moisturizing my families skin without feeling greasy or covered in chemicals. It lasted us about 5 months. I would buy it again in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> Smells good. Soft feeling. I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best lotion ever! It deeply moisturizes but does not leave a sticky feeling once it has dried.  The original formula smells great--like bananas--and moisturizes better than any other lotion I have tried.  I have very sensitive skin and am prone to eczema, and this not only does not irritate my skin, but helps keep eczema at bay.  Amazon has the best pricing available for this item.  At other beauty stores in runs upwards of $20.</li>
            <li> Greetings, best skin lotion on the market.  Use Hempz after shaving, penetrates great, not tacky.[[ASIN:B000OYJ9AO Hempz Herbal Moisturizer, 17-Fluid Ounce (500 ml) (Package may vary)]]</li>
            <li> I searched for this great product sold at high prices in stores and found it on- line at an amazing price and was delivered to my door in a couple days. I&#x27;ll continue to use this great smelling non greasy lotion. My friends and family are now hooked on hempz lotions too!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used. It absorbs in your skin quickly &amp; does not leave you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome and it softens and moisturizes. One product I do not want to live without! What else can I say?</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. Paying alot more for it from my salon. Now that i found it here I plan to switch &amp; save money. This stuff WORKS, especially for my upstate NY cold dry hands. Smell is NOT overpowering, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to that. B&amp;BW creams weird me out in my mouth they&#x27;re so overpowering, but this is mild &amp; lovely. Not weirdo college pot-smoking dark smell either. Nice, light, happy scent. Don&#x27;t let the logo fool you.</li>
            <li> We tried product after product to help with itchy skin.  We got some relief using Arbonne body lotion, but it had to be applied quite often.  A family member was in a nursing home for several weeks following surgery and they brought home scabies!  It is not noticeable until the itching began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff worked like a miracle.  We were truly amazed and keep it on hand at home and work even now.  And the fragrance is wonderful.  Not greasy and absorbs nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are sold for life on Hempz moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  Not greasy and makes my skin feel wonderful. I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting smooth skin</li>
            <li> This lotion was nice. It felt good, not too greasy or thick but not really thin either. I liked the smell of it as well. I can&#x27;t say that this is the best lotion I have ever tried but it is definitely up there! I would definitely recommend giving it a try! The shipping on this was also really fast.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great and moisturizes well too!! Leaves you feeling very soft afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for before &amp; after tanning.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this lotion when my daughter began using it, so I &#x27;borrowed&#x27; hers to try it for myself. I am allergic to aroma&#x27;s that are too strong, but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me. I like that it isn&#x27;t too thick or too thin. It&#x27;s a good &#x27;all year round&#x27; lotion.</li>
            <li> Great product and price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion at a salon and loved it. However the pump broke after just a few uses. It pumps, but nothing comes out. Disappointing!</li>
            <li> BEST moisturizer at a fantastic price.  I have a bottle in every room. It has a fruity light scent. Great to use after bathing.l</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! It has a really great smell and it moisturizes perfectly. I am male and this does not have a strong sent nor is the sent feminine in anyway. The sent is almost similar to bubble gum but not to strong. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot either. Me and my wife both use it almost daily. I have very ashy skin and this does a great job of making my skin feel great in the winter months. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Nice light texture that really soaks in. I use it daily, not too thick so it soaks in right away but not so thin you feel like you put nothing on.  My daughter swears by it when she tans.</li>
            <li> Product was received on time and met my expectations</li>
            <li> the moisturizer works great! I previously used bath and body body butter, but after I tried this item, I decided to switch. it moisturizes and can be easily applied to your skin--- i found b&amp;b is relatively too hard to apply. It is too sticky and heavy for me. With body butter, I have to use it with other body oil. but with this item, i can perfectly use it on its own. Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Personally lotion is a must for me. Therefore I much rather have a good quality lotion. I read lots of reviews on this lotion before i bought it, and everyone is right. It feels great when you put it on, doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy, smells good but not girly so even a man could use it and not feel bad about it, and leaves your skin hydrated for hours. Hands down i love it and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a wonderful smell and I use it everyday. The bottle does not last me very long because I love it so much. It is very not-overpowering so it doesn&#x27;t make me nausous like some Bath and Body works scented stuff.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order Hempz Herbal Body Moisturizer (Original) because I thought it would smell like hemp.  It doesn&#x27;t.  Not even a trace.  What I first smelled was bananas followed by strawberries.  As other reviews have stated, the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  If you wear perfume or cologne, the smell of the moisturizer will most likely not interfere with the fragrance you are wearing.  Right now I can still smell the Hermessence Vetiver Tonka that I sprayed on three hours ago.  I can smell the Hempz Herbal Body Moisturizer too but the Vetiver Tonka came back to the forefront a couple of minutes after applying the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how well Hempz Herbal Body Moisturizer works, it&#x27;s incredible.  So many body moisturizers claim to not be greasy but they usually are.  This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t leave oil stains on the computer keyboard or the bedding like so many other moisturizers I have tried.  This moisturizer absorbs into the skin very rapidly, creating a protective barrier that lasts for hours.  The directions state to use liberally however I discovered just a little bit goes a long way because it is so thick.  What I like the most about this moisturizer is how great it makes my skin feel.  No more dry, flakey, itchy skin.  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Fake.  Smelled like bubble gum and arrived with a hot pink pump and top..  Definitely not authentic hempz which has a mild scent and nothing like bubble gum. Ugh. Sending it back!</li>
            <li> I used to sell this at my old work and it was always my favorite lotion because of the Hemp Oil being closest to the natural oils of your skin. It does an amazing job at keeping your skin nice without being oily and it has a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife. She loves it and cannot live without it. She has tried so many other expensive brands, and none of them compare to HEMPZ. This is a great Value for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the high praises on amazon.com, I certainly don&#x27;t regret. It works great and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> makes skin smooth nice smell</li>
            <li> This lotion is horrible. Not only does it smell bad, it contains a number if dangerous chemicals. I certainly won&#x27;t be putting it on my body</li>
            <li> Have always loved this lotion. Amazing scent. It&#x27;s described as strawberry banana, but I think more tropical coconut.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion-  its smells great-  moisturizes nicely -  highly recommended</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion.  I&#x27;m athletic &amp; spend a lot of time outside in the dry Arizona desert. I mix it with the HEMPZ HYDRATING BATH &amp; BODY OIL.  Keeps my skin soft all day.</li>
            <li> Great lotion that really moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves my hands. Plus the smell of it. It came on time. I just hope next time it comes in the morning</li>
            <li> I was a little wary about buying this lotion from here because several people said it wasn&#x27;t the same thing you buy from the salon and/or that it has a bubble-gummy scent. I agree, it is a bit bubble gum but it is the EXACT lotion as in the tanning salon. My friend bought her bottle for $32.00, I bought this one for $10. We compared them and lets just say my friend was disgusted she paid slightly more than me for the same identical product. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a lotion kind of person. I only use it when my skin gets dry from either the season or due to soap or solvents.&lt;br /&gt;In the winter, my shins sometimes get dry and itchy. No other lotion really seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;I use this lotion once and the itching goes away immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my hands after working in the garage with solvents like gas or brake cleaner or the pumice shop soaps that completely dry your hands out.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, absorbs quickly and it works great. Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
            <li> I love Hempz lotion and was happy to see it on Amazon. It is smooth and very moisturizing without being greasy or leaving residue.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of the smell and it is not as moisturizing as I wanted to.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and will always use it. It feels great on the skin and smells wonderful. It is a staple in my house.</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite body lotion - not sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> Its a good moisturizer but smells a little weird.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a lot of body lotions and this one is one of the good one that has natural contents.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it smelled better!</li>
            <li> After trying so many body lotions, I always come back to this one. Love the natural ingredients, the smell, texture, everything.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible!! What a great buy.</li>
            <li> My favorite post tan and everyday moisturizer. It smells incredible too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after a recommendation from my sister when I began tanning. Of course, being as pale as I was when I started, I burnt quite a bit. Let me just say this, I now swear by Hempz lotion! It sucked the heat out of my burns faster than any aloe vera that I have ever used. My burns were literally gone in a matter of a day and I was able to continue tanning. The smell is this is simply amazing! I use this lotion once in the morning, once after I tan and usually right before I go to sleep as well. I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week now and my skin is velvety smooth, it feels incredible. I find myself just tickling my side at times because my skin is so incredibly soft that I love feeling it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another lotion again. There is no heavy, oily feel to it at all. A very lightweight, softening lotion with a very soft smell as well; nothing too overwhelming. I also purchased the Hempz Triple Moisture and I love that just as much! There aren&#x27;t enough words in this world to describe how much I love this lotion, honestly, there isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll never use anything else, let&#x27;s just put it that way. I&#x27;m now a Hempz user for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as using it as an after tan lotion, it&#x27;s perfect for that as well. Keeps my tan moist and doesn&#x27;t let it dry out at all. Sets it very nicely and holds it perfectly! Those over priced after tan lotions sold at salons have nothing on Hempz. Nothing at all. This lotion is an all in one perfection in a bottle. Good on sunburns, good for after tan lotion and perfect for an everyday lotion! Will definitely be purchasing this again. And again, and again!</li>
            <li> I have diabetes and I love this stuff. Great for feet and hands and face. I dumped everything else. A cosmetologist gave me a sample and have been hooked since. You can never put on too much.</li>
            <li> Great deal on this lotion that is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It smells magnificent.  Feels great to apply.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for years and I still love it as much now as I did when I first started.  It is a great product for dry and chapped skin, on hands, legs or wherever.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Great lotion, I like the descrete scent, and you stay moisturized all day. I would recommend this lotion to people</li>
            <li> Only 3 stars because I didn&#x27;t get to try the product because the lotion arrived with a broken pump (the tip about 1/2 in. was broken) and leaking product all over the package. I suggest to pick a better package material, like a box, so the item don&#x27;t get damaged. will return the item and most likely reorder and hope for a better quality next time.</li>
            <li> Finally!!! There are only two lotions that absorb and leave my skin smooth and silky. This is one of them. I bought it recently after my friend recommended it. Even though I have another great body lotion that I swear by I bought this and it is great! Now i have two amazing lotions that I just can&#x27;t get enough of. I bought this in original scent and I am not the biggest fan of it. The pomegranate is just so much better! The original scent is a bit sweet for me.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion makes your body feel like it is wrapped in a cloud. I feel super soft and smooth. The winter will put this lotion to it&#x27;s test because I get very dry skin when it&#x27;s cold. I am pretty sure this lotion will do fine.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love that it absorbs super fast and doesn&#x27;t re-appear after few hours. You  know how some lotions after you put them on you can still feel a layer of them and when you sweat just a tiny bit you become like the greased up deaf guy from family guy? I hate that feeling and this lotion doesn&#x27;t have it. It absorbs and that is it. Leaves your skin moisturized and soft and smelling very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT! and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I started using this after tanning, but now I just use it every time I get out of shower!  It smells so good and leaves my skin soft for a full day.  I&#x27;ve gotten bad or fake versions of this lotion from other sites, but this one is genuine, and a much better price than at the store!  Try it, you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> Smells like a dream, hydrates beautifully, if they stop making this product I will cry.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells great :D</li>
            <li> very nice smell and very silky. i will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Great price and great lotion</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shipped quick as well!&lt;br /&gt;smells delish!</li>
            <li> not too moisture but still good</li>
            <li> Smells like bubble gum :) Great lotion, but does make your hands a bit sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Smells great and never make me feel oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion.  I found it as an &amp;#34;aftersun&amp;#34; lotion 12 years ago when I was tanning for my wedding, it has a nice mild scent (I like the original over other scented versions) it is mild enough for my sensitive skin, never stings or anything, it is thick, very moisturizing (not liquidy like some lotions!!!)  it keeps my skin super moisturized and also reminds me of my wedding whenever I smell it :)</li>
            <li> Soothing and smells great. A must have for naturalists! Hemp for life!</li>
            <li> It smells like bubble gum - not like hemp like I expected.</li>
            <li> Love Hempz products, this one has a nice soft sent to it. Will deff. purchase again!</li>
            <li> Next lotion purchase will be on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Lotion works great! I was originally introduced to this line of lotion by a nail technician, and fell in love with the feel and the scent. I loved the clean and fresh, but not overpowering scent of the original hempz lotion, and upon first putting this lotion on I thought it smelled the same...but I think it actually might be a tad different than the hempz lotion I&#x27;d used before. Maybe it was a weird batch, or maybe I&#x27;m mis-remembering but I don&#x27;t think the scent is quite the ssme as the hempz you purchase in the store. Even though the smell is a little off, the lotion still works great and I&#x27;m still using it every day. Overall, it&#x27;s such a great deal and I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and always keeps my skin moisturized but never greasy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this product.  I bought offline and saved 12.00 instead of buying in the salon.  It works great.  I apply it after the shower and it moisturizes all day long.  Smells like bananas to me.  (Not overpowering)  I have people stop me and ask me what perfume I am wearing so they must like it too!  Don&#x27;t hesitate if you are looking for a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you are a devout lover of Supre Hempz Lotion, then beware of the desirable price of this cheap knock-off lotion! I was and just received my shipment and the lotion was crap. Nothing like the REAL product, and their marketing gimmick (packaging may vary), is where they suck you in! This lotion was NOT moisturizing and I could&#x27;ve found something comparable at my local supermarket. Cheap. So disappointed. That&#x27;s what you get for trying to save a few bucks; crap.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this on Amazon..The price is unbeatable..&lt;br /&gt;I have used this lotion in the past &amp; always loved the results..&lt;br /&gt;leaves my skin sooooo soft, its best to use as soon as you get out of the shower...&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping..</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever!!!  Use it!!</li>
            <li> Product smells AMAZING (like a banana and strawberry smoothie), moisturizes really  well, and leaves skin feeling soft! great for after tan use! I love this brand and plan to buy this lotion as well as other products in the future.</li>
            <li> The only lotion I use</li>
            <li> If you can get this for around $10, it&#x27;s a steal!  By far the best lotion I&#x27;ve had.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I really thought the smell would be a lot better than what I was expecting. I was wrong and am amazed at how popular this lotion is. It&#x27;s nice that it isn&#x27;t heavy, but the smell is overwhelming. Smells like that horrible banana smell. Never again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!! Love hempz</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It smells like bubblegum and leaves your skin feeling so smooth and smelling great. The price is also a plus, at my local beauty supply store this is $19.99. It was defiantly a great deal and reasonable shipping time!</li>
            <li> This lotion has been around for years and I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon, better price here than at Beauty Brands. Love the scent and the thickness. It&#x27;s not oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great and feels incredible on your skin, whether you tan or not! It&#x27;s such a great moisturizer that even my boyfriend started using it. A must-have!</li>
            <li> my skin &amp;#60;3&#x27;s Hempz!!! yours will too!!!!</li>
            <li> Most amazing lotion ever...Great for after sun tanning or a salon tan. I feel like it keeps my tan longer. The scent is so yummy, very soothing and calming smell. Last forever. Not greases a all it soaks into the skin leaving you smoth and dry free.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells great, moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> ... And not just because of the hemp leaf on the front. Smells good, not overpowering, not greasy. Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between the ones I get at the salon and the one I got from amazon.</li>
            <li> Arrived without a hitch or leaky bottle for that matter. This stuff is hard to come by overseas. Great lotion!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion as a daily moisturizer. It provides all day moisture and the smell is pleasant and works for all four seasons. If I had one complaint it would be that sometimes the pump doesn&#x27;t work as well once you get more than halfway done with the bottle, but turning the bottle upside down and unscrewing the pump still allows you to get every drop of this fabulous lotion. I was first introduced to this lotion at a spa and the price was $20, so being able to purchase it at almost half the prize at amazon.com allows me to use this lotion on a regular basis. My skin really misses it when I run out.</li>
            <li> This lotion is made for a 7 year old girl.  If that&#x27;s you, you&#x27;ll love it. The product I received looks identical to the one shown, but the ingredients are different and it smells like bubble gum, there is nothing \\&quot;herbal\\&quot; about it.  It&#x27;s a rip off.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It makes your skin so soft without feeling greasy.  It has a light, pleasant fragrance that can be worn with just about any perfume.  Good for anyone that suffers from dry skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion has an overbearing scent of strawberry banana or bubble gum.  I find myself applying this lotion several times a day since it doesn&#x27;t provide the same level of moisturizing as the Aveeno or Vaseline Intensive Care lotions I&#x27;m used to.  Needless to say, I will not be buying this lotion ever again.  After reading all the positive reviews, I expected a much better quality product with a much better scent.  I am very disappointed I purchased this item and wish I could return the unused portion for a refund.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! Started using it over a year ago when I puchased it at my tanning salon. I have used. All different kinds of mositureizers in the past but this one is the best by far :) Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion ever. I usually buy it at my local tanning salon but I pay 4 times more for it there. I love that I can buy my favorite lotion on here.</li>
            <li> I receive compliments constantly from people walking by re how goooood this smells. Universal. Great beach lotion. P.s. Try the pomegranate hempz lotion for a more feminine scent or if you desire a significant other to kiss your body,, scent is good and taste is ok ;)</li>
            <li> I have said this before, Hempz is the best lotion I have ever used and will continue as long as it is available. That&#x27;s because when something gets so popular somebody wants to buy the company and the next company starts cutting corners for more profit.</li>
            <li> This my favorite one.  I do love all of them but this scent is my favorite.  Great price</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is different for sure, but the moisturizing effects are hand over fist worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with this item, and as a regular tanner it really helped my skin &amp; tan!!</li>
            <li> it kill my dry skin especially in winter time.</li>
            <li> Its amazing how soft and velvety this lotion is. Really pleasant tactile experience, very absorbent. Also, the smell is truly wonderful. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better lotion.</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest moisturizers I have ever used. It  isn&#x27;t oily. The fragrance of this one, which is the original one, is so soft and fresh...not overpowering. If you purchase this in the store you will pay twice the price. Amazon offers it at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Once you try Hempz, you wont want any other lotion brand. My favorite scent ever.</li>
            <li> not too greasy, not too thick. absorbs quick. skin feels more supple after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smells amazing (almost like the bubble gum amoxicillin they give to kids lol). might think this lotion&#x27;s not cheap but for the quality it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re giving it away at 20$ a bottle (not really, but it ain&#x27;t Kiehls). The body butter&#x27;s to die for. so is the pomegranate scented kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tip: this stuff&#x27;s the secret to achieving and keeping a tan. otherwise half your tan scrubs off in the shower if you don&#x27;t moisturize, and this product&#x27;s made for that purpose - which is why you see it a lot at tanning salons.</li>
            <li> Reordered for my wife as she absolutely loves this lotion. It&#x27;s not to sticky after applying &amp; repairs her dry skin &amp; mine within a couple days.</li>
            <li> I really do like this lotion. It smells amazing, as everyone says and really has helped my dry skin. I only have really dry skin in between my knuckles and my hand itself and used to use Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair which was the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. The only issue was that it was incredible greasy and left residue on the leather in my car and on desk. It didn&#x27;t smell the best either but it worked. Hempz works for sure, just not as well. But I&#x27;d much rather have a non greasy lotion that I have to reapply than one that is greasy. So far my knuckles have improved but still get dry if I don&#x27;t reapply regularly. I would for sure recommend this product for its richness and smell. I&#x27;d say its effectiveness is a 7 out of 10.</li>
            <li> package may vary aka this is a fake/knockoff</li>
            <li> Salong product, much better prices.</li>
            <li> All you need to know is that this stuff is absolutely amazing! I got it for my girlfriend and she loves it!</li>
            <li> This is not Hempz. It does not have the fragrance of Hempz. I agree with the other reviews, it smells like bubblegum or cotton candy.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion. Smells great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product especially after being out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Smells like bubblegum, but I confirmed that it is supposed to smell like that. Great daily moisturizer, especially on sensitive skin. It goes on smooth, and absorbs quickly. Plus your skin smells great!</li>
            <li> i dont usually use moisturizers, but this stuff works awesome.&lt;br /&gt;and even though im a guy, it smells great.  great for keeping&lt;br /&gt;a tan.  i will always purchase Hempz products from now on.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 weeks before leaving this review. I realy wanted to love this lotion because of all of the amazing reviews! Let me first just say that the lotion does smell amazing, by far the best smelling lotion I have ever used. On the other hand that is about the only positive thing I have to say about it.  I found this lotion to be the least moisturizing lotion I have ever used. I wouldn&#x27;t mind as much if it was just another $5 drug store lotion, but it&#x27;s not! I paid $14 for it and feel like I got jipped big time. I will continue to use the bottle I bought until it runs out, but I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  IT ARRIVED WITHIN A WEEK.  THIS COMPANY DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB.  I AM GOING TO ORDER ANOTHER BOTTLE NOW.  I WOULDN&#x27;T HESITATE!</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever! Smells amazing. It&#x27;s a must have for any person, girl or guy. I&#x27;m buying one more for my desk at work.</li>
            <li> This is honestly one of the best moisturizers on the market and with the price of it in beauty supply stores, the best way to save money is by buying on the Amazon market. Regardless of the price, I pretty much swear by this lotion now. It is ultra moisturizing, smells amazing, and has a non-greasy formula. I&#x27;ve always been told by friends that I have the silkiest, baby-soft skin, and that&#x27;s pretty good for 25! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the lotion itself is nice and creamy and i enjoy it, but wouldn&#x27;t buy again because it smells like Pez.</li>
            <li> I love the Hempz lotion.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing and has a light fresh scent that won&#x27;t clash with perfumes or other scents I wear.  I have bought it for several years at Ulta and just recently starting buy it on Amazon.  I am saving almost $10 a bottle.  All around awesome!</li>
            <li> I received this lotion yesterday.  Excited to try it, I put some on my hands as I was leaving the house.  Big mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews said this had a light, fruity scent.  Fruity, yes.  Light, no.  It has a very strong, overpowering odor of fake strawberries.  I don&#x27;t know how well the lotion works, but the odor made me sick.  My sinuses filled up almost immediately, giving me a headache that lasted all night, even after I was finally able to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have issues with strong scents, stay away.  I&#x27;ve given this to a friend who doesn&#x27;t have these problems.</li>
            <li> I have never given such a low rating in my life. I definitely love hemp oil based things. but this stuff is CRAZY! I put it on - it smelled fantastic...like strawberries and springtime. Later that night my arm began to itch and itch and itch. I scratched at it like I had 200 bug bites - at first I thought I must have an reaction to my washing detergent but nope it was this lotion. It wasn&#x27;t too bad on my legs but my arms were literally covered in a little rash that itched like the dickens...no fun. I gave this stuff away...</li>
            <li> What more can you say about lotion other then I love this stuff and have used it for years. Keeps your hands moisturized but not greasy and it smells great. Life long buyer here</li>
            <li> Love the hempz loition but the bottle didn&#x27;t come wrapped like they normally do and the pump was cracked and it had leaked out a bit. I could at least take my pump off my old bottle and put it on the damaged one at least. Besides that best loition I&#x27;ve ever used works great for dry skin and isn&#x27;t greasy!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 6 yrs. I have purchased a lot of different moisturizers and this one&lt;br /&gt;seems to be the best for me. Has a light scent and med. consistency.</li>
            <li> I started using Hempz years ago while working at a tanning salon up north. It was the one the employees loved the most. Best lotion ever!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my face, but it has a fragrance that clashes with my aftershave, so no good. Otherwise, it performs it&#x27;s function as a moisturizer. No smells listed in the description so it gets one star.</li>
            <li> perfect love the smell the price was basically getting 2 for 1 if you were to buy it in the store</li>
            <li> ...reminds me of how red PEZ tastes.  My wife had a little sampler of the stuff and just catching a whiff of it I had to go buy some.  I bought a huge thing of it and now I am a little sick of the smell, but it was awesome while it lasted.  There are better moisturizers out there but this one just smells better to me than all the rest.  I finally decided to go with an unscented, though!</li>
            <li> LOVE the fragrance, which is refreshing and clean smelling.  This, plus the wonderfully creamy texture, make this cream a delight for anyone suffering with dry skin.  Really works.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it smells amazing!!! Shipped out fast.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! Arrived quickly and safely.  Will be ordering again!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Has always been my favorite lotion</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product I bought it as a gift it was delivered very quickly. Definately a great holiday deal, smells great and gets your hands back in good shape. No damages and I recommend it to everyone who uses lotion!!</li>
            <li> Just as we hoped thanks.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Leaves your skin moisturized for a long time. I used this little guy up in a month! I&#x27;m pretty religious about lotion everyday though. Get this product.</li>
            <li> Good lotion but it smells like candy.  Which would be really cute if I were younger but for a 46 year old I would rather smell fresh.  My husband likes the lotion though and the smell for whatever reason does not bother him at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem like normal hemp lotion to me.... I&#x27;m sticking to purchasing this from the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever.  No greasy but makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, does the job!</li>
            <li> I have have ordered this lotion twice and even the second time I was impressed. I love the smell and how soft my skin feels after applying the lotion. It especially works and feels great after tanning.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff. Love.</li>
            <li> Makes a great salad dressing</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and my hands are so soft because of this lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome. Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and silky. Dries quickly and smells light and lovely. (Word to the wise) the scented versions are a bit overwhelming the original is perfect.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion! I received a sample from a friend who works in a nail salon. After trying it, I had to buy a big bottle. The smell is fantastic, nice and clean. Not flowery or over-bearing. The lotion never feels sticky or greasy. I highly recommend for anyone who is looking for an everyday, all-over body lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and find it works better than most moisturizers. I have no wrinkles and it feels good on my face. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to stay younger looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good lotion, I just hate the bubblegum smell</li>
            <li> I just recently discovered this brand of lotion. I received this during a Christmas party in our office. I used it a couple of times and I realized how great it was. My skin was outrageously healthy looking and felt smooth to touch. I think that because it is an herbal lotion in that it could give my skin the needed health and glow.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I live in Colorado and use it year round. I&#x27;m glad I can purchase it here on Amazon at a reasonable price. I also highly recommend Hempz Body Butter which I use on the backs of my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought that natural oils might be better than the synthetic junk found in other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes fine, but it&#x27;s scent is pervasive.  It isn&#x27;t a bad smell, it&#x27;s just one that strongly reminds you that you smell like strawberries.&lt;br /&gt;Not for me, but as far as moisturizing it does an OK job.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion. It has a great scent, and it moisturizes even better. I love that it is made with organic oil, as I try to stick with products that are organic. My husband and I both it use daily, it is good for your entire body. The best part about it is that its not oily. I don&#x27;t like lotions that are oily and leave your skin feeling greasy. This lotion does not do that. The only person that didnt like the smell is my son, his a teenager and he says that it smells a bit girly, which in a way it does, hence the reason I only gave the item 4 stars. The packaging is very good as the bottle is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t get clogged when pumping. I purchased this lotion on August 05, 2013 and it&#x27;s now November 15, so it did last quite sometime. It was used regularly. I would recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> Sure, at first this might look like a nice, reasonably gender neutral, hemp-infused lotion.  Not so!  Lo&#x27; and behold, it arrived in a pink bottle.  &amp;#34;Oh well&amp;#34;  I tell myself, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s not like I need a metallic blue bottle just to feel secure in my masculinity&amp;#34;.  I tried it out on my dried-out, jacked up arms (they get pretty bad when it&#x27;s 10 degrees outside).  Big mistake.  The powerful scent of fake bananas overwhelmed my senses, and stayed with me for hours.  Not only did it smell terrible, it smelled feminine.  Powerfully feminine.  It was too much.  I couldn&#x27;t take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fine to sell hyper-feminine lotions for people who can stomach the smell of fake fruit, but there should at least be a warning on the product page!  And in the meantime, why not provide a product with neutral packaging and a neutral scent?  Show some love for us male hemp enthusiasts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it did leave my skin soft and supple.  :P</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters birthday she loves it. This is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t burn her dry chapped hands. Bought more for christmas gifts. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Seen the same thing in spas for double the price.</li>
            <li> First of all, it broke me out in the worst hives I&#x27;ve had since I was a kid, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the product.  However, you should make sure you have smelled this before you buy it.  A very very overpowering, sickly feminine smell.</li>
            <li> This lotion is paraben free which was a reason I started buying it. Have used this lotion for years and it has remained my favorite. Super moisturizing and smells SO good. I highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> The Hempz Herbal Moisturizer is a unique lotion that has many perks for the skin. It goes on smooth and it gives the skin a glow and shine that last for a long period of time. And it smells great with all the different botanical herbs. Once applied to the skin people know where you were because of the lasting effect it leaves in that area. I love this lotion and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Needed the one for the hands.  This was the right product but wrong item...my fault I guess...... Need to read very carefully.</li>
            <li> Exactly how it was described, works wonders&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS LIKE BANANAS by the way&lt;br /&gt;Still have it and I still love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love hempz lotion. This lotion seems to be a little thinner than what I get. Great for dry skin. Smells good</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion, it is very hydrating and it is not greasy but rather smooth and refreshing. By far my favorite lotion out there! It also shipped really fast :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years--it works really well for me, my skin is on the dry side, even my daughter uses it</li>
            <li> This shiznit is amazing.  The smell is lovely and it doesnt dry your skin out at all.  Must buy people!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I used a similar product made by a local vender that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one might be great, but I can&#x27;t get over the smell. It smells like liquid amoxicillin. Like the stuff you take as a kid when you&#x27;re sick. Yuck.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells amazing and is really moisturizing!! It&#x27;s great. I will use it everyday. It&#x27;s my favorite. Great product</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would of been a great lotion,somewhat organic and naturally light on the skin, I was wrong, its greasy like a pork sandwich and the scent is so overpowering that you cant escape it. malibu island scents hemp lotion is 10x better, it costs more, but it fits my needs to a T.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  I have fairly dry hands since I wash them a lot at my job.  This lotion is fabulous!!  It is not greasy.  It has a subtle smell without being purfumey.  I use it regularly on my entire body.  Great buy!!</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin hydrated and looking great, especially during dry weather. The smell is great! I use it all year round.</li>
            <li> This lotion is gentle enough for me yet strong enough for my husband! It&#x27;s a great lotion that smells delicious! If you have really dry skin I would highly recommend this lotion! The price is 1/2 of what I can buy it for at salons or stores!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a new moisturizer. I&#x27;d been a Cetaphil user for years and it worked great at first but over time, it wasn&#x27;t enough for the winter months. Hempz seems to do the trick and seems to be just as good, but I still prefer the cetaphil cream for my really rough/dry wintery days. The scent of this lotion is nice and light, fades after a few hours, but the moisture definitely stays in your skin. I would buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, not oily at all and smells wonderful. Smells a bit like coconut.  Delivered very quickly too.  Would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I hate lotion. I actually hate all types of lotion, and I wash my hands as soon as I rub it on my arms and legs. Hempz is my favorite - I love the smell and the hydration. Unfortunately, I just found out that it has a 7 out of 10 hazard rating on cosmeticsdatabase DOT com, so I will immediately discontinue use of it and find something safer. So bummed :( I expect a better produt, Hempz!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion a week ago because the good review on amazon and the Herbal label. It feels very liquid at the first moment but it is very moisturizing than other lotions I tried, and the skin was not itchy anymore. However, the smell is so strong which I don&#x27;t like it, just like a fake fragrance. I may try other brand next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by all the positive reviews of this lotion. I cannot get past the smell. Who *wants* to smell like strawberry banana? Please, comment - help me understand. Right on the back it states that it is \\&quot;soft breezy floral, strawberry and banana\\&quot; scented. I should have read through the reviews more carefully - I will never use this, no matter how moisturizing! Blech.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hempz lotion for years.  So happy I can order it from Amazon.  The best feature is the light scent &amp; the non-greasy feel on your skin.</li>
            <li> The product may work well but I will never know because it smells really bad.  Whatever scent they added is horrible.  Would have been much better off with an orderless product or at least something that does not smell like  a cheap fruity bubble gum. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great smelling lotion. It actually makes the skin feel soft. It shipped very fast! Very happy costumer! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very thick and smells great! I used this after I shower - especially in the winter. It makes my skin soft and moist for longer than other products I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t have that watered-down feeling like some other lotions. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Best Lotion Ever!  Love how smooth it makes my skin.  Love the scent of Strawberries and bananas.  Skin is hydrated all day with this lotion.  Also, I have sensitive skin, this passed the test.  Highly Recommended.  Save 50% from Retail on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great!  Smells amazing and no oily residue.  It moisturizes better than any other lotion i have ever had!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Ive ordered this lotion multiple times. Its not greasy and it rubs in easy. Not a strong smell. Use daily.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product. I already knew about this product from the tanning salons that I attend. I highly recommend it for those who go tanning as an after tanning lotion, it is known to help keep the tan and help preserve it longer. also, it is made from all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I use this lotion daily, and after I tan. Very moisturing as well as fantastic smelling. Product came fast and in good condition. There was a large dent in the side of the bottle, so it doesnt stand well on my counter - that is why i docked the rating a star.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, great price, fast shipment! Thank you</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!!! Its not sticky after appling and smells wonderful!!!!!!  I,m ordering more......The price is GREAT!!!!! I have people ask me the name of my perfume, and I tell them its Hempz Body Lotion........</li>
            <li> We are addicted to this FABULOUS lotion - it is smooth, creamy, and not greasy - nothing is better than this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lotion and does what lotion do.  I rate it 3 stars because it has a scent reminiscent of bubble gum.  I don&#x27;t like smelling faintly of bubble gum.</li>
            <li> First of all, the shipping speed is so quick. I like the fragrance which makes me feel comfortable. And I thought this moisturizer fits my skin very well. I feel so excited to have found the right product. Recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing!  I normally hate lotion but sometimes my hands get so dry (I work at an animal hospital and wash my hands a lot) I have to use some, we had this at work and i fell in love. I use it daily now.</li>
            <li> Wife loves the Hempz and have purchased it i other outlets but have come to use Amazon regularly as they have the best price and service.  Always purchase enough for free shipping and arrives on time every time.  Great silky feel and very nice smell but not vower bearing.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect everyday lotion.  I use on my legs and arms as needed.  It is the perfect smell, that reminds me of some good memory, but isn&#x27;t too strong.  I can still use perfume and feel like the 2 aren&#x27;t competing.  On my 2nd bottle and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I like the Hemp lotion, just not the scent so much.... But it fades quickly. It really helps with the dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> it smells really good. i would say just ok moisture job. i thk i would switch to some others after this.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it&#x27;s mild and smells very tropical. The lotion itself is extremely moisturizing and I have never owned a product quite like this. It is worth every penny and I cannot see myself ever needing another moisturizer. It&#x27;s also great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is not a great moisturizer and on top of that it smells bad. My wife doesn&#x27;t like me wearing it when she is around because of the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product; it&#x27;s my new favorite! This cream is light and smells so good on top of how good it feels on your skin and how well it moisturizes. I will definitely be buying more :)</li>
            <li> Some of the very best lotion on the market.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, I use it almost everyday it smells great and helps to eliminate my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No break outs, no clogged pores and absorbes right into your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No oily feeling!!</li>
            <li> Best item i bought v. Gotta keep  hind it from my son. .</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning it is very strong smell, so if your allergic to scents do not buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great in Denver, Colorado. We have dry air and this keeps my skin healthy and moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem like a knock off. I have salon one and this one, The only difference is the salon charges a lot more for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy again from here.</li>
            <li> awesome fragrance and keeps me soft all day.</li>
            <li> Love love love this lotion. I love how moisturizing it is, and I&#x27;m so obsessed with the smell. This is seriously my favorite lotion, and with the great price that Amazon is selling it for, you really can&#x27;t beat it. I would definitely purchase this again from this seller because the lotion and value is amazing!</li>
            <li> love this lotion, makes skin very soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this lotion but the fragrance is overwhelmingly sweet, so much that I would have passed on this product if I had known what to expect. I was careful to choose the one labeled Original vs. the ones that mentioned fragrance, thinking to avoid the sweet scent, but no. I probably should have returned it.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this moisturizer.  It works really well to keep my skin soft, especially in a Wisconsin winter.  It also works great at extending your tan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as creamy as it used to be but I like how it smells and my husband still uses it.</li>
            <li> my wife LOVES this lotion - initially purchased it from her hair-stylist for $21 and absolutely couldnt live without it.  It was too expensive to maintain though, so i&#x27;m glad I found it on amazon.  Finding it here for 1/2 price was ideal, now she gets to use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Im the type that immediately slathers lotion on from head to toe after a shower. This lotion has a great, light scent. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy at all. It keeps my skin hydrated all day. My husband has even started using it.</li>
            <li> A fine product. Excellent customer service</li>
            <li> I do like this product. It&#x27;s been many years since I bought it from a salon and I am not sure if it&#x27;s my lack of memory or not, but this seems different than what I remember. It is still a great amount of product that works well and smells good for the price.</li>
            <li> its smells so good and makes my skin so soft .</li>
            <li> It smells so good.  I used this after being out in the sun or after tanning.  I love this product and would recommend it.  ;-) Enjoy....</li>
            <li> Fast service. Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> The only cream I will buy</li>
            <li> Best lotion on the planet. All purpose moisturizer that definitely helps your skin, best thing is how good it smells.</li>
            <li> They sell this at tanning salons - and a little more pricey. This is my favorite scent, I always get compliments on the scent because its light and sweet.</li>
            <li> First, the lotion was leaking out of the top when I opened the package. Secondly, tt smells so bad I will not use it.  I considered returning it, but with the costs and the trouble involved, it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Lesson learned, buy a product you are familiar with.  I purchase alot online, but never cosmetics or toiletries again.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion but wish they would find a natural alternative to the propylene glycol. I&#x27;m going to buy another lotion until they change the formula. My bottle at home lists it as propenadiol ( I probably spelled that wrong) but its the same thing as propylene glycol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...</li>
            <li> I believe I got the bubble gum knock off. :-(</li>
            <li> Love this lotion you can keep putting on more and it keeps soaking in to your skin,love the smell and good value best of all its not tested on animals</li>
            <li> Loved it, all gone now but smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I first found Hempz lotion while living in Nebraska. It is unavailable in Kansas. I was happy to find it available here at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is smooth, thick and great for sensitive skin. The scent is mild, never overpowering.</li>
            <li> Hemp lotion is a staple in my home. Leaves my skin soft during a long, dry winter, without feeling greasy. The smell evokes the feeling of the topics even though I&#x27;m in New England.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fabulous! It is hydrating and makes your skin very soft. And to boot, it smells delicious! Even my guy friends love it. I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> terrible fragrance.  good lotion though.</li>
            <li> First used this at a cousin&#x27;s house and came home wanting to get some myself.  Works well and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Best lotion out there...order repeatedly...I have sensitive skin and this is outstanding.  Not greasy or oily, smells great and use everyday.</li>
            <li> Our favorite lotion and this price is outstanding.  The only lotion we use now - my husband loves it as well.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells cheap... too strongly of bubble gum.  It gives me headaches.  Be aware, there are no returns once you purchase!  Now I&#x27;m stuck with a bottle of lotion that I&#x27;ll never use.  Maybe I&#x27;ll give it to a college kid to enjoy.</li>
            <li> Cheaper here than any store I have found, love this and it works too. Great price for this wonderful product. Love the original scent</li>
            <li> I bought a small sample of this lotion in my local pharmacy and fell in love with the smell. The larger bottle was too expensive for me and when I checked here it was $5.00 less. The lotion makes my skin feel very smooth and makes me smell scrumptuous. If you try it I hope you like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something intoxicating about the smell of this moisturizer. Skin feels soft and rejuvenated. I always wear after a day at the beach and it seems to help my tan last longer. I like that the consistency is not too thick that I feel like I&#x27;m going to stick to anything, but it seems to soak right in.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t repeat what other reviewers are saying about the quality of this lotion. It is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell, on the other hand, is incredibly strong. You WILL smell like fruit-flavored antibiotics for the entire day, so keep that in mind when you buy this. I used it only on my legs so my pants would mask the smell. I bought a different lotion for my arms, neck, chest so I wouldn&#x27;t be walking in a toxic cloud all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this is my first and last time using Hempz.</li>
            <li> The best lotion ever!  Great price and ships quickly...my whole family loves this lotion, great to use after tanning! Buy it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just thick enough and smells wonderful. Love this and will definitely get it again when it runs out, which will probably be soon.</li>
            <li> same quality product as you buy in the store.  Smelled great, the texture was slightly less thick than usual, but i figured the thickness would vary with each batch.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great, and is not tested on animals. It also has a wonderful, light scent that I particularly love! I originally began using Hempz several years ago when I lived in Hawaii and was obsessed with laying out in the sun. Now that I&#x27;ve come to my senses and learned to love my natural skin tone, I still love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with Hempz is that if your skin is severely dry, a few applications may be necessary. This may be an issue for people living in drier climates (like me). For that reason, I give it four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the lotion leaves no greasy or unpleasant feel on the skin after application, and it absorbs quickly. Great for after the shower. Hempz is definitely worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> Smells really yummy, almost too yummy. I almost took a bite out of my arm the other day because it smelled so good.&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin feel awesome.&lt;br /&gt;No THC thankfully or I&#x27;d be high as balls 24/7</li>
            <li> INTRODUCED TO THIS PRODUCT OVER 15 YRS AGO, LOVE IT. gREAT PRICE AND QUICK DELIVERY</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.Been using for years.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! The scent is delicious and it it super moisturizing to my dry winter skin....give it a try!</li>
            <li> Tried this at a salon, but found the price a bit steep. I decided to check out Amazon and so glad I did! After reading some of the negative reviews, I knew this had to be the real stuff! The smell, consistency and results are exactly the same which means to me , I got the real Hempz at half the price that the salons charge.</li>
            <li> Hempz lotion is the best! Love the smell and just a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this again! I love the smell and doesn&#x27;t leave me greases; nor does it break out my face.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered and great price!!</li>
            <li> Love it , I would recommend it , it works well.</li>
            <li> this smells DIVINE!  absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and wonderful.  highly recommend this lotion!  (it&#x27;s also kind of fun to see the faces on my coworkers when they realize that the lotion on my desk has a pot leaf on the label :) )</li>
            <li> I buy this lotion because it smells so good (and I&#x27;m fairly sensitive to smells). It does a very good job moisturizing, even in the dead of winter. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the price, but Amazon still has the best deal around!</li>
            <li> Works great on my sensitive skin. Absorbs quickly and has a light, clean scent. I&#x27;ll never use another lotion again!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion ever!  Feel in love with it over 40 years ago! Not sticky, absorbs quickly and smells devine!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and have been looking for it for quite a while.  It smells really nice (not like marijuana...lol) and leaves my hands soft and smooth without being too sticky or greasy. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Smells great. Only complaint is that it just isn&#x27;t quite moisturizing enough for me for brutal winters here in Minnesota.</li>
            <li> We received a sample bottle a couple years ago, and now we have purchased this &amp;#34;king sized&amp;#34; version and it&#x27;s in an strategic place in our living room for easy access. This product doesn&#x27;t lay on top of your skin, it hydrates amazingly. Best Buy.</li>
            <li> This is THE best lotion I have ever used!  Plus it smells heavenly!  If you have never tried it, you must!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. It is by far my favorite lotion. EVER. It isn&#x27;t slimy at all and it smells like heaven. :) I&#x27;m never buying another brand again.</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer, smells good and does not leave skin oily. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  Love the smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion. Great fragrance</li>
            <li> Love this lotion it makes my hands soft.  It also came in the time they said.</li>
            <li> not quite the scent I was expecting; but still a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have used this for over two years.  It is a great moisturizer; creamier than other popular brands.  My hair stylist gave me a sample,  Since then, I have bought it.  My daughter-in-law likes it too.</li>
            <li> So I went to my usual tanning salon and I saw this exact same product for sale there for over $20! I was like, &amp;#34;Are you kidding me?&amp;#34; but then I found it on here. I LOVE this lotion! It smells amazing and it is such a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that i found this here for the price, oh my gosh what a steal compared to what i was originally buying it at. love the smell great for after a day out in the sun, nice summer smell. definitely recommending.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells amazing, it makes your skin super soft, and was really cheap to buy! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion. A friend of mine used this and I asked her what smelled so good.  When she showed me the bottle, I bought it the next day for myself and one for my mother as a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> By far the best moisturizer available on the market.Scent is relaxing and attractive.Hempz ingredient cured my psoriasis completely!!! Has many uses throughout the year.</li>
            <li> Seriously smells great and leaves my skin feeling super soft! Can&#x27;t go wrong. I use it after I&#x27;m in the sun.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! It has such a great scent and really does keep your skin hydrated, super great product!</li>
            <li> According to Hempz, this is fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients lists don&#x27;t match and Hempz only has two direct to consumer venues that they use. Amazon&#x27;s review policies will not allow me to list them here, look up the phone number for Hempz and ask them for the information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really happy about this candy/pez/bubblegum spelling knock off lotion and will be seeking a refund for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve gotten a knock off product on Amazon, guess I have to be more careful.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift for our daughter-in-law.  I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love it.  Great price!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the correct brand. I don&#x27;t know about other reviewers claiming it&#x27;s a knock-off, but my order was the real deal. Great price, and it came right on time.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing. And doesn&#x27;t leave your hands sticky like most lotions do.</li>
            <li> Smell like the land of ooo from adventure time and is really gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> Hempz lotion is wonderful.  Oridinal is my favorite, the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The strong fruity smell can give you a headache, it doesn&#x27;t feel as moisturizing as the Gold Bond Ultimate Softening Lotion with Shea butter.</li>
            <li> this product smell really really bad and for the first time I used it, the cheap and strong sense make me so sick even headache. This is not the same as the &#x27;original&#x27; product. they refill cheap lotion in it.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I ever use. It is an all over body lotion, I have using this for over 25 years.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite brands. it&#x27;s so moisturizing and you don&#x27;t need constant reapplication.</li>
            <li> I did not like the lotion. Too watery, need to apply a couple layers before feeling mousturized. And the smell!!! It&#x27;s okay by its too strong for me.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE AND SMELLS GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> My hands get very very dry and I keep this product on my desk to use throughout the day.  It lasts forever (using it several times a day on just my hands).  I finally ordered a replacement after a couple years through Amazon as it is much cheaper here then at the salon where I got my first bottle.  The scent is nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  Moisturizes and softens better than anything else I have ever used.  I love the scent, too.</li>
            <li> I use this both day and night. It cools my summer feet and keeps them from being so dry. At night time I use it with socks to keeps that softness feeling into the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hempz is a product I will use for as long as they make it. I make my feet feel good...</li>
            <li> At first I really did not understand how people can rave so much about a lotion, I mean its just lotion after all - all lotion is pretty much the same as long as it moisturizes my skin. I guess you can say I was skeptical especially the retail price is pretty high for a body lotion, luckily amazon sells this for more than half the price. I have tried almost every lotion out in the drugstore and some department store brands. So I decided why not give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;First off the scent for the original formula is described as a fresh breezy floral with strawberry and banana. For me the scent is quite nice, but I&#x27;m not crazy about it because it does sometimes come off a little bit too strong for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;The formula itself was what really suprised me, it is 100% paraben free, gluten free and vegan. It is formulated with Shea butter, gingseng, vitamins A C and E. The formula is very light weight, smooth and is not greasy nor does it leave any sort of uncomfortable residue after application. The best part is that I actually notice that my skin stayed moisturized and smooth hours after I have applied it, where as most body lotions just sit on the skin or wears off in an hour or so leaving your skin right where you started, dry and tight. Even though this formula is somewhat light it absorbs very quickly and still provides excellent long lasting moisture.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion I definetly recommend this and this lotion, I will probably be repurchasing this again and trying some of the other scents they offer. Definetly give it a try!</li>
            <li> Hempz moisturizes great but it has a very strong and sweet smell. It is a little much for me. I probably will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product is great! As a guy, I&#x27;d like for it to have less of a frangrancy smell, but it does the trick way better than any other lotion that I&#x27;ve used before. It seeps into your skins and quenches it with moisture. I let my friend (a girl) use it one time and she made me order one for her. Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a salon because my manicurist used it on me and I love the way it feels and smells.  They were out of it one day so I decided to check out Amazon and I got it for half the price.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> While I had to wait about 24 hours for my lotion to thaw out due to the freezing temps in which it was left, I love this lotion. For someone who washes their hands a lot and lives in a  freezing climate, it&#x27;s the only lotion I have found that feels like it actually soaks in and makes my hands softer without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> My favorite smelling lotion! I love how creamy and moisturizing it is for my skin. It&#x27;s also all natural, no parabens! Hemp seed oil is very beneficial for your skin. I have also tried the Pomegranate version, but the original scent is definitely my favorite!</li>
            <li> Hempz lotion is the best lotion. It isn&#x27;t greasy and it makes my skin feel great! It smells good too.</li>
            <li> bought this because during cold weather, skin starts to get dry and ashy. my parents freaked out and thought i was smoking marijuana because of the icon, but after they found out it was just lotion made out of hemp, they tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li> The best product for dry skin!  I have used this product for several years</li>
            <li> This lotion is not greasy like a lot of lotions.  It don&#x27;t take very much and smells great.  Will buy more great price!</li>
            <li> Great lotion not greasy. Absorbs quickly. Convenient pump. Lasts long. Nice smell my husband loves it. Very popular  and well priced</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product on my constantly dry hands. It has a soft fruity smell that my coworkers believe smells like bananas. It does the job of keeping my hands moisturized.</li>
            <li> this is sweet like candy and highly mousterizing BUT absorbs quickly. i love the smell it is very girly and sweet.</li>
            <li> Love this product and so does everyone that comes over and tries it; I find my friends commenting how they like the feel and smell of it.  I couldn&#x27;t agree more but I tend to go through it quickly :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it smells like candy, but it&#x27;s good lotion and dries in seconds while keeping your hands/feet moisturized. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful! So rich, amazing smell, works great on face, arms and legs. Its moisturizing ability is long lasting.  Buying a gallon next!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this moisturizer and use it on my legs daily.  It&#x27;s not greasy and would be good for all skin types.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, however im not sure this is the original that i was looking for . It has more of a lavender fragrance, the one i was looking for wasn&#x27;t as scented.</li>
            <li> This is the best Moisturizer. Also, smell lasts for the entire day if you apply.&lt;br /&gt;Folks go for it :-)</li>
            <li> The original is by far my favorite. I keep this on my desk at work  for easy use. I also have a bottle at my house.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion and a great value of what you would pay online VS retail (usually $25 a bottle here).</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and the price was perfect, because this is not cheap lotion.  I feel like I got a great deal and my whole family loves the smell.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought it originally to use after getting some sun outside, but now I use it all the time. My tattoo artist actually recommended it for using on new tatts, so I&#x27;ve been doing that as well. Since I moved up north my hands and lips have constantly been cracked and dry, but this stuff took care of that in a matter of days.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be stocking up on this lovely stuff! Great smell, goes on wonderfully and isn&#x27;t greasy. It dries in about a minute and moisturizes instantly :)</li>
            <li> My Husband bought this to use after he tans to moisturize his skin. He likes this product and uses it anytime he tans.</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent hand moisturizer. I use this year around and it keeps my hands and body nice and soft even during the winter when your skin can become very dry. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smooth, smells great, no after oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hempz for at least a decade now. I use it as a facial lotion as well as a body lotion. I am 45 and still get compliments on my skin. Very moisturizing, very little smell to it, and I have one by every sink in the house.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and I love how it can moisturise for 12hrs straight! my skin glows now! and it looks so healthy!</li>
            <li> Wonderfully Awesome Lotion!!!! I had a few problems with dry skin and this lotion is the best I have ever used, problems are all&lt;br /&gt;gone.</li>
            <li> I love this brand! I have eczema so a lot of scented lotions burn my skin. I was relieved when I tried this lotion and my skin didn&#x27;t burn. It has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming. It rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy afterwards. I would recommend this product to anyone! I will be buying more and $11 a bottle is a great deal!</li>
            <li> I use this lotion after tanning and I love it. I use it on a daily basis and it is great. It doesn&#x27;t leave that thick film afterwards and it absorbs quickly and smells great.</li>
            <li> Smells greats, and moisturizes great!</li>
            <li> I started using it during last winter and still using it in the summer. I have very dry skin and this works really well.</li>
            <li> Received this moisturizer as a gift several years ago and must confess, I am addicted. Use it every day.  Bought a travel size container to put some in so I don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell!! Goes on great, not greasy at all. Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> i received my lotion within the time they said i would , and it is just amazing smells great! i love it!</li>
            <li> THE BEST LOTION EVER!!!!</li>
            <li> so far so good. i love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product so clean feeling and smell Great!</li>
            <li> Very nice thank you to upscale deal</li>
            <li> Quick shipment - excellent item</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Goes on clean (not greasy or slimy) and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> Best lotion out there.</li>
            <li> Best lotion on the planet. I&#x27;ve been using HempZ for about 10 years. Has a good smell that works for a man.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin and I also am prone to eczema.  I&#x27;ve tried many lotions on the market, even the ones people swear by and which are geared towards/advertised as able to heal eczema or at least keep it at bay.  I&#x27;ve tried the cheap stuff starting at a couple of bucks and worked up to the stuff that costs around $20 and none of them seemed to work, or if they worked it was short term, or the lotion/cream would be greasy or too thick, too thin and in some cases they just plain did not work.  I&#x27;ve tried using moisturizing gloves, fancy oils and even soaps to try and help with the issue...unfortunately none worked.&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago I decided to go cruelty free and found that many of the products that I had been using were tested on animals.  I had seen this lotion in places like Ulta and a couple of other specialty stores before, but sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to take a product seriously when it has a pot leaf on the label.  To a certain extent, that&#x27;s why I decided to try this stuff...marijuana has many healing attributes and nothing else had worked so far.  Plus even if it didn&#x27;t work at all, it would still be a novelty product.&lt;br /&gt;Within about 3 days the dry skin (which had begun to crack and bleed) was, for the most part cleared up!  It was still a little rough, but it wasn&#x27;t dry to the point of causing pain or opening and bleeding.  Other remedies had taken between 2wks-1 month for minimal results and this stuff worked immediately!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at Ulta and yes, Amazon does have a lot of third parties peddling counterfeit products, which is why I suggest either buying direct from the company (in this case Hempz) or finding out what the approved vendors are for this company&#x27;s products and buying only from those vendors.&lt;br /&gt;I guess the downsides to this stuff would be the price, but the way I look at it has become: I can buy 4 $5 lotions that yield disappointing results, or 1 lotion at $20 which gives me the results I want.&lt;br /&gt;The lotionis vegan and yes, it does have a small amount of hemp oil in it.  This does not mean &amp;#34;dude, I can smoke my lotion.&amp;#34;  The lotion is THC free and has other extracts/oils associated with healthy skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this is the best lotion I have used and I can&#x27;t really find a fault with it.  I sort of tried to find something wrong with it, but unless you&#x27;re completely against using marijuana for its healing attributes&lt;br /&gt;I got the original kind and it has a grassy, banana scent to it.  It&#x27;s not tropical, it&#x27;s more of a freshly cut lawn scent and it doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have yet to find a fault with this product and the first day of use I was trying to hate this product.  It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m against using marijuana for medicinal purposes, but because the giant hemp leaf on the front seemed too much like a gimmick/marketing ploy to the point where it would either be a useless novelty item or it would have to be an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;If you use too much, it can seem a bit thick and my only advice would be to use it sparingly...a little at a time.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, however when I ordered two bottles, both of them arrived with damaged pumps.  I had to dig my old one out of the garbage to be able to use it. I couldn&#x27;t fine the correct place to contact Amazone regarding the shipping condition, I will definetly order again, but will re think the shipping... Super Saver wasn&#x27;t a saver at ALL!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion at friends&#x27; houses in the past but never bought it for myself since it tends to be pricy in the stores. Found it on Amazon for a very reasonable price so i indulged myself :). The vey first time I tried it the pump seemed to break as stated in some of the other reviews and I was kind of p/o&#x27;ed, but then I unscrewed the pump completely off, put it back on and it seems to work just fine now! It smells super good, kind of like bananas and it feels so smooth, almost feels like its melting into your skin! So happy I treated myself to this lotion!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so great. When I use it at the club anyone who walks into the locker bay area always comments &amp;#34;what smells so great!&amp;#34;  Love this for gifts for any occassion</li>
            <li> Best lotion out there. Fast shipping from seller.</li>
            <li> This lotion works pretty well on my hands. It has a strong fragrance that I wasn&#x27;t really expecting. I guess I thought this would be a more &amp;#34; all natural&amp;#34; type of product, maybe smell like patchouli a little or something like that but it has a full on sweet flower fragrance like other lotions. Doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or gross but if you are looking for products that won&#x27;t contribute flowery smells to your hands, there are other hemp oil products that better fit the bill. Big container is a good value and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and the price was perfect!</li>
            <li> I was at my Son&#x27;s in Athens GA visiting.  I love to take long bubble baths and read in the tub. I noticed that my legs and feet were very dry and peeling of dead skin.  My son noticed that I was picking and scratching at them. He gave me some cream to put on them. What a difference it made.  I ask him what kind of cream it was.  Guess what Hempz Herbal Moisturizer.  He gave the rest to me to bring home.  My daughter-in-law used it and loved it, so we ordered her 2 bottles and me two bottles.  My girl friend from Gauley Bridge, WV was visiting me and tried it and she found it in her Beauty Salon and  bought it also.  We all love the difference it makes in our skin.  We wouldn&#x27;t be without it now. TRY IT!  YOU WILL LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, arrived quickly and sealed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all, and in California or dry/summer area&#x27;s its a must to have good lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuffs what i&#x27;ve been using for 5 years now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion. I found it in my tanning salon, helps dry skin improve immediately.  It&#x27;s not greasy, but it is smooth and smells great.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the pump does not work after using half the bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this product year round even when not tanning! Smells amazing... not greasy at all&lt;br /&gt;and your skin feels soft and does not get dried out all day!&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended!!!</li>
            <li> i used this all the time when i was a manager at a tanning salon. it is hands down the best lotion out there. stores are selling it for twice as much and it goes so fast its hard to justify buying it these days. once i found this on amazon i was hooked. will reorder for sure.</li>
            <li> Good product. The appeal for men is strong in this one. Highly recommend for guys looking for manly hygienic products.</li>
            <li> bought this for my son and he loved it!  I also purchased a small size perfect for my small purse!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Smells great and feels so good.</li>
            <li> The one and only lotion. Very hydrating and great smell. I give these as gifts and not one girl would not want this lotion. Also much better price on Amazon than at Ulta</li>
            <li> It smells so amazing and the smell is so amazing, i cant even explain how amazing this product is :)</li>
            <li> This lotion is GREAT. Smells great makes your skin feel GREAT ALL day.You only need apply it once and it last all day. Smells TERIFFIC</li>
            <li> Smells like bubblegum</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews that said this lotion was not authentic. I compared the lotion I received with the full price lotion I purchased at a salon. In my opinion, the two are identical. Same fragrance, same color, same feel and consistency. Half the cost. It makes me wonder if people leaving negative reviews own salons.</li>
            <li> Great price from Amazon, cheaper than in the stores. Absorbs quickly and has a unique smell. I like the pump top too.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  It smells amazing and leaves my skin super soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite for fighting dry winter weather in Wisconsin.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer</li>
            <li> This is certainly not the original.  I bought it and the smell was way off, went out and bought another one at Beauty Brands which is where I fell in love with the lotion.  The smell has nothing to do with it.  This one smells like some people say kind of bubble gum or almost banana like it is very strong and not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion if original is wonderful.  Not greasy, no residue, nice smell I love it and I usually hate putting lotion on, that says a lot. Highly recommended but not this one sold her, it is certainly not original.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this lotion. And the texture and feel of it is SOO nice! Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.  Bought this as a gift for my mom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely addicted to this moisturizer.  Love the smell too.  I use a tanning bed and it seems to really moisturize my skin afterwards and also right out of the shower.  I also use it as a moisturizer for my face.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THE ORIGINAL HEMPTZ LOTION AS WELL AS CITRUS AND A COUPLE OTHERS. BUT FOR ME NOTHING BEATS THE ORIGINAL SCENT AS WELL AS THE SOFTNESS IT BRINGS MY SKIN.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great and it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals. Also the price was awesome! It also has a mild scent.</li>
            <li> THis is a great product sold at a good price and with great service.  I have used this for years after swimming and it keeps your skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000OYJ9AO Hempz Herbal Moisturizer, 17-Fluid Ounce (500 ml) (Package may vary)]]This moisturizer without a doubt is the best I have ever used. I have very dry skin, and have tried many products to help with flaky skin. When I tried Hempz I was amazed, it really works, it lives up to it&#x27;s name, \\&quot;Moisturizer\\&quot;. Not even my legs look dry anymore, and it smells fantastic. I love this product and I hope that it never goes off the market. My skin feels silky and soft, even my children have noticed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for over 10 years and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I love the smell and it moisturizes my skin great. Amazon sells it for about $8 cheaper than I can buy it in the store so I can&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> i got this and am not crazy about the scent since i am a guy. But what i want to know is if this is ok for face lotion. I dont want it breaking me out either. It seems like a good product so far i just prefer unscented and i want to use it on my face but dont want to breakout.</li>
            <li> not much else to say!</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in this purchase.  Maybe I should have read more reviews.  I thought original would have been more of a lotion smell with no scent.  It is a very nice lotion altogether just not liking the smell as it is more for a woman then a man.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product.  I thought the because of the low price that I was going to get a watered down version but got the real deal!</li>
            <li> this is an amazing moisturizer &amp; it smells amazing! it doesnt leave a greasy residue on your skin! I absolutely lovve this product!</li>
            <li> smells so good and really moisturizes without being greasy. i like to use it after tanning and after showering because i shower in the morning and then again after i go to the gym. my skin can sometimes be dry because of this so it helps to use after the shower.</li>
            <li> I have very dry itchy skin. This lotion has made my skin less itchy by putting more moisture in my skin. The best thing is this lotion does not feel greasy like most lotions and it smells great. I highly recommend this lotion. It is the best.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leaves your skin hydrated for days!!! I highly recommend, and this coming from a beauty product junky!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It smells really good, but I still feel like I need to put lotion on after. I still feel dry. I don&#x27;t really recommend this product as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Saw this in a local tanning salon and fell in love with the smell.  Goes on great too, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.  Shipping and delivery was fast, great service!!</li>
            <li> I like this lotion a lot. It&#x27;s not greasy, but my husband complains that the smell is a little overwhelming for his taste.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more years than I can remember.  I only tan in the summer, but I find myself using this moisturizer even in the winter just for dry skin.  The smell isn&#x27;t too sweet, and doesn&#x27;t last long, but the moisture does.  I have eczema and this product is one of the few moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t cause an outbreak.  I would highly recommend this product and the price is WAY better than at the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this lotion, this is actually my first time purchasing Hempz products. Smells like bananas and strawberries, the scent last for hours. Love It!</li>
            <li> My brother&#x27;s friend had us try this once, and I always remembered how excellent it was compared to any lotion I ever had, and finally got some of my own. Ive never liked the feel of moisturizer or putting creams on my skin, my dad used to try to make me sample it at stores and I&#x27;d run away yelling. But this stuff is different! :) It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> Smell is nice. Great for after tanning.</li>
            <li> Everything was great and I love the lotion and so I gave the new ones to family members for Christmas. They arrived quickly and I appreciate that. Thank you, M. Reason</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Not too heavy and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and I love it.  My skin feels soft all day.  When I tried going back to my original lotion (Aveeno Naturals, Unscented), I was itching at my dry-feeling skin by the afternoon.  Once you start using Hempz, you&#x27;ll realize how much your other lotions have been letting you down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of scented/perfumed lotions, but this is just a hint and is a perfect balance.  I can&#x27;t say how much I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t even that strong.  It&#x27;s definitely there but after a few minutes you don&#x27;t even notice it.  Absorbs nice and fast.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best lotion - not sticky &amp; absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;ve used it for yrs. now &amp; will never change.  Even my massage therapist says I have the softest skin of all her clients.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for everyday use. It does not work as well on severely dry skin as I had hoped it would but still a great lotion!</li>
            <li> I very rarely write reviews for anything but I&#x27;m so in love with this lotion that I felt compelled. Hempz absorbs well, is not greasy and - this may be an illusion but my skin just looks better...smoother or something.  Another big perk is the smell. I have a very strong aversion to anything scented but the mild, faint, natural scent of Hempz Original is so nice.  It&#x27;s the only scented thing I use and I&#x27;ve had several people compliment me on how good I smell when I&#x27;ve used this lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Really does a great job of keeping your hands soft.  However the shipment I received was a mess! Broken containers and goop all over the place.</li>
            <li> THis is absolutely the best smelling lotion that I have every used, I love it. It works well for dry skin.</li>
            <li> i love this product. it the same one as the stores, just not as expensive :) i recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I looked up what Cannabis saltiva seed oil is and it says on wikipedia and other websites that \\&quot;Its seeds are chiefly used to make hempseed oil which can be used for cooking, lamps, lacquers, or paints. They are also used as caged-bird feed, for it is a moderate source of nutrients for most birds. The flowers (and to a lesser extent the leaves, stems, and seeds) contain psychoactive and physiologically active chemical compounds known as cannabinoids that are consumed for recreational, medicinal, and spiritual purposes. When so used, preparations of flowers (marijuana) and leaves and preparations derived from resinous extract (hashish) are consumed by smoking, vaporizing and oral ingestion. \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want anything to do with weird stuff like marijana or anything or have my family around it. I already bought 2 bottles of this stuff, but I don&#x27;t know if I should return it or not. Will this have negative effect on our body in anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can anyone answer?</li>
            <li> I received my lotions today and I am so pleased with them.  I have used this product in the past, but just found it to pricey and luckily found them at a great price and I just LOVE EM&#x27;!!!!!Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every moisturizer out there for dry skin.  After using this, I won&#x27;t use anything else.  No more dry skin!</li>
            <li> I have been using Hempz lotion for 6 years now! I love it!!!! It is never greasy and leaves my skin smooth. I love it that there are nice, yummy, healthy things in it.  I usually get it from my tanning salon and pay upwards of $20 a bottle, so its great that I was able to find it here for less! It was shipped super quickly!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  The product was new, unopened and was as stated in the description.</li>
            <li> I should have done a better job reading because the &amp;#34;100% pure natural hemp seed oil&amp;#34; was below the &amp;#34;enriched with&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought this was a 100% pure chemical free lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after getting the bottle in the mail, I read the ingredients and there are way to many to list. A lot of them I can&#x27;t even pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with raw shea butter next time. This bottle of lotion does have a  hint of bubblegum smell. It&#x27;s not that bad, but not that great also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter by Nubian Heritage does the same job (if not better) w/o all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is a scam and is NOT real Hempz lotion.  I use it in my hair. Any other product that should control fly aways NEVER works for me.  I read a tip once that said moisturizing lotion can help. THAT never worked for me.  Once, in desperation when my hair was too dry to control, I tried some of my sister&#x27;s HEMPZ Moisturizer on my hands, then ran my hands through my hair. I was amazed. It perfectly smoothed my hair and made it shiny - unlike any hair product I ever tried.  I showed it to my sister, then she started using it in her hair (a little goes a long way). I was so happy to find it on amazon, so I ordered a bottle DESPITE warnings from some people that this wasn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my bottle came, I tried it in my hair.... IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK. I tried the HEMPZ from my sister again. It worked perfectly, smelled clean (my bottle smelled weirdly bubble gummy).  The two lotions do not match in color.  Sorry, but this is one product that you must buy from a salon - too many ripoffs out there.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very moisturizing. My skin felt much softer and moisturized after only a few uses out of the shower. I didn&#x27;t feel oily or sticky after I used it. The lotion itself is very impressive. My only concern is the smell. Although it is not a horrible smell, I&#x27;m definitely not a fan of the scent. It is pretty strong fruity, floral smell (more feminine). If you aren&#x27;t one to wear perfume/cologne or body spray, this could work for you. But if you like wearing perfume, the smells will probably clash. Overall a good body lotion, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, but the pump broke half way through!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff and the smell is not to strong. highly recomment it to all people everywhere. Get yours today you wont be sorry</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love this stuff. It is the best lotion I have ever used. It moisturizers but does not feel greasy at all! It is great if you spray tan at all also. Helps keep your color longer. It smell great and the price on amazon is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the lotions and shipping was QUICK!  : )</li>
            <li> I can not get over the smell! It smells so good the lotion really does what it says. I plan one buying a lit more</li>
            <li> Wife love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Very moisturizing and smells great!</li>
            <li> Used this lotion after tanning, and it is very good stuff. It smells good &amp; has a great feel on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion.  I recommend it to everyone.  Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Its so soft and smells amazing. Leaves my skin feeling smooth for hours on end! I need to buy more I&#x27;m already half way done with the bottle</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! However, I am very unhappy with the packaging. The last two bottles I have ordered arrived with pumps that do not work, consequently I have to remove the entire pump to attain any lotion. It&#x27;s a pain, please get better pumps!</li>
            <li> Not even close to the original.  I don&#x27;t know if this was a knock off or what.  Fragrance was horrible - buyer beware</li>
            <li> My mom used to use this, and I remember exactly how it smelled, which I liked, which is why I ordered this. Whatever was in the bottle is not what my mother used to get for after tanning from the tanning salon. I put it on once and haven&#x27;t used it since. I could still smell it 2 days and a shower later! It&#x27;s just the strongest odor of plastic cherry you can fathom. Don&#x27;t buy this on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update** I just saw a whole display of Hempz products at Marshall&#x27;s on Thursday. I found a bottle with the same label as the one I received through Amazon, unscrewed the cap and smelled it. 100% confirmed my suspicion that I received a fraudulent product! I even took a tiny bit on my pinky and rubbed it into my wrist - the lotion at Marshall&#x27;s smelled and felt exactly as it should. (The real stuff is awesome!!) Gave me the confidence to return my Amazon order, which is a first for me, and will be going out Monday!!</li>
            <li> Over priced garbage. Smells good but everything thing else about this product is garbage.  Drys off of skin immediately and does nothing to retain moisture.</li>
            <li> love this product and it moisturizers so well</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product!!! How dare this company disgrace Hempz,</li>
            <li> I like its smell, like some tropical fruits.seems nice.</li>
            <li> First of all I have spent tons of money on lotions for several reasons.. #1 My daughter has suffered with eczema for years and #2 I live in the desert... Hands down this is the best lotion we have ever used. My whole family loves it so much that I had to order 4 more bottles so they each had their own. Hempz lotion has a nice smell.. I bought the citrus blossom but didn&#x27;t really like that smell as much as the original. But it absorbs into your skin and your skin is so soft! Not just soft because you just applied the lotion but soft throughout the day and I can tell a significant difference in my skin. I have even been using it on my face and my face is usually very sensitive to lotions.... it usually turns red and peels but not with Hempz! I am a fan for life! I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products to see how awesome they are. Definitely worth the purchase and I HIGHLY recommend... An my daughter has had great luck using this with her eczema issues.</li>
            <li> I have used the Hempz Brand in the past for indoor tanning, but this is my first time buying the Hempz Moisturizer and I am loving it. It goes on smoothly, is light in texture and I love the scent. It also makes my skin feel amazing. I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and love it . Soaks in fast and smells great</li>
            <li> As everyone stayed, absorbs quickly, very light yet moisturizing, leaves skin soft, expected a thicker constistancy lotion but overall still great. Good scent for summer (very banana-y). I have eczema and on drier skin days I need to put a thicker cream overtop of drier areas. Overall would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. My skin is always so smooth, hydrated, and smells great. I will definitely order this lotion again.</li>
            <li> Lotion arrived fast.  Great price.  This lotion does not contain Parabens - I found that not all Hemp lotions are paraben free but this one is.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping-Great price-Exactly what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is the best lotion i ever tried. Smells great and keeps my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> i ordered this lotion simply because my tanning salon has it on display as a tester lotion to use. i used it at the salon and liked the smell, and feel . when i found it on amazon i liked the price cut and figured i would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;the product arrived at the time and date it was promised. the bottle itself was inside of a little baggy almost like the style bag that pool toys come in. it has a floral scent to it. and it rubs into your skin really smooth. i rubbed down in it and got into bed. when i woke up i felt like butter. my skin was so soft. i give the lotion a A :) good buy</li>
            <li> left my skin feeling very soft and moursurized, I&#x27;m in the sun alot so I applied morining and night. I could tell a difference in my skin after only 2 days of use.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion and the price is right! I would recommend buying this lotion here than in a specialty store to save money.</li>
            <li> Hempz lotion was the best find I have come accross. thanks much to my sister in law for introducing me to it! I love the strawberry banana scent of the origional lotion but the other scents are great too! I use this lotion as my face lotion everyday and it has a perfect balance for my skin, its moisturizing but not oily. I love it for all my body parts!</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my husband and he loved it. Smell was subtle; not too strong. And the lotion didn&#x27;t feel greasy. He loved it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the original lotion.  It goes on easily, absorbs quickly and keeps my skin soft.  The Arizona sun sucks the moisture right off me but a couple of applications a day on my arms and legs seems to mitigate that.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Enjoying this product. I have very dry skin and it works great.  Smooths on easily, dis appears in to skin, not sticky or greasy and the scent is very nice too.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and it gets dry easily. This is the only lotion that I know will work every time and it smells good (even for a man).</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she absolutely loves it. And I love it on her as well. Great fragrance.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive. It&#x27;s very soothing and hydrating... Great lotion!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the great reviews but I didn&#x27;t think that this moisturizer was that great. Personally, I think Aveeno daily moisturizer does a far better job at keeping my skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a banana crossed with bubble gum but unlike many reviewers I actually like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is the first time I bought this product so not sure if I ended up with a knock off</li>
            <li> Been buying this for years...Bought it for me girl friend..She loves it when I rub down her body after she showers..I like that too!</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion. I have all three of their lotion smells, and alternate them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of all the Hempz lotions. It honestly smells better then any other lotion that I have tried. However, it does not do the best job moisturizing. If you have extremely dry skin, I would recommend trying something a little more suitable. I love the way this smells so much, I use a different lotion for first application and use this after. I just can&#x27;t get over the smell of Hempz!!! You will also find the pricing for this item is great compared to what Salons are charging for this brand. I only order this item through Amazon!</li>
            <li> Smells nothing like the real thing. Has a very artificial, bubblegum-like scent. Do not buy from Amazon! Buy from Ulta or Loxa Beauty.</li>
            <li> I would much rather pay 10$ for this than the 20$ I have paid sometimes at the local salon. And with amazon when I buy a couple things the shipping is completely free. If you dont already know about this product, then its time that you learn. This the absolute BEST moisturizer on the market. This keeps my skin truly moisturized, where other moisturizers, cheap ones, seem to fail in doing that. I think that the natural shea butter thats in this Hempz moisturizer is what makes it work wonders. If you are looking to reduce the lines on your face, as of course, a moisturizer doesn’t do that, then try using it along with [[ASIN:B00I0N24TY nunutrients vitamin c serum]] (apply it before the moisturizer) if you are going for younger looking skin. If not then you can just get the moisturizer and i guarantee your skin will feel silky smooth with just one use!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It absorbs way better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and use it daily.  I used to be a Bath &amp; Body Works user but I use this exclusively now.  I feel it keeps my skin nicer longer.  I have re-ordered it several times.  I even keep one on my desk at work. The fragrance is wonderful.  My daughter who is a nurse introduced me to it.</li>
            <li> bought this so it can sit on the sink in the bathroom without the bulk of the larger bottle also purchased.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw this on a coworker&#x27;s desk, but one try and I had to have it. This lotion has a light banana-ish, melon-y smell and moisturizes without leaving a greasy, slippery feeling. The bottle size is generous and the price was better than I&#x27;d seen at local stores.....one of the many reasons I prefer Amazon.com to other retailers and e-tailers.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t even use perfume.  I love the smell of this lotion and it does not bother my skin or allergies in any way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for ten or fifteen years!  It&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried, and it&#x27;s so affordable on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s low in fragrance and my boyfriend even uses it when he comes over.  I&#x27;ve hooked my roommates on it.  It&#x27;s so hydrating and even takes makeup off.  No mineral oil, no acne, no residue, no burning.  I use this on my face all the time and have very sensitive skin.  (I can&#x27;t even use Dove bodywash!)  This is a great product and I strongly recommend it to men and women alike.  They sell this in high-end tanning salons for twice the price; it&#x27;s a bargain here.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this lotion years ago for my birthday and I&#x27;ve been enjoying it ever since.  It smells great and is an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good cream, very nice smell. I am buying the shampoo now. Hemp products are great</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a coworker almost five years ago and I really do love it.&lt;br /&gt;Its good for ur hands, feet, body and all over.&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m running low, I know where to find it.</li>
            <li> NOT HEMPZ. I&#x27;ve purchased Hempz lotion from a registered retailer in the past this is not it, this is a knock off. It smells like nasty bubble gum. Amazon fully refunded my purchase after I returned it</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I would like to try it unscented next, as I usually don&#x27;t like scents. This one has a banana strawberry scent that is in the ingredients as its scent. It isn&#x27;t overpowering, but definitely a lil fruity :)</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion! Many scents, but Original is my favorite! I use this at least 3 x&#x27;s a day, even as my face moisturizer!  It smells so good &amp; I get compliments from friends, co - workers - at first they asked what I was wearing that smelled so good!  Everyday I  have a student grab my arm just to enjoy the scent - I believe it is soothing! And, the price is less than half of what I paid at several department stores!!!! It&#x27;s a win, win!</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like fruity bubble gum then this may be the right product for you.  If on the other hand you&#x27;re a man like me then no time of the day is the right occasion to smell like mother nature&#x27;s treasures of the land.  I don&#x27;t remember the last time I heard a man getting compliments on how his passion fruit aroma is complementing his strong manhood.  After putting this stuff on after I ran out of lotion I was coerced by an unhappy bed-mate to take a shower to get this stuff off me. There are other lotions out there that will do as good of a job moisturizing without knocking you out with the fragrance. This product is unreasonably highly rated and I&#x27;m starting to think many of the 5-star reviews are coming from hippies that appreciate the body odor masking scent.</li>
            <li> Better than average body lotion. Not making a big difference in extremely cold weather.</li>
            <li> I ordered this when I encountered it while visiting family.  Love the smell and the way it leaves my skin feeling moisturized, not greasy.  I don&#x27;t use it as a body moisturizer, more as a hand cream, but it does a nice job and makes my hands feel (and smell) wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great lotion.  Not greasy and soakes into your skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary about trying this product out.  I am so glad that I did.  It is non-greasy and keeps your skin soft.  I highly recomend this for men or women and it is at a great price compard to the stores around here.</li>
            <li> This has a great smell and a wonderful affect on dry hands. It&#x27;ll be my preferred brand from now on</li>
            <li> This product I am very happy with, nice relaxing smell. Having dry skin, with continued use I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Support hemp products!&lt;br /&gt;Hemp products could save our economy...if only we could grow it and use it in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;Industrial Hemp- we need it now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is priced well, smells great and works!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a smell in the world like that of Hempz original. I could lick it up it smells so good. Glad to have found this for such a reasonable price on amazon</li>
            <li> Regardless if it&#x27;s fake or not, it works wonders. No greasy feeling, it does absorb quickly. My skin actually feels moisturized after using it, and I don&#x27;t have to slather it on, or constantly keep up on it, like some other stuff.</li>
            <li> This moisturizes wonderfully and smells lovely. I will be ordering this again when this bottle runs low!</li>
            <li> When nothing else worked for my daughter&#x27;s dry &amp;#34;allergy&amp;#34; bumps on her arms, this was THE lotion!  Her pediatrician had recommended many lotions that had no effect on her skin, but the Hempz cleared the &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34;  and dried chafed areas completely!  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!!</li>
            <li> Great body lotion. Absorbs into skin very quickly!</li>
            <li> Its a little expensive that why I only use it every night before I go to bed. It smells awesome and feels great on my hands.</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer after tanning . Really keep your skin from drying out. Use as a daily moisturizer , likes the way  it makes my skin feel better.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a fresh, pleasant scent that&#x27;s not too overpowering.  It (the scent) doesn&#x27;t last a super long time, but that&#x27;s OK with me because it means the lotion won&#x27;t conflict with any fragrance I was planning to wear (although I mostly use this on my legs so that&#x27;s not much of an issue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about the consistency I would expect for a lotion -- not too watery but not as thick as a body butter, either (so it&#x27;s great for summer).  It&#x27;s easy to dispense and spread around.  It rubs in without leaving residue.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, even after I&#x27;ve shaved my legs.  And it&#x27;s moisturizing all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see the ingredients if you scroll down the product page.  This has a lot of plant extracts, which is great.  (Some of them, like ascorbic acid, are also antioxidants.)  The fragrance is artificial and this does contain a silicone, if you are watching out for either of those.  I don&#x27;t see any animal-derived ingredients, though, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please check seller feedback carefully before making a purchase.  I understand there have been some issues with product quality and/or authenticity.  If you choose a highly-rated seller you are more likely to get a genuine product!</li>
            <li> I had originally gotten hempz lotion from the person who cuts my hair. I ordered this bottle from Amazon and broke out in a terrible rash every time it was use, never had this problem with the previous bottle from a salon.  I would not recommend it to anyone get it from a legit salon!</li>
            <li> My every expectation was met with this product. I will be a repeat buyer.  There are five people in my home who use this product and each has to have their very own bottle...</li>
            <li> A little too scented for me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the lotion I know and love at a great price.</li>
            <li> Amazon produced my lotion as ordered quickly and well packaged.  Be careful of other online ordering of the HEMP Z product...I had ordered the lotion in July (from Lotion Source) and finally received it in November, Unfortunately, I had to complain the Better Business Bureau to get it...I am sticking with Amazon for all my online orders!....This product makes fabulous Christmas Gifts tooour, for your female and male friends.  Just a great lotion...enjoy!.</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with this lotion! It is sooooooo good for my skin. Doesn&#x27;t make me too oily and doesn&#x27;t dry me up. I use it on my hands daily and even got my mom hooked. :) GREAT PRODUCT and it smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Very awesome, As advertised.</li>
            <li> I used it after shower .I smooth to my body .IS so nice .i love feel it on my body</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever.  It smells good and leaves my skin looking moisturized and nice.</li>
            <li> love, love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Smells real good, great for elbows and knees!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for many friends and relatives. They all loved it!</li>
            <li> i wont buy another type of lotion ever again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Soaks in quick. No grease feeling and pleasant light banana scent. Very original product.</li>
            <li> Love love love this lotion! Great for tanning or anytime. Isn&#x27;t greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really do much for my dry skin and I&#x27;m with the others on the fact that it doesn&#x27;t seem authentic.</li>
            <li> The best lotion, and it smells very very good!</li>
            <li> My favorite of all time and smells absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I received my item today. Very dissatisfied. Item is not as described. The bottle it came in isn&#x27;t even the bottle that&#x27;s advertised, so I feel false advertisement was played here. Not to mention, the smell of it isn&#x27;t even Hempz scent. I&#x27;ve used Hempz lotion now for over 5 years, and nothing else so I know how it should smell and feel. Also, it advertises for a 2.25 oz and I received a 2 oz bottle. Overall, I would not buy this product. I know for future reference I won&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li> Item moisturizes very well</li>
            <li> I buy Hempz all the time and this product is the real thing! I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this product makes my skin feel and smell. The smell is very relaxing and its different from other lotions. I can&#x27;t seem to find a store near me that sells this lotion so I luckily got two of these as gifts for Christmas and hopefully won&#x27;t have to buy any anytime soon. I definitely recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have several bottles of this stuff going at any given time, one in my bathroom, one on my desk at work, one next to my chair in the living room and even one in my computer room.  Not greasy and smells heavenly - not to mention I now have the softest skin since I was a child.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Smells great and feels good on.</li>
            <li> Dude....This smells like sex feels. I ordered it cause winter is wrecking havoc on my hands. Just got it, and sure enough it looks like the picture. Bonus points for that. Better yet, I immediately put it on my hands and had to stop myself from eating them off. It smells like pure awesome and my hands are having a ridiculous time of themselves. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I like it.  I have been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the Hempz lotion! And I bought it for a fraction of what it costs in stores. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Fragrance is delightful (men even like to use it too!)...absorbs quickly and is non-greasy. Everyone in my office uses it and are so happy to have been introduced to HEMPZ</li>
            <li> highly recommended this hemp based lotion its smells like bubblegum and makes my wife skin so soft and adorable. She has been using this product since I met her. The bottle last a very long time if used daily. My wife uses is it all the time so she runs out a little fatter that is how good this product is. I am serious it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer.  I have tried many moisturizers and hand creams and this is the best.  It has a nice, light scent and it is quickly absorbed and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I have seached and searched for the best moisurizer, and have found it.  HEMPZ.. You smell like a banana,.. and the moisturizer is awesome.. YOU WILL ENJOY..</li>
            <li> I am 27 and began using a retinol cream a few months ago. It seemed that no matter what lotion i put over it, my skin was still drying out. I tried some of the Hempz and it has worked wonders! I think for me, its a combination of the retinol cream and the lotion, but my skin looks amazing. It&#x27;s incredibly soft as well. And, not only does it give me that softness on my face, it is amazing nurishment on my hands, arms, feet, etc. If you&#x27;ve never tried this lotion, it is something to live by. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like the herbal smell and good for daily moisture, might more good for combination skin type~ I am a very dry one</li>
            <li> absorbs and moisturises well, but it smells like bubble gum. I can&#x27;t go around smelling like bubble gum.oh well.mint scent would be nice like the body wash.</li>
            <li> Super moisture with yummy smell.</li>
            <li> I had skin cancer surgery on the top of my head three and one half years ago. The dermatologist recommended a specific OTC lotion to use. My personal physician recommended a lotion you get upon request from a pharmacy. It was not on the shelf, but no prescription was required..Weird!  Neither of these products effectively alleviated the symptoms for which they were recommended. I took matters into my own hands and conducted comparisons of the two lotions recommended by doctors and another I had been using for about three months.Each of the three had similar ingredients. During the weeks of testing,I was reading online about treatments for skin in order to promote healing, reduce scarring etc. Organic lotions were mentioned briefly in one article. Lotions made with hemp seed oil were  mentioned. So I searched online for short periods over two days and ran across some companies and labs and the products they made containing hemp seed oil. The ingredients listed in HEMPZ were dissimilar to the synthetic lotions I used before. I ordered the HEMPZ lotion  because it was less expensive and was a hefty 17oz. btl. At first, I thought it smelled too  feminine but soon realized it was a combination of fruit and herbal fragrances, It&#x27;s not too thin or thick, It doesn&#x27;t disappear into the skin like some lotions, but after briefly working  HEMPZ into the skin, there was no oily residue, no particulates, no aftermath at all. The areas most inflamed quickly felt soothed. I used the HEMPZ on my hands, feet, lower legs, upper arms and forearms. After one week the effects of HEMPZ had met or exceeded the products I had used earlier in the area of surgery for three years. I bought HEMPZ Original Body Lotion. Since it came through Amazon, any doubts were smoothed over. I plan on using the HEMPZ for a long time.One thing I liked best.; I do not have to re-apply every hour or two. I started with three times per day applications and now at two per day I am satisfied it is working.</li>
            <li> This lotion once used, will be the last brand of lotion you will want to purchase. Highly moisturizing, but non greasy. And the smell is amazing. This product deserves 6 stars.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, love this hand cream.</li>
            <li> when it comes to products like moisturizer, lotion, and shampoo, everyone seems to have their favorite that works just for them. that probably is as it should be since we all have different skin and hair types. but Hempz body moisturizer is arguably the best lotion ever made. i don&#x27;t say that lightly. it works well for vastly different types of skin and in different climates.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s made with hemp seed oil and extract that helps skin retain moisture and it has essential fatty acids and amino acids that helps encourage the health of your skin. this lotion feels rich and creamy without ever feeling greasy and you only have to use it once during the day.&lt;br /&gt;the scent is clean, simple, and won&#x27;t overpower other scents you may want to put on and it works. really can&#x27;t ask for more in a lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it is not animal-tested. Smells, however, like cheap candy (banana bubblegum?). How I wish they made an unscented version. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The product came broken and smelled really funky. I thought maybe it was normal.  I used it one time and it gave me an allergic reaction.  I had to use Benadryl to calm it down.  Anyway this product cannot be returned because of a hazardous policy.  I&#x27;m an amazon prime member and amazon was gracious enough to rectify the situation.  Five stars for amazon one star for this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Not greasy and very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and since moving to the desert over 10 years ago, it has been a real challenge for me to keep moisturized.  You might call it a ‘double whammy’.  I am very happy with Hempz Body Moisturizer.  I use it after the shower and on a daily basis.  The lotion is of a medium thickness but it absorbs immediately and it is not greasy, and not oily, so I am able to get dressed immediately.  There is a slight fruity scent, and to me it smells a little like strawberry/banana yogurt, which does not bother me especially since sweet scents will give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to sum up my review, Hempz Herbal Moisturizer, is creamy and absorbs immediately, there is no greasy or oily film to stain or ruin clothing, softens and heals scaly dry skin, and protects me from all the drying effects of living in the desert.</li>
            <li> It smells like bubble gum, if you can get past the horrendous smell, I&#x27;d say it is an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Do not buy that unless you want to feel like a banana. its a good quality lotion. I just have a hard time to smell myself after applying this. my cat loves it btw.</li>
            <li> Took a star off for the fragrance. Like most, it is too strong and mixes poorly with anything else you may be wearing (after shave, cologne)..</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Least a very long time. Smells like strawberry. Witch is kinda noticeable but not overwhelming.  I was hoping for maybe something that didn&#x27;t have a sent. Maybe I&#x27;ll try the cucumber flavor next. But this lotion work so I really can&#x27;t gave it a bad review.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and was happy to find it because it was a lot cheaper online than in stores, but the top of the bottle broke at some point before it was delivered.  When I opened the box I noticed the lotion had spilled everywhere.  Thankfully it was in it&#x27;s own plastic packaging so it didn&#x27;t get on the other items in the box, however, whatever broke on the bottle no longer allows the pump to work on the bottle, which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for so many years and nothing beats he smell and quality of this lotion! I have naturally super dry skin and this is the only thing that works for me!!</li>
            <li> THE SMELL IS SO NICE AND IT STAYS ON FOR LIKE 12HOURS</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and smells AMAZING. I am so addicted to this lotion I bought two- one for work and one for home.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!  Loved it so much that I bought the gallon refill jug! I get unbearablely dry, cracked,  painful winter skin and this stuff is a miracle. I can not say enough about it! It&#x27;s amazing and feels wonderful! Soaks right in and smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. Great for in between hand washing or even after the shower. Not overly perfumed. Just a nice clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever tried!&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, leaves my skin soft and moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have dry skin anymore because of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for everybody!</li>
            <li> I used this once and I&#x27;m sure I would have liked this product&#x27;s ability to moisturize....but the perfume fragrance is so overpowering and it lingers for hours!  The smell made this unusable.</li>
            <li> AAAA ++++  I purchased this based only on the outstanding reviews here on Amazon and feel obligated to share my complete satisfaction with this product. It absorbs quickly and smells nice. It is not greasy either. I purchased the Original scent 17oz bottle which has a strawberry banana scent. But don&#x27;t be turned off by that idea. My teenage sons even love it! It&#x27;s not too girly but it&#x27;s not sporty or medicinal smelling either. I think is smells like a fresh shower. We took the 17oz bottle to islands as an after-sun moisturizer and it was such a hit the kids came to our room to see if they could keep it for the week. We ended up sharing it and the entire bottle was gone within a day or two of our return. Given there are five of us, I think it lasted very well for such a popular product. I would highly recommend this product and we are on our second bottle. I think I need extra one for the den and one for the bathroom! This makes hand and feet feel so good too!!!</li>
            <li> Feels greasy. All Ingredients don&#x27;t sound natural, but I&#x27;m no expert.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today. I read a lot of reviews on here about it being fake and the &amp;#34;bubblegum &amp;#34; smell was awful. I went on the original website and they said that the smell was floral and banana. I believe that this is the real product based on what I read on Hempz website. I love the smell and consistency of the lotion. The price was awesome as well.</li>
            <li> See a difference with first application - haven&#x27;t had long enough for any long term critique but if the first weeks are any indication, it&#x27;s  a real winner - smooth, non greasy application - leaves the skin instantly smooth and soft and absorbs as soon as you apply without leaving any smeary residue - highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love, love this stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I found it at a tanning salon I was going to, they stopped saleing it, I of course wasn&#x27;t happy, so I found it online.the company I was buying it from stop saleing it again i wans&#x27;t happy &amp; now I found it again.. I&#x27;m very, very happy !!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Its not greasy, it has a plesant smell &amp; my skin just drinks it up....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you never stop saleing it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but purchased from my tanning salon for $26. I used it for a week or so then realized that my skin looked firmer &amp; more toned. I love this product so you can imagine my excitement when I checked Amazon &amp; found it for half the price! My skin craves this lotion &amp; use it daily. You will love it!</li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs pretty quickly. I do feel a difference, since my skin feels more soft/moisturized. I love the pomegranate scented one. I have the original as well, but feel like they should hold off on the scent, because sometimes we just don&#x27;t need such a fragrant lotion. For it to be original but so fragrant kind of threw me off. Good price compared to stores such as Ulta which is selling it for $23 a pop.</li>
            <li> This was a gift from my sister. My wife using it to moisturize her skin. She says it was really nice.</li>
            <li> Have used this Moisturizer for years and love it! It has a great smell - for men or women. My husband loves it too. Absorbs quickly, not greasy, &amp; makes your skin so soft and keeps the dryness away!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for the past 5 years and I just love it! This is the best moisturizing lotion I have ever used. I tan in a tanning bed and I use this everyday and it helps keep my skin from drying out! Also it does not leave a greasy feeling after using it which I like very much and the smell is awesome!</li>
            <li> Smells yummy and it&#x27;s not greasy. A great value.</li>
            <li> Love it, Need it, Want it, Gots to haves it! Smells so good I could eat it. Moisturizes and delights. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is the best lotion I have used after tanning.&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good,Not too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;.Can&#x27;t wait to try the pomegranite lotion next.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion, due to the use of hemp which is rich but easily absorbed. My only complaint--the perfume is extremely strong (forget wearing your own!) and, of course, requires alcohol which is NOT good for the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this moisturizer.  It is very gentle and I can use it all over my body.  It is very refreshing and the Amazon price made it even better!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t ever let this product go away, it helps to dry up  the sun damage on my arms.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Sometimes my boyfriend even uses this lotion because it smells and works so well. We will continue to buy this lotion whenever it runs out.</li>
            <li> Try it you&#x27;ll get hooked to the smell.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this lotion. It&#x27;s not oily and dries fast and has such a wonderful smell. Its great for my skin and helps hold the little color I have in!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, leaves my skin so soft and has an amazing smell to it!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> this stuff smells so good!!!</li>
            <li> is hard to get absorbed, which is strange for a hemp product, they normally are the best at absorbing quickly. this has not stopped the chapped hands.</li>
            <li> Upon choosing a headline for this review, I was tempted to make references to whorehouses and the like but that wouldn&#x27;t be fair...To the whorehouse...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try this product and had high hopes for it..I don&#x27;t know how i missed the negative review warning of the smell..I mean the stench of this product. It&#x27;s horrendous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizing capability for this product is not known as I almost immediately jumped in the shower to get it off of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely return products that I buy but I am afraid to have this one in my bathroom as the disgusting memories of the stench dim and I have dry skin..who knows what I might do...or worse,,,an innocent house guest might use it and I might have to insist they take a shower to get it off..Or the effect this stuff might have on my clothing..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose boggles..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you don&#x27;t mind cheap smelling cheesy products, then maybe this is for you. For me, I&#x27;d rather suffer with dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so good. It doesn&#x27;t keep my skin moisturized for long, but the smell makes up for that.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife, she loves it.</li>
            <li> So happy I found this lotion for such an amazing price! I got this as a birthday gift a few years back, and when I ran out I wanted to get some more, until I found out it was almost $40! Luckily my boyfriend found it on here for 12! Smells amazing!! Hempz original is the best!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for dry skin. My hands used to peel and crack during the winters here due to the dryness but after using this lotion I have seen a noticeable decrease in the problems. It also has a very unique scent that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Its really good for people who have severe dry skin and/or eczema. I use it on my son who has bad eczema and it clears it up within two days. I also use it everyday on myself morning and night and it keeps my skin soft. Glad I finally found a GREAT lotion that does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion, and the feel of it is amazing too. I recommend it, and would definitely buy it again because of the texture and the smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great product with a great gender neutral scent!  No paraben&#x27;s and no stickiness at all.  You can feel the moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Excellent! I have used a prescription lotion, but this apparently works equally well for my eczema.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this lotion. It is my staple buy for dry skin! Smell is amazing. Not greasy goes on thick but once absorbed leaves you baby soft, I even use it on my face. I&#x27;ve been using for years and will continue to use forever!</li>
            <li> I am purchasing my 3rd bottle today, I love this stuff!  It smells wonderful and works terrific!  I always have people ask me what I am wearing because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Natural scent. Very moisturizing.  It is sold at a very fair price and it&#x27;s description accurately fits the product.</li>
            <li> I work lifting heavy objects and with a lot of mail; often I have to worry about my job making my skin very dry. A friend had a hemp moisturizer for men and I really liked it because I didn&#x27;t smell like a chick or feel oily. I decided to look for it on Amazon because I am lazy like that and  I got this moisturizer by mistake thinking it was the same one,  but I am very happy I did. This moisturizer blows my friends moisturizer out of the water, forget his Wallmart brand. It had to be fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a guy, I was worried about the smell being to girly for my taste, but it isn&#x27;t that bad....more like a strange bannanaish scent...and it is a ladies magnet if their ever was one. That probably helps with my like of this moisturizer. I wont be using any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this product. The moisturizing effect lasts whole day long. This is my second bottle and this has been the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love all the Hempz products but his one is really great. The lotion soaks in very quickly and leaves no residue. It is a great moisturizer and smells great.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried my different lotions. this is a great moisturize for the body and it smell great. will definitely order again</li>
            <li> This lotion is super moisturizing and smells like honey suckle.  I am usually allergic to fragrance but this is very subtle.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is not miracle body lotion.  It won&#x27;t make you look younger, and it won&#x27;t erase age spots or anything like that.  But it really does provide a wonderful, light moisture that lasts quite a long time.  I use it all over.  In the morning after I splash my face with water, I apply a sunscreen.  After that has been absorbed, I apply Hempz to my face and neck, and then I apply my make up.  It keeps my face moisturized all day without feeling greasy.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my feet after I shower and I have noticed a definitely improvement in the tone and texture of the skin on my feet and heels.  It has a light scent that fades fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried numerous moisturizing lotions.  For now, this is the best I&#x27;ve found at providing simple moisturization to the skin.</li>
            <li> I have loved this lotion for it&#x27;s scent and nice feel when applied for several years now.  When I found it on Amazon I was VERY pleasantly surprised at the price!  I have been paying twice what I paid thru this Amazon seller at my hair salon and man do I feel ripped off.  Think of it - the same thing for half the price - what a deal!</li>
            <li> I have tried endless numbers of skin moisturizers and this is the best I have ever found. The price is competitive and a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for atleast 5 years.  I am hooked!  I love the light scent and how it actually hydrates my skin w/o leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li> It is doing a good job of moisturizing but is heavy and does not soak into skin very well. It may be too soon to see if it really help with my dry skin but I think it might eventually.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Nice light but effective cream.</li>
            <li> Best lotion on the market this is my second bottle</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer and my skin loved it.  What I didn&#x27;t like and will keep me from using it again is the smell.  Far too sweet.  It fought with my perfume. The scent stayed with me all day, too.  Too bad.  It was really good for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I thought I would try this lotion out. Other reviewers are correct in stating that it does smell like bubblegum, which didn&#x27;t bother me.  It is thinner lotion, not as creamy &amp; rich as I would have liked.  It reminded me of a cheap store brand lotion that didn&#x27;t provide all day hydration and would find my skin ashy in a few hours after application. I will pass on this in the future and go with another brand.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE WORST. Horrible, disgusting knockoff. Oiley and gross. Smells SO STRONG just like cheap bubblegum. Terrible. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Its not greasy absorbs great has a really nice smell to it.  I bought several different types keep one in bedroom and kitchen.  Gave one as a b-day present.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Not to greasy, just right.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing! and it does its job at keeping my skin moist. I have Psoriasis and after using this for about a week it started to clear up the flakes and cracks. The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was a bit more pricey than the other hemp lotions i have found in stores.</li>
            <li> I love the product itself. The rain I gave it two stars is the packaging. The bottom portion was bubble wrapped but the top was not and the pump was broken on arrival. I was completely out or I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my skin so smooth &amp; it smells delightful! I like it so much, I bought the large size for home and the travel size for traveling!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this.. Good product.  Not greasy. Works well! Will purchase more in the future! easy to the nose!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Smells amazing!! I use this product along with my self tanner. It helps extend the life of my tan! Impostors don&#x27;t compare!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It smells great, and for $10, this beats buying it in any store! Definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Hempz Herbal Moisturizer covers nicely without a heavy film.  Smells so nice!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but the smell is kind of weird and tends to linger.</li>
            <li> We love this moisturizer.  Thank you for carrying it.  Helps our dry skin SO MUCH! (and smells lovely!)</li>
            <li> The absolute BEST ltion on the market. Women love the smell!</li>
            <li> Smells good but didn&#x27;t moisturize well or nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but the smell is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like its smell. It makes me think of some food. A little weird.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite moisturizing lotion for over 10 yrs!</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve performed research before I purchased this from a local salon $23 aahhh! This is great product w/ a delightful scent! Very fragranted!</li>
            <li> Excellent all over body lotion at a good price and delivered as expected in a sturdy carton.</li>
            <li> I love Hempz Herbal Moisturizer! It not only moisturizes my dry skin but, leaves not oily residue and it smells wonderful too!&lt;br /&gt;Plus - What a bargain Amazon has on this product!</li>
            <li> great product and price.</li>
            <li> When winter hit my hand tend to get dried out due to no humidity and washing with soap, so I have been using this product for 3 years and it works great. No Propblem</li>
            <li> Not the original scent. Definitely bubblegum-y. One star added for Amazon taking care of it.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like the smell of this and I am not a person who likes scented hand lotions. It has a pretty strong scent and reminds me of bananas. Other people may be able to  smell it within a 15 - 20 foot radius. It is a medium weight lotion, one press of the dispenser is actually too much for me. I would order this again and recommend it to people who aren&#x27;t bothered by scented hand lotions.</li>
            <li> The scent is overpowering and gives me a headache. I enjoy products made from hemp but this smells cheap and I don&#x27;t recommend it. I wouldn&#x27;t give it a star but i have to give at least one star in order to submit. :( sorry.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, the smell is very light and  I am incredibly sensitive to smells, this is on of few I can tolerate.  Moisturizes all day without feeling greasy.  Hepmz is good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This body lotion is great!  The scent is beautiful and light and the lotion soaks right in.  My skin feels soft - not greasy or sticky at all!  Its my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Contains FRAGRANCE. Smell is very fruity and lingers - Big Time. Using this stuff, even on a small area, makes you smell like sweet-tart candy.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this product based on the ingredients listed on the Amazon website (seller: all american tanning) which excluded any mention of scent or perfume, but it&#x27;s right there on the bottle received.&lt;br /&gt;NOT recommended for those with sensitivity to scents and perfumes. Otherwise it&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Really too bad about the super fruity and clinging smell (AND Retinyl palmitate. According to Consumer Reports, &amp;#34;Retinyl palmitate has been linked to an increased risk of skin cancer in animal studies, and it can convert to retinoids, associated with a risk of birth defects&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list on the bottle I received (matches what&#x27;s shown on *ULTAs* website for the product)... Water/Aqua/Eau, Isopropyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Sorbitan Palmitate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Fragrance/Parfum, henoxyethanol, Polysorbate 40, Carbomer, Aminomethyl Propanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Methylisothiazolinone, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, Benzyl Salicylate, Amyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Eugenol, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Methyl 2-Octynoate, Ascorbic Acid, Retinyl Palmitate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had better luck with a completely different product line - Avalon Organics. Avalon Organics Hand and Body Lotion, Aloe Unscented, soaks in well, is gentle on skin and smells like ALOE (which dissipates and doesn&#x27;t linger all day or infuse your clothes like HEMPZ does). Avalon Organics has a vast array of scented products as well, but they use only essential oils like Rosemary &amp; Lavender, no perfumes.</li>
            <li> Thanks for prompt delivery.  My favorite lotion by far.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just finished my bottle of Hempz that I bought from a reputable salon. I really liked the product, the smell and the quality. I went on Amazon to buy 2 bottles from this seller and when I received it, the lotion had burst everywhere, and to my dismay I noticed that the product inside is NOT a Hempz product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contents are filled with a CHEAP bubblegum scented lotion as many of the reviewers have mentioned. The quality of the lotion is very much like the cheap lotions that the nail salons use and buy in bulk for a cheap price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a shame that this seller is ruining the reputation of HEMPZ since the real scent is actually very nice. I suspect that most of the reviewers here are first time buyers so they are not aware of the high quality of Hempz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very dissapointed and will try to return both the bottles I bought.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion EVER. I&#x27;ve purchased it many times before and the smell is amazing! Hands feel so soft</li>
            <li> Best on the planet!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> works well, but has a kind of weird sweet (almost candy?) scent to it that most guys probably won&#x27;t like. it does seem to absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an excessive amount of grease</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s not a pot smoker, nor a hippie by any means.  She just loves this lotion for her hands... I like it too</li>
            <li> Hempz is the best lotion out there. I&#x27;ve never found a better lotion than this. I know it&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s worth every penny. It smells amazing. Like candy or bubble gum or something. It&#x27;s such a nice fragrance to carry with you all day. This keeps my youngest eczema at bay and is truly a great moisturizer. I always wish I bought two bottles instead of one. I keep a little bottle in my diaper bag too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t thick or greasy at all. It&#x27;s the perfect balance of moisturizing. Your skin smells delightful and is very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer at work for years it&#x27;s great. Non greasy.  In cold Midwest winters we need a long lasting moisturizer. Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I bought it to keep at work. I have a habit of putting moisturizer or lotion on my hands after I wash them and this works well. It actually keeps my hands nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, keeps my skin smooth, and it smells really good. Ladies love the smell :)</li>
            <li> I was worried when I saw some of the negative reviews stating a heavy \\&quot;strawberry\\&quot; scent to this lotion, but I took a chance and am so glad - this is EXACTLY the product and scent I remember from 7 or 8 years ago when I had my last bottle! After going through the tons of bath and body works lotions gifted to me a while back (they&#x27;re okay, but I find them to be very heavy of scent and somewhat greasy), I finally got around to getting the stuff I love most: Hempz. To me it doesn&#x27;t smell at all like strawberries even though it says so on the bottle; I get more of the earthy shea butter with some slight fruitiness to it. The fragrance is slightly heavy and will linger a while - so if you&#x27;re the type of person who doesn&#x27;t like a highly fragrant lotion then this may not be for you, but the quality of the lotion is phenomenal... like others say, it&#x27;s not greasy and it rubs in immediately, leaving your skin feeling soft and hydrated. This is a fairly large bottle for the price, so to me very worth it and I will be back to buy more!</li>
            <li> A good moisturizer at an affordable price. A pleasant scent but not overpowering. I&#x27;ve been buying this for several years.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for an awesome price, it&#x27;s a good size.. Bought it several months ago and there is still plenty of lotion left in th bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and always paid at least $20/bottle in tanning salons. I loved finding it for much cheaper and the same great stuff!</li>
            <li> Also kind of oily. Check the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great Product skin is silky smooth</li>
            <li> Hempz Herbal Moisturizer is by far one of the best moisturizers and smells wonderful!  It is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> leave my skin feeling nice and smooth and smells good, kinda fruity. not the sent i was expecting but its nice.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it makes my skin feel extra smooth. Definitely going to always keep this stocked in the house.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it does everything a lotion is supposed to do and has a fresh, slightly &amp;#34;peachy&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased a trial size of this lotion from my hairdresser. I loved it so much, I had to get a bigger bottle. I love the feel of it on my skin (hands, arms, and legs) It&#x27;s not oily, is absorbed easily, and has a soft, sweet smell. It doesn&#x27;t interfere with the smell of my perfume. I like that. Will definitely buy another bottle when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> I buy this every year, I love the smell and I love how it makes my skin feel after I have been in the sun.  If you are a looking for the best after sun lotion out there you have found it.</li>
            <li> Starting to get into the Hempz line and have NO regrets. Nice fresh scent and leaves your skin feeling great without feeling greasy.  I work in a hospital always wagging my hands or putting alcohol on them.  This helps and price is great.</li>
            <li> I live in CO and so it is very, very dry. This lotion is incredible. I would find a store that carries this brand to smell all of the scents first (then buy on Amazon as this price is incredible!!!) since that seems to be the main complaint on here. I just went to my eye doctor who shares an office, I&#x27;m assuming, with a skin center. They have all the different types of Hempz in a display case. I had just gotten it from Amazon and loved it so I was curious and checked the price. They were selling this particular size and scent for like $20-25. So there ya go! There is a DEFINITELY fragrance even to the regular. So if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, buy it here, but do check out the fragrances first somewhere.  I happen to this it smells great. But they have others to choose from.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I have already bought another bottle. It&#x27;s very hydrating and smells great. It smells like strawberry banana...yum!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it smells great, and makes my skin super soft!!! i would reccomment it to ANYONE! great buy!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!!!  Great lotion</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a pleasant smelling quick absorbing multi-purpose lotion, this is it.  Mild enough for your face, the results will amaze you...  Apply and let it absorb prior to make-up and at night.  You will never need another face lotion...</li>
            <li> This is non sticky , not greasy and makes your skin feel great!  The value was excellent and i will order it again.</li>
            <li> Got what I ordered at a good price, much lower than retail.  this is a good product with no nasty fillers.  Smells good.</li>
