    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Excellent Product, does what it claims - durable protection and strength.</li>
            <li>Infinite shine - great line.</li>
            <li>the OPI Infinite shine top coat, and it worked great!</li>
            <li>the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>And it was amazing...</li>
            <li>When you buy this whole system it works AWESOME!</li>
            <li>Great product quick delivery</li>
            <li>Love the infinite line.</li>
            <li>love the product stays for days</li>
            <li>Love OPI Infinite Shine</li>
            <li>It worked pretty good at first, OPI is superior to that one. .</li>
            <li>Much, much easier than gel and good results.</li>
            <li>Although the top coat wasn&#x27;t as shiny as I&#x27;d like this primer when used with the top coat is a clear knock it out of the park winner.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I only get a week out of gel when others swear they get weeks!  </li>
            <li>So far this new polish is 7 days old and still perfect!</li>
            <li>The polish still looked fresh after a full week.</li>
            <li>Really useful not to use a lamp</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own gels for several years now, wanted to switch, plus you can&#x27;t beat OPI for color choices.  </li>
            <li>but the gel polish just peels right off with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Oh and it is very easy to remove, just like regular polish.</li>
            <li>Love this entire program.  </li>
            <li>If you still want to try this system, make sure you buy it where you can get your money back if you choose.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product applies well</li>
            <li>they dont want to pay for return shipping, which can cost almost as much as the product....</li>
            <li>I just ordered the older looking one (that I had ordered before)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear winner.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors and the shine, hence I purchased the whole set: base coat, nail polish and top coat.</li>
            <li>I desperately wanted to love this!!  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t pay a manicurist for something you can do yourself while watching TV or listening to music.  Using this primer and a silver topcoat provides a long-lasting manicure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear winner.  Although the top coat wasn&#x27;t as shiny as I&#x27;d like this primer when used with the top coat is a clear knock it out of the park winner.  It&#x27;s been 6 days and narry a chip and I am very hard on my nails,  I do house work all the time without gloves (I know..I know).  And I am not even using the Inifinite Shine Polish,  I have so much OPI that I am sandwiching the regular OPI between this base and the Infinite Shine Top - the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product applies well</li>
            <li> Infinite shine - great line. I love the colors and the shine, hence I purchased the whole set: base coat, nail polish and top coat. It lasts for at least 10 days without chipping. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> When you buy this whole system it works AWESOME! I usually have chips and peeling in a day but with this line, it lasts 7 days minimum. I will be keeping my nails done from now on. Way to go OPI!!</li>
            <li> Great product quick delivery</li>
            <li> Great product! Love the infinite line. For those of you who have not tried this line of gel polish please give it a try,you won&#x27;t be sorry. Oh and it is very easy to remove, just like regular polish.</li>
            <li> Great base coat! I tried Seche Vite I think its called. It worked pretty good at first, OPI is superior to that one. . I have always been told  by manicurists that I have oily nails, which  makes it a challenge to find a product that adheres well to my nails.&lt;br /&gt;I tested it out Saturday by cleaning with ammonia and no gloves. No chips or anything!!&lt;br /&gt;Id recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;Cindy</li>
            <li> love the product stays for days</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell any difference for the extra price.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is this stuff or what, but my regular nail polish lasted for almost 7 days.  I am harsh on my nails.  I am very active.  I have a baby.  And my nail polish was on point!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My nail polish usually lasts one day.  So far this new polish is 7 days old and still perfect!</li>
            <li> Love this entire program.  Long lasting...easy removal</li>
            <li> I used this with regular OPI nail color and the OPI Infinite shine top coat, and it worked great! The polish still looked fresh after a full week. Much, much easier than gel and good results. I was not happy with the Infinite Shine color, but the base and top coat made regular OPI color last a week.</li>
            <li> I dont understand what happened....but the gel polish just peels right off with this stuff. I have been using OPI for years and I needed a new base. The packaging was different from the one I had bought previously, but I thought that wouldnt matter. It DOES. I cant go a week without one half nail gel just LIFTING off. And then all the rest follow. It didnt happen until I started using this primer. I just ordered the older looking one (that I had ordered before)...its black with white lettering. And it was amazing...verses this stuff.......I would return it, but I have noticed a pattern with online stores...they dont want to pay for return shipping, which can cost almost as much as the product....</li>
            <li> Really useful not to use a lamp</li>
            <li> Love OPI Infinite Shine</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, does what it claims - durable protection and strength.</li>
            <li> Works well with other Gel effect products</li>
            <li> I desperately wanted to love this!!  I have been doing my own gels for several years now, wanted to switch, plus you can&#x27;t beat OPI for color choices.  I bought the top and base coat and 2 colors.  I am tough on my hands, type all day.  It did not last 2 days!! and the chips were on all over!  To be fair, I only get a week out of gel when others swear they get weeks!  I tried it several times, NG.  I am back to my gel.  If you still want to try this system, make sure you buy it where you can get your money back if you choose.</li>
            <li> Infinite shine is terrible. Starts chipping within one or two days. Not shiny at all! :( don&#x27;t waste your money! }</li>
