            <li>A great toothbrush, good at getting the gums as well as the teeth.</li>

            <li>The handle has a very intelligent ergonomic design that enables superior cleaning, grip, control, fit, reach, and coverage.</li>
            <li>Plus they feel good to hold.</li>

            <li>I even bought Radius brand with replacement heads brush that has a timer once, which was not as good.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the hand.</li>
            <li>It is superior to all the rest.</li>

            <li>I find that I brush for a longer time and with more thoughtfulness, something that just has to be good for dental health.</li>
            <li>I have also purchased this product for friends and family who are elderly and still have their own teeth.</li>
            <li>It cleans his teeth exceptionally well although his fine motor coordination is not that good.</li>
            <li>the are the ones my mother gave me and are super great.</li>
            <li>Best toothbrush for so many reasons but mainly for bleeding gums.</li>
            <li>Very good toothbrush that cleans very well.</li>
            <li>It is a good fit for my needs.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent toothbrush for me because it has a larger hand grip and more bristles.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not convinced that its cleaning better than my sonicare.</li>
            <li>I have use RADIUS toothbrushes for many years.  </li>
            <li>interesting thing though.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>They cost more, but can be used up to 9 months.</li>
            <li>I think when the gum is healthy the teeth will be, too.  </li>
            <li>As for how many brushes I received, I ordered one set of three</li>
            <li>Love these tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands and types of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy them in the drugstore</li>
            <li>These are simply the best toothbrushes on the planet.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I have used for years and love them.</li>
            <li>Again it covers a large surface area, the handle is great and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>This is the best toothbrush, especially if you have arthritis in your hands, because the handle is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>Unusual but good.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use anything else but original radius toothbrushes, I love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>Every use my mouth feels healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>i guess nothing special though i can just get a better grip on my toothbrush</li>
            <li>My first one of this kind I bought 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li>They also make great gifts because they are unique and more durable than the smaller toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>These are literally SO huge</li>
            <li>they are great for brushing your tongue too since its so big</li>
            <li>Purchased these on recommendation from family and have to say that I&#x27;m still not so comfortable using it yet.</li>
            <li>The product is BPA free.</li>
            <li>Two models are available - one for right-handed users and one for left-handed users.</li>
            <li>When I have a routine cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office, the hygienist and dentist always remark that my teeth are very clean, white, and bright.</li>
            <li>Your mouth will feel incredibly clean when you use this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>after reading so many positive reviews i bought this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i think we have full experience for writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are able to get to all surfaces of the teeth much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>For super gum health, remember to trash your toothbrush every 3-4 months, or when the bristles start to splay out a bit.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s more toothbrush in your mouth than you&#x27;re used to, and it may feel funny at first.</li>
            <li>I like this brush so much better than normal head brushes</li>
            <li>Cool, right?</li>
            <li>Thanks RADIUS!!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>All in fun colors.</li>
            <li>Who knew one {1} toothbrush would cost $16.84 divided by three should be the right price.</li>
            <li>Love it, gives a nice massage to your gums every time you use it, I bought a small one for my grandson ( that came for a short visit, he is 2 1/2 years old) and loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much cleaner your mouth feels after brushing compared to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush cleans and massages much better than others due in part to the extremely high bristle density and relatively large, but very comfortable head.</li>
            <li>Seems bulky at first sight, but after using it for years, I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without my Radius.</li>
            <li>I kept the kid size for me (much better reach) and bought my son a regular kid toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>The brush portion is big, so you brush a lot more teeth with every stroke.</li>
            <li>If this is your first time with Radius, use it for 3 months before you decide whether you like it or not.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this toothbrush, and the way it cleans teeth and gums, both gently at the same time.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so much extra clean now!</li>
            <li>left handed are available as well as for the right hand.</li>
            <li>Very Good quality,when I used ordinary toothbrush I usually could not help to use more force to brush the tooth,because the brush damage so the toothbrush always could be used within 1 month.</li>
            <li>Just be gentle at first</li>
            <li>I love these and have used for a long time.</li>
            <li>Super soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip and brush my gums at the same time.  </li>
            <li>but my gums are certainly getting some additional brushing.</li>
            <li>I also like the large brush.</li>
            <li>They are of very good quality and last a long, long time.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses and loves these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>My dentist alwasy exclaims how great my teeth are, this is the secret.</li>
            <li>after one month of use both my and my wife&#x27;s brushes were absolutely unusable.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the teeth, cleans the gums.</li>
            <li>I feel like they get my teeth super clean with less brushing.</li>
            <li>This is the only tooth brush we use in our family now.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to go back to the regular tooth brush, but just didn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li>The softness of the bristles are very effective in getting in hard to reach places despite the big head.  </li>
            <li>The adult size is just too large.</li>
            <li>Getting my teeth cleaner, and out of the bathroom faster, wow, can&#x27;t beat them!!</li>
            <li>I also use another old Radius toothbrush to clean out, with water, my cat food cans every day, it has multiple uses.</li>
            <li>I got a travel case for it because I no longer wish to use my normal head travel brush.  </li>
            <li>The larger grip allows me to hold the brush in my hand applying pressure with my right thumb also while brushing.</li>
            <li>Cant live without them.</li>
            <li>found this brushes when searching for something new for my teeth.</li>
            <li>Not only that, after using my regular toothbrush my gums puffed up and bled because the radius wasn&#x27;t getting them clean.</li>
            <li>I decided to try my old regular tooth brush, and sure enough 2 days later the stains were gone.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and the bristles last longer than a normal bristles.  </li>
            <li>The large number of bristles on the brush covers the entire tooth and surrounding gum area with each passing motion and bristle stroke while brushing with toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I am old...</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shred your gums.</li>
            <li>They are great for anyone having trouble brushing their teeth unless the inside of their mouth is very small.</li>
            <li>They truly and thoroughly clean the mouth and gums without much harsh abrasion.</li>
            <li>But after 1 month RADIUS seems like a new one,and because of it&#x27;s big the force on the tooth when I use it become small,so it well protect the surface of the tooth.</li>
            <li>They last a lot longer than regular toothbrushes and massage your gums really well.  </li>
            <li>Takes some getting used to at first due to the size</li>
            <li>I use no other.</li>
            <li>If you use one of these you probably will decide to use no other toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is being able to pick the colors I want in the 3-pack since I&#x27;m not super keen on pink.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t clean the back molars very well no matter how hard you try to brush back there.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this does anything special for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>These brushes have been proven over years of my use to be more durable than regular size toothbrushes which are at least 50% smaller than the Radius Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>On a recent business trip, I forgot my Radius and purchased a regular adult toothbrush.</li>
            <li>For a single guy, when I get to them, that pink and the lilac will certainly make a statement in my white bathroom.</li>

            <li> The brush portion is big, so you brush a lot more teeth with every stroke.</li>
            <li> If this is your first time with Radius, use it for 3 months before you decide whether you like it or not.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush, and the way it cleans teeth and gums, both gently at the same time.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so much extra clean now!</li>
            <li> left handed are available as well as for the right hand.</li>
            <li> Very Good quality,when I used ordinary toothbrush I usually could not help to use more force to brush the tooth,because the brush damage so the toothbrush always could be used within 1 month.</li>
            <li> Just be gentle at first</li>
            <li> I love these and have used for a long time.</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Easy to grip and brush my gums at the same time.  </li>
            <li> but my gums are certainly getting some additional brushing.</li>
            <li> I also like the large brush.</li>
            <li> They are of very good quality and last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses and loves these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> My dentist alwasy exclaims how great my teeth are, this is the secret.</li>
            <li> after one month of use both my and my wife&#x27;s brushes were absolutely unusable.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the teeth, cleans the gums.</li>
            <li> I feel like they get my teeth super clean with less brushing.</li>
            <li> This is the only tooth brush we use in our family now.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to go back to the regular tooth brush, but just didn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> The softness of the bristles are very effective in getting in hard to reach places despite the big head.  </li>
            <li> The adult size is just too large.</li>
            <li> Getting my teeth cleaner, and out of the bathroom faster, wow, can&#x27;t beat them!!</li>
            <li> I also use another old Radius toothbrush to clean out, with water, my cat food cans every day, it has multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I got a travel case for it because I no longer wish to use my normal head travel brush.  </li>
            <li> The larger grip allows me to hold the brush in my hand applying pressure with my right thumb also while brushing.</li>
            <li> Cant live without them.</li>
            <li> found this brushes when searching for something new for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Not only that, after using my regular toothbrush my gums puffed up and bled because the radius wasn&#x27;t getting them clean.</li>
            <li> I decided to try my old regular tooth brush, and sure enough 2 days later the stains were gone.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and the bristles last longer than a normal bristles.  </li>
            <li> The large number of bristles on the brush covers the entire tooth and surrounding gum area with each passing motion and bristle stroke while brushing with toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I am old...</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shred your gums.</li>
            <li> They are great for anyone having trouble brushing their teeth unless the inside of their mouth is very small.</li>
            <li> They truly and thoroughly clean the mouth and gums without much harsh abrasion.</li>
            <li> But after 1 month RADIUS seems like a new one,and because of it&#x27;s big the force on the tooth when I use it become small,so it well protect the surface of the tooth.</li>
            <li> They last a lot longer than regular toothbrushes and massage your gums really well.  </li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to at first due to the size</li>
            <li> I use no other.</li>
            <li> If you use one of these you probably will decide to use no other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is being able to pick the colors I want in the 3-pack since I&#x27;m not super keen on pink.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t clean the back molars very well no matter how hard you try to brush back there.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this does anything special for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> These brushes have been proven over years of my use to be more durable than regular size toothbrushes which are at least 50% smaller than the Radius Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> On a recent business trip, I forgot my Radius and purchased a regular adult toothbrush.</li>
            <li> For a single guy, when I get to them, that pink and the lilac will certainly make a statement in my white bathroom.</li>
            <li> I had no infections or reason to have sensitive gums other than using the Radius toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tiny air hole keeps mildew away (you should never store your toothbrush where air can&#x27;t dry it after each use).  </li>
            <li> See surprised, larger than ordinary toothbrushes</li>
            <li> but I have been using them for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and as some of the other reviewers have said - this brush really fills my mouth up, but I like how it cleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush terrible price and despite the photo you will only get one.</li>
            <li> I alternate this with conventional brush and an electric.</li>
            <li> We first bought them a few years back and are addicted.</li>
            <li> to clean teeth you had to hold this strange brush at different angles (like other brushes) and this VERY UNCOMFORTABLE with this</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time compared to other toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The handle is a little too short for me (and my hands are not particularly large), so I get cramps in my hand by the end of brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The rating should be a minus four {4}</li>
            <li> Plus--this is a Green US company, too, which is an added extra.</li>
            <li> but not very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wide head insures you will not miss an any teeth when you brush.  </li>
            <li> I flossed in other areas and they all bled.</li>
            <li> The other days I use a sonic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Would not think of using any other toothbrush,</li>
            <li> i will not use any other brush</li>
            <li> Also, the Radius lasts longer than a regular toothbrush, probably because you don&#x27;t need to brush hard.</li>
            <li> I have toothbrushes to last at least a year</li>
            <li> Dentists tell you that you need to replace your brush every few months, and that you need small brushes for the molars in the back.  </li>
            <li> I managed to get a green, a pink and a lilac.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for years and hands down</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use any other toothbrush now, these are so pro!</li>
            <li> I think, however, that if you have a small mouth, you might find it a little difficult to adapt to, as the head of the brush is far larger than conventional brushes.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to, but my teeth have never felt cleaner after brushing.</li>
            <li> It arrived faster than expected!!!</li>
            <li> I use it to do the corners of my shower and any hard to reach places that need brushing.  </li>
            <li> so your arms will tired in a seconds.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t see anything wrong with my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you are not allowed to choose colors.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush for me because it has a larger hand grip and more bristles. The larger grip allows me to hold the brush in my hand applying pressure with my right thumb also while brushing. The large number of bristles on the brush covers the entire tooth and surrounding gum area with each passing motion and bristle stroke while brushing with toothpaste. These brushes have been proven over years of my use to be more durable than regular size toothbrushes which are at least 50% smaller than the Radius Toothbrush. I find that the Radius toothbrush will last about 6 months for me with my use of 3 toothbrush uses per day 7 days per week. Years ago I bought mine at Walmart. But nowadays Amazon.com is the only place that I can find them. I always keep one or two in reserve. They also make great gifts because they are unique and more durable than the smaller toothbrushes. I also floss and rinse with a mouth rinse after every brushing.</li>
            <li> I used these with my kids years ago. They are great for anyone having trouble brushing their teeth unless the inside of their mouth is very small.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use anything else but original radius toothbrushes, I love &#x27;em. Once you learn how to properly use one, you wont want anything else</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush for so many reasons but mainly for bleeding gums. I will never use another toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Only toothbrush my husband will use. We found these about 10 years ago and have been a continuous customer. Takes some getting used to at first due to the size but then you will want nothing to do with a regular size toothbrush ever again! My husbands dentist approves of the toothbrush too, which is a plus. And my husbands dentist has remarked how much better his dental health has been!</li>
            <li> One of the best toothbrushes on the market.</li>
            <li> You need a big mouth to use these and some of my smaller mouthed friends say they&#x27;re too big, but well...I have a big mouth I guess. I absolutely love these toothbrushes. I feel like they get my teeth super clean with less brushing. Plus they feel good to hold. The only thing I would change is being able to pick the colors I want in the 3-pack since I&#x27;m not super keen on pink.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush terrible price and despite the photo you will only get one. At this price is should be 2 minimum or 3 for a deal, not 1.</li>
            <li> The handle is a little too short for me (and my hands are not particularly large), so I get cramps in my hand by the end of brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m not convinced that its cleaning better than my sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have use RADIUS toothbrushes for many years.  I find that they do a great job of cleaning your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are great! they are great for brushing your tongue too since its so big</li>
            <li> great brush ,. takes getting use to</li>
            <li> These are literally SO huge but they&#x27;re good i guess nothing special though i can just get a better grip on my toothbrush ehh</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles. Feels great on gums</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Radius for years. On a recent business trip, I forgot my Radius and purchased a regular adult toothbrush. I felt as if I were using a child&#x27;s toothbrush. Also, the Radius lasts longer than a regular toothbrush, probably because you don&#x27;t need to brush hard. Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Seems bulky at first sight, but after using it for years, I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without my Radius.</li>
            <li> I could kick myself for not reading that review from 6-27-12.  I don&#x27;t think I will use the toothbrush I will put it in a frame, hang on bathroom wall titled&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Taken by Amazon &#x27;  Who knew one {1} toothbrush would cost $16.84 divided by three should be the right price. Shame on you!!  The rating should be a minus four {4}</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush ever made!! I have been using these for years. Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> After using the Radius toothbrush I can&#x27;t go back to a regular toothbrush It feels like a total cleansing of the mouth</li>
            <li> I love these Radius toothbrush/mouthbrush! They are awesome. They truly and thoroughly clean the mouth and gums without much harsh abrasion. I just purchased the travel cases for the toothbrushes as well and find them to be a perfect pairing.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and as some of the other reviewers have said - this brush really fills my mouth up, but I like how it cleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One interesting thing though. After I had used it for about three weeks I had reason to floss and my gums bled. I flossed in other areas and they all bled. I had no infections or reason to have sensitive gums other than using the Radius toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use the brush, but only a couple of times a week. The other days I use a sonic electric toothbrush. This system seems to work as I don&#x27;t have any bleeding gums. Have any of you had this experience?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use any other toothbrush now, these are so pro! Getting my teeth cleaner, and out of the bathroom faster, wow, can&#x27;t beat them!!</li>
            <li> I have been using these toothbrushes since the 80&#x27;s.  They are the absolute best!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush, and the way it cleans teeth and gums, both gently at the same time. I think, however, that if you have a small mouth, you might find it a little difficult to adapt to, as the head of the brush is far larger than conventional brushes. I find that I brush for a longer time and with more thoughtfulness, something that just has to be good for dental health. Also, watch the handedness of the brush--left handed are available as well as for the right hand. Plus--this is a Green US company, too, which is an added extra.</li>
            <li> best toothbrush in the world. gets your gums and your teeth. never use anything but</li>
            <li> Purchased these on recommendation from family and have to say that I&#x27;m still not so comfortable using it yet. I can&#x27;t say I feel my teeth any cleaner than with a $2.00 brush but my gums are certainly getting some additional brushing. Not sure if this does anything special for oral hygiene. Delivered on time and described correctly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE**** Didn&#x27;t like them. The adult size is just too large. Threw them out. They don&#x27;t clean the back molars very well no matter how hard you try to brush back there. I kept the kid size for me (much better reach) and bought my son a regular kid toothbrush. I have toothbrushes to last at least a year but I will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> This is the only tooth brush we use in our family now.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to go back to the regular tooth brush, but just didn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for years and hands down they are the best ever. Would not think of using any other toothbrush,</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  Only brush I have used for 10 years.  Gums are healthier because you brush the gums along with the teeth.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes! It arrived faster than expected!!! Excellent</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are able to get to all surfaces of the teeth much better than a regular toothbrush. They cost more, but can be used up to 9 months. I have been using these for a couple years now and love them!</li>
            <li> Unusual but good.  Easy to grip and brush my gums at the same time.  My first one of this kind I bought 15 years ago.  I know that sounds gross, that I still have it.  Dentists tell you that you need to replace your brush every few months, and that you need small brushes for the molars in the back.  Not so.  I floss daily and use this brush, I didn&#x27;t even go see a dentist for 5 yrs and they didn&#x27;t see anything wrong with my teeth.  I think when the gum is healthy the teeth will be, too.  I was vegetarian so maybe that helped, too.  I dip my brush in H3O once in awhile.  It has made it softer after all these years.  I even bought Radius brand with replacement heads brush that has a timer once, which was not as good. I came back to this one.  I happened on this package deal and order it for my entire family and as backups.</li>
            <li> Cant live without them.</li>
            <li> i will not use any other brush</li>
            <li> I like the soft, wide brush. Does a very good job of covering/brushing teeth and gums. Feels good on the hand. Unfortunately, you are not allowed to choose colors. They do it for you. I managed to get a green, a pink and a lilac. For a single guy, when I get to them, that pink and the lilac will certainly make a statement in my white bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush, especially if you have arthritis in your hands, because the handle is easy to hold.  I also like the large brush.</li>
            <li> A great toothbrush, good at getting the gums as well as the teeth.</li>
            <li> Your mouth will feel incredibly clean when you use this toothbrush.  Just be gentle at first otherwise you will irritate your gums a bit.  As for how many brushes I received, I ordered one set of three and I received one set of three.  Perfectly packaged, arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses and loves these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Very Good quality,when I used ordinary toothbrush I usually could not help to use more force to brush the tooth,because the brush damage so the toothbrush always could be used within 1 month.But after 1 month RADIUS seems like a new one,and because of it&#x27;s big the force on the tooth when I use it become small,so it well protect the surface of the tooth.Thanks RADIUS!!</li>
            <li> These are the best manual toothbrushes.  They last a lot longer than regular toothbrushes and massage your gums really well.  My dentist alwasy exclaims how great my teeth are, this is the secret.</li>
            <li> I alternate this with conventional brush and an electric. The Radius has amazing control and comfort in the hand. It&#x27;s big. My daughter calls it a dog brush... but I have been using them for a long long time. I am old... my teeth the are the ones my mother gave me and are super great. -fuss budget Bob</li>
            <li> Love these tooth brushes. Every use my mouth feels healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> Very good toothbrush that cleans very well.</li>
            <li> found this brushes when searching for something new for my teeth. after reading so many positive reviews i bought this.&lt;br /&gt;i and my wife used this brushes for one month and i think we have full experience for writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. size. this brush is VERY big. it is like brushing teeth with shoe polisher brush. but i have a big head and this is not a problem. but not very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. ergonomics is SO BAD so your arms will tired in a seconds. to clean teeth you had to hold this strange brush at different angles (like other brushes) and this VERY UNCOMFORTABLE with this handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. durability. do not know how this can lasts for six months. after one month of use both my and my wife&#x27;s brushes were absolutely unusable. bristles were bended like on the cheapest brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;needles to say that i WILL NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these things. Gentle on the teeth, cleans the gums. Our daughter&#x27;s dentist recommended these.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands and types of toothbrushes. I have found this one to be the best. It is superior to all the rest. This toothbrush is not junk from China. This is a high-quality engineered toothbrush Made in the USA in Pennsylvania. This toothbrush cleans and massages much better than others due in part to the extremely high bristle density and relatively large, but very comfortable head. It lasts a very long time compared to other toothbrushes. The handle has a very intelligent ergonomic design that enables superior cleaning, grip, control, fit, reach, and coverage. The product is BPA free. Two models are available - one for right-handed users and one for left-handed users. I have been using this brand for several years. I use no other. When I have a routine cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office, the hygienist and dentist always remark that my teeth are very clean, white, and bright. If you use one of these you probably will decide to use no other toothbrush. If I were a NASA astronaut preparing for residency on the International Space Station for 6 months, I would want 3 or 4 of these toothbrushes in my personal kit. For details and information about this toothbrush, check out the manufacturer&#x27;s excellent web site with videos. RadiusToothBrush dot com P.S. I have no affiliation with Radius except as a consumer.</li>
            <li> Great product, heard to find in stores. Very happy with product</li>
            <li> I have used a Radius toothbrush for 20 years - they are spectacular!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great on teeth and gums - superior quality!</li>
            <li> I used this for two months and started noticing brown stains developing on my teeth. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why. I decided to try my old regular tooth brush, and sure enough 2 days later the stains were gone. Not only that, after using my regular toothbrush my gums puffed up and bled because the radius wasn&#x27;t getting them clean.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It is a good fit for my needs. I like the size and the colors. Works well for me and my family</li>
            <li> Excellent for elderly folks with dementia or Alz. who have lost some of their dexterity.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this item for months, love this product! My mouth feels so much extra clean now!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Radius for about 15 years now.  I used to be able to buy them in the drugstore but now thank goodness for Amazon, I can still get them.</li>
            <li> I have a handicapped son. This is without a doubt the easiest toothbrush for him to use by himself. It cleans his teeth exceptionally well although his fine motor coordination is not that good. I have also purchased this product for friends and family who are elderly and still have their own teeth. Again it covers a large surface area, the handle is great and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> See surprised, larger than ordinary toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Very big, fits in my mouth.  That&#x27;s what she said.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this tooth brush for quite some time,every thing was perfect from price to delivery  and the tooth brush performs excellently</li>
            <li> My family loves RADIUS toothbrushes. We first bought them a few years back and are addicted. It&#x27;s amazing how much cleaner your mouth feels after brushing compared to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> been using them for years. great product.</li>
            <li> These are simply the best toothbrushes on the planet. Maybe in the universe. The brush portion is big, so you brush a lot more teeth with every stroke. Handle is ergonomically shaped to your hand ... you can choose left-handed or right-handed. Radius even makes kid toothbrushes. All in fun colors. For super gum health, remember to trash your toothbrush every 3-4 months, or when the bristles start to splay out a bit. If you&#x27;re worried about the landfill, Radius even has one where you just replace the bristle portion, and re-use the handle. Cool, right? Tip: get one of their toothbrush cases - they fit the Radius perfectly, are great for travel OR at-home storage. Tiny air hole keeps mildew away (you should never store your toothbrush where air can&#x27;t dry it after each use).  If this is your first time with Radius, use it for 3 months before you decide whether you like it or not. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s more toothbrush in your mouth than you&#x27;re used to, and it may feel funny at first. But after 3 months, you&#x27;ll never go back to those standard brush-one-tooth-at-a-time toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes.  It took a little getting used to, but my teeth have never felt cleaner after brushing.</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes I have ever used. My dentist is amazed at how good my teeth and gums look! I also use the toothbrushes for my dogs. The vet is equally impressed! They are of very good quality and last a long, long time. The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shred your gums. Excellent toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I love these and have used for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it, gives a nice massage to your gums every time you use it, I bought a small one for my grandson ( that came for a short visit, he is 2 1/2 years old) and loved it.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush going.  It is very sturdy and the bristles last longer than a normal bristles.  The softness of the bristles are very effective in getting in hard to reach places despite the big head.  The wide head insures you will not miss an any teeth when you brush.  I like this brush so much better than normal head brushes I got a travel case for it because I no longer wish to use my normal head travel brush.  One added bonus is after extended use in your mouth and you retire your brush for good, you can use this brush for cleaning.  I use it to do the corners of my shower and any hard to reach places that need brushing.  I also use another old Radius toothbrush to clean out, with water, my cat food cans every day, it has multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I have used for years and love them. Also gave one to grandson who has braces, and he loves the way it cleans his teeth.</li>
