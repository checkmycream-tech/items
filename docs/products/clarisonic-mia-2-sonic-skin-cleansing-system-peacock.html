            <li>, it&#x27;s like magic...</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I use my Mia every night and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my favorite beauty product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it pulses</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I have it.  </li>
            <li>and it feels even better now that I have the Mia 2.</li>
            <li>have used it 2x / day for the last week and my skin is the best it has ever been !!</li>
            <li>I was able to rub the mark off</li>
            <li>Love the color too&amp;#62; Clairisonic face wash is fantastic.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it !!!!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel super smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this, it&#x27;s really helping with my sever acne.</li>
            <li>My face is so sensitive that I have a huge problem keeping it clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>After one use, my skin was noticeably cleaner and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly, and we had it in no time.  </li>
            <li>I have considered and put off purchase for almost two years and finally decided to make the purchase at Christmas time, and, I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I charged full 24 hours first time according to the instruction.</li>
            <li>20 seconds for chin area, and then 10 seconds on each check, so that you don&#x27;t over do it and her face has cleared up right away</li>
            <li>I am so excited to try my new product!</li>
            <li>My first time use for one minute</li>
            <li>To be completely frank, I bought the Clarisonic Mia because it&#x27;s fast and easy.</li>
            <li>It is not only quick, it leaves my skin feeling ultra smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels so good especially when you are using a facial cleanser that is exfoliating.</li>
            <li>The Mia2 helps gently buff away dullness to keep my skin vibrant and fresh.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; action really gets my skin clean</li>
            <li>I feel like the Mia blasts away the dry skin and allows my nightly moisturizer to do its job even better than before.</li>
            <li>I had a huge pimple on my cheek and with this one use I already feel like it has gotten smaller.</li>
            <li>In hindsight I wish I&#x27;d purchased the peony (or something lighter and girlier), but it wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back when it functions exactly as promised</li>
            <li>I have new skin!  </li>
            <li>this one in particular i purchased as a gift since i wanted to share the wealth</li>
            <li>I have very rough skin, and this product is far too gentle to perform the type of massage that I need in order to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I actually like this model better than my last (Plus) because it is smaller and easier to maneuver around your face.  </li>
            <li>, the instructions say that you have to charge the Clarisonic for 24 hours prior to first use.</li>
            <li>and it was exactly as described... came with user manual and all the proper components.</li>
            <li>My skin is pale and sensitive (standard peaches and cream), and it&#x27;s always been pretty clear save occasional mild breakouts in my T-zone.</li>
            <li>it only makes me question if this product was truly new when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>it left my skin feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li>A pretty color, but less \\&quot;fun\\&quot; than I&#x27;d anticipated.</li>
            <li>Two weeks of non use really shows what this little guy does for your skin.  </li>

            <li> In person it&#x27;s the teal equivalent of hunter green - very dark.</li>
            <li> is a lil harsh for my skin type but does the job.</li>
            <li> I thought even I could find 60 seconds to wash my face in the evening and slip down the rabbit hole of anti-aging before it was too late.</li>
            <li> In the winter months, we don&#x27;t realize how dry our skin gets from the heat indoors and the cold wind outdoors.</li>
            <li> When I called clarisonic for the 2 year warranty I was advised that the product is NOT made by clarisonic and is a fake, no warranty is valid.</li>
            <li> this is a fake and the warranty would not be valid!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think my skin is still adjusting to the Clarisonic. It feels really refreshing to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> My first time use for one minute it left my skin feeling baby soft. I had a huge pimple on my cheek and with this one use I already feel like it has gotten smaller. LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li> I had one that died after 2 years and had to get another.  Two weeks of non use really shows what this little guy does for your skin.  I actually like this model better than my last (Plus) because it is smaller and easier to maneuver around your face.  I found I didn&#x27;t change the speed anyway, so I didn&#x27;t need the Plus.</li>
            <li> Bought the device, charged it as you&#x27;re supposed to and it never worked. I&#x27;ve bought another one since from my doctor&#x27;s office and it is the best product in the world. If you want to take a chance you can buy one from here, it might work, mine just didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it truly was a clarisonic. However after only 2.5 months the unit would not charge. When I called clarisonic for the 2 year warranty I was advised that the product is NOT made by clarisonic and is a fake, no warranty is valid. NO where in this description does it state this is a fake and the warranty would not be valid! I&#x27;m out 140 bucks, scam!</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as advertised. My skin is pale and sensitive (standard peaches and cream), and it&#x27;s always been pretty clear save occasional mild breakouts in my T-zone. The Mia2 helps gently buff away dullness to keep my skin vibrant and fresh. It&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside (to me) is the peacock color. In the photo it&#x27;s lighter and brighter than in person. In person it&#x27;s the teal equivalent of hunter green - very dark. A pretty color, but less \\&quot;fun\\&quot; than I&#x27;d anticipated. In hindsight I wish I&#x27;d purchased the peony (or something lighter and girlier), but it wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back when it functions exactly as promised and it lives in my shower.</li>
            <li> I have bought your product skin cleansing a month ago. I charged full 24 hours first time according to the instruction. But I found the electricity was empty after that day and I cannot charge anymore. I send you this mail for advice and wait for your reply.</li>
            <li> I have very rough skin, and this product is far too gentle to perform the type of massage that I need in order to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> if you dont own one already buy one! the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; action really gets my skin clean and i have noticed improvement in my oily/combo skin within the short time i have had it! this one in particular i purchased as a gift since i wanted to share the wealth</li>
            <li> I got the Mia 2 as a Christmas gift and could not be more thrilled with it. It more than exceeded my expectations and even my hopes. After one use, my skin was noticeably cleaner and more vibrant. It takes off makeup with ease (nothing shows up with my astringent on a cotton ball). I don&#x27;t bother to use my exfoliant (I will likely mark that off my next shopping list). It is excellent! My only complaint is that you cannot change the timer settings or turn it off. After 60 seconds, it will auto-off. Ahh well.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love the color... love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  She&#x27;d mentioned it a few times, and finally I buckled.  It shipped quickly, and we had it in no time.  My wife is so stoked to have, and use this daily...</li>
            <li> I have considered and put off purchase for almost two years and finally decided to make the purchase at Christmas time, and, I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I also purchased extra brush heads and share the Clarisonic Mia 2 with my tween grandaughter.  She was having some breaking out on her forehead and she used the Mia 2 that has a timer that lets you know to only use 20 seconds for forehead, 20 seconds for chin area, and then 10 seconds on each check, so that you don&#x27;t over do it and her face has cleared up right away and she&#x27;s learning how to take proper care of her skin.  LOVE IT!!!!  I am 58 and I love it for how it makes my skin feel, and then follow with a good moisturizer and Walla!, it&#x27;s like magic...nice healthy skin is the result.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering and time is ticking...don&#x27;t hesitate any longer, go ahead and purchase...you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes my skin feel super smooth. All sonicare products are amazing. Love the color too&amp;#62; Clairisonic face wash is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I use my Mia every night and I love it.  All of my makeup is removed and I can tell my face is cleaner. My skin is the softest it has ever been.  I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy one.  I have owned this for about 5 months and it&#x27;s my favorite beauty product. I love the way it pulses so you know when to move to a different part of your face and I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the travel case yet, but I&#x27;m so glad I have it.  I can&#x27;t imagine travelling without it.</li>
            <li> I own this.  It is the most wonderful cleansing system I have ever found!  My face is so sensitive that I have a huge problem keeping it clean and healthy.  After I got my Mia2 I have new skin!  You will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> To be completely frank, I bought the Clarisonic Mia because it&#x27;s fast and easy. I thought even I could find 60 seconds to wash my face in the evening and slip down the rabbit hole of anti-aging before it was too late. This product was even better than I could have imagined! It is not only quick, it leaves my skin feeling ultra smooth. In the winter months, we don&#x27;t realize how dry our skin gets from the heat indoors and the cold wind outdoors. I feel like the Mia blasts away the dry skin and allows my nightly moisturizer to do its job even better than before. Take it from me, this product makes a great gift for yourself or someone else in your life.</li>
            <li> This item just stopped working after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> It feels so good especially when you are using a facial cleanser that is exfoliating. It works as promised. I love it!</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing.  I haven&#x27;t used the face wash it came with but I&#x27;m using my regular wash that i&#x27;ve been using for years now and it feels even better now that I have the Mia 2.</li>
            <li> I waited quite some time to purchase the Clarisonic after a good friend recommended the product, and I wish I had bought it sooner. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this, it&#x27;s really helping with my sever acne. The brush head that it comes with is a lil harsh for my skin type but does the job.</li>
            <li> I decided to bite the bullet and invest in a Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t find the peacock edition anywhere else so purchased it from the Cosmetic Warehouse here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This product has been THE PERFECT addition to my skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it 2x / day for the last week and my skin is the best it has ever been !!&lt;br /&gt;VERY HAPPY with this purchase !!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because when I opened the product up there was a white smudge mark on the actual Mia2 handle. I was able to rub the mark off but it just makes me question whether or not this product was pre-owned or used as a tester somewhere before being repackaged and made to look like it was brand new?&lt;br /&gt;Also, the instructions say that you have to charge the Clarisonic for 24 hours prior to first use. I only had to charge mine overnight (~12 hours) before it was fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;So it only makes me question if this product was truly new when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that little tidbit about how \\&quot;new\\&quot; this product was when I received it, I have NO OTHER complaints. The product is PERFECT and works fine and has done wonders for the texture of my skin and has evened out my skin tone !!</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery and it was exactly as described... came with user manual and all the proper components. I am so excited to try my new product!</li>
