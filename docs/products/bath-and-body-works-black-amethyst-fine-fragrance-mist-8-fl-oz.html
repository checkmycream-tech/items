            <li>But the smell I love....</li>
            <li>This is my FAVORITE scent of all time from b&amp;bw.</li>
            <li>Such a great scent!</li>
            <li>My experience with the seller was top notch</li>

            <li>this is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>I love bodymist and lotion.</li>
            <li>, this is actually a better deal, money-wise.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of cologne-type fragrances and this was so strong that I immediately got a headache from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a lover of sweet fragrances, this has a bit of sweetness, but also exotic, I recommend them to all the girls who like to use Bath &amp; Body Works products.</li>
            <li>very happy to have my Black Amethyst body spray again.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making it available through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>The product was in perfect condition and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell much else besides very strong patchouli.</li>
            <li>it very much hope I can order more stuff</li>
            <li>(This review was originally written in December 2013 but never posted).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I wanted it to be special.</li>
            <li>I spray it in my hair, and actually use about twelve squirts per day, but the fragrance lasts a good six hours.</li>
            <li>want to thank mike from hoarder mikes for having it in stock and shipping it to me so quickly...</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Plus, this arrived right on schedule.</li>
            <li>It was a great item for a very special Person Im sad to say is no longer with us</li>
            <li>Its okay did not like the price to the extra shipping.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as potent as an actual perfume, resulting in a lighter scent throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>so Bath&amp; body should bring this back , So glad to have found it here</li>
            <li>It was her sixty first birthday</li>
            <li>Only scent I am able to use because of asthma.  </li>
            <li>It had a very nice smell, wasn&#x27;t to weak.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This definitely steps outside the realm of \\&quot;normal BBW scents\\&quot; which I usually enjoy this just has too much of one note for me to enjoy.</li>
            <li>I love my B&amp;BW Black Amethyst bodyspray and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I am highly allergic to fragrances now; and this is the &amp;#34;rare&amp;#34; one that I can wear without having a reaction.  </li>
            <li>and I needed something new and different.</li>

            <li> This smells wonderful and I have loved using it.  It isn&#x27;t as potent as an actual perfume, resulting in a lighter scent throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It had a very nice smell, wasn&#x27;t to weak. It&#x27;s sort of a darker, evening scent.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this smell when I bought the lotion in store years ago but they no longer sell it in stores.  This mist has no staying power at all, sorry.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE scent of all time from b&amp;bw. I&#x27;ve been wearing this since 2009. I can&#x27;t stop buying it!!</li>
            <li> (This review was originally written in December 2013 but never posted).&lt;br /&gt;I was doing a mini little Bath &amp; Body Works haul because I was in desperate need of a new fragrance. I&#x27;d been using the same body mist from Victoria&#x27;s Secret since I was pregnant and I needed something new and different. I saw this on the website and noticed that it had great reviews so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be giving this to a family member or something because as much as I hate to say it, I do not like this scent at all.

I&#x27;m not a fan of cologne-type fragrances and this was so strong that I immediately got a headache from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is long lasting, I definitely have to give it that. But I just couldn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent!! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It was a great item for a very special Person Im sad to say is no longer with us She passed away</li>
            <li> Such a great scent! I got this for my friend for her birthday and she loves it. Plus, this arrived right on schedule. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the scent......</li>
            <li> This is the sort of mist i like when going out on the town.</li>
            <li> Again this is a great product so Bath&amp; body should bring this back , So glad to have found it here Thanks</li>
            <li> This smells of patchouli,  I don&#x27;t smell much else besides very strong patchouli. Once it dries down it&#x27;s tolerable but not for me, hoping to gift it. My experience with the seller was top notch no worries there just not the scent for me at all! This definitely steps outside the realm of \\&quot;normal BBW scents\\&quot; which I usually enjoy this just has too much of one note for me to enjoy.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to discover that I could buy the fragrance from you since it is no longer stocked in the stores.  I am highly allergic to fragrances now; and this is the &amp;#34;rare&amp;#34; one that I can wear without having a reaction.  Thank you for making it available through Amazon.com.  Yeah!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kay Carpenter</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  Shipping was fast and easy. I willllllll reorder again!</li>
            <li> I chose this fragrance as agift for my sister. It was her sixty first birthday and I wanted it to be special. She says she like it.</li>
            <li> Only scent I am able to use because of asthma.  I am happy to have this.  Scent is so refreshing</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite scents. I love bodymist and lotion. I will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> This has been my exclusive fragrance for years, and I was so sad to find that my local store decided to stop stocking it.  I usually buy from the Bath and Body website, however when they aren&#x27;t offering their &#x27;buy three get three&#x27; promotion, this is actually a better deal, money-wise.  The scent is a sandalwood, and not fruity at all.  And, for years, whenever I go out people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.  I spray it in my hair, and actually use about twelve squirts per day, but the fragrance lasts a good six hours.</li>
            <li> I love this splash, the fragrance is divine! I am a lover of sweet fragrances, this has a bit of sweetness, but also exotic, I recommend them to all the girls who like to use Bath &amp; Body Works products. The product arrived in excellent condition, there were no delays in delivery and was just the way it appears in the description and photo. I have no complaints of the product or the seller, I recommend!</li>
            <li> bought this for my mom, it was discontinued but i found it here!! couldnt be more happy and cant wait to surprise my mom on christmas morning, shes not expecting it!!</li>
