            <li> This has worked great for my fine lines by my eyes. It feels great when I put it on, almost cooling. I put this around my eyes after cleansing and before moisturizing. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a high price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** My reviews are my honest opinion and I&#x27;m not financially compensated for them.&lt;br /&gt;Received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review***</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with the results so far. I&#x27;m using it every day in the morning and spread it all over my face and neck, followed by an SPF lotion.

I also feel the firmness of my skin is better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with the quality - good value for the money. I recommend it to anyone who is looking to get rid of visible signs of aging.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks and so far I can&#x27;t see any difference and I really don&#x27;t like the smell. Everytime I use it, my son says I stink.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Absorbs quickly, my face is looking smoother!</li>
            <li> It gave me a rash the first night I used it. I waited about a week and tried it again, and I have not had anymore issues. Love the product. I had someone tell my yesterday that I was 28..... but don&#x27;t tell them that I am actually 46!</li>
            <li> i have been using this for awhile now and my face is the softest i have ever felt. it only takes a little and the fine lines are going away..love it..</li>
            <li> Love this product I add a little to my face cream</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference with 4-5 days of starting this serum.  My skin was softer and I&#x27;m pleased with the results months later.</li>
            <li> thank you for letting me try this product with little or zero money, I love it, this product brought back healthy glowing face . I use it in the morning and in the evening, no allergies from it or rashes, I noticed less dryness on my face</li>

            <li> Received my product quickly and I sm really loving it. My skin is super-sensitive so I was a bit leery. It feels great on my skin and co workers have noticed a difference too!</li>
            <li> Great Vitamin C Serum!  Also, not tested on animals.  The serum soaks into your face-at least it did on mine-immediately.  I think it will be great for this winter but also, my skin needs it in summer too.  There is no smell to irritate the nose or eyes.  And the product itself didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes. I think it also mentioned dark circles.  That will be the real test!  THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Natural, organic, no alcohol or parabens. This serum is making my skin more moisturized and brighter looking. My freckles look like it&#x27;s fading and it feels so soft.</li>
