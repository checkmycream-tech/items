            <li>My friends &amp; family were soo impressed with my find-Can&#x27;t wait 2</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that some of the reviews said the material is not that great to see through, defeating the purpose of a shield that can protect your face while spraying.</li>
            <li>This Shield/Protector works great for my wife when spraying her hair.</li>
            <li>works great to keep hairspray off your face</li>
            <li>Works great on preventing hairspray from getting into my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It works great for this.</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t work without this shield, it is amazing!</li>
            <li>Protect from hair spray, looks really great, clients love this sheild</li>
            <li>,I&#x27;m very satisfied *</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!  </li>
            <li>It certainly does a great job of protecting the face while I spray my hair.  </li>
            <li>I had wanted to create a product like this myself for many years.  </li>
            <li>With this shield I am able to keep the spray away from my eyes as well as off of my face.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m sure it will cake on and hamper visibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face is more oval...</li>
            <li>I have a hair cut that feathers on the top</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and works great to prevent spray from getting on the face,.</li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to do: keep your face nice and clean from whatever you might be spraying into your hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure you regularly clean off any spray you get on it.</li>
            <li>I disagree; I feel you can see just fine through it.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is translucent-ish, but I see through it fine and can see where I am spraying.</li>
            <li>so I can super glue it together, but still!</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my hair stylist and they work fantastic</li>
            <li>It was a clean break</li>
            <li>Does anyone remember that Uncle Jesse came up with an idea for this product in an episode on Full House?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute and considerable tool to have!!!</li>
            <li>and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t completely cover the entirety of my forehead and face (but nearly most of it).</li>
            <li>It rinses clean to look like new.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for one of these and Amazon was the only place I was able to find one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also able to direct the spray where I want it because the shield is clear, without wasting hairspray and hoping I&#x27;m hitting the right spots.</li>
            <li>Generally though I use a light spray and there is not a problem with that happening.  </li>
            <li>Well, it really does exactly what it promises</li>
            <li>This product is a great idea but the reality falls a little short...</li>
            <li>I knew I wanted to try it, even though the shipping was almost as much as the Face Shield.  </li>
            <li>Who wants to do that?</li>
            <li>the only thing I wish was it was hands free</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t using that much pressure.</li>
            <li>Used 2 own a few pastel colored ones when I was in my teens when I 1st started doing hair-</li>
            <li>Professional product for those finishing mists!!!</li>
            <li>She highly recommends it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product does help cut back on the amount of hairspray hitting your face but is not extremely well thought out or user friendly.</li>
            <li>The only thing is they don&#x27;t last long in that they break very easily even if you never drop them.  </li>
            <li>I love it, no more hair spray in the eyes or on places</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a little heavier/thicker than I thought it would be so it ended up being really bulky and more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It does need to be rinsed off frequently as the spray builds up on it -  which used to build up on my face, apparently!  </li>
            <li>take them back down memory lane with my new set-Great purchase &amp; quick delivery</li>
            <li>Back then old women use to just go once a week and have there hair set and the shield kept the hair spray out of there face.</li>
            <li>Well I was curious to see if this really was a product, and of course I found it on Amazon (is there anything you can&#x27;t find here?).</li>
            <li>You should not expect to be able to clearly look through it and see where you are spraying your hair product, but rather a blind shot.</li>
            <li>Despite the shield being clear there is nearly no visibility.</li>
            <li>cuz with a longer hair treatment or updo your hand gets tired but other than that overall satisfied!</li>

            <li> Protect your face and makeup from sticky hairspray residue.  It rinses clean to look like new.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t work without this shield, it is amazing! Protect from hair spray, looks really great, clients love this sheild</li>
            <li> I had wanted to create a product like this myself for many years.  I blamed hairspray splatters on my face for embarrassing  break outs.  When I saw it I knew I wanted to try it, even though the shipping was almost as much as the Face Shield.  It certainly does a great job of protecting the face while I spray my hair.  It does need to be rinsed off frequently as the spray builds up on it -  which used to build up on my face, apparently!  Also, on occasion I use a heavier hairspray and the hair will stick to the shield and pull out of place when the shield is pulled back.  Generally though I use a light spray and there is not a problem with that happening.  I am happy I purchased this and would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching 4 these items 4 years-Used 2 own a few pastel colored ones when I was in my teens when I 1st started doing hair-My friends &amp; family were soo impressed with my find-Can&#x27;t wait 2 take them back down memory lane with my new set-Great purchase &amp; quick delivery,I&#x27;m very satisfied *_*</li>
            <li> I have been looking for one of these and Amazon was the only place I was able to find one. I wear contact lens and have to be careful with hairspray. With this shield I am able to keep the spray away from my eyes as well as off of my face. I&#x27;m also able to direct the spray where I want it because the shield is clear, without wasting hairspray and hoping I&#x27;m hitting the right spots. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Well, I give the designers credit for coming up with this, however, if you want to see what you are doing when you spray your hair, you&#x27;ll have to wash it every day! Who wants to do that? It does the job though, you won&#x27;t get hairspray on your face!</li>
            <li> Simple enough of a product. Does what it is supposed to do: keep your face nice and clean from whatever you might be spraying into your hair. I&#x27;ve noticed that some of the reviews said the material is not that great to see through, defeating the purpose of a shield that can protect your face while spraying. I disagree; I feel you can see just fine through it. Yes, it is translucent-ish, but I see through it fine and can see where I am spraying. Make sure you regularly clean off any spray you get on it. Otherwise, I&#x27;m sure it will cake on and hamper visibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say is that the shield might be a bit small for some faces. My face is more oval... and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t completely cover the entirety of my forehead and face (but nearly most of it). If you have a round face, perhaps this won&#x27;t give you as much protection? I guess it is something to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> I love it, no more hair spray in the eyes or on places I don&#x27;t need hair spray</li>
            <li> This Shield/Protector works great for my wife when spraying her hair. She highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to protect my face from hairspray in an effort to reduce potential acne.  There is no point to this product.  I stopped using it after three or so tries.  Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> works great to keep hairspray off your face</li>
            <li> I have a hair cut that feathers on the top and I use hair spray to hold it in place. I remember when my Grandmother would go get her hair done way back in the 60&#x27;s once a week they would hand this to her and spray her down. Back then old women use to just go once a week and have there hair set and the shield kept the hair spray out of there face. I do my hair everyday and got tired of hair spray on my forehead and hands. I looked every where for one of these even a beauty supply store they did not have a clue what I was talking about. So I took a shot on Amazon and found just the one I wanted.</li>
            <li> Works great on preventing hairspray from getting into my eyes.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Came broken..not worth returning it</li>
            <li> Product is what I expected and arrived as promised,</li>
            <li> Does anyone remember that Uncle Jesse came up with an idea for this product in an episode on Full House? But turns out it was already a product that was on the market? Well I was curious to see if this really was a product, and of course I found it on Amazon (is there anything you can&#x27;t find here?). Well, it really does exactly what it promises, it protects your face from hair spray. I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars because I feel that it is too small to protect my entire face, so I have to move it around and spray sections of hair at a time - but even doing this I can feel some hair spray settling onto the part of my face that I can&#x27;t keep covered. It&#x27;s also a little heavier/thicker than I thought it would be so it ended up being really bulky and more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The handle broke like two days after I received it</li>
            <li> Love love love it!  I would recommend to everyone that uses hair spray close to their face.</li>
            <li> Despite the shield being clear there is nearly no visibility. You should not expect to be able to clearly look through it and see where you are spraying your hair product, but rather a blind shot. The product does not fit exactly to your forehead, and is rather small. You have to constantly maneuver the product to prevent the hair spray from hitting your forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does help cut back on the amount of hairspray hitting your face but is not extremely well thought out or user friendly.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my hair stylist and they work fantastic the only thing I wish was it was hands free cuz with a longer hair treatment or updo your hand gets tired but other than that overall satisfied!</li>
            <li> This product is a great idea but the reality falls a little short...the hairspray tends to cloud it somewhat, sort of defeating the \\&quot;see through\\&quot; clarity, and your hair can stick to it if you accidentally touch it to your hair after spraying. I would give this product about a B-.</li>
            <li> Professional product for those finishing mists!!! Especially for my clients who already have on their makeup!! It&#x27;s a cute and considerable tool to have!!!</li>
            <li> This face shield works well and does what it is supposed to do.  I use it to keep hairspray off my face and out of my eyes.  The only thing is they don&#x27;t last long in that they break very easily even if you never drop them.  They will just start cracking after about a month of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my haircuts because I hate the hair getting on my face! It works great for this. I&#x27;m giving it one star because the second time I used it, while trying to wipe down the inside with a towell, it snapped and broke. It was a clean break so I can super glue it together, but still! I wasn&#x27;t using that much pressure.</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser and needed this for my clients.  It is very sturdy and works great to prevent spray from getting on the face,.</li>
