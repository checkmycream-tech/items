            <li>and I do feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I got this body wash when it was on a very good sale, with a coupon on top of it, so it was well worth the cost; I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d buy it at full price though.</li>
            <li>I purchased this thinking it would be a mild cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Have gotten compliments on how healthy &amp; soft it is.</li>
            <li>Maybe tingly skin minty fresh feeling???  </li>
            <li>The soap is clear, lathers up nicely, has a soft peppermint smell.  </li>
            <li>I know a true / natural mint scent-</li>
            <li>I feel like they were expired as it didn&#x27;t really have a scent and didn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It does not smell much like peppermint.</li>
            <li>It really does smell like drain cleaner.</li>
            <li>Really like to use the peppermint to lather face for shaving.</li>

            <li>Amazingly smooth shave and leaves skin feeling clean and tight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m getting clean, but it&#x27;s not very pleasant.</li>
            <li>less lather as expected but still does an excellent job and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a hint of peppermint, but mainly lemon.  </li>
            <li>After  a couple of weeks of use, my children and I have developed rashes.  </li>

            <li> With that in mind, it doesnt last long on your body.  </li>
            <li> I am not that wild about the soap itself, finding it not light or bubbly enough.</li>
            <li> I opened the other two, and they smelled the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this one above the other scents.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
            <li> In the bottle, it didn&#x27;t smell unpleasant, but I would never be able to categorize it as peppermint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken open only one bottle of this body wash so far, but it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li> I use those Japanese nylon scrub cloths and it lathers up well with only a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to try the other products by 7th Generation.</li>
            <li> I like the stuff, but it is not very bubbly and it feels like you waste a lot trying to wash with it.</li>
            <li> odd.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the ingredients on this body wash are</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is in it that caused the dryness thus leading to rashes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thin, though, so I see myself going through my supply faster than thicker, creamier body washes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not exaggerating.</li>
            <li> I like the very delicate scent.</li>
            <li> but wow this is awful, it smells like</li>
            <li> but it smells absolutely horrible and is no where remotely near what peppermint smells like.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a vague hint of it, but the scent doesn&#x27;t stay on your body after you wash, and while you&#x27;re using it it smells....</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this company will never be seeing another dime from me.</li>
            <li> It smelled like it went bad in the bottle (unless they&#x27;re aiming for a musty, mildewy, dirty mop water scent).</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this as the smell is horrible!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27; the worst thing I have ever smelled!!!</li>
            <li> Once I lathered up, EGADS this stuff smells awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It says here at Amazon that it is gluten free.  It says on Seventh Generations website that it is gluten free.  It does NOT say on the bottle that it is gluten free.  This could potentially be a BIG problem for someone who is gluten intolerant.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this as the smell is horrible!!! I bought it thinking I love peppermint but the smell is anything but peppermint! I got nauseous in the shower from the smell and had to throw away all three bottles I purchased. It&#x27; the worst thing I have ever smelled!!! YUCK!!!!!</li>
            <li> This smells like a cleaning product, not peppermint body wash. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m getting clean, but it&#x27;s not very pleasant. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Some of the bottles leaked in the package.  I feel like they were expired as it didn&#x27;t really have a scent and didn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought these with a super good deal and a coupon and I would only pay that again. At a regular price, these seem overpriced to me. I like the stuff, but it is not very bubbly and it feels like you waste a lot trying to wash with it. Still, it was a nice scent, fun to have when kids came home at the Holidays</li>
            <li> It does not smell much like peppermint. There&#x27;s a vague hint of it, but the scent doesn&#x27;t stay on your body after you wash, and while you&#x27;re using it it smells....odd. Foams nicely though and I do feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t choose this scent again. It smells &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;. I know a true / natural mint scent- I grow it. This does not have a nice fragrance. Nice lather. Rinses clean. Didn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like seventh generation products but wow this is awful, it smells like chemicals and mine arrived with out seals on them.</li>
            <li> Great body wash, I will always buy it.</li>
            <li> Great body wash.  Very nice peppermint smell and does leave the skin feeling very very good.  You will enjoy it I promise.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, and it lasts a good part of the day. It would get 5 stars if it moisturized better.</li>
            <li> I like my body wash to create lots of suds, and it takes a good bit to get to the level I like.  It works though, and the scent is growing on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the ingredients on this body wash are but it smells absolutely horrible and is no where remotely near what peppermint smells like.</li>
            <li> When I received my three-pack, I popped one open to see what it smelled like. In the bottle, it didn&#x27;t smell unpleasant, but I would never be able to categorize it as peppermint. Once I lathered up, EGADS this stuff smells awful. Literally gag inducing. It smelled like it went bad in the bottle (unless they&#x27;re aiming for a musty, mildewy, dirty mop water scent). I opened the other two, and they smelled the same. Needless to say, this company will never be seeing another dime from me. I&#x27;m going back to Dr. Bronners.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff to try because I&#x27;m on dialysis n itch a lot so I got it n love it</li>
            <li> Nice body wash, pleasant scent, less toxins than others, recommend</li>
            <li> I love this body wash! Lathers well and smells great...I love the peppermint smell!</li>
            <li> i use this everyday and the peppermint is a nice scent and not the tingly over powering (almost burning) that some of the peppermint shower gels are.  I&#x27;d recommend this one above the other scents.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it would be a mild cleanser.  After  a couple of weeks of use, my children and I have developed rashes.  I am not sure what is in it that caused the dryness thus leading to rashes.  This formula needs a makeover ASAP.  I will go back to EO soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this hooking to replace my chemical filled shampoo. Love it! It suds up great and leaves my hair &amp; body smelling nice. Been using it as a natural shampoo for a year now. Paired with Aubrey Conditioners, my hair has never been better. Have gotten compliments on how healthy &amp; soft it is. Definitely will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken open only one bottle of this body wash so far, but it&#x27;s working well. The scent is fresh without being overpowering, and I get a great lather from it, which is uncommon for natural soap products. It&#x27;s a little thin, though, so I see myself going through my supply faster than thicker, creamier body washes. I got this body wash when it was on a very good sale, with a coupon on top of it, so it was well worth the cost; I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d buy it at full price though.</li>
            <li> Smells like drain cleaner. I&#x27;m honestly not exaggerating. It really does smell like drain cleaner. I will try it on my drains, because I won&#x27;t be showering with it, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> nice smell and a leaves the skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> I love this wash it smells wonderful and leaves you feeling clean without a lot of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I bought these on sale.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase overall.  The soap is clear, lathers up nicely, has a soft peppermint smell.  Definitely not a strong odor.  With that in mind, it doesnt last long on your body.  It is soothing and I prefer it with my evening shower before bed.  I&#x27;d like to try the other products by 7th Generation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting.  Maybe tingly skin minty fresh feeling???  I got none of those.  It was soap.  I landed up giving two of the three bottles away because I was so unimpressed.  I would not buy or recommend the product.</li>
            <li> The aroma is just Ho Hum. It smells more like a disinfecting kind of mint, than peppermint to me. I am not that wild about the soap itself, finding it not light or bubbly enough. It seems kind of heavy.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a hint of peppermint, but mainly lemon.  It cleans well, but I ordered this because I wanted a peppermint scent.</li>
            <li> less lather as expected but still does an excellent job and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry. I like the very delicate scent.</li>
            <li> Really like to use the peppermint to lather face for shaving. Amazingly smooth shave and leaves skin feeling clean and tight. I use those Japanese nylon scrub cloths and it lathers up well with only a small amount. Bought at a bargain market but will be restocking soon from Amazon.</li>
