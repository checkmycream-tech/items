            <li>I currently  own the Oral-B Sonic Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Sonic quality is nice.</li>
            <li>but then I found these on Amazon and was thrilled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the Oral B Sonic for years and these replacement heads worked great, just like the original heads purchased years ago.</li>
            <li>They clean my teeth well and do a great job at stimulating my gums.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a great job getting my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>This particular brush and head are the best of all of the ones I have tried before -</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly, shipped quick and received without a problem.  </li>
            <li>I always like Oral-B, and am very happy with the new brushes.</li>
            <li>This is a very easy product to review.  </li>
            <li>Love being able to purchase them automatically, every three months!  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable, functional, and effective.  </li>
            <li>I suspect there are others just as good, but this one works fine.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads work just fine and do a good job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>it had 2 brush handles and a charger which was perfect since I still had the old charger.  </li>

            <li>so that&#x27;s good enough for me, dainty, petite</li>
            <li>I own a Sonic care tooth brush too which I think is a better electronic tooth brush, and the heads wear better than the Oral B.</li>

            <li>You CAN NOT beat this price, I have searched fair and wide, and this was def the best price I was able to find.</li>

            <li>I hope to find a better deal soon.</li>

            <li>Great Price &amp; Fast Delivery</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Its on the cheaper side than most electric brushes</li>
            <li>but I think you get more than you spend.</li>
            <li>Gotta love it when a plan comes together.   </li>

            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>I LOVE ORAL B PRODUCTS .</li>
            <li>I was so happy to  find what I needed and at a reasonable price thru amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a satisfied costumer.</li>
            <li>The Amazon deal I got makes the price much more palatable.</li>
            <li>Amazon prime is awesome, it came in 2 days, and I saved 10 dollars from the local drugstore.</li>
            <li>So glad I was shopping at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The latest technology applies rotating heads and these are not compatable.  </li>
            <li>Do NOT trust the reviews that say these fit the Vitality!</li>
            <li>Heck, there was no shelf space for this item in most of the stores.</li>
            <li>After this experience-I will do more shopping on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Better deals can be found at Costco.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li>ever since I started to use this product about 3years ago, my dentist is pleased with the result, and I have no cavities.  </li>
            <li>Love the service.</li>
            <li>And, the shipping was free!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results</li>
            <li>Santa brought us our sonic tooth brush and we love it.</li>

            <li>I needed replacement heads for my Sonic toothbrush and these definitely fill the bill - great price!</li>
            <li>This product is superb because they last up to 4-5 months before having to change the head on the toothbrush.</li>

            <li>Very excited to find them at Amazon.com for a resonable price plus FREE shipping!  </li>
            <li>the product is good quality and the price was right.</li>
            <li>And I get good positive feedback when I go for cleanings!</li>
            <li>When I did find one at a local drugstore they wanted more than I paid for 3!!!</li>
            <li>The problem is stores no longer carry this particular replacement since the toothbrush -- which works great - is not this year&#x27;s model.  </li>
            <li>The price was very good compared to Oral B&#x27;s own website (almost double the price) and shipping was free at Amazon.</li>
            <li>This was a very cheap and easy purchase.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find these replacement heads as they are becoming increasingly scarce.</li>
            <li>the toothbrush itself is great, charge lasts a good, long time, &amp; heads are easy to replace.</li>
            <li>Nice and cheap....  far better than Ebay!!   </li>
            <li>I can not buy this product in the store anymore and was glad to fine it on line.  </li>
            <li>and it feels like dentist clean after each use!</li>
            <li>Work just fine on my sonic brush and haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast and I am very pleased with the toothbrushes and the price I paid for them.</li>
            <li>free shipping makes it ok.  </li>
            <li>The Sonic B Complete is a great toothbrush but the head refills are way overpriced coming up to 7 dollars for each refill head.  </li>
            <li>Glad these were available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and they work great for my Oral B sonic complete.</li>
            <li>I was nervous they wouldnt fit based on some reviews, but they fit no problem!</li>
            <li>These were a good price, and it was very convenient to have them delivered.</li>
            <li>Very relieved to find them and at a good price.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good product.</li>
            <li>I was SOOO EXCITED to find these on Amazon and that they are available as a subscribe and save product at such a great price!</li>
            <li>The replacement brush heads are better than the original brush head that came with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Make sure the replacement head matches the original.</li>
            <li>Yee-haw, I hope they are able to continue offering this product at such a great price.</li>
            <li>Them came very quickly and at a resonable price.</li>
            <li>and it was so easy.</li>
            <li>There are lots of varieties, and easy to confuse.</li>
            <li>is the house keeping that keeps it clean..:)</li>
            <li>Filling up 14 words about a toothbrush is not as easy as it looks</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and easy to store in bathroom.</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to have a supply of these at a fairly reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find these at Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>They are fine....</li>
            <li>Easy fit.  </li>
            <li>They are exactly the same and work perfectly with mine and my wife&#x27;s Oral B toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>No biggie, they work fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine and arrived on time.  </li>
            <li>Replacements were just fine</li>
            <li>I need \\&quot;soft\\&quot; and these seem to be fine.</li>
            <li>Fine.  </li>
            <li>And can continue using my finely working sonic tooth-brushing engine.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and I am pleased with the performance.  </li>
            <li>Also the 3 brushheads came in with cheap wrapping materials.</li>
            <li>As it doesn&#x27;t fit well to the toothbrush, the vibration of the brushhead also spilled the toothpast everywhere.</li>
            <li>I bought two packages to take advantage of free shipping</li>
            <li>As Braun/Oral-B has marketed newer models, the brush heads for my model are no longer available in retail.  </li>
            <li>free shipping,half the price of stores if you can find it.  </li>
            <li>I thought \\&quot;oral-B\\&quot; meant it would fit my brush, and that \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; referred to the type of head.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I buy Oral B heads in a store they fit my toothbrush.   </li>
            <li>Amazon recommended I buy these Oral B Sonic replacement brush heads for my Oral B Pulsonic toothbrush - but they don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I always receive precisely what I&#x27;ve ordered.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads fit my Braun Oral B Vitality Sonic toothbrush that I was given by my dentist office.  </li>
            <li>It came with a travel case that fit the handle and a brush head conveniently for travel.  </li>
            <li>These are so cheap I couldn&#x27;t resist.  </li>
            <li>In addition they don&#x27;t fit the oral B handle as well as the originals, they are probably meant as a one size fits all arrangement, which they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The shape of it is very streamline making the brushing experience nice.</li>
            <li>I bought some of the brushes made in China for a cheap price and got a cheap product.</li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t fall out as they did on the cheap product.</li>
            <li>Now i have three toothbrush heads that don&#x27;t fit and am out my money.</li>
            <li>This is a genuine Oral-B product, not an aftermarket knock-off.  </li>
            <li>These are great replacement heads especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Snug fit</li>
            <li>Then I found this gem, the original Oral-B product at a super duper discount!</li>
            <li>I am always glad that I can reorder replacement heads online easily and don&#x27;t have to scour store shelves to find the exact match.</li>
            <li>This is a good brush head replacement, fitting just the same as the original heads.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find this because I couldn&#x27;t find the right one in the stores.  </li>
            <li>One thing make sure you get the right name of your tooth brush.</li>
            <li>This oral-b sonic  brush is far superior to the Sonicare by Philips.&lt;br /&gt;Bought these originally for my kids (who are now teens).  </li>
            <li>Buy from amazon, u will save a ton of money and they work fantastic and keeping your teeth shiny and clean.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see it offered on Amazon at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>That being said, these will leave your mouth feeling extremely fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy as I did not have to buy a brand new tooth bush because the retail stores were not stocking the replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe these are the original replacement brushheads.</li>
            <li>Wish I haven&#x27;t thrown away the original one.</li>
            <li>Just like the ones that came with the original toothbrush</li>
            <li>But we were so excited when we discovered they had our toothbrush heads on amazon.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>that I think the original heads had softer bristles.</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>and they are just like the ones that came with it originally.</li>
            <li>so I was excited when I found them.  </li>
            <li>The price is fine, and the service is quick.</li>
            <li>They work well and keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>The brush keeps my teeth amazingly clean.  </li>
            <li>I like the clean feeling</li>
            <li>Product posted in good time but the ultimate nightmare-- didn&#x27;t fit the rechargeable unit I have which says Vitality Sonic</li>
            <li>These fit my Oral-B Sonic Vitality, received them quickly and ordering online was a lot easier than driving around looking for these.</li>
            <li>The brushes contain the famous Oral-B blue indicator bristles that provides a nice reminder of when to replace your brushes.</li>
            <li>Used this toothbrush for YEARS and always a clean bill of tooth health when I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li>use all the time and clean the teeth and messages my gums when needed sometimes come off the brush handle</li>
            <li>Clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>These really clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>Dentist always compliments how clean I keep my teeth</li>
            <li>My teeth are clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>My teeth always feel squeaky clean after using them each morning and evening.</li>
            <li>I found the right toothbrush replacements for my sonic toothbrush unit!</li>
            <li>They do a reasonable job in keeping your teeth clean and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>The colors were so much bolder , and the brush heads seemed to rotate to clean better.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who needs healthy teeth and a pretty smile, buy these.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I get them for such a great price and the shipping is amazingly fast, I received them in three days, two days sooner than they said!</li>
            <li>I was very glad to find this as they are no longer available in stores local to me.</li>
            <li>headline and 20 more words is too much of an effortheadline and 20 more words is too much of an effortheadline and 20 more words is too much of an effortheadline and 20 more words is too much of an effortheadline and 20 more words is too much of an effort</li>
            <li>So I am very grateful they are available through Amazon!</li>
            <li>This is only a good thing.</li>
            <li>I was not about to get rid of a perfectly good unit simply because the brushes have been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants better oral health.</li>
            <li>Price is way more reasonable than in the store.</li>
            <li>I love these brush heads with my electric toothbrush, although they are very expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The order was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and was as described.  </li>
            <li>The shipment arrived quickly too.</li>
            <li>I really thought I got a great deal on price, especially since I couldn&#x27;t find the correct heads in the stores</li>
            <li>I could not even find this particular brush head at most stores.</li>
            <li>glad I was able to find these here because I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re actually sold in stores anymore,</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>My refills arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried several different electric toothbrushes, but this is the one we like the best, but wouldn&#x27;t you know, it&#x27;s also the hardest to find.</li>
            <li>I appreciate being able to find replacement brushes for my still working, but older model electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Brushes will last depending on usage, but they do seem to do better than most of the store knockoff brands.</li>
            <li>Better than regular toothbrush in my opinion and love the timer.</li>
            <li>This newer one is better than the older ones.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 packages and they arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>the Oral B brushes are a more recent design than the ones that came with the tooth brush and are actually better at getting into the spaces between teeth, etc.  </li>
            <li>WITHOUT flossing very much too!</li>
            <li>I was excited to find these on subscribe and save and the price was very reasonable in comparison to retail.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the fast delivery and product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>the unit works pretty good and a have definitely saved a bit on the replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fits brush perfectly and I was unable to locate the brush heads locally so was thrilled to be able to find them at the right price.</li>
            <li>I should have checked Amazon FIRST!</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I was happy with my electric toothbrush and did not want to have to buy a new one, but all of my brush heads finally wore out</li>
            <li>These fit well and were very well priced for a 3-pack.</li>
            <li>My daughter goes through a lot of these, now that she has braces, so I am glad Amazon offers them.     </li>
            <li>But... do I get complimented on my smile always?</li>
            <li>Worth every dime.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>A very positive transaction.</li>
            <li>and I received it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads were sent quickly and were just as if I bought them in the store, but they were much cheaper!</li>
            <li>But they were packaged well and price was right.</li>
            <li>The price is right and the ease of ordering will have me purchasing this item again.  </li>
            <li>It is what it says it is, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to &amp; the price is right</li>
            <li>I thought it would fit my Oral-B, but mine is an older one, and I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>Certain brushes fit certain model toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the timeliness of receiving the product as well as the quality (as expected)</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t last, ended up costing more money because they needed to be replaced about four times more frequently.</li>
            <li>Searched all over for these, hard to find, Amazon had the best price by far.  </li>
            <li>so I thought I would have to buy a new toothbrush that had   replacement heads available in the store.</li>
            <li>Better to buy at CVS or Walgreens and get the right heads or return with no questions asked even with open package.</li>
            <li>However, when I checked with Amazon, the product was very reasonable priced.  </li>
            <li>These refills were very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipper and everything arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Received everything very fast.  </li>
            <li>Glad I&#x27;m able to get them online for a whole lot less than at the store.</li>
            <li>Three new replacement heads still in original packing.  </li>
            <li>They were hard to find, so I was happy to find them.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I needed for my Oral B Vitality Sonic toothbrush, Type 3709.</li>
            <li>I ordered several packs to make sure I never run out again.</li>
            <li>This brush is exactly like the origal brush that came with my unit.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>It matched exactly what I was looking for for my rechargable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>If not all your heads fit all the models, you should make it clear.  </li>
            <li>Amazon had the best price I could find, but at over $6 a brush, they are expensive.</li>
            <li>Have checked many different places</li>
            <li>Replacement heads for the oral-b electronic toothbrush lasts more than the 3 months they suggest (and that is based on brushing twice daily).  </li>
            <li>thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I got our correct replacement the first time with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was having difficulty locally finding the replacement heads for my Sonic Oral B toothbrush, which I love the results that I receive from this product.  </li>
            <li>I would gladly do business with this individual again.</li>
            <li>I have the Sonic Complete system and none of the brushes in the stores fit this unit.  </li>
            <li>Even better, I stopped getting regular cavities.    </li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>for some reason, after i used the first head for a couple weeks, the head wouldn&#x27;t spin anymore; it would just vibrate.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I love the feature that tells you when to switch to the next quarter of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what we were expecting.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered  Exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li>I only spend $15 at most a year on toothbrush replacement heads, which is one purchase a year.  </li>
            <li>Third day I used it, it stopped rotating, cheap springs or something, won&#x27;t purchase again!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve purchased this item before and been burned, as of September 2012 the product being shipped does fit the Oral B Sonic Complete.  </li>
            <li>I always get 6 months or more out of them, but only use it once a day.  </li>
            <li>And I truly would reccomend this product to anyone interested.</li>
            <li>I gave this 5 stars because it was exactly what I needed to.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Between all of these items and using them religiously EVERY day my experience in the dentist chair is much much better.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>They were the exact replacement for my electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product turned out to be exactly what I thought it should be.</li>
            <li>I do wish the that the new brush heads were just the brush part as my old one was...just better for the environment, but that&#x27;s me.  </li>
            <li>They arrived earlier than expected and in great condition.</li>
            <li>I finally went to Amazon on line and was able to order the replacement brushes reasonably priced.    </li>
            <li>These replacements are much cheaper than you can get locally and you can set and reset a replacement schedule to save even more.  </li>
            <li>Grateful to be able to save so much money &amp; get a name brand product (rather than generic heads).</li>
            <li>High quality and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find, thrilled I did!</li>
            <li>my dentist even commented that he noticed a positive improvement in staining around the spaces and gums.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to think to check on Amazon, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Figured I&#x27;d save more in the long run... and after about a year of using it...</li>
            <li>Product came when promised, was exactly what I ordered, and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I received exactly what i ordered in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li>Plus they ship pretty fast.</li>
            <li>These are the only ones that will fit and are not carried by many local stores.  </li>
            <li>(yes, they are not cheap, but compare to many others, this is not bad).</li>
            <li>Years later, it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Even in the large stores like BJ&#x27;s or Sam&#x27;s club.  </li>
            <li>Not even in the large discount store 1 mile from my home.</li>
            <li>The floss action heads do a great job of cleaning and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I love this new feature of Amazon - having an item I need regularly sent on a selected schedule!  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used the Sonic Complete System since last summer and have found it made a significant difference from manual toothbrushes - the heads do a great job in dislodging small particles and also seem to help in brightening the teeth.   </li>
            <li>It is working okay, but had a hard time getting the brush to fit on the shaft.</li>
            <li>Three days later I had my much needed brushes and the shipping was FREE.</li>
            <li>:)  At least I can get the refills from a aupplier on Amazon for now, although not with the combined free shipping offer.  </li>
            <li>I have had great success w this brush and am really sorry to see it go.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and quality part.</li>
            <li>My son really likes his sonic brush, and needed a replacement head.</li>
            <li>These are the real deal...love the price.</li>
            <li>I have used this Oral B Vitality Sonic brush for years and really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, would not hesitate to order again.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is much cheaper</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than at Target or Walmart.  </li>
            <li>seems to me to work very well.  </li>
            <li>I found them here at Amazon.com at a much lower price than anywhere else I had searched.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think there is any difference between these and the ones I bought at a store.  </li>
            <li>provides a generic fit.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I&#x27;ve tried the &#x27;generic&#x27; brush heads, but sometime, they don&#x27;t fit correctly, so now,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Much easier (and faster) to order them from Amazon.</li>
            <li>So I am thinking to ditch the whole system and getting the newer ones.</li>
            <li>They fit well and are equal to the originals that came with my gift.</li>
            <li>The price was much cheaper than what I paid for in the stores.</li>
            <li>There is really nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li>This item shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>This product works very well cleaning your teeth and massaging your gums.  </li>
            <li>Very durable heads.</li>
            <li>This is a name brand brush for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>I have seen some reviews that say these dont fit properly, these do.</li>
            <li>The Sonic Replacement Brush Heads work really well, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Though the brush itself is somewhat prone to wearing out and the charging system is very hit or miss.</li>
            <li>How much else can be said about a toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li>I chose this rating because I really like the product and would recommend it to anyone as well.  </li>
            <li>FAST shipping too.</li>
            <li>The product is genuine and actually works as ever I remember.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>Have bought several and all of them fit as they should and</li>
            <li>I like these brush heads, they are the only ones that fit my electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I bought mine straight from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I got the Sonic Complete toothbrush as a door prize back in 2008 and have not been able to find replacement toothbrush heads in the store for over a year now.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are thanking me for locating proper fitting brushes again for my Oral B Sonic Complete tooth brush.</li>
            <li>but it seems I replace these heads far more often than I ever replaced regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Nice firm bristles, color change to let you know when you “should” change</li>
            <li>So while the device itself provides good oral care you are forced to overpay dramatically for refills.</li>
            <li>Brush heads fit perfectly on the motorized toothbrush base</li>
            <li>Good value, really, when you consider you can not get a  cleaning equal to this any other way, except by going to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Superior to an ordinary electric toothbrush in every way, the Sonic Complete!  </li>
            <li>While the brand name may be expensive, I believe in spending good money on my teeth, they are definately worth investing in!</li>
            <li>These are the brush heads for an older electric toothbrush and this was a good price for this hard to find item</li>
            <li>I am pleased to lower the star ratings on this to warn other customers.  </li>
            <li>My only complaints about the toothbrush heads are that they wear fairly quickly (and you really need to replace it when the toothbursh head is worn) and they are pricey - very pricey in stores.  </li>
            <li>This fits very well and decent price</li>
            <li>I use with a Braun power toothbrush and it gets my teeth clean and flossed at the same time.</li>
            <li>Good price for product;  Brush heads are packaged individually (not in same package containing all three) with disclaimer that \\&quot;packaging may be slightly damaged\\&quot;.   </li>
            <li>This one has a gentle vibrate that allows me to control the motion while it deep cleans better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Sonic Replacement brushes for my Sonic Care Complete were the first I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>Pricing allows for more frequent replacment of this now several years old toothbrush that workes well for me.</li>
            <li>love the oran b, but they need to improve their brushes, the brushes on my other tooth brush were much better and did a better job., and they are way too expensive, but all replacement brushes are</li>
            <li>Found a generic version but with the reviews about not staying correctly on the unit or bristles falling out I didn’t want to chance it as I knew these are good quality and have never had problems… not going to mess around with my health.</li>
            <li>and i can feel the difference when brushing my teeth with a new brush head!</li>
            <li>works like it is brand new!  </li>
            <li>Brand new item and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find them on Amazon for basically half the price.</li>
            <li>decent brush heads</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and I will purchase this item again in the future.</li>
            <li>Be sure to select the proper refill for your specific automatic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Decent tooth brush heads.</li>
            <li>I was unable to purchase these replacement heads through my grocery/pharmacy and was pleased to be able to order them online.</li>
            <li>blue &amp;#34;tell-tale&amp;#34; bristles seem to lose their color rather quickly (which is supposed to indicate time for a replacement).  </li>
            <li>I have an older model, close to 6 years, of the Oral-B ultrasounic toothbrush and could no longer find the replacement heads in the stores.</li>
            <li>Oral B has decent quality, but I no longer use their products, would not recommend for the price.</li>
            <li>My main problem with these products are the HIGH costs.  </li>
            <li>I saw the high rating on this product and that made me trust the purchase.  </li>
            <li>So all those high tech ones that rotate don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>There is a high, medium, and massage setting so you can take your pick.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>They last a lot more than 3 months - which is the standard time tooth brush companies tell you to change to a new brush.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the replacement brushhead shafts are in deep blue color, rather than the light blue color that come with the original ones.</li>
            <li>I had to really push down on it, otherwise it has worked fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly want to buy a new electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is an old electric toothbrush by Oral-B, and you can&#x27;t really get it anywhere in store, so the brush head</li>
            <li>These are great but they are too expensive.</li>
            <li>The sonic replacement brush heads provide a great cleaning but can be difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li>just like the ones I purchase at the&lt;br /&gt;dentist office, only a little more reasonable!</li>
            <li>But the brush is fairly soft and after only a few weeks it&#x27;s too soft to do any good.  </li>
            <li>this is one of the orginal sonic appliances but as long as I can obtain the brushes (no longer available in stores, hence one is forced to buy a new appliance at a healthy cost)</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I used the mid setting but now use the high setting.  </li>
            <li>The brushes ware out after about a month, which is why new ones need to be purchased and used.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to have to get a new toothbrush for a lack of replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>the brush heads look like new still</li>
            <li>The order of Oral-B sonic Replacement Brush Heads came on time in brand new condition.</li>
            <li>I figure each brush lasts about 2 weeks before I have to put on a new one.</li>
            <li>After these wear out I&#x27;ll probably have to find a new toothbrush altogether.</li>
            <li>Plus I don&#x27;t have to buy a new powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You buy something that works well and want to continue to use it, but there are always new and improved replacements coming on to the market, so, what is one to do?</li>
            <li>New, in package just as described.</li>
            <li>Just a complete win-win!</li>
            <li>Yes, these are toothbrush heads, so it&#x27;s pretty obvious what you use them for...</li>
            <li>We brought it into our house and changed the old heads for the new ones.  </li>
            <li>LOVE my Oral-B Sonic Complete, but I do not love paying $20+ for 3 replacement brush heads at the store.  </li>
            <li>This is not a very common tip, so I have to order it.  </li>
            <li>Being unable to find these refills near where I live, this is an easy and quick way to obtain them.</li>
            <li>Great price helps during these bad economic times.</li>
            <li>The refills are clearly where the profits are</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type of person who naturally moves my hand in a circular motion when brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>This is just what I needed to replace my old, worn out brush heads.</li>
            <li>I have not had any problems so far.</li>
            <li>I ended up with the Oral B Sonic Complete -</li>
            <li>I have used Oral B Sonic Complete for approx.</li>
            <li>Use of the Oral B Sonic Complete has improved the health of my gums and my teeth have never felt cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this toothbrush that I&#x27;ve had for a few years.</li>
            <li>The brush heads have performed as well as they always have on the Sonic Complete tooth brush.</li>
            <li>+ year old mouth intact.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are the correct product for the Sonic Complete toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads work well and lasts a reasonable amount of time(3-4 weeks) but they are over priced when compared to the generic brand which almost performs as well(2-3 weeks).</li>
            <li>I like my old tooth brush and these replacement heads</li>
            <li>The only time I use them is on vacation, since I am very hesitate to bring this along for fear of losing</li>
            <li>They have a regular shape like a real toothbrush,</li>
            <li>Both the price and service offered by this provider is making me smile not only bigger, but brighter!</li>
            <li>The head fits brush very well,  The price is slight higher than Costco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The product is small enough to fit into a standard envelope, but I was sent mine in a cardboard box 30×23×11cm, which annoyed me a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I like the small head size since it is easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>They are the same brand we used to buy in the store just a couple dollars less online for 3 toothbrush heads instead of just the one we used to buy for the same price, which is fabulous!</li>
            <li>The brushes are the same design as the original, and should last just as long as well.</li>
            <li>Not wanting to replace my toothbrush simply because the manufacturer wants me to (they made that clear by limiting the replacement brushes on store shelves), I turned to the &#x27;Net for help.</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that they are all the same colour - for families it would be useful for each person to have a different colour toothbrush head</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush a few months ago and was not looking forward to paying the full toothbrush price again for brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten them this way before and will certainly do the same next time I need them.</li>
            <li>Finding the refills on Amazon turned a hard job into an easy one...</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to get things that are hard to find.</li>
            <li>When the battery in that one finally gave out, I though I would try something new.</li>
            <li>Last year my electric toothbrush broke and I went searching for a new one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great having a line on this product--no longer are these replacement heads found on store shelves, at least, locally, and for the past two or three years.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush heads for my sonic clean were affordable via this website even less than Wallmart except for the shipping and handling so the next time I will just get them from my local Wallmart.</li>
            <li>My Oral B Sonic Complete recently started konking out on me.  </li>
            <li>Still think they are pricey, but most of the reviews on the aftermarkets ones are not great.</li>
            <li>Oral B recommends replacing every 3 months - we think it can safely stretch to 4-5 months, particularly since the heads are somewhat expensive compared to manual toothbrushes with regular replacement.</li>
            <li>Its been hard to find a replacement brush for my Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased it for my 14 year old son and last year when I took him for his 6 month cleaning, the dentist was amazed at the difference in my son&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find these replacement heads at Amazon, because they are very difficult to find locally, and when I do, they are much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>NOT LONG ENLOUGH.....</li>
            <li>I could not find this product in our local retail stores and when I did they were far more expensive than ordering thru this vendor.  </li>
            <li>They may seem expensive, but they LAST, and if you try going back to your old way of brushing, you won&#x27;t be able to stand it.</li>
            <li>Only problem was my Oral B Sonic broke right after I made the purchased, and they have discontinued this item, No More Sonics</li>

            <li> Searching Amazon I found a variety of cheaper options, but most of them seemed to be off-brand and didn&#x27;t have the best reviews.  </li>
            <li> Love the heads, do an excellent job cleaning.  </li>
            <li> and I was THRILLED!    </li>

            <li> I was so delighted to find the bursh heads that I ordered two packages...am covered for the year.  </li>
            <li> I have had my electric toothbrush for 3 or 4 years and it works good.  </li>

            <li> I currently  own the Oral-B Sonic Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Sonic quality is nice.</li>
            <li> but then I found these on Amazon and was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Oral B Sonic for years and these replacement heads worked great, just like the original heads purchased years ago.</li>
            <li> They clean my teeth well and do a great job at stimulating my gums.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a great job getting my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> This particular brush and head are the best of all of the ones I have tried before -</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly, shipped quick and received without a problem.  </li>
            <li> I always like Oral-B, and am very happy with the new brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a very easy product to review.  </li>
            <li> Love being able to purchase them automatically, every three months!  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable, functional, and effective.  </li>
            <li> I suspect there are others just as good, but this one works fine.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads work just fine and do a good job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> it had 2 brush handles and a charger which was perfect since I still had the old charger.  </li>
            <li> Soft bristles and excellent cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The Oral Sonic Complete is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Fits my Oral-B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush perfectly.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good enough for me, dainty, petite</li>
            <li> I own a Sonic care tooth brush too which I think is a better electronic tooth brush, and the heads wear better than the Oral B.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Sonic Replacement Brush Head (3 ct) are a good replacement, Gives that dentist clean feeling after use.</li>
            <li> You CAN NOT beat this price, I have searched fair and wide, and this was def the best price I was able to find.</li>
            <li> I found their quality to be as good as the original heads I had and am pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> I was delighted to find them on Amazon and receive them so quickly.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find I could obtain them so easily.</li>
            <li> I love these Sonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> I hope to find a better deal soon.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads for Oral-B are a much better deal here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Great Price &amp; Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Its on the cheaper side than most electric brushes</li>
            <li> but I think you get more than you spend.</li>
            <li> Gotta love it when a plan comes together.   </li>
            <li> Glad to have found them.  </li>
            <li> I love the Oral B Sonic system.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral B Sonic.  </li>
            <li> The retail stores could never beat this value but since most stores no longer carry them, it&#x27;s a moot point.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I LOVE ORAL B PRODUCTS .</li>
            <li> I was so happy to  find what I needed and at a reasonable price thru amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a satisfied costumer.</li>
            <li> The Amazon deal I got makes the price much more palatable.</li>
            <li> Amazon prime is awesome, it came in 2 days, and I saved 10 dollars from the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> So glad I was shopping at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The latest technology applies rotating heads and these are not compatable.  </li>
            <li> Do NOT trust the reviews that say these fit the Vitality!</li>
            <li> Heck, there was no shelf space for this item in most of the stores.</li>
            <li> After this experience-I will do more shopping on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Better deals can be found at Costco.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> ever since I started to use this product about 3years ago, my dentist is pleased with the result, and I have no cavities.  </li>
            <li> Love the service.</li>
            <li> And, the shipping was free!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results</li>
            <li> Santa brought us our sonic tooth brush and we love it.</li>
            <li> Glad to find the brush head.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love my toothbrush, I have had it for over four years now.</li>
            <li> I love them and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an extremely satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li> thank you fast shipping and great price.  </li>
            <li> I just love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I have my sonic for many years and it is easier to by thru Amazon when you know the style.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;&#x27; know the style when there are so many.</li>
            <li> I feel the brush heads do not hold up for more than  two months.</li>
            <li> I needed replacement heads for my Sonic toothbrush and these definitely fill the bill - great price!</li>
            <li> This product is superb because they last up to 4-5 months before having to change the head on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product ever, too cheap!</li>
            <li> love this tooth brush&#x27; love these heads</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll buy some more when needed.</li>
            <li> Sure wish I could still purchase these in store, but I can&#x27;t find them.  </li>
            <li> Amazon as I had looked unsuccessfully in many stores for these replacements.  </li>

            <li> Glad I found them.</li>
            <li> These brushes fit my Oral-B Sonic Complete brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> let me keep brushing my teeth so that I don&#x27;t end up looking like most of the people in south Indiana.</li>
            <li> My dental check-ups are vastly better than before.  </li>
            <li> My teeth get cleaned better, and faster, and more efficiently.  </li>
            <li> These heads fit perfectly with my Oral-B Sonic Complete electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you know what type of oral b toothbrush you have before you buy any replacement brush.  </li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t need to write so many words to submit this review.</li>
            <li> Very excited to find them at Amazon.com for a resonable price plus FREE shipping!  </li>
            <li> the product is good quality and the price was right.</li>
            <li> And I get good positive feedback when I go for cleanings!</li>
            <li> When I did find one at a local drugstore they wanted more than I paid for 3!!!</li>
            <li> The problem is stores no longer carry this particular replacement since the toothbrush -- which works great - is not this year&#x27;s model.  </li>
            <li> The price was very good compared to Oral B&#x27;s own website (almost double the price) and shipping was free at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This was a very cheap and easy purchase.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find these replacement heads as they are becoming increasingly scarce.</li>
            <li> the toothbrush itself is great, charge lasts a good, long time, &amp; heads are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Nice and cheap....  far better than Ebay!!   </li>
            <li> I can not buy this product in the store anymore and was glad to fine it on line.  </li>
            <li> and it feels like dentist clean after each use!</li>
            <li> Work just fine on my sonic brush and haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and I am very pleased with the toothbrushes and the price I paid for them.</li>
            <li> free shipping makes it ok.  </li>
            <li> The Sonic B Complete is a great toothbrush but the head refills are way overpriced coming up to 7 dollars for each refill head.  </li>
            <li> Glad these were available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and they work great for my Oral B sonic complete.</li>
            <li> I was nervous they wouldnt fit based on some reviews, but they fit no problem!</li>
            <li> These were a good price, and it was very convenient to have them delivered.</li>
            <li> Very relieved to find them and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good product.</li>
            <li> I was SOOO EXCITED to find these on Amazon and that they are available as a subscribe and save product at such a great price!</li>
            <li> The replacement brush heads are better than the original brush head that came with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Make sure the replacement head matches the original.</li>
            <li> Yee-haw, I hope they are able to continue offering this product at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Them came very quickly and at a resonable price.</li>
            <li> and it was so easy.</li>
            <li> There are lots of varieties, and easy to confuse.</li>
            <li> is the house keeping that keeps it clean..:)</li>
            <li> Filling up 14 words about a toothbrush is not as easy as it looks</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and easy to store in bathroom.</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to have a supply of these at a fairly reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find these at Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> They are fine....</li>
            <li> Easy fit.  </li>
            <li> They are exactly the same and work perfectly with mine and my wife&#x27;s Oral B toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> No biggie, they work fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine and arrived on time.  </li>
            <li> Replacements were just fine</li>
            <li> I need \\&quot;soft\\&quot; and these seem to be fine.</li>
            <li> Fine.  </li>
            <li> And can continue using my finely working sonic tooth-brushing engine.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and I am pleased with the performance.  </li>
            <li> Also the 3 brushheads came in with cheap wrapping materials.</li>
            <li> As it doesn&#x27;t fit well to the toothbrush, the vibration of the brushhead also spilled the toothpast everywhere.</li>
            <li> I bought two packages to take advantage of free shipping</li>
            <li> As Braun/Oral-B has marketed newer models, the brush heads for my model are no longer available in retail.  </li>
            <li> free shipping,half the price of stores if you can find it.  </li>
            <li> I thought \\&quot;oral-B\\&quot; meant it would fit my brush, and that \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; referred to the type of head.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I buy Oral B heads in a store they fit my toothbrush.   </li>
            <li> Amazon recommended I buy these Oral B Sonic replacement brush heads for my Oral B Pulsonic toothbrush - but they don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I always receive precisely what I&#x27;ve ordered.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads fit my Braun Oral B Vitality Sonic toothbrush that I was given by my dentist office.  </li>
            <li> It came with a travel case that fit the handle and a brush head conveniently for travel.  </li>
            <li> These are so cheap I couldn&#x27;t resist.  </li>
            <li> In addition they don&#x27;t fit the oral B handle as well as the originals, they are probably meant as a one size fits all arrangement, which they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The shape of it is very streamline making the brushing experience nice.</li>
            <li> I bought some of the brushes made in China for a cheap price and got a cheap product.</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t fall out as they did on the cheap product.</li>
            <li> Now i have three toothbrush heads that don&#x27;t fit and am out my money.</li>
            <li> This is a genuine Oral-B product, not an aftermarket knock-off.  </li>
            <li> These are great replacement heads especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Snug fit</li>
            <li> Then I found this gem, the original Oral-B product at a super duper discount!</li>
            <li> I am always glad that I can reorder replacement heads online easily and don&#x27;t have to scour store shelves to find the exact match.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush head replacement, fitting just the same as the original heads.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to find this because I couldn&#x27;t find the right one in the stores.  </li>
            <li> One thing make sure you get the right name of your tooth brush.</li>
            <li> This oral-b sonic  brush is far superior to the Sonicare by Philips.&lt;br /&gt;Bought these originally for my kids (who are now teens).  </li>
            <li> Buy from amazon, u will save a ton of money and they work fantastic and keeping your teeth shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see it offered on Amazon at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> That being said, these will leave your mouth feeling extremely fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy as I did not have to buy a brand new tooth bush because the retail stores were not stocking the replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe these are the original replacement brushheads.</li>
            <li> Wish I haven&#x27;t thrown away the original one.</li>
            <li> Just like the ones that came with the original toothbrush</li>
            <li> But we were so excited when we discovered they had our toothbrush heads on amazon.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> that I think the original heads had softer bristles.</li>
            <li> Many thanks!</li>
            <li> and they are just like the ones that came with it originally.</li>
            <li> so I was excited when I found them.  </li>
            <li> The price is fine, and the service is quick.</li>
            <li> They work well and keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The brush keeps my teeth amazingly clean.  </li>
            <li> I like the clean feeling</li>
            <li> Product posted in good time but the ultimate nightmare-- didn&#x27;t fit the rechargeable unit I have which says Vitality Sonic</li>
            <li> These fit my Oral-B Sonic Vitality, received them quickly and ordering online was a lot easier than driving around looking for these.</li>
            <li> The brushes contain the famous Oral-B blue indicator bristles that provides a nice reminder of when to replace your brushes.</li>
            <li> Used this toothbrush for YEARS and always a clean bill of tooth health when I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> use all the time and clean the teeth and messages my gums when needed sometimes come off the brush handle</li>
            <li> Clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> These really clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> Dentist always compliments how clean I keep my teeth</li>
            <li> My teeth are clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> My teeth always feel squeaky clean after using them each morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I found the right toothbrush replacements for my sonic toothbrush unit!</li>
            <li> They do a reasonable job in keeping your teeth clean and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> The colors were so much bolder , and the brush heads seemed to rotate to clean better.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who needs healthy teeth and a pretty smile, buy these.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I get them for such a great price and the shipping is amazingly fast, I received them in three days, two days sooner than they said!</li>
            <li> I was very glad to find this as they are no longer available in stores local to me.</li>
            <li> headline and 20 more words is too much of an effortheadline and 20 more words is too much of an effortheadline and 20 more words is too much of an effortheadline and 20 more words is too much of an effortheadline and 20 more words is too much of an effort</li>
            <li> So I am very grateful they are available through Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is only a good thing.</li>
            <li> I was not about to get rid of a perfectly good unit simply because the brushes have been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants better oral health.</li>
            <li> Price is way more reasonable than in the store.</li>
            <li> I love these brush heads with my electric toothbrush, although they are very expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The order was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and was as described.  </li>
            <li> The shipment arrived quickly too.</li>
            <li> I really thought I got a great deal on price, especially since I couldn&#x27;t find the correct heads in the stores</li>
            <li> I could not even find this particular brush head at most stores.</li>
            <li> glad I was able to find these here because I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re actually sold in stores anymore,</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> My refills arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried several different electric toothbrushes, but this is the one we like the best, but wouldn&#x27;t you know, it&#x27;s also the hardest to find.</li>
            <li> I appreciate being able to find replacement brushes for my still working, but older model electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Brushes will last depending on usage, but they do seem to do better than most of the store knockoff brands.</li>
            <li> Better than regular toothbrush in my opinion and love the timer.</li>
            <li> This newer one is better than the older ones.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 packages and they arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> the Oral B brushes are a more recent design than the ones that came with the tooth brush and are actually better at getting into the spaces between teeth, etc.  </li>
            <li> WITHOUT flossing very much too!</li>
            <li> I was excited to find these on subscribe and save and the price was very reasonable in comparison to retail.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the fast delivery and product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> the unit works pretty good and a have definitely saved a bit on the replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fits brush perfectly and I was unable to locate the brush heads locally so was thrilled to be able to find them at the right price.</li>
            <li> I should have checked Amazon FIRST!</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I was happy with my electric toothbrush and did not want to have to buy a new one, but all of my brush heads finally wore out</li>
            <li> These fit well and were very well priced for a 3-pack.</li>
            <li> My daughter goes through a lot of these, now that she has braces, so I am glad Amazon offers them.     </li>
            <li> But... do I get complimented on my smile always?</li>
            <li> Worth every dime.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> A very positive transaction.</li>
            <li> and I received it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads were sent quickly and were just as if I bought them in the store, but they were much cheaper!</li>
            <li> But they were packaged well and price was right.</li>
            <li> The price is right and the ease of ordering will have me purchasing this item again.  </li>
            <li> It is what it says it is, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to &amp; the price is right</li>
            <li> I thought it would fit my Oral-B, but mine is an older one, and I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Certain brushes fit certain model toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the timeliness of receiving the product as well as the quality (as expected)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t last, ended up costing more money because they needed to be replaced about four times more frequently.</li>
            <li> Searched all over for these, hard to find, Amazon had the best price by far.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I would have to buy a new toothbrush that had   replacement heads available in the store.</li>
            <li> Better to buy at CVS or Walgreens and get the right heads or return with no questions asked even with open package.</li>
            <li> However, when I checked with Amazon, the product was very reasonable priced.  </li>
            <li> These refills were very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipper and everything arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Received everything very fast.  </li>
            <li> Glad I&#x27;m able to get them online for a whole lot less than at the store.</li>
            <li> Three new replacement heads still in original packing.  </li>
            <li> They were hard to find, so I was happy to find them.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I needed for my Oral B Vitality Sonic toothbrush, Type 3709.</li>
            <li> I ordered several packs to make sure I never run out again.</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly like the origal brush that came with my unit.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> It matched exactly what I was looking for for my rechargable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> If not all your heads fit all the models, you should make it clear.  </li>
            <li> Amazon had the best price I could find, but at over $6 a brush, they are expensive.</li>
            <li> Have checked many different places</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for the oral-b electronic toothbrush lasts more than the 3 months they suggest (and that is based on brushing twice daily).  </li>
            <li> thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I got our correct replacement the first time with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was having difficulty locally finding the replacement heads for my Sonic Oral B toothbrush, which I love the results that I receive from this product.  </li>
            <li> I would gladly do business with this individual again.</li>
            <li> I have the Sonic Complete system and none of the brushes in the stores fit this unit.  </li>
            <li> Even better, I stopped getting regular cavities.    </li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> for some reason, after i used the first head for a couple weeks, the head wouldn&#x27;t spin anymore; it would just vibrate.  </li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I love the feature that tells you when to switch to the next quarter of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what we were expecting.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered  Exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li> I only spend $15 at most a year on toothbrush replacement heads, which is one purchase a year.  </li>
            <li> Third day I used it, it stopped rotating, cheap springs or something, won&#x27;t purchase again!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve purchased this item before and been burned, as of September 2012 the product being shipped does fit the Oral B Sonic Complete.  </li>
            <li> I always get 6 months or more out of them, but only use it once a day.  </li>
            <li> And I truly would reccomend this product to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because it was exactly what I needed to.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Between all of these items and using them religiously EVERY day my experience in the dentist chair is much much better.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> They were the exact replacement for my electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product turned out to be exactly what I thought it should be.</li>
            <li> I do wish the that the new brush heads were just the brush part as my old one was...just better for the environment, but that&#x27;s me.  </li>
            <li> They arrived earlier than expected and in great condition.</li>
            <li> I finally went to Amazon on line and was able to order the replacement brushes reasonably priced.    </li>
            <li> These replacements are much cheaper than you can get locally and you can set and reset a replacement schedule to save even more.  </li>
            <li> Grateful to be able to save so much money &amp; get a name brand product (rather than generic heads).</li>
            <li> High quality and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find, thrilled I did!</li>
            <li> my dentist even commented that he noticed a positive improvement in staining around the spaces and gums.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to think to check on Amazon, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Figured I&#x27;d save more in the long run... and after about a year of using it...</li>
            <li> Product came when promised, was exactly what I ordered, and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what i ordered in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Plus they ship pretty fast.</li>
            <li> These are the only ones that will fit and are not carried by many local stores.  </li>
            <li> (yes, they are not cheap, but compare to many others, this is not bad).</li>
            <li> Years later, it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Even in the large stores like BJ&#x27;s or Sam&#x27;s club.  </li>
            <li> Not even in the large discount store 1 mile from my home.</li>
            <li> The floss action heads do a great job of cleaning and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this new feature of Amazon - having an item I need regularly sent on a selected schedule!  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used the Sonic Complete System since last summer and have found it made a significant difference from manual toothbrushes - the heads do a great job in dislodging small particles and also seem to help in brightening the teeth.   </li>
            <li> It is working okay, but had a hard time getting the brush to fit on the shaft.</li>
            <li> Three days later I had my much needed brushes and the shipping was FREE.</li>
            <li> :)  At least I can get the refills from a aupplier on Amazon for now, although not with the combined free shipping offer.  </li>
            <li> I have had great success w this brush and am really sorry to see it go.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and quality part.</li>
            <li> My son really likes his sonic brush, and needed a replacement head.</li>
            <li> These are the real deal...love the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this Oral B Vitality Sonic brush for years and really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, would not hesitate to order again.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is much cheaper</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than at Target or Walmart.  </li>
            <li> seems to me to work very well.  </li>
            <li> I found them here at Amazon.com at a much lower price than anywhere else I had searched.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think there is any difference between these and the ones I bought at a store.  </li>
            <li> provides a generic fit.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I&#x27;ve tried the &#x27;generic&#x27; brush heads, but sometime, they don&#x27;t fit correctly, so now,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Much easier (and faster) to order them from Amazon.</li>
            <li> So I am thinking to ditch the whole system and getting the newer ones.</li>
            <li> They fit well and are equal to the originals that came with my gift.</li>
            <li> The price was much cheaper than what I paid for in the stores.</li>
            <li> There is really nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> This item shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> This product works very well cleaning your teeth and massaging your gums.  </li>
            <li> Very durable heads.</li>
            <li> This is a name brand brush for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> I have seen some reviews that say these dont fit properly, these do.</li>
            <li> The Sonic Replacement Brush Heads work really well, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Though the brush itself is somewhat prone to wearing out and the charging system is very hit or miss.</li>
            <li> How much else can be said about a toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I really like the product and would recommend it to anyone as well.  </li>
            <li> FAST shipping too.</li>
            <li> The product is genuine and actually works as ever I remember.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> Have bought several and all of them fit as they should and</li>
            <li> I like these brush heads, they are the only ones that fit my electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I bought mine straight from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I got the Sonic Complete toothbrush as a door prize back in 2008 and have not been able to find replacement toothbrush heads in the store for over a year now.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are thanking me for locating proper fitting brushes again for my Oral B Sonic Complete tooth brush.</li>
            <li> but it seems I replace these heads far more often than I ever replaced regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Nice firm bristles, color change to let you know when you “should” change</li>
            <li> So while the device itself provides good oral care you are forced to overpay dramatically for refills.</li>
            <li> Brush heads fit perfectly on the motorized toothbrush base</li>
            <li> Good value, really, when you consider you can not get a  cleaning equal to this any other way, except by going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Superior to an ordinary electric toothbrush in every way, the Sonic Complete!  </li>
            <li> While the brand name may be expensive, I believe in spending good money on my teeth, they are definately worth investing in!</li>
            <li> These are the brush heads for an older electric toothbrush and this was a good price for this hard to find item</li>
            <li> I am pleased to lower the star ratings on this to warn other customers.  </li>
            <li> My only complaints about the toothbrush heads are that they wear fairly quickly (and you really need to replace it when the toothbursh head is worn) and they are pricey - very pricey in stores.  </li>
            <li> This fits very well and decent price</li>
            <li> I use with a Braun power toothbrush and it gets my teeth clean and flossed at the same time.</li>
            <li> Good price for product;  Brush heads are packaged individually (not in same package containing all three) with disclaimer that \\&quot;packaging may be slightly damaged\\&quot;.   </li>
            <li> This one has a gentle vibrate that allows me to control the motion while it deep cleans better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Sonic Replacement brushes for my Sonic Care Complete were the first I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Pricing allows for more frequent replacment of this now several years old toothbrush that workes well for me.</li>
            <li> love the oran b, but they need to improve their brushes, the brushes on my other tooth brush were much better and did a better job., and they are way too expensive, but all replacement brushes are</li>
            <li> Found a generic version but with the reviews about not staying correctly on the unit or bristles falling out I didn’t want to chance it as I knew these are good quality and have never had problems… not going to mess around with my health.</li>
            <li> and i can feel the difference when brushing my teeth with a new brush head!</li>
            <li> works like it is brand new!  </li>
            <li> Brand new item and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find them on Amazon for basically half the price.</li>
            <li> decent brush heads</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and I will purchase this item again in the future.</li>
            <li> Be sure to select the proper refill for your specific automatic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Decent tooth brush heads.</li>
            <li> I was unable to purchase these replacement heads through my grocery/pharmacy and was pleased to be able to order them online.</li>
            <li> blue &amp;#34;tell-tale&amp;#34; bristles seem to lose their color rather quickly (which is supposed to indicate time for a replacement).  </li>
            <li> I have an older model, close to 6 years, of the Oral-B ultrasounic toothbrush and could no longer find the replacement heads in the stores.</li>
            <li> Oral B has decent quality, but I no longer use their products, would not recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> My main problem with these products are the HIGH costs.  </li>
            <li> I saw the high rating on this product and that made me trust the purchase.  </li>
            <li> So all those high tech ones that rotate don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> There is a high, medium, and massage setting so you can take your pick.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> They last a lot more than 3 months - which is the standard time tooth brush companies tell you to change to a new brush.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the replacement brushhead shafts are in deep blue color, rather than the light blue color that come with the original ones.</li>
            <li> I had to really push down on it, otherwise it has worked fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly want to buy a new electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is an old electric toothbrush by Oral-B, and you can&#x27;t really get it anywhere in store, so the brush head</li>
            <li> These are great but they are too expensive.</li>
            <li> The sonic replacement brush heads provide a great cleaning but can be difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> just like the ones I purchase at the&lt;br /&gt;dentist office, only a little more reasonable!</li>
            <li> But the brush is fairly soft and after only a few weeks it&#x27;s too soft to do any good.  </li>
            <li> this is one of the orginal sonic appliances but as long as I can obtain the brushes (no longer available in stores, hence one is forced to buy a new appliance at a healthy cost)</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I used the mid setting but now use the high setting.  </li>
            <li> The brushes ware out after about a month, which is why new ones need to be purchased and used.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to get a new toothbrush for a lack of replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> the brush heads look like new still</li>
            <li> The order of Oral-B sonic Replacement Brush Heads came on time in brand new condition.</li>
            <li> I figure each brush lasts about 2 weeks before I have to put on a new one.</li>
            <li> After these wear out I&#x27;ll probably have to find a new toothbrush altogether.</li>
            <li> Plus I don&#x27;t have to buy a new powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You buy something that works well and want to continue to use it, but there are always new and improved replacements coming on to the market, so, what is one to do?</li>
            <li> New, in package just as described.</li>
            <li> Just a complete win-win!</li>
            <li> Yes, these are toothbrush heads, so it&#x27;s pretty obvious what you use them for...</li>
            <li> We brought it into our house and changed the old heads for the new ones.  </li>
            <li> LOVE my Oral-B Sonic Complete, but I do not love paying $20+ for 3 replacement brush heads at the store.  </li>
            <li> This is not a very common tip, so I have to order it.  </li>
            <li> Being unable to find these refills near where I live, this is an easy and quick way to obtain them.</li>
            <li> Great price helps during these bad economic times.</li>
            <li> The refills are clearly where the profits are</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who naturally moves my hand in a circular motion when brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed to replace my old, worn out brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems so far.</li>
            <li> I ended up with the Oral B Sonic Complete -</li>
            <li> I have used Oral B Sonic Complete for approx.</li>
            <li> Use of the Oral B Sonic Complete has improved the health of my gums and my teeth have never felt cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this toothbrush that I&#x27;ve had for a few years.</li>
            <li> The brush heads have performed as well as they always have on the Sonic Complete tooth brush.</li>
            <li> + year old mouth intact.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are the correct product for the Sonic Complete toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads work well and lasts a reasonable amount of time(3-4 weeks) but they are over priced when compared to the generic brand which almost performs as well(2-3 weeks).</li>
            <li> I like my old tooth brush and these replacement heads</li>
            <li> The only time I use them is on vacation, since I am very hesitate to bring this along for fear of losing</li>
            <li> They have a regular shape like a real toothbrush,</li>
            <li> Both the price and service offered by this provider is making me smile not only bigger, but brighter!</li>
            <li> The head fits brush very well,  The price is slight higher than Costco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The product is small enough to fit into a standard envelope, but I was sent mine in a cardboard box 30×23×11cm, which annoyed me a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I like the small head size since it is easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> They are the same brand we used to buy in the store just a couple dollars less online for 3 toothbrush heads instead of just the one we used to buy for the same price, which is fabulous!</li>
            <li> The brushes are the same design as the original, and should last just as long as well.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to replace my toothbrush simply because the manufacturer wants me to (they made that clear by limiting the replacement brushes on store shelves), I turned to the &#x27;Net for help.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that they are all the same colour - for families it would be useful for each person to have a different colour toothbrush head</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush a few months ago and was not looking forward to paying the full toothbrush price again for brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten them this way before and will certainly do the same next time I need them.</li>
            <li> Finding the refills on Amazon turned a hard job into an easy one...</li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to get things that are hard to find.</li>
            <li> When the battery in that one finally gave out, I though I would try something new.</li>
            <li> Last year my electric toothbrush broke and I went searching for a new one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great having a line on this product--no longer are these replacement heads found on store shelves, at least, locally, and for the past two or three years.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads for my sonic clean were affordable via this website even less than Wallmart except for the shipping and handling so the next time I will just get them from my local Wallmart.</li>
            <li> My Oral B Sonic Complete recently started konking out on me.  </li>
            <li> Still think they are pricey, but most of the reviews on the aftermarkets ones are not great.</li>
            <li> Oral B recommends replacing every 3 months - we think it can safely stretch to 4-5 months, particularly since the heads are somewhat expensive compared to manual toothbrushes with regular replacement.</li>
            <li> Its been hard to find a replacement brush for my Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased it for my 14 year old son and last year when I took him for his 6 month cleaning, the dentist was amazed at the difference in my son&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find these replacement heads at Amazon, because they are very difficult to find locally, and when I do, they are much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> NOT LONG ENLOUGH.....</li>
            <li> I could not find this product in our local retail stores and when I did they were far more expensive than ordering thru this vendor.  </li>
            <li> They may seem expensive, but they LAST, and if you try going back to your old way of brushing, you won&#x27;t be able to stand it.</li>
            <li> Only problem was my Oral B Sonic broke right after I made the purchased, and they have discontinued this item, No More Sonics</li>
            <li> These are hard to find locally and the price is right on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After I started to use the first toothbrush, it is very obvious to me that the brushhead is very hard, not as soft as the ones that I have been using at all.</li>
            <li> When it came time to buy new brush heads, I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere in a store, so finally decided to let my fingers do the walking and found them on Amazon at half the price of a store.  </li>
            <li> I have an older model tooth brush and these replacements heads are getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the inconvenience associated with it not fitting into my mailbox, using such boxes is very wasteful.  </li>
            <li> They were even the same price as some of the single head packages at my local stores.</li>
            <li> The brush heads have a long life similar to the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize how long it had been since I replaced them until I took a survey that asked when I last replaced my brush heads and realized I was an outlier.  </li>
            <li> The brushes last for a long time and hold up well.</li>
            <li> These brushes seem to last a long time before the wear indicator shows replacement time.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they wear down quickly so you have to replace them often.</li>
            <li> I will need new ones again, as I change them every few months.</li>
            <li> I bought these for FAR less than they were selling for at Target.</li>
            <li> I spent 4 different trips to various stores to find my toothbrush replacements.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding the right brush heads for my Sonic Complete.</li>
            <li> Having no experience with any other toothbrush like this we can only say that it is a big improvement over manual brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find these replacement brush heads so to have them delivered to your home is a real bonus.</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement heads from this particular seller because it was a little cheaper then other sellers at the time.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong one and realized it when they arrived and wouldn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> Shipping time was a bit long IMO.</li>
            <li> I have been brushing my teeth with the Oral B sonic for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The brush itself is a different size and shape than the smaller round heads I presently use, so that was another reason I was looking forward to using these.</li>
            <li> We have no issues with them and as long as the tooth brush keeps working we will keep using these types of brushes.</li>
            <li> I am so annoyed right now.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are getting harder and harder to find in the big box stores</li>
            <li> I can always find hard to get itemsm discontinued items and just plain ole rare items from Amazon.</li>
            <li> ( generic not worth the cash)</li>
            <li> These brush heads are hard to find where I live</li>
            <li> I love the Sonic electric toothbrush, but finding the replacement heads is almost impossible.  </li>
            <li> Local convenience stores were selling replacement heads for $25, but Amazon sold them for a lot less.</li>
            <li> A lot less money than buying them at a big box store.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the stores have quit carrying it in favor of new, more expensive items.  </li>
            <li> They even arrived faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on-time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Having it shipped thru Subscribe and Save not only saves a few cents, but reminds me to change my toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very loose and all it does is vibrate, it doesn&#x27;t spin.  </li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s cleaning was minimal.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to think of anything too exciting to say about toothbrush heads, but my dentist recommends this brand.  </li>
            <li> just beware that this refill will likely NOT fit your vitality sonic.</li>
            <li> It works as expected, just like the ones at the store but cheaper.</li>
            <li> What can I say, works just as expected.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The incorrect brush was sent to me and I was unable to use it, so had to return and pay return postage which does&#x27;nt seem quite fair because it was not my fault the wrong item was sent to me</li>
            <li> This was a big waste of time and money for me so other consumers be forewarned.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads were cheaper than some of the other places.</li>
            <li> I have tried cheaper knock offs and was extremely disatisfied, trashed them and reordered the Oral-B brand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Oral B/Braun has changed the brush design since other reviewers&#x27; comments, so</li>
            <li> and I have been using my last brush head way past its life expectancy.</li>
            <li> i bought this set of replacements on amazon and so far 2 of the 3 heads are useless after only 2-3 weeks use.  </li>
            <li> The price for these has never come down and there is nothing to warrant other than no one else</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth from years of brushing too hard and since using the Ora-B Sonic with sensitive toothpaste there has been a dramatic decrease in hot and cold sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> These are hard to find at my local store.  </li>
            <li> I have had a difficult time finding the correct brush head that will fit on my base unit as no one seems to carry this exact model!</li>
            <li> I hate store shopping, I always end up with more stuff than I went in for.  </li>
            <li> I did subscribe to make the price go down</li>
            <li> The performance will go down dramitically if you use an off brand.</li>
            <li> From now on I will buy tooth brush heads in a store even though that is less convenient for me.</li>
            <li> The dental hygienist commented that my teeth looked cleaner with less plaque than before and asked if I was using an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> One thing less to worry about.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase from Amazon since regular retail is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> arrived in about 3 days or less.</li>
            <li> My dentist saw improvement in my gum line with less tartar.</li>
            <li> And these are less money than paying retail.</li>
            <li> They do fit my toothbrush base (oral B sonic vitality) but don&#x27;t go all the way down</li>
            <li> I still believe they are a little over-priced.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a little buzz when it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li> These refills have become very hard to find in the local stores.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I could not see the fine print description on website and ordered the wrong product.</li>
            <li> That was a waste of money as for as I am concerned</li>
            <li> The 3 replacement heads were not available, so I was mailed 4 replacement heads at no additional charge.</li>
            <li> They arrived within a few days of the order.</li>
            <li> but it does not fit the Vitality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Oral-B Sonic toothbrush for a few years now and use Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save to replace my brushes as needed.</li>
            <li> they are behind lock and key.  </li>
            <li> I notice the brushes are not readily available.  </li>
            <li> These did not fit my oral B vitality toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric toothbrush for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> They are also hard to find due to the model number.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t mess a toothbrush up!  </li>
            <li> 2nd order was on time and less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Getting a little hard to find, and a little pricy if you can still find them at a retail store</li>
            <li> 1st order was a half day late...</li>
            <li> Tired of going to brick and morter stores only to be disappointed I went online to Amazon and found what I had been looking for, purchased it online, and received it as fast as I would have wanted.</li>
            <li> See the other 1 star reviews!!!</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that it&#x27;s difficult to find the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if all electric toothbrushes are like this</li>
            <li> Finally found what I needed (correct refills) after buying the wrong ones in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Difficult item to find at our local stores.  </li>
            <li> No more driving around for me.</li>
            <li> This is the exact product that I have purchased in stores, except: (1) I can no longer find this product in stores (2)</li>
            <li> I had been searching for replacement brush heads at the usual stores since the beginning of the year, and they were always sold out.</li>
            <li> I had to buy the refill heads because they do not sell them on the military base we live on.</li>
            <li> i thought it was just one of the very few defective ones that i was unlucky to get</li>
            <li> Plus, the multipack comes in 3 slightly different colors, meaning that my fiancee and I can share the same base and swtich out the heads.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Sonic replacement heads were hard to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding these replacement toothbrushes in stores.  </li>
            <li> These are hard to get in the store, and I got them cheaper and faster through Amazon.</li>
            <li> (there are hard to find in stores)</li>
            <li> and they are hard to find</li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> Hard to find these as it is a discontinued model.</li>
            <li> This model of toothbrush heads are hard to find in the stores these days.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I brush at least twice a day with my Oral-B electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> /&gt;There should be at least four heads in each package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rate this poorly because it does not fit my toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> It does the job, but very expensive; we are trying to find an alternate source.</li>
            <li> Plus when I found them on Amazon, they were so much less expensive</li>
            <li> And much less expensive than bought in  a store.</li>
            <li> They are impossible to find locally anymore.</li>
            <li> These replacement tooth brush heads for Sonic Vitality are nearly impossible to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> Brush heads that are impossible to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> After being shocked at the price of these refills in the local drugstore</li>
            <li> These are very hard to find in my area</li>
            <li> This is extra text to meet the stupid minimum requirements from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these in the store where I purchased the toothbrush (wally world), so that was frustrating.  </li>
            <li> They were also the least expensive brush heads I could find.  </li>
            <li> but I got tired of running around town to find the ones I needed.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for approximately two years</li>
            <li> We were a little disappointed that none of the stores carry these toothbrush heads for the Oral-B Sonic Toothbrush anymore.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are hard to find in stores and when I do find them they are very expensive.</li>
            <li> I received the toothbrush awhile ago and found it difficult to find the replacements.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> *should* be cheaper, but nope, it&#x27;s expensive....</li>
            <li> It randomly shuts off, and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even turn on.  </li>
            <li> I have seen it randomly turn on as well.  </li>
            <li> I used to use each one longer than recommended  because they were so expensive.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find the head replacement as this seems to be a discontinued toothbrush model.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the design of the Philips product leads to mold &amp; mildew growing in the toothbrush head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you followed this indication, you would be replacing these rather expensive heads way too often.</li>
            <li> But sad to say, this toothbrush replacement has been discontinued and I cannot find anything to replace it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the cheaper brand and now very sorry.</li>
            <li> I searched all over for this product and every place I checked, the product was very expensive.  </li>
            <li> These replacement heads seem impossible to find in the market place.</li>
            <li> I have really bad teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I saw the price in the drug store for he Oral-B Sonic Replacement Brush Heads.   </li>
            <li> Frustrated and upset.</li>
            <li> I always purchase the replacement heads here as they are too difficult to find, and when you do, outrageously priced....</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bummed :(</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointment on the purchase!</li>
            <li> Some of the prices were outrageous but not at Amazon.com.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome replacement for cheap!</li>
            <li> Just received the replacement brush heads for my Oral-B automatic toothbrush. I noticed that the replacement brushhead shafts are in deep blue color, rather than the light blue color that come with the original ones. Also the 3 brushheads came in with cheap wrapping materials. After I started to use the first toothbrush, it is very obvious to me that the brushhead is very hard, not as soft as the ones that I have been using at all. As it doesn&#x27;t fit well to the toothbrush, the vibration of the brushhead also spilled the toothpast everywhere. I can&#x27;t believe these are the original replacement brushheads. Wish I haven&#x27;t thrown away the original one. Very disappointment on the purchase!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and quality part.</li>
            <li> I always like Oral-B, and am very happy with the new brushes. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs healthy teeth and a pretty smile, buy these.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I love these Sonic brush heads. They work well and keep my teeth clean. I will buy them again. The downfall is the price. I hope to find a better deal soon.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads for Oral-B are a much better deal here on Amazon.  I have it set up for them to be delivered on a regular basis which saves me from having to worry about their replacement.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered the cheaper brand and now very sorry. That was a waste of money as for as I am concerned</li>
            <li> Both, the toothbrush and replacement brush are excellent products.  I tried to buy replacement brushes locally but had no luck.  I finally went to Amazon on line and was able to order the replacement brushes reasonably priced.    John S., Lake Hiawatha, N.J.</li>
            <li> This set of buush heads is about $30.00 at the drug store. They are also hard to find due to the model number. Both the price and service offered by this provider is making me smile not only bigger, but brighter!</li>
            <li> My son really likes his sonic brush, and needed a replacement head. It came just in time!</li>
            <li> Not wanting to replace my toothbrush simply because the manufacturer wants me to (they made that clear by limiting the replacement brushes on store shelves), I turned to the &#x27;Net for help. There they were. Thank you Al Gore!</li>
            <li> Oral-B Sonic Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)     Great Price &amp; Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> I searched all over for this product and every place I checked, the product was very expensive.  However, when I checked with Amazon, the product was very reasonable priced.  Overall, I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The price was lower than retail stores. The order was delivered quickly. I am completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> After being shocked at the price of these refills in the local drugstore I was glad to find them on Amazon for basically half the price. I bought two packages to take advantage of free shipping so it was like getting 6 heads for the price of 3. They were exactly what I needed for my Oral B Vitality Sonic toothbrush, Type 3709. They even arrived faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered!!!</li>
            <li> Works well or so my son says. He ask for this one Christmas for a gift and I got him the brush and some replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Finally! I found the right toothbrush replacements for my sonic toothbrush unit! I have had a difficult time finding the correct brush head that will fit on my base unit as no one seems to carry this exact model! I love this model! I ordered several packs to make sure I never run out again. This brush is exactly like the origal brush that came with my unit. The brush keeps my teeth amazingly clean.  Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> The Oral- B Sonic replacement brush heads were perfect.. no damage or used looking brushes.. I will def purchase more!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Its on the cheaper side than most electric brushes but I think you get more than you spend. I reccomend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  As Braun/Oral-B has marketed newer models, the brush heads for my model are no longer available in retail.  So I am very grateful they are available through Amazon!</li>
            <li> got it today...free shipping,half the price of stores if you can find it.  It definitely works with Vitality Sonic series (3737).  Gotta love it when a plan comes together.   Just got order #2...1st order was a half day late...free shipping makes it ok.  2nd order was on time and less expensive.  These are the real deal...love the price.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and was as described.  It matched exactly what I was looking for for my rechargable toothbrush.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Shipping was prompt and the product is the same as you would buy at your local Walgreens for $27.00. Great price helps during these bad economic times.</li>
            <li> I rate this poorly because it does not fit my toothbrush.    I thought \\&quot;oral-B\\&quot; meant it would fit my brush, and that \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; referred to the type of head.  I did not see anything that said \\&quot;this brush head only fits the sonic style oral-b\\&quot;  and because all the models I have ever had and the models my friends and family have take the same brush heads. Whenever I buy Oral B heads in a store they fit my toothbrush.   Therefore, I will describe this site and/or this brush \\&quot;not user friendly\\&quot;. If not all your heads fit all the models, you should make it clear.  This was a big waste of time and money for me so other consumers be forewarned.  I saw the high rating on this product and that made me trust the purchase.  I am pleased to lower the star ratings on this to warn other customers.  From now on I will buy tooth brush heads in a store even though that is less convenient for me.</li>
            <li> I got the Sonic Complete toothbrush as a door prize back in 2008 and have not been able to find replacement toothbrush heads in the store for over a year now.  I had enough supply to get me through and recently opened my last one.  I was SOOO EXCITED to find these on Amazon and that they are available as a subscribe and save product at such a great price!</li>
            <li> After driving all over town and wasting time looking for replacement brushes at the wholesale clubs, big box stores, and local drug stores I decided to check Amazon. Viola! Three days later I had my much needed brushes and the shipping was FREE. I should have checked Amazon FIRST! I have used this Oral B Vitality Sonic brush for years and really like it. I don&#x27;t know why retailers are no longer stocking the replacements.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found them.  Great experience.</li>
            <li> Amazon recommended I buy these Oral B Sonic replacement brush heads for my Oral B Pulsonic toothbrush - but they don&#x27;t fit. The Sonic is very different to the Pulsonic and brush heads can not be interchanged.[[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> We use this brush with Jason&#x27;s pepermint toothpaste and it works great! The Jason&#x27;s toothpaste also whitens and polishes your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Jesus&#x27; Blessings and Peace</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t mess a toothbrush up!  They are fine....just like the ones I purchase at the&lt;br /&gt;dentist office, only a little more reasonable!</li>
            <li> I love the Oral B Sonic system. The brushes work well, but they are pricey. Amazon had the best price I could find, but at over $6 a brush, they are expensive.</li>
            <li> Commending on prompt delivery.  Great to get this type item on line.  I hate store shopping, I always end up with more stuff than I went in for.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Thank you for making this more affordable!  Have checked many different places and they wanted way more than you!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these in the store where I purchased the toothbrush (wally world), so that was frustrating.  Why sell a product that needs refills if you aren&#x27;t going to provide the refills?  :)  At least I can get the refills from a aupplier on Amazon for now, although not with the combined free shipping offer.  The company shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> very pleased with the replacement brush heads. I received the toothbrush awhile ago and found it difficult to find the replacements.</li>
            <li> Superior to an ordinary electric toothbrush in every way, the Sonic Complete!  These refills were very reasonably priced.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> So happy I don&#x27;t have to throw away a perfectly good electric toothbrush.  These replacement heads were no where to be found in my area so I am happy that the toothbrush can still be used for a while longer.</li>
            <li> The dental hygienist commented that my teeth looked cleaner with less plaque than before and asked if I was using an electric toothbrush. I said yes and she told me to keep using it. Local convenience stores were selling replacement heads for $25, but Amazon sold them for a lot less. The shipment arrived quickly too.</li>
            <li> These replacements are much cheaper than you can get locally and you can set and reset a replacement schedule to save even more.  I strongly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find these.  I have been looking for a while.  this was a good price.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral B Sonic.  I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 5 years.  My only gripe is that it&#x27;s difficult to find the replacement heads.  Luckily,I found them at a great price at Amazon.com.  The retail stores could never beat this value but since most stores no longer carry them, it&#x27;s a moot point.</li>
            <li> Item ordered was item received.  Three new replacement heads still in original packing.  Easy fit.  Shipping time was a bit long IMO.</li>
            <li> This is a very easy product to review.  There is a consistency in Oral-B products which defies criticism.  I always receive precisely what I&#x27;ve ordered.  It never varies.  This is only a good thing.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for the oral-b electronic toothbrush lasts more than the 3 months they suggest (and that is based on brushing twice daily).  They do a reasonable job in keeping your teeth clean and refreshing.  Also good value for the money by purchasing via amazon.com.</li>
            <li> These refills have become very hard to find in the local stores.  Had to go to Amazon to find the product.  Was glad to find it, but sad to pay additional shipping to receive the product.  Brush holds up well with daily brushing!</li>
            <li> This is an old electric toothbrush by Oral-B, and you can&#x27;t really get it anywhere in store, so the brush head *should* be cheaper, but nope, it&#x27;s expensive.... decent brush heads though</li>
            <li> My item was shipped promptly &amp; arrived in good condition.  It does a great job  &amp; I think is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> This model fits the Sonic Vitality toothbrush.  Offered at the best price on the internet and inside stores.  Get them while they last, and save an extra 15% with Amazon&#x27;s subscribe &amp; save offer.</li>
            <li> I was actually super happy when I got the items because it fit perfectly and i can feel the difference when brushing my teeth with a new brush head!</li>
            <li> I was so delighted to find the bursh heads that I ordered two packages...am covered for the year.  Finding the refills on Amazon turned a hard job into an easy one...</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Oral-B Sonic Complete, but I do not love paying $20+ for 3 replacement brush heads at the store.  Searching Amazon I found a variety of cheaper options, but most of them seemed to be off-brand and didn&#x27;t have the best reviews.  Then I found this gem, the original Oral-B product at a super duper discount! Yee-haw, I hope they are able to continue offering this product at such a great price.</li>
            <li> This brush is not going to do all your work for you.  You still have to work it into all the crevices you can find, but the vibrations help loosen the stuff that ought not to be there, and they stimulate the gums somewhat.  Dentists say you should change your brush after several months.  Some of the bristles change color from blue to white when it&#x27;s time to make the switch.</li>
            <li> I could not find this product in our local retail stores and when I did they were far more expensive than ordering thru this vendor.  I am a very satisfied customer.  Product arrived on-time and as expected.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find at my local store.  Love being able to purchase them automatically, every three months!  One thing less to worry about.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before. Great price for the replacement heads as I have the electric toothbrush. Fast delivery, would not hesitate to order again. The 3 replacement heads were not available, so I was mailed 4 replacement heads at no additional charge. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Being unable to find these refills near where I live, this is an easy and quick way to obtain them. They arrived within a few days of the order. I&#x27;ve gotten them this way before and will certainly do the same next time I need them.</li>
            <li> One week from order to use. They were also the least expensive brush heads I could find.  What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase from Amazon since regular retail is ridiculous.  Delivery was quick and I will purchase this item again in the future.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. Not as fancy as the competition&#x27;s toothbrush heads, but it is what it is.</li>
            <li> My teeth are thanking me for locating proper fitting brushes again for my Oral B Sonic Complete tooth brush. Happy!</li>
            <li> I ordered the brush heads for the sonic vitality toothbrush.  The replacement brush heads are better than the original brush head that came with the toothbrush.  The product arrived quickly and I am pleased with the performance.  I like the clean feeling it gives my teeth.</li>
            <li> Shopped around at all the stores in my area and even with shipping, these replacement heads were the cheapest. They were even the same price as some of the single head packages at my local stores. Work great. Will buy again at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who naturally moves my hand in a circular motion when brushing my teeth. So all those high tech ones that rotate don&#x27;t work for me. This one has a gentle vibrate that allows me to control the motion while it deep cleans better than a regular brush. I recommend it to anyone who has a similar brushing style.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002M5JO8 Oral-B Sonic Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; this is one of the orginal sonic appliances but as long as I can obtain the brushes (no longer available in stores, hence one is forced to buy a new appliance at a healthy cost) I will continue to use it. Works great. I was pleased with the fast delivery and product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This was a very cheap and easy purchase. It got here in a timely manner. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> The brushes ware out after about a month, which is why new ones need to be purchased and used.</li>
            <li> I always purchase the replacement heads here as they are too difficult to find, and when you do, outrageously priced....thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> this watch was a surprise present for my wife, she loves it so that&#x27;s good enough for me, dainty, petite</li>
            <li> I love this new feature of Amazon - having an item I need regularly sent on a selected schedule!  It makes it so easy to get things that are hard to find.</li>
            <li> These brush heads were cheaper than some of the other places. I have had my electric toothbrush for 3 or 4 years and it works good.  Good Product amazon.    Thank You,  Alicia Whittington</li>
            <li> We looked in all the local stores for this product and no one had it.  They were even out of stock on the Oral B site.  You can always find what you are looking for at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ORAL B PRODUCTS . THEY WORK GREAT FOR ME . I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE . BUY IT .</li>
            <li> Be sure to select the proper refill for your specific automatic toothbrush.  I got our correct replacement the first time with Amazon.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> These are great brush heads. They last a lot more than 3 months - which is the standard time tooth brush companies tell you to change to a new brush. I brush at least twice a day with my Oral-B electric toothbrush and I get about 5 months per head (sometimes longer). They clean my teeth well and do a great job at stimulating my gums. These brush heads are hard to find in stores and when I do find them they are very expensive. Amazon&#x27;s price is much cheaper so I always get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have an Oral-B S-200 tooth brush and needed a replacement brush. These fit well and were very well priced for a 3-pack. The brushes are the same design as the original, and should last just as long as well. Very good product.</li>
            <li> These are just as advertised and for a great price and with free delivery.  It is much cheaper than at Target or Walmart.  Just a complete win-win!</li>
            <li> I was looking for this product in stores and couldn&#x27;t find it,  so I thought I would have to buy a new toothbrush that had   replacement heads available in the store. I was so happy to  find what I needed and at a reasonable price thru amazon.  I&#x27;m a satisfied costumer.</li>
            <li> Excellent....easy to replace......3 count will get me from dentist visit to dentist visit.....works like it is brand new!  couldn&#x27;t find in the stores so amazon pulls through once again</li>
            <li> Product posted in good time but the ultimate nightmare-- didn&#x27;t fit the rechargeable unit I have which says Vitality Sonic</li>
            <li> I have always liked the Oral B products and the sonic version of the toothbrush seems to me to work very well.  My only complaints about the toothbrush heads are that they wear fairly quickly (and you really need to replace it when the toothbursh head is worn) and they are pricey - very pricey in stores.  The Amazon deal I got makes the price much more palatable.</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement heads, and they arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  Saved me a trip to the store, where they don&#x27;t always have these replacement heads in stock</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush a few months ago and was not looking forward to paying the full toothbrush price again for brushes. Amazon prime is awesome, it came in 2 days, and I saved 10 dollars from the local drugstore. I did subscribe to make the price go down even lower - great! The toothbrush itself and the brushes are good for a low-cost sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was having difficulty locally finding the replacement heads for my Sonic Oral B toothbrush, which I love the results that I receive from this product.  I found them here at Amazon.com at a much lower price than anywhere else I had searched. Received them within a very short time and look forward to receiving them on the automatic delivery.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered timely and in great condition. I would gladly do business with this individual again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these Oral B brush heads in the store any longer .So I was thrilled to find them on line.Them came very quickly and at a resonable price.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the timeliness of receiving the product as well as the quality (as expected) Would order again from this company</li>
            <li> I ordered these replacement heads from this particular seller because it was a little cheaper then other sellers at the time. It took about 3 weeks to be delivered. I guess if you don&#x27;t mind waiting, by all means....</li>
            <li> Love the heads, do an excellent job cleaning.  Found at retail stores for double the price amazon has them for.  Buy from amazon, u will save a ton of money and they work fantastic and keeping your teeth shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> I like my toothbrush and these heads. My only complaint is that they wear down quickly so you have to replace them often. I&#x27;m not sure if all electric toothbrushes are like this but it seems I replace these heads far more often than I ever replaced regular toothbrushes. Good product though and does a great job cleaning.</li>
            <li> Finally found what I needed (correct refills) after buying the wrong ones in the stores.  I guess you can find refills at some of the \\&quot;Big Box Stores,\\&quot; but I got tired of running around town to find the ones I needed.  Works for me!</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed to replace my old, worn out brush heads. It was delivered in a timely manner and in good, working condition. I had no problems.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for these replacement heads for a couple years, being very frugal with the few I had left.  I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to think to check on Amazon, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  I thought I was going to have to get a new toothbrush for a lack of replacement heads.  I really don&#x27;t think there is any difference between these and the ones I bought at a store.  I am very happy with them.  They fit my toothbrush perfectly.</li>
            <li> These are perfect, have been looking for replacements forever. So glad I was shopping at Amazon.  I really thought I got a great deal on price, especially since I couldn&#x27;t find the correct heads in the stores, I will definately purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> Obtained product in a timely maner. Good product</li>
            <li> The Sonic B Complete is a great toothbrush but the head refills are way overpriced coming up to 7 dollars for each refill head.  These are not the upgraded motorized heads. They are just a regular brush that fits onto the motorized section.  The price for these has never come down and there is nothing to warrant other than no one else provides a generic fit.  The latest technology applies rotating heads and these are not compatable.  So while the device itself provides good oral care you are forced to overpay dramatically for refills.</li>
            <li> Decent tooth brush heads. I own a Sonic care tooth brush too which I think is a better electronic tooth brush, and the heads wear better than the Oral B.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the Sonicare toothbrush, but switched to Oral-B sonic when my Sonicare finally conked out after 6 or 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I switched is because I was spending about $25 a pop for  only 2 replacement brushes for Sonicare and Oral-B was around $20 for 3 brushes. Figured I&#x27;d save more in the long run... and after about a year of using it... the unit works pretty good and a have definitely saved a bit on the replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good value... I have it on subscription now.</li>
            <li> These fit my Oral-B Sonic Vitality, received them quickly and ordering online was a lot easier than driving around looking for these.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get ripped off my Walgreens or Fred Meyers, buy the replacement brush heads here on Amazon! They are exactly the same and work perfectly with mine and my wife&#x27;s Oral B toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Difficult item to find at our local stores.  My daughter goes through a lot of these, now that she has braces, so I am glad Amazon offers them.     Very fast shipper and everything arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Do NOT trust the reviews that say these fit the Vitality! THEY DON&#x27;T!! See the other 1 star reviews!!! I am so annoyed right now.</li>
            <li> I love my oral-b sonic toothbrush!  These brush heads are getting harder and harder to find in the big box stores so I am so glad that Amazon carries them!  They last you 3 months each (or longer if you prefer-but I like to change out as recommended).  So, all in all, it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> I can not buy this product in the store anymore and was glad to fine it on line.  It came promptly after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Sonic replacement heads were hard to find in the stores.  These were a good price, and it was very convenient to have them delivered.</li>
            <li> Purchasing a 3 pack is definately the way to go!  No need to look up the proper replacement the next time you need it and I won&#x27;t overuse the worn out brush as I did this time.</li>
            <li> Three heads in the package, that&#x27;s great but it does not fit the Vitality. So i guess since i opened the pkg, will have to throw out. Better to buy at CVS or Walgreens and get the right heads or return with no questions asked even with open package.</li>
            <li> I had looked all over town for these replacement heads. Heck, there was no shelf space for this item in most of the stores. When I did find one at a local drugstore they wanted more than I paid for 3!!! Glad these were available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find refills for our Oral B Sonic replacement and to top it off, the prices were fantastic.  So thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> After this experience-I will do more shopping on Amazon. I got a great price on these brushes-the best yet. I loved the fast shipping &amp; excellent service. I am very impressed.I do alot of shopping on line and will start checking out Amazon FIRST-Thanks!</li>
            <li> perfect replacements for the original.  Plus, the multipack comes in 3 slightly different colors, meaning that my fiancee and I can share the same base and swtich out the heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Oral-B Sonic toothbrush for a few years now and use Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save to replace my brushes as needed. The brushes contain the famous Oral-B blue indicator bristles that provides a nice reminder of when to replace your brushes. These brushes get the job done.</li>
            <li> These are great but they are too expensive. Better deals can be found at Costco.</li>
            <li> After searching retail outlets for over a month with no luck, my wife suggested going online to buy replacement toothbrush heads for my Oral B.  Amazon had them at a very good price, and they were delivered in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I can not find these replacement toothbrush heads anywhere except on Amazon. I get them for such a great price and the shipping is amazingly fast, I received them in three days, two days sooner than they said!</li>
            <li> I have been hunting around to find these replacement brushes in various stores to no avail.  I have the Sonic Complete system and none of the brushes in the stores fit this unit.  Plus when I found them on Amazon, they were so much less expensive then what I had been seeing and I was THRILLED!    Great shopping experience.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> works great. Used this toothbrush for YEARS and always a clean bill of tooth health when I go to the dentist. WITHOUT flossing very much too!</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I&#x27;ve tried the &#x27;generic&#x27; brush heads, but sometime, they don&#x27;t fit correctly, so now,&lt;br /&gt;I stay with Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Product came when promised, was exactly what I ordered, and was reasonably priced. This was my second purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> Its been hard to find a replacement brush for my Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  This fits very well and decent price (yes, they are not cheap, but compare to many others, this is not bad). Received everything very fast.  I will probably buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric toothbrush years ago on the recommendation of my dentist.  Years later, it&#x27;s still going strong.  Even better, I stopped getting regular cavities.    The brush heads have a long life similar to the toothbrush.  I didn&#x27;t even realize how long it had been since I replaced them until I took a survey that asked when I last replaced my brush heads and realized I was an outlier.  So I&#x27;ve ordered another batch.      I use one brushhead and change it to another for my toddler son to use.  Effective and and long-lasting.  I can&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding these replacement toothbrushes in stores.  I looked on-line and found them.  Some of the prices were outrageous but not at Amazon.com.  The shipping was very fast and I am very pleased with the toothbrushes and the price I paid for them.</li>
            <li> I could not even find this particular brush head at most stores. The one store that I found them wanted $27.00 for 2 heads. You can&#x27;t beat the price here.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these replacements in stores anymore so bought these on amazon. Good price and fits my Vitality Sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for.  It fits perfectly and works wonderful.  I have not had any problems so far. You CAN NOT beat this price, I have searched fair and wide, and this was def the best price I was able to find.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there to say? It&#x27;s a toothbrush replacement! Just like the ones that come with the toothbrush. Having it shipped thru Subscribe and Save not only saves a few cents, but reminds me to change my toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong one and realized it when they arrived and wouldn&#x27;t fit.  But they were packaged well and price was right.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonic electric toothbrush, but finding the replacement heads is almost impossible.  Glad I&#x27;m able to get them online for a whole lot less than at the store.</li>
            <li> Good price for product;  Brush heads are packaged individually (not in same package containing all three) with disclaimer that \\&quot;packaging may be slightly damaged\\&quot;.   Mine however are o.k.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time just as advertised.  A very positive transaction.</li>
            <li> ever since I started to use this product about 3years ago, my dentist is pleased with the result, and I have no cavities.  I am glad to have it!</li>
            <li> i bought this set of replacements on amazon and so far 2 of the 3 heads are useless after only 2-3 weeks use.  for some reason, after i used the first head for a couple weeks, the head wouldn&#x27;t spin anymore; it would just vibrate.  i thought it was just one of the very few defective ones that i was unlucky to get so i threw it away.  i opened a second one and the same thing happened after just about the same amount of time (2 weeks).  the brush heads look like new still but it&#x27;s very loose and all it does is vibrate, it doesn&#x27;t spin.  beware- do not buy these on amazon, buy them at your local walmart or target instead.</li>
            <li> My Oral B Sonic Complete recently started konking out on me.  It randomly shuts off, and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even turn on.  I have seen it randomly turn on as well.  I have had it for about 2 years, I think I have to call the manufacturer.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Besides that, the toothbrush is great.</li>
            <li> This was the only place I could find this specific head for my electric toothbrush.  Works perfectly and my teeth are clean.  No complaints here.</li>
            <li> These are hard to get in the store, and I got them cheaper and faster through Amazon. Love the service.</li>
            <li> I need these and where I purchase supplies (brick and mortar store) they are behind lock and key.  It takes forever to get staff to get the key, etc.  Much easier (and faster) to order them from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best price on these replacement brushes that I&#x27;ve found any where. And, the shipping was free!</li>
            <li> I have been brushing my teeth with the Oral B sonic for a long time.  I am pleased with the results</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit my Braun Oral B Vitality Sonic toothbrush that I was given by my dentist office.  Very good deal!</li>
            <li> The order of Oral-B sonic Replacement Brush Heads came on time in brand new condition. (there are hard to find in stores) The packaging came undamaged. You can order with confidence.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised.  Way over priced, but that&#x27;s Oral B.</li>
            <li> I could not find these retired toothbrush heads in the stores. I was delighted to find them on Amazon and receive them so quickly.</li>
            <li> I spent 4 different trips to various stores to find my toothbrush replacements. This was the only place I found them and it was so easy. No more driving around for me.</li>
            <li> My hygienist always comments on how good my teeth and gums look. She can always tell which of her patients use a sonic toothbrush vs a manual toothbrush. Definitely recommend.   Do be cautious when buying replacement heads. Make sure the replacement head matches the original. There are lots of varieties, and easy to confuse.</li>
            <li> Santa brought us our sonic tooth brush and we love it. The problem is stores no longer carry this particular replacement since the toothbrush -- which works great - is not this year&#x27;s model.  Glad to find the brush head.</li>
            <li> After my dentist hygienist suggested the Oral B Sonic I purchased it and have been very pleased. The dentist has noted that I don&#x27;t have a lot of plaque which is a noted improvement. I love this product.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but very expensive; we are trying to find an alternate source.</li>
            <li> It is still too pricey, I found the newer Oral-B auto tooth brush&#x27;s replacement part is cheaper.  So I am thinking to ditch the whole system and getting the newer ones.</li>
            <li> Yes, these are toothbrush heads, so it&#x27;s pretty obvious what you use them for...glad I was able to find these here because I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re actually sold in stores anymore, and I&#x27;m not throwing out a perfectly good working electric toothbrush just because they decided to make a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> Just like the ones that came with the original toothbrush</li>
            <li> I love my toothbrush, I have had it for over four years now. I have to say that the replacement head brushes are a lot of money. But... do I get complimented on my smile always? Yes, yes I do :D</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the order &amp;  delivery time of this product. I received exactly what i ordered in a very timely fashion. And much less expensive than bought in  a store. Keep up the good work.  Barb</li>
            <li> I thought it would fit my Oral-B, but mine is an older one, and I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. Before I purchased this toothbrush, I used a regular Oral-B toothbrush with the rotating heads. When the battery in that one finally gave out, I though I would try something new. This toothbrush does a great job getting my teeth clean. It leaves your mouth tingling when you are done. There is a high, medium, and massage setting so you can take your pick. The end result is definitely cleaner teeth. This toothbrush is worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> Last year my electric toothbrush broke and I went searching for a new one.  I ended up with the Oral B Sonic Complete - it had 2 brush handles and a charger which was perfect since I still had the old charger.  It came with a travel case that fit the handle and a brush head conveniently for travel.  When it came time to buy new brush heads, I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere in a store, so finally decided to let my fingers do the walking and found them on Amazon at half the price of a store.  This particular brush and head are the best of all of the ones I have tried before - I love them and my dentist even commented that he noticed a positive improvement in staining around the spaces and gums.  I will probably never buy these in a store again.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I wanted.  It arrives on time as promised.  I have used Oral B Sonic Complete for approx. 5 years and will continue to do so.  I recently purchased it for my 14 year old son and last year when I took him for his 6 month cleaning, the dentist was amazed at the difference in my son&#x27;s teeth.  My son&#x27;s cleaning was minimal.  I&#x27;m an extremely satisfied customer.  Thank you Oral B and Amazon for carrying this product.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Sonic Replacement brushes for my Sonic Care Complete were the first I&#x27;ve purchased. They fit well and are equal to the originals that came with my gift. I still believe they are a little over-priced.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. Unfortunately I could not see the fine print description on website and ordered the wrong product. When I contacted amazon to return they handled the situation promptly and efficiently. Will do business with this company again.</li>
            <li> After struggling to find the replacement heads locally, I finally turned to Amazon to find what I was looking for. The items arrived very quickly and in great shape. The price was very good compared to Oral B&#x27;s own website (almost double the price) and shipping was free at Amazon.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads are name brand Oral B as advertised! If your thinking about getting a knock off brand replacement brush head, please don&#x27;t!!! You&#x27;re Oral B toothbrush was made to be used with Oral B brush heads. The performance will go down dramitically if you use an off brand. That being said, these will leave your mouth feeling extremely fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> Just what I was Looking for great price.  these you just can not find in the store and I am so happy I can find them here.  keep them coming.  thank you fast shipping and great price.  Hope my toothbrush doesn&#x27;t give out on me. thank you</li>
            <li> This is the exact product that I have purchased in stores, except: (1) I can no longer find this product in stores (2) The price was much cheaper than what I paid for in the stores. Overall I am very happy as I did not have to buy a brand new tooth bush because the retail stores were not stocking the replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> I just love this tooth brush. I had to buy the refill heads because they do not sell them on the military base we live on. The only problem is the shipping. I had to send them to a friend who had to send them to me because the company didn&#x27;t ship APO.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads for my sonic clean were affordable via this website even less than Wallmart except for the shipping and handling so the next time I will just get them from my local Wallmart.</li>
            <li> I needed brush refill. Amazon, even with postage, was cheaper than any of my stores even on sale!!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, functional, and effective.  Using the discoloration of the bristles as life indicator is brilliant and useful.  3 ct. package is affordable.  There is really nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> This item shipped really fast. I fits perfectly and a much better price than in the store.  Definently a good buy.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush for problems with my gums.  Use of the Oral B Sonic Complete has improved the health of my gums and my teeth have never felt cleaner.  I love the feature that tells you when to switch to the next quarter of your mouth.  When I first used it, I used the mid setting but now use the high setting.  The massage feature is also nice.  My husband and I both use the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product works very well cleaning your teeth and massaging your gums.  I have found it to work just as well as those that are much more expensive.  My refills arrived quickly.  I will order them again from Amazon.con in the future.</li>
            <li> Difficult to think of anything too exciting to say about toothbrush heads, but my dentist recommends this brand.  My only criticism is that they are all the same colour - for families it would be useful for each person to have a different colour toothbrush head so they do not get mixed up.  The product is small enough to fit into a standard envelope, but I was sent mine in a cardboard box 30×23×11cm, which annoyed me a great deal.  Aside from the inconvenience associated with it not fitting into my mailbox, using such boxes is very wasteful.  Also, the P&amp;P charge was about $5.</li>
            <li> Very good.I have my sonic for many years and it is easier to by thru Amazon when you know the style.Keep the box and you&#x27;&#x27; know the style when there are so many.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what we were expecting. It was the perfect fit. I have even added a subscription to it to ensure that I don&#x27;t miss out on having our refils when needed.  I was very glad to find this as they are no longer available in stores local to me.</li>
            <li> I feel the brush heads do not hold up for more than  two months. NOT LONG ENLOUGH.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There should be at least four heads in each package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other wise everything is satisfactory&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this toothbrush that I&#x27;ve had for a few years. I am always glad that I can reorder replacement heads online easily and don&#x27;t have to scour store shelves to find the exact match. I have tried cheaper knock offs and was extremely disatisfied, trashed them and reordered the Oral-B brand. While the brand name may be expensive, I believe in spending good money on my teeth, they are definately worth investing in!</li>
            <li> These are so cheap I couldn&#x27;t resist.  They do fit my toothbrush base (oral B sonic vitality) but don&#x27;t go all the way down and there&#x27;s a little buzz when it&#x27;s on.  No biggie, they work fine.  But the brush is fairly soft and after only a few weeks it&#x27;s too soft to do any good.  I figure each brush lasts about 2 weeks before I have to put on a new one.</li>
            <li> I was misled to believe this was the standare three pack.  But there was only one brush head in the package.</li>
            <li> I suspect there are others just as good, but this one works fine.  It is the kind that fits my oral-b rechargeable.</li>
            <li> A very good buy!  I needed replacement heads for my Sonic toothbrush and these definitely fill the bill - great price!</li>
            <li> love taking care of my teeth!  this stimulation makes your mouth feel like you&#x27;ve just left the dental office after your cleaning!</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and excellent cleaning.  I have sensitive teeth from years of brushing too hard and since using the Ora-B Sonic with sensitive toothpaste there has been a dramatic decrease in hot and cold sensitivity.  Do NOT use whitening tooth paste even if it is for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; teeth.  They all have some amount of pumice and it would be like putting a belt sander to your teeth.</li>
            <li> This product fits mt brush perfectly, it is the origina, and I am very happy with it. And I get good positive feedback when I go for cleanings!</li>
            <li> Never try to buy the off brand ones-they just don&#x27;t work as well.  The floss action heads do a great job of cleaning and last a long time.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads were a fraction of the price in the retail store.  Grateful to be able to save so much money &amp; get a name brand product (rather than generic heads).</li>
            <li> While the packaging had been cheaped out, the bristles hold up well to justify the price, and the price was under the competitors that I researched.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  Unfortunately, the stores have quit carrying it in favor of new, more expensive items.  My product is still in good condition so I need the replacement heads, and found them on Amazon. I will need new ones again, as I change them every few months.</li>
            <li> Product as described-Reasonable price in comparison to local discount superstore that is always out of stock &amp; charges same price for just one brush.</li>
            <li> Searched all over for these, hard to find, Amazon had the best price by far.  the toothbrush itself is great, charge lasts a good, long time, &amp; heads are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> these replacement heads work well for the Oral-B Sonic Toothbrush. The brushes last for a long time and hold up well.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find this because I couldn&#x27;t find the right one in the stores.  It fits great.  : )</li>
            <li> I was glad to find these replacement heads as they are becoming increasingly scarce. They are impossible to find locally anymore.In addition they don&#x27;t fit the oral B handle as well as the originals, they are probably meant as a one size fits all arrangement, which they don&#x27;t. Hence the three stars rating.After these wear out I&#x27;ll probably have to find a new toothbrush altogether.</li>
            <li> Getting a little hard to find, and a little pricy if you can still find them at a retail store</li>
            <li> This is a price that can&#x27;t be beat.  Even in the large stores like BJ&#x27;s or Sam&#x27;s club.  They can&#x27;t match this price.  I used to use each one longer than recommended  because they were so expensive. Now, I can change the head every month.</li>
            <li> We were a little disappointed that none of the stores carry these toothbrush heads for the Oral-B Sonic Toothbrush anymore. But we were so excited when we discovered they had our toothbrush heads on amazon. They are the same brand we used to buy in the store just a couple dollars less online for 3 toothbrush heads instead of just the one we used to buy for the same price, which is fabulous! This product is superb because they last up to 4-5 months before having to change the head on the toothbrush. Plus they ship pretty fast. A win, win for this product!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered  Exactly as shown.  Would buy again from this company.  Good shippping time.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find the head replacement as this seems to be a discontinued toothbrush model. I am very pleased with price and service when receiving this item.</li>
            <li> I only spend $15 at most a year on toothbrush replacement heads, which is one purchase a year.  The Oral Sonic Complete is perfect.  Worth every dime.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried several different electric toothbrushes, but this is the one we like the best, but wouldn&#x27;t you know, it&#x27;s also the hardest to find. But, I&#x27;ve discovered, I can always find it here and for the BEST price!</li>
            <li> Third day I used it, it stopped rotating, cheap springs or something, won&#x27;t purchase again! Don&#x27;t buy this product ever, too cheap!</li>
            <li> My daughter got this for us as a xmas present. It fitted perfectly on our original sonic electric toothbrushes. Works great.</li>
            <li> love this tooth brush&#x27; love these heads and they are hard to find</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  I have had this Oral-B sonic tooth brush system for 5 years.  I would definately buy another one should I need to replace it.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads seem impossible to find in the market place. I am very happy with the order I placed and will do so again!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good brush heads. They are the ones that work with my toothbrush so that&#x27;s why I purchased them. Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Kudos to Amazon and seller !!! I can always find hard to get itemsm discontinued items and just plain ole rare items from Amazon. Brand new item and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very durable heads. The shape of it is very streamline making the brushing experience nice. The color screams \\&quot;YEAH\\&quot;!!!!!! Wish they put a racing stripe on the side.... There&#x27;s a party in your mouth and Oral B is the house keeping that keeps it clean..:)</li>
            <li> Great brush.  It does a great job of flossing my teeth for each brushing.  I use with a Braun power toothbrush and it gets my teeth clean and flossed at the same time.</li>
            <li> These brushes are an excellent product and always leave one&#x27;s teeth nice and ;lean.  We&#x27;ll buy some more when needed.</li>
            <li> The price is right and the ease of ordering will have me purchasing this item again.  My husband also uses Sonic and he will be ordering again, also.</li>
            <li> use all the time and clean the teeth and messages my gums when needed sometimes come off the brush handle</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Sonic brushes were as they said they would be. These are very hard to find in my area and I was excited to find them on Amazon. The price was excellent. They arrived earlier than expected and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Sure wish I could still purchase these in store, but I can&#x27;t find them.  This oral-b sonic  brush is far superior to the Sonicare by Philips.&lt;br /&gt;Bought these originally for my kids (who are now teens).  These work amazingly well.  My husband &amp; I use the Sonicare.  Unfortunately, the design of the Philips product leads to mold &amp; mildew growing in the toothbrush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Oral-B models DO NOT harbor water, mold or mildew.  I wish they still sold this model - I would replace my Sonicare&#x27;s with them. But my kids are still working great after about 6 years.  I will continue to purchase these replacement heads from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find these on subscribe and save and the price was very reasonable in comparison to retail. The brush itself is a different size and shape than the smaller round heads I presently use, so that was another reason I was looking forward to using these. The cut out shape in the stem of the brush attachment is entirely different than that of the brush I have on there now, and so it does not snap onto the brush handle at all.  I don&#x27;t know if Oral B/Braun has changed the brush design since other reviewers&#x27; comments, so just beware that this refill will likely NOT fit your vitality sonic. Bummed :(</li>
            <li> These were just what I was looking for. I was very glad to find these replacement heads @ Amazon as I had looked unsuccessfully in many stores for these replacements.  I love this toothbrush! Please keep these in stock!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Hard to find, thrilled I did! Did not want to replace my toothbrush!</li>
            <li> What can I say about a toothbrush? It works as expected, just like the ones at the store but cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these replacement heads for a while now from Amazon.  I have never been disappointed.  The package arrived well preserved and I received it pretty quickly.  The brush heads have performed as well as they always have on the Sonic Complete tooth brush.</li>
            <li> We brought it into our house and changed the old heads for the new ones.  The colors were so much bolder , and the brush heads seemed to rotate to clean better.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve purchased this item before and been burned, as of September 2012 the product being shipped does fit the Oral B Sonic Complete.  It was shipped efficiently.  No problems.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used the Sonic Complete System since last summer and have found it made a significant difference from manual toothbrushes - the heads do a great job in dislodging small particles and also seem to help in brightening the teeth.   Oral B recommends replacing every 3 months - we think it can safely stretch to 4-5 months, particularly since the heads are somewhat expensive compared to manual toothbrushes with regular replacement.</li>
            <li> They may seem expensive, but they LAST, and if you try going back to your old way of brushing, you won&#x27;t be able to stand it.</li>
            <li> This is not a very common tip, so I have to order it.  Works great, but I wish I could find them in the stores instead of going through ordering them each time.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I saw the price in the drug store for he Oral-B Sonic Replacement Brush Heads.   I was pleased to see it offered on Amazon at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> These are the brush heads for an older electric toothbrush and this was a good price for this hard to find item</li>
            <li> I bought some of the brushes made in China for a cheap price and got a cheap product. This is a name brand brush for a reasonable price. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out as they did on the cheap product. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these replacement heads in the stores but can always rely on Amazon to have what I need.  I now have clean happy teeth!</li>
            <li> This is a good brush head replacement, fitting just the same as the original heads.  However, the bristles on the heads seem to be noticeably tougher than the originals.  I didn&#x27;t do a side by side comparison, and am only going off my memory.  Just a heads up that I think the original heads had softer bristles.</li>
            <li> its the only one make by the co. that makes the sonic oral-b  what more do you want i gave you an answer</li>

            <li> I was unable to purchase these replacement heads through my grocery/pharmacy and was pleased to be able to order them online. They were delivered promptly and it was what I had wanted.</li>
            <li> The price was fair.  Works fine and arrived on time.  I&#x27;m happy with it.   This is extra text to meet the stupid minimum requirements from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and packaged well.  These replacement tooth brush heads for Sonic Vitality are nearly impossible to find in local stores.  So glad I was able to find them here.</li>
            <li> Brush heads sold at great place for replacements for Oral B toothbrush.  Would continue to buy at Amazon at this price.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, no defects what so ever, and totally functional.  I would recommend this item and this provider to anyone who uses this type of oral care.</li>
            <li> These brushes seem to last a long time before the wear indicator shows replacement time.  I always get 6 months or more out of them, but only use it once a day.  I like the small head size since it is easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the head seemed to hold up well and wears nicely.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good buy. And I truly would reccomend this product to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> What can I say, works just as expected.  Shipped fast.  Clean teeth.  Filling up 14 words about a toothbrush is not as easy as it looks</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over 10 years and I am still very satisfied with its performance. I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Replacements were just fine but toothbrush died!</li>
            <li> I have a sonic toothbrush bought sometime ago. I notice the brushes are not readily available.  I am glad I found them on Amazon. I was not about to get rid of a perfectly good unit simply because the brushes have been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because it was exactly what I needed to. The local stores didn&#x27;t carry it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in about 3 days or less. Very good product as well as good service.</li>
            <li> I have looked all over trying to find these brush heads. They fit my wife&#x27;s tooth brush perfectly A+ A+</li>
            <li> I could not find these in my local stores and I wanted to continue to use this necessary product with my toothbrush.  I was thrilled to find I could obtain them so easily. They work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product that keeps my teeth very clean. It is easy to use and easy to store in bathroom.</li>
            <li> I appreciate being able to find replacement brushes for my still working, but older model electric toothbrush. Saves me from getting rid of a perfectly good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We receive the replacement brush heads on a regular automatic basis.  The brushes are good, don&#x27;t see rating a brush excellent but maybe they are.  We have no issues with them and as long as the tooth brush keeps working we will keep using these types of brushes.</li>
            <li> Pricing allows for more frequent replacment of this now several years old toothbrush that workes well for me. Quarterly visits to the hyfgienist and daily use has kept this 65+ year old mouth intact.</li>
            <li> So happy to find these brushes that fit my oral b vitality. Was able to buy at wal-mart but thy discontinued them and I have been using my last brush head way past its life expectancy. Love this toothbrush, have had it over tens years and just keeeps going so glad tofind these on amazon</li>
            <li> Always need a resupply of brush heads. Only problem was my Oral B Sonic broke right after I made the purchased, and they have discontinued this item, No More Sonics</li>
            <li> Hard to find but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have an older model tooth brush and these replacements heads are getting harder and harder to find.  I was happy to find them here.  Nice price too!</li>
            <li> These did not fit my oral B vitality toothbrush. I emailed the manufacturer and they insisted they did (and they don&#x27;t!). Now i have three toothbrush heads that don&#x27;t fit and am out my money. Frustrated and upset. Would never order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I have been using these toothbrush heads for over 3 years and I have been extremely satisfied! I recommend these toothbrush heads!</li>
            <li> I Love the Oral-B Tooth Brush! Bought mine Years ago &amp; Still going Strong!! Just needs Replacements.. Thanks for a Great Product!!</li>
            <li> This is a genuine Oral-B product, not an aftermarket knock-off.  Brush heads fit perfectly on the motorized toothbrush base unit.&lt;br /&gt;The blue &amp;#34;tell-tale&amp;#34; bristles seem to lose their color rather quickly (which is supposed to indicate time for a replacement).  If you followed this indication, you would be replacing these rather expensive heads way too often.</li>
            <li> These heads fit perfectly! I have seen some reviews that say these dont fit properly, these do. I will order again when these wear out.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I needed.  It would be helpful to have \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; for the type of brush.  I need \\&quot;soft\\&quot; and these seem to be fine.</li>
            <li> The Sonic Replacement Brush Heads work really well, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I wouldn&#x27;t try to buy a genaric brand.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding the right brush heads for my Sonic Complete. These fit perfectly and were a good price.</li>
            <li> Though the brush itself is somewhat prone to wearing out and the charging system is very hit or miss. Brushes will last depending on usage, but they do seem to do better than most of the store knockoff brands.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find locally and the price is right on Amazon. Great toothbrush heads and it feels like dentist clean after each use!</li>
            <li> I love this heads and the toothbrush they are used on. I&#x27;ve been using these for years and have never had a cavity.</li>
            <li> good buy.fits my tooth brushes.please keep them on hand as we will be ordering more. One thing make sure you get the right name of your tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  How much else can be said about a toothbrush head.  Seems like harassment to need to add&lt;br /&gt;words for nothing.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly, shipped quick and received without a problem.  Better than regular toothbrush in my opinion and love the timer.</li>
            <li> headline and 20 more words is too much of an effortheadline and 20 more words is too much of an effortheadline and 20 more words is too much of an effortheadline and 20 more words is too much of an effortheadline and 20 more words is too much of an effort</li>
            <li> I had been searching for replacement brush heads at the usual stores since the beginning of the year, and they were always sold out. I was very pleased to find these at Amazon at a reasonable price. They are exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Great Product I cannot find this product in the stores any more better then manual toothbrush any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRLB&lt;br /&gt;St Louis Mo</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I really like the product and would recommend it to anyone as well.  good job</li>
            <li> These brush heads are the correct product for the Sonic Complete toothbrush. Brush heads that are impossible to find in local stores.  Although I don&#x27;t remember the price of prior repacements, this seems to be comparable.  Plus I don&#x27;t have to buy a new powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, completely functional.  The sonic replacement brush heads provide a great cleaning but can be difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> These are the only ones that will fit and are not carried by many local stores.  we were happy to find them listed on this site.</li>
            <li> My dentist saw improvement in my gum line with less tartar. He gave me an A+ in my brushing. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants better oral health.</li>
            <li> Having no experience with any other toothbrush like this we can only say that it is a big improvement over manual brushing. The refills are clearly where the profits are but they do hold up well as part of the system--not needing replacement all that often(6 months).</li>
            <li> As stated you get three tooth brush heads and they work great for my Oral B sonic complete.And these are less money than paying retail.</li>
            <li> Very good product that I have known for a while. This newer one is better than the older ones.</li>
            <li> I like the replacement brush head.  It fits my toothbrush.  The texture of the brush head is great and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush and great replacement brushes.  These really clean teeth.  Last a month or two.  Good value, really, when you consider you can not get a  cleaning equal to this any other way, except by going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> The incorrect brush was sent to me and I was unable to use it, so had to return and pay return postage which does&#x27;nt seem quite fair because it was not my fault the wrong item was sent to me</li>
            <li> I have really bad teeth and gums. I have to go to the dentist every 3-6 months.  They recommended this toothbrush with the use of \\&quot;go betweens\\&quot;, floss and listerine. Between all of these items and using them religiously EVERY day my experience in the dentist chair is much much better.</li>
            <li> Original is best quality.( generic not worth the cash)</li>
            <li> Nice and cheap....  far better than Ebay!!   If you need these, this is the place to get them..   FAST shipping too.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads work well and lasts a reasonable amount of time(3-4 weeks) but they are over priced when compared to the generic brand which almost performs as well(2-3 weeks).</li>
            <li> I wish it had 4 heads instead of 3 but this is the only place I can get my replacements.  I&#x27;ve tried Target and Wal-Mart and still can&#x27;t find it.  Never had a problem and it works with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I currently  own the Oral-B Sonic Electric Toothbrush.  I have used it for approximately two years and I love it. After brushing, my teeth feel almost as good as after the dental hygienist cleans them.  But sad to say, this toothbrush replacement has been discontinued and I cannot find anything to replace it. I have had great success w this brush and am really sorry to see it go.  I will continue searching for it  and hopefully find some.  I did find the 3 ct. brush head on Amazon.com but the seller wanted $152.00 for the same product I had been paying $14.00 for.</li>
            <li> I was happy with my electric toothbrush and did not want to have to buy a new one, but all of my brush heads finally wore out and I couldn&#x27;t find replacements anywhere. Amazon to the rescue! Many thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased my Sonic electric toothbrush sometime ago, and could only find my replacement brush heads here. Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> These are great replacement heads especially for the price.  This is a good toothbrush and has lasted me quite some time.</li>
            <li> You buy something that works well and want to continue to use it, but there are always new and improved replacements coming on to the market, so, what is one to do? Tired of going to brick and morter stores only to be disappointed I went online to Amazon and found what I had been looking for, purchased it online, and received it as fast as I would have wanted. And what do you know? The product is genuine and actually works as ever I remember. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Work just fine on my sonic brush and haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere else.  Sonic quality is nice.</li>
            <li> The price on these replacements couldn&#x27;t be beat!  Not even in the large discount store 1 mile from my home.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Price is way more reasonable than in the store. Will buy these again for sure.</li>
            <li> Hard to find these as it is a discontinued model. Very relieved to find them and at a good price. Fast service. Happy camper.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I was looking for. I was going to throw my toothbrush away and buy another one if I didnt find these brushes. I love these brushes. they&#x27;re the perfect size. I&#x27;m so glad I found them.</li>
            <li> It is working okay, but had a hard time getting the brush to fit on the shaft. I had to really push down on it, otherwise it has worked fine.</li>
            <li> Fine.  Product met or exceeded my expectations.  My main problem with these products are the HIGH costs.  Look for sales.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 packages and they arrived quickly. A lot less money than buying them at a big box store. They are not making the sonic toothbrush anymore so am happy I can still get the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> love the oran b, but they need to improve their brushes, the brushes on my other tooth brush were much better and did a better job., and they are way too expensive, but all replacement brushes are</li>
            <li> This model of toothbrush heads are hard to find in the stores these days. I don&#x27;t particularly want to buy a new electric toothbrush. Glad I found them. Fit perfectly</li>
            <li> These brushes fit my Oral-B Sonic Complete brush perfectly. Snug fit and they are just like the ones that came with it originally. Still think they are pricey, but most of the reviews on the aftermarkets ones are not great.</li>
            <li> Fits my Oral-B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush perfectly. Nice firm bristles, color change to let you know when you “should” change but I use them for a while after that. Have bought several and all of them fit as they should and no problem with bristles or anything. Found a generic version but with the reviews about not staying correctly on the unit or bristles falling out I didn’t want to chance it as I knew these are good quality and have never had problems… not going to mess around with my health. Dentist always compliments how clean I keep my teeth so I’d say they’re doing their job.</li>
            <li> I have an older model, close to 6 years, of the Oral-B ultrasounic toothbrush and could no longer find the replacement heads in the stores. In fact, I bought another model just recently but then I found these on Amazon and was thrilled. Works great.</li>
            <li> fit my oral b sonicare perfectly.  I was nervous they wouldnt fit based on some reviews, but they fit no problem!</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes fit the Oral-B handle perfectly.  Each brush lasts me about a month so I keep one or two spares in the drawer.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find replacement brushes in the stores, but the unit was still working great. Order replacements and am still using them. I like knowing that I can find replacements online.</li>
            <li> I love these brush heads with my electric toothbrush, although they are very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;However, regardless of the price, i will continue buying these brush heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric toothbrush for quite a few years. It got where I couldn&#x27;t find replacement brush heads. So I am very happy with these  replacements.</li>
            <li> What can one say about sonic replacement brush heads??  They were hard to find, so I was happy to find them.  My teeth are clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> Oral B has decent quality, but I no longer use their products, would not recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> The head fits brush very well,  The price is slight higher than Costco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have the electric toothbrush set that these are the replacement heads for it.  Very excited to find them at Amazon.com for a resonable price plus FREE shipping!  Score!</li>
            <li> I like my old tooth brush and these replacement heads let me keep brushing my teeth so that I don&#x27;t end up looking like most of the people in south Indiana.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  If you use the sonic care system you need to replace the brushes regularly.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Sonic Replacement Brush Head (3 ct) are a good replacement, Gives that dentist clean feeling after use. They are pricey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Oral B Sonic for years and these replacement heads worked great, just like the original heads purchased years ago.</li>
            <li> I bought these for FAR less than they were selling for at Target. They were the exact replacement for my electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great having a line on this product--no longer are these replacement heads found on store shelves, at least, locally, and for the past two or three years. Yet I receive their delivery six months apart, automatically.  And can continue using my finely working sonic tooth-brushing engine.  -M.H.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Oral-B Sonic for about seven year now.  My dental check-ups are vastly better than before.  My teeth get cleaned better, and faster, and more efficiently.  I can&#x27;t imagine going back to a regular brush.  The only time I use them is on vacation, since I am very hesitate to bring this along for fear of losing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find these replacement heads at Amazon, because they are very difficult to find locally, and when I do, they are much more expensive.  This will keep me going for a good length of time!</li>
            <li> The product turned out to be exactly what I thought it should be. I future I will only use these heads for brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> New, in package just as described.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years.  My teeth always feel squeaky clean after using them each morning and evening.</li>
            <li> These heads fit perfectly with my Oral-B Sonic Complete electric toothbrush. Since the charger holds three heads it&#x27;s a perfect fit!</li>
            <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve found and I do a lot of research before making my purchases. These brush heads are hard to find where I live I cant find in a Wal-Mart of Walgreens so I was happy to see I could order on here.</li>
            <li> These brush heads work just fine and do a good job cleaning my teeth. I recommend them highly. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I like these brush heads, they are the only ones that fit my electric toothbrush.  I would recommend these and purchase again,.</li>
            <li> The brush heads were sent quickly and were just as if I bought them in the store, but they were much cheaper!</li>
            <li> the Oral B brushes are a more recent design than the ones that came with the tooth brush and are actually better at getting into the spaces between teeth, etc.  I recommend them and will buy them again when needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using a regular toothbush for months. I&#x27;m so happy to be able to use my Oral B again.Fast delivery and good product.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with these.  They are hard to find in stores so I was excited when I found them.  They have a regular shape like a real toothbrush, only smaller.  Make sure that you know what type of oral b toothbrush you have before you buy any replacement brush.  Certain brushes fit certain model toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. No one carries them- not cvs, not Walgreens, not target, not rite aid. And the price was great.</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t need to write so many words to submit this review. It&#x27;s a tooth brush head (actually 3 in the package). It is what it says it is, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to &amp; the price is right</li>
            <li> I was happy to find the brush heads becasue you no longer can buy them in the store. the product is good quality and the price was right.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are great.  High quality and worth the money.  I purchased cheaper brush heads but they didn&#x27;t last, ended up costing more money because they needed to be replaced about four times more frequently.</li>
            <li> I needed replacements again for this brush and have found that stores no longer carry them.  Thankfully I found them here.  I found their quality to be as good as the original heads I had and am pleased with them.  I have not had any issues with bristles coming out or anything like that.  Maybe watch WHO you are buying these types of things from.  I bought mine straight from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am a dentist, and I recommend them to my patients. When the time comes for replacement heads, i send my people to you. The price is fine, and the service is quick.What&#x27;s not to like!!</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to have a supply of these at a fairly reasonable price.  I do wish the that the new brush heads were just the brush part as my old one was...just better for the environment, but that&#x27;s me.  These were what I needed, and they do a good job.</li>
            <li> Fits brush perfectly and I was unable to locate the brush heads locally so was thrilled to be able to find them at the right price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find these replacement brush heads so to have them delivered to your home is a real bonus.</li>
