            <li>Perfect ,,, can&#x27;t wait for my item</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed!</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Great seller, thugh!</li>
            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>but, I am happy</li>
            <li>Great delivery.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well!  </li>
            <li>This worked in about 4 minutes, to an amazing level!  </li>
            <li>This was an awesome product I will surely buy many times over!</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product, I&#x27;ve seen much better results than what I experienced.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>It was rather amazing to watch it begin to shrink and flatten the bags.</li>
            <li>I put it on top of make up and it seemed to work better</li>
            <li>While it works on most people to erase years.....</li>
            <li>I love it before I put my makeup on but after makeup it doesn&#x27;t look as good.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>We both love this product and will order more.</li>
            <li>Waited for more than an hour, added lotion and the benefit was immediately lost.  </li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>Make sure you cleanse and dab the cream under your eyes going clockwise.</li>
            <li>Is more of a wrinkle filler in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This was ok.</li>
            <li>Product didn&#x27;t work for more than 5 minutes and leaves a noticable film...</li>
            <li>Very quick shipping, A+.</li>
            <li>The product seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li>I do not have large &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; per say like many people &amp;#34;testing&amp;#34; this product, maybe if I did this product would work better...</li>
            <li>Great concept product, however the product does not last 8 hours nor does it hold up when light make up applied.</li>
            <li>use oil free makeup</li>
            <li>I lightly put it around my undereyes</li>
            <li>Works great but doesn&#x27;t last...</li>
            <li>So far so good....</li>
            <li>Product is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use it</li>
            <li>But since I rarely wear makeup at home it will be fine for days</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to erase as much as I&#x27;d like to.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work to add more because it leaves a kind of dry film as it dries.</li>
            <li>Vials can use 3-4 times the satchet if you are lucky 2.  </li>
            <li>The vials came quickly from  the vendor.</li>
            <li>Super super stuff, it takes.years off your appearance.</li>
            <li>Even my husband was impressed by the results and he is a physician, skeptical of most cosmetic products that make miraculous claims.</li>
            <li>Product dries out too quickly once the bottle is opened.  </li>
            <li>you smile it&#x27;s worth thedisappointments if you smile</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the wrinkles</li>
            <li>But for me, this product isn&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li>Then the minute you smile your eyes stretch loosening it up</li>
            <li>The product was priced right, it was as advertised, shipping was prompt.</li>
            <li>I would try it again if it was the right consistancy</li>
            <li>First try did nothing, used more on the second try and does improve the bag/circle under the eye.  </li>
            <li>it does  shrink the lines, and i can feel a tightening when first applied.  </li>
            <li>glad I bought it in a small batch first!!</li>
            <li>does not work as promised very dissatisfied with the product,</li>
            <li>The tubes that I received the writing is in LIGHT BLUE!!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to purchase the whole $100+ kit, but this trial amount proved to me that the product is &amp;#34;all that&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>It really needs a cap.</li>
            <li>Item is ok for a slight tighter look..until you apply makeup over it...</li>
            <li>It does help but doesn&#x27;t hide under eye lines completely!!</li>
            <li>but once I began to smile they were back.</li>
            <li>it is an amazing transformation needs to be put in a bigger bottle not these little vials...</li>
            <li>for the first time a product actually did what it claimed to</li>
            <li>n tighten up ur skin pretty much same thing!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time ladies!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel as if it is this WOW product like everyone</li>
            <li>The reason you go clockwise is because there is a natural &amp;#34;drain&amp;#34; under your eye near your nose (lymph nodes).</li>
            <li>and I repeat Not 3 or 4 applications as they claim!!!!!!!As far as how the products work</li>
            <li>Also as soon as you smile or make any facial expression the lines are back.</li>
            <li>Also if you put too much on, it made your skin look dry and scaly</li>
            <li>I did send it back as I think the material was old.</li>
            <li>Felt really uncomfortable, like if I smiled, this would just flake off.</li>
            <li>The vials I received have blue lettering, not black.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The vials I received have blue lettering, not black.</li>
            <li> Worked for 5 minutes and only when I fanned my face to get it to dry.</li>
            <li> The eye cream leaves a white dry residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I dont wear makeup and the grey was so noticeable i had to wash it off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hype sorry to say because I was excited like everyone else.</li>
            <li> n let it dry</li>
            <li> It is chalky looking when dry.  </li>
            <li> Talk about dry and crepey.</li>
            <li> but once its dry you get a slight grey film.</li>
            <li> One has to be careful where the product is placed, it can turn crinkled and white after a little bit.</li>
            <li> only negative would be that it does leave a white film where applied...</li>
            <li> however, I noticed after it completely dried it did leave a white flaky residue.</li>
            <li> Very drying and irritating to the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Very uneven results and does not last long.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference other than it felt like paste on my face.</li>
            <li> The skin around the areas where I applied this product were dry and crusty, even though I used little of this product and dabbed it as told.</li>
            <li> all this product does is leave your skin feeling tight and looking dry, it does not fill in lines or mske them appear less visable.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t work I&#x27;m not satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a white cream, how hard can it be.</li>
            <li> All it did was to like freeze the skin and did nothing for dark circles like it said.  </li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t order anymore not worth the price..</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> so 1 small tube would last for quite a few uses.</li>
            <li> Less then one star</li>
            <li> You will see the wrinkles and bags disappear before your eyes in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> So... I had very flat spots and then other areas that looks twice as bad puffy because it was flat next to it.</li>
            <li> However it does make your skin feel tight, look flakey, and discolored,unless you put a ton of foundation over it.</li>
            <li> Only use your ring fingers as the skin under the eye is very delicate.</li>
            <li> but this product was in my opinion a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It works for a few minutes , then bam...</li>
            <li> a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money .</li>
            <li> dried up the skin and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Needs to be reapplied after a few hours.</li>
            <li> the puffiness is uneven</li>
            <li> I just bought a few vials to try.</li>
            <li> Product seems dried out, not easy too apply.  </li>
            <li> The reason I am only giving this 3 stars is because it is very expensive and there is only one application per vial &amp; Not</li>
            <li> This works instantly, but when I don&#x27;t wear it, it seems to make my bags worse, not sure if it&#x27;s the product or just me?</li>
            <li> aww so dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> Elmer glue and apply a thin layer under your eyes and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I guess the upside to it if you like it is it takes very little</li>
            <li> I am not sure.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I would ever try it again</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT more than 2 applications per tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who they are paying to write these product reviews.</li>
            <li> It was late arriving</li>
            <li> I had to add a drop of water because it was so thick.</li>
            <li> the writing on the tubes are BLACK!!!</li>
            <li> You could seriously see it happening.</li>
            <li> If you move it turns white and ugly DONT BUY IT</li>
            <li> if you put on liquid make up after the treatment, it washes right off....extremely disappointing :(</li>
            <li> it was very thick and pasty.</li>
            <li> not happy at all with the product.</li>
            <li> I look sloppy.</li>
            <li> sorry.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed - at all.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t happen evenly.</li>
            <li> but it dries out the skin so bad that you get wrinkles.</li>
            <li> its very bad no chang</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible...</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I did not receive the item that was shown.  What I did receive was the sample packets that stated they were not for resale.  The product seem to work fine.  I put it on top of make up and it seemed to work better but it did turn white like others stated.</li>
            <li> I received 10 packets instead of 5 vials. There is a big difference in the size and quantity of cream in the packets compared to the vials.</li>
            <li> I would purchase from this seller again.  The product was priced right, it was as advertised, shipping was prompt.</li>
            <li> Its LIKE a glue... no like it , still working just 1 hour</li>
            <li> I thought product worked just as add said, but it dried up fast and left a white dryish residue</li>
            <li> does not work as promised very dissatisfied with the product, glad I bought it in a small batch first!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the vials and satchet there is a big difference in size and the amount of times you can use one satchet. Vials can use 3-4 times the satchet if you are lucky 2.  People feeling the orders need to read what the orders are and not substitute things with out contacting the buyer.  The cost of the satchets are lower than the vials.  I have friends that sell this product. I bought on Amazon because of price difference for vials.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last...if you put on liquid make up after the treatment, it washes right off....extremely disappointing :(</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectations, nor did it work as promised. I followed the simple instructions and even tried it a couple different ways, before makeup, without makeup, after makeup.  There were video instructions online, which I followed as well but this product was in my opinion a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t work I&#x27;m not satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> It was late arriving but, I am happy</li>
            <li> While it works on most people to erase years.....I wasn&#x27;t able to erase as much as I&#x27;d like to.  It is an amazing product, I&#x27;ve seen much better results than what I experienced.  One has to be careful where the product is placed, it can turn crinkled and white after a little bit.</li>
            <li> Product does not make any difference at all.</li>
            <li> The vials came quickly from  the vendor. I did send it back as I think the material was old. it was very thick and pasty. I would try it again if it was the right consistancy</li>
            <li> Instantly sticky.. Then instantly glossy... Then turns to white flakes.. But not instantly ageless. Watched multiple YouTube videos to help with application. It&#x27;s just a white cream, how hard can it be. If you want to know what it feels and looks like Grab your kids Elmer glue and apply a thin layer under your eyes and let it dry.</li>
            <li> turned white and flaky.  not happy at all with the product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> you smile it&#x27;s worth thedisappointments if you smile it&#x27;s worth the wrinkles</li>
            <li> Perfect ,,, can&#x27;t wait for my item</li>
            <li> I love it before I put my makeup on but after makeup it doesn&#x27;t look as good.&lt;br /&gt;It still helps but not as much&lt;br /&gt;I use oil free makeup and I&#x27;ve tried material powder</li>
            <li> Burned or irritated face</li>
            <li> Although it felt like spans for your face....</li>
            <li> Super super stuff, it takes.years off your appearance.Wish they had all over face creams!</li>
            <li> It works for a few minutes , then bam... Back your eye bags .its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its like putting glue on your face!  If you move it turns white and ugly DONT BUY IT</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money .</li>
            <li> I did what it said it would but it dries out the skin so bad that you get wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well!  Will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> This was an awesome product I will surely buy many times over!</li>
            <li> aww so dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> It leave a fime on your face like powder</li>
            <li> This product did NOT deliver to it&#x27;s reputation... I wouldn&#x27;t suggest anyone wasting their money.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well. Even my husband was impressed by the results and he is a physician, skeptical of most cosmetic products that make miraculous claims. We both love this product and will order more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel as if it is this WOW product like everyone thinks it is. I lightly put it around my undereyes it seemed to have softened some of the lines I have, but once I began to smile they were back. The skin around the areas where I applied this product were dry and crusty, even though I used little of this product and dabbed it as told. I do not have large &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; per say like many people &amp;#34;testing&amp;#34; this product, maybe if I did this product would work better...I am not sure. But for me, this product isn&#x27;t worth it&#x27;s hype sorry to say because I was excited like everyone else.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed!, the product I received wasn&#x27;t the same as the pictures of the product on amazon the writing on the tubes are BLACK!!! The tubes that I received the writing is in LIGHT BLUE!!!! and I&#x27;m not sure I would ever try it again I feel I was Scammed!!!!)0:</li>
            <li> The product works just like the video says! It truly is instant...however, I noticed after it completely dried it did leave a white flaky residue. As if I didn&#x27;t wash my face. I bought 5 vials. Maybe I will try it again. I followed the directions as stated on the video. Maybe next time I won&#x27;t put any moisturizer under my eyes and see if that works. Probably won&#x27;t buy it again 😢 sorry.</li>
            <li> its very bad no chang</li>
            <li> This worked in about 4 minutes, to an amazing level!  I didn&#x27;t want to purchase the whole $100+ kit, but this trial amount proved to me that the product is &amp;#34;all that&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> Worked for 5 minutes and only when I fanned my face to get it to dry. Will be returning.</li>
            <li> dried up the skin and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Very drying and irritating to the eyes.  The minute you apply eye cream all effects are gone.</li>
            <li> Did not come with instructions.  First try did nothing, used more on the second try and does improve the bag/circle under the eye.  Waited for more than an hour, added lotion and the benefit was immediately lost.  Does leave some residue on the skin as it works, if you use water or lotion to wipe it off, the effect stops.  So - yes it works if you can use only this product - lasts for a couple of hours or so.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Works great! only negative would be that it does leave a white film where applied...</li>
            <li> for the first time a product actually did what it claimed to</li>
            <li> Great concept product, however the product does not last 8 hours nor does it hold up when light make up applied. The eye cream leaves a white dry residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the difference  vials versus envelope packets of Instantly  Aging</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work...waste of money</li>
            <li> Seems to actually work. Needs to be reapplied after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Applied product per directions, no residue. Instant results! But call it Cinderella because after 5 hours, the effects wore off &amp; the bags were back.</li>
            <li> Works great but doesn&#x27;t last...</li>
            <li> All it did was to like freeze the skin and did nothing for dark circles like it said.  Also if you put too much on, it made your skin look dry and scaly</li>
            <li> So far so good....just started.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed - at all.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Leaves white film on skin</li>
            <li> It was okay but I won&#x27;t order anymore not worth the price..</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible... You might as well put egg white on ur face n let it dry n tighten up ur skin pretty much same thing! Then the minute you smile your eyes stretch loosening it up n the puffiness is uneven n is visible. The &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is cakey n irritated under my eyes! Less then one star</li>
            <li> YES! This does get rid of the bags under your eyes. Make sure you cleanse and dab the cream under your eyes going clockwise. Only use your ring fingers as the skin under the eye is very delicate. The reason you go clockwise is because there is a natural &amp;#34;drain&amp;#34; under your eye near your nose (lymph nodes). You literally massage out the fluid and decrease puffiness.</li>
            <li> Product dries out too quickly once the bottle is opened.  It really needs a cap.</li>
            <li> This stuff was cakey, it didn&#x27;t work as advertised. A complete waste of money. Do not fall for the hype.</li>
            <li> The reason I am only giving this 3 stars is because it is very expensive and there is only one application per vial &amp; Not and I repeat Not 3 or 4 applications as they claim!!!!!!!As far as how the products work I will give it 5 stars it is an amazing transformation needs to be put in a bigger bottle not these little vials...</li>
            <li> The vials I received have blue lettering, not black. The product is like chalk. Very uneven results and does not last long. I followed the instructions and within an hour, I had, what looked like, white clumped chalk under my eyes. The instructions say to replace cap when done. You can&#x27;t. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does help but doesn&#x27;t hide under eye lines completely!!</li>
            <li> It is chalky looking when dry.  Product seems dried out, not easy too apply.  Asking for a refund.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference other than it felt like paste on my face. Is more of a wrinkle filler in my opinion. Great seller, thugh!</li>
            <li> For me, the product does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell that it did anything!</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping, A+. But this product does not work, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Product is worth every penny! You will see the wrinkles and bags disappear before your eyes in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Great delivery. Item is ok for a slight tighter look..until you apply makeup over it... I used liquid... and I&#x27;ve used just powder and neither was oil based but the product lost its potency as soon as anything g was applied. But since I rarely wear makeup at home it will be fine for days I look sloppy.</li>
            <li> This was ok. I had to add a drop of water because it was so thick. It did help some but once its dry you get a slight grey film. I dont wear makeup and the grey was so noticeable i had to wash it off. Also as soon as you smile or make any facial expression the lines are back. Product didn&#x27;t work for more than 5 minutes and leaves a noticable film... Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Made my skin look chalky. Felt really uncomfortable, like if I smiled, this would just flake off. Definitely NOT more than 2 applications per tube.</li>
            <li> Well, thank goodness I just bought a few vials to try. Used 1 time and will never try it again. Tried it under my eyes. Used my usual moisturizer first as it directed me to do. It was rather amazing to watch it begin to shrink and flatten the bags. You could seriously see it happening. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t happen evenly. So... I had very flat spots and then other areas that looks twice as bad puffy because it was flat next to it. Almost looked like lumps under my eyes. It doesn&#x27;t work to add more because it leaves a kind of dry film as it dries. I thought maybe makeup would hide this but EEEECCCCHHHHH!!!!! Talk about dry and crepey. It was awful. I guess the upside to it if you like it is it takes very little so 1 small tube would last for quite a few uses. Good luck. I was really excited to use it but, nope.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time ladies! I&#x27;m not sure who they are paying to write these product reviews. However I&#x27;m going to tell you, all this product does is leave your skin feeling tight and looking dry, it does not fill in lines or mske them appear less visable. However it does make your skin feel tight, look flakey, and discolored,unless you put a ton of foundation over it. I am so disappointed! May as well lit 28$ on fire!</li>
            <li> This works instantly, but when I don&#x27;t wear it, it seems to make my bags worse, not sure if it&#x27;s the product or just me?</li>
            <li> it does  shrink the lines, and i can feel a tightening when first applied.  I think when i get a larger size, will be bettew.</li>
