            <li>That&#x27;s fine except it doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent my smell.</li>
            <li>It seems to give good scent protection but could use A little more scent be more fragrant</li>
            <li>The regular everest does not smell good.</li>
            <li>Well worth</li>
            <li>I wish that had been more clearly labeled or included in the product description.</li>
            <li>Item discription and picture showed exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I do not move or anything this stuff smells good for a few hours.</li>

            <li>Had too much to drink and ended up staying the night at a friend&#x27;s house.  </li>
            <li>I bought a pack of degree \\&quot;adventure\\&quot; for my boyfriend (I&#x27;m female), and it came with this one for free.</li>
            <li>This listing being for the invisible stick was the whole reason I ordered it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works better than the majority of other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I suppose I should have looked more carefully at the picture, but normally antiperspirants are labeled as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells mantastic, though the packaging seems... less than believable.</li>
            <li>However I have been un able to find it local anymore, all they sell now is regular degree everest</li>

            <li>Degree Men, Adrenaline Series, Invisible Stick Deodorant, Everest is long las the price compared to stores.ting with a fresh sent.</li>
            <li>It works well, but I don&#x27;t detect any difference between this and regular Degree for Men, but that goes in general for the whole Degree for Men line.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently I noticed that Sam&#x27;s club was selling this new adrenaline along side the standard degree.</li>
            <li>The strong scent combines with my body odor to make a really strong, really bad stench that even I cannot stand.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that it is actually an antiperspirant as well as a deodorant.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re anything like me and have always had trouble finding antiperspirant that works, steer far clear of this stuff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I usually wouldn&#x27;t write a review about a deodorant but this stuff just lasts so long.  I went to a cookout Sunday wearing it.  I was outside, hot, and sweaty...nearly half the day.  Had too much to drink and ended up staying the night at a friend&#x27;s house.  Woke up Monday morning...and this stuff was still smelling potent and as good as ever.  Probably the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I also started using this line after Costco switched to it and I can&#x27;t stand it.  Terrible itching after an hour of putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;Never had a problem with the other Degree lines.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to return the other sticks</li>
            <li> To push the stick out, twist the bottom. Took me some time to figure that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why you have to buy two packs. It smells mantastic, though the packaging seems... less than believable. I like it though, smells great, my girlfriend loves it too.</li>
            <li> It works well, but I don&#x27;t detect any difference between this and regular Degree for Men, but that goes in general for the whole Degree for Men line.  I&#x27;d rather just stick to the cheaper regular stuff.  Maybe it&#x27;ll be different for you, though.</li>
            <li> The deodorant I received was a dark blue container instead of the one in the picture but it doesn&#x27;t matter I&#x27;m happy since I now have 2 tall sticks to last me at least for the majority of next month. (i shower twice a day, once in the morning and again after working out)</li>
            <li> Prompt service, very good.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the Adreneline series as described/pictures.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it in a store, but I&#x27;m happy I found it here. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Keeps you smelling great!</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of degree \\&quot;adventure\\&quot; for my boyfriend (I&#x27;m female), and it came with this one for free. I&#x27;ve used men&#x27;s deodorant before, so I tried it and liked it. I got a little sick of getting white streaks on my clothes by accident, so on a whim I tossed it and bought my old clear stick deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a week now and I&#x27;m DYING. I reapply 3-4 times a day and it still doesn&#x27;t work as well. This line of degree works SO well.</li>
            <li> Degree Men, Adrenaline Series, Invisible Stick Deodorant, Everest is long las the price compared to stores.ting with a fresh sent. Well worth</li>
            <li> Was looking for something different than Axe, this is it. Smells real clean, lasts at least a couple of days. Great price, and wass delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using degree brand deodorant for years. It works better than the majority of other brands I&#x27;ve used. I have a strong bad smell. If I fail to apply I will stink within an hour of showing even if I do not sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I noticed that Sam&#x27;s club was selling this new adrenaline along side the standard degree. It smelled nice so I thought I&#x27;d try it. Big mistake. This stuff has a STRONG smell. That&#x27;s fine except it doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent my smell. The strong scent combines with my body odor to make a really strong, really bad stench that even I cannot stand.&lt;br /&gt;If I do not move or anything this stuff smells good for a few hours. However if I do anything that might get my heart rate up I end up with an unbearable odor emanating from my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently people do like this stuff, but my guess is if this stuff works for you, the cheaper standard stuff would probably work just as well. If you&#x27;re anything like me and have always had trouble finding antiperspirant that works, steer far clear of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like this product, for its smell is refreshing and the protection is good too. Also the auto mail is convenient for this product.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty nice and does its job. As minor as it is, I like how the entire bottom turns so I&#x27;m not using two fingers to try to turn a little rotating piece.</li>
            <li> I really love the degree everest invisible stick deoderant. However I have been un able to find it local anymore, all they sell now is regular degree everest and it smells completely different. For some reason it has the be the \\&quot;invisible stick\\&quot; to get the good smell. The regular everest does not smell good. So I went to try and buy some of the invisible stick online. I found this listing for it. Item discription and picture showed exactly what I was looking for. I have been buying from here for a while now and had great service, so I ordered 3 two packs. I just recieved it and they sent the regular everest, not the invisible stick.&lt;br /&gt;Not a happy customer, I am now returning these. This listing being for the invisible stick was the whole reason I ordered it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware!! Item not as discribed!</li>
            <li> It seems to give good scent protection but could use A little more scent be more fragrant i like deodorant with a stronger scent so good but not great</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the description that it was a stick deodorant. I was surprised to see that it is actually an antiperspirant as well as a deodorant. I wish that had been more clearly labeled or included in the product description. I suppose I should have looked more carefully at the picture, but normally antiperspirants are labeled as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I use a separate antiperspirant and was only looking for a deodorant, this was a bit of a wasted purchase for me. Thus the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a great product so far, I&#x27;ve used it for two days and I smell great. I was sweating so bad yesterday at the gym and when I went home I still smelled fresh!!!</li>
            <li> great deodrant and great price... it smells fresher than a new born seal fresh out the woom in the arcctic ocean</li>
            <li> I apply this once in the morning after i shower and once at night after i shower. Usually keeps me smelling good the whole day. On some days when i do physical training in the morning it doesn&#x27;t cover up the smell of Body odor. If i had to buy again i would buy a different smell</li>
