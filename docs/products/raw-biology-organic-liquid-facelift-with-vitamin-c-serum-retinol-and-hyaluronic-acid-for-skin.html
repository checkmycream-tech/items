            <li>and i will be honest</li>
            <li>Nice texture to the products.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>All thoughts, opinions, and experiences are my own.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was doing any good, but I had to go to a dermatological surgeon for a suspicious growth.</li>
            <li>it seems kind of watery</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product because of the reviews and price and honestly I wanted to give my best review</li>
            <li>it was nicely done.</li>
            <li>shipped to me fast what a great product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I am loving what I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li>I honestly can not say it works or does not work because I quit using it after three trys.  </li>
            <li>Loving it.</li>
            <li>And the best part is that natural and organic ingredients!!!</li>
            <li>Awesome product and very fast accurate service!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these magnificent three...</li>
            <li>Great price,  nicely packaged, quick ship, quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to seeing the long term affects as the 3 ingredients are the best for beautiful skin. :)</li>
            <li>So many great reviews because.... they basically offer a free product for a review.  </li>
            <li>It feels great on the skin and works quick.</li>
            <li>but it really does give my skin what it needs to get to its most perfect state.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a wonderful and safe way to keep your skin looking youthful and fast.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin and this product was just perfect, no allergic reactions!</li>
            <li>I recommended them this Organic Liquid Facelift and we&#x27;ll see which one will look the most prettier after using it! :)</li>
            <li>But so far, I&#x27;m very happy with what I see!</li>
            <li>My face looks brighter and has a nice healthy nourished glow.</li>
            <li>They were looking through a bright light and magnifying glass.</li>
            <li>After applying all three products I noticed that my skin was super soft and bright, like I&#x27;d have a really wonderful night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great solution to salon facelift procedures, try this Organic Liquid Facelift first.</li>
            <li>It soaks in fairly well, though for comparison, I have unique skin that doesn&#x27;t absorb most serums fully.</li>
            <li>I noticed a very light citrusy aroma, and the product was also in gel form and came with a dropper.</li>
            <li>These serums are very light and do not have a fragrance- which works well for me.  </li>
            <li>The organic facelift is very light and non sticky.</li>
            <li>and it goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>So amazed for the shipment, very fast!!!</li>
            <li>As I have said before, I have had the best and fastest results after using your product in just two short weeks.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to reorder and never run out now that I have seen the difference using all three serums has made in my appearance.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this combo</li>

            <li>Glad that the Hyaluronic Acid has vitamin C in it, and that</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different things and this works great!</li>
            <li>I am 64 and like so many try everything, but as we age, our skin grows thinner</li>
            <li>I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and do my best to take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended others to your site as this is a better price than others with 5 star ratings.</li>
            <li>Of course it says most results occur in 30 days-</li>
            <li>I love that for the price of one, I got three products.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t have as many as the others</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks, my acne was more under control</li>
            <li>LOVE  </li>
            <li>Wrinkles are flattening out and my skin feels much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with continued use</li>
            <li>My face is like caved in on the sides where I have lost most of my collagen.</li>

            <li>My skintone became more even and dewy.</li>
            <li>It does what naps are supposed to do, giving you that relaxed, flushed, satisfied look.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better already</li>
            <li>Because we all know many don&#x27;t work!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, it did seem to give my skin a healthy glow</li>
            <li>Finally, I&#x27;m more than happy to say this product really works.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product faithfully until the magic stops.</li>
            <li>but as of tonight - I love it..    </li>
            <li>but I am so glad I ended up getting this product.  </li>
            <li>This will surely help</li>
            <li>but this is so real and of what I experienced.</li>
            <li>Love touching my face all the time.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel after I use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I listened.</li>
            <li>Similar to my experience using this brands product for cellulite removal - I am equally impressed.  </li>
            <li>These products are just OK in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I like the process of all three - I am satisfied with product</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the cost and the trio lasted me a full two months using it twice a day every day.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years of age and stays healthy with eatng healthy as well.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin feels softer and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>My face looks and feels better than it has since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m really pleased with the results, my skin is noticeably firmer &amp; smoother &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many things, but the combination of the three hit the spot.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and softer and my skin tone looks more even.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m not stupid, I ordered another set today!</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m writing a good review not because they&#x27;re giving away a free full size bottle of organic Vit C Serum</li>
            <li>I waited a full month before writing this review because I value the reviews on her and wanted to give an honest posting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Telling me I look beautiful and that my skin has a young looking glow....</li>
            <li>My wife is so ecstatic and my 22-year-old daughter who doesn&#x27;t need anything to look beautiful are completely hooked on these products.</li>
            <li>Laugh line is going away, smoother and clearer skin!!</li>
            <li>so excited for their give away!</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of three products in one; It does NOT leave the skin greasy, and blends easily...</li>
            <li>Best for me though, is that it leaves such a smooth and dewy canvas for either tinted sunscreen or foundation.</li>
            <li>I was offered this Organic Liquid Facelift for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it.  </li>
            <li>It all works great and there is no strong scent, which is great for something that&#x27;s going to be on your face all day.</li>
            <li>The wife really likes the way her skin feels, and how bright her complexion is.  </li>
            <li>I find that with many creams, my foundation will not go over them smoothly.  </li>
            <li>but so far no problems just great results.</li>
            <li>many are from free samples.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and has a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>This is the full package of skincare!</li>
            <li>These products are the best, and tried other products like everyone else.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy free gift love this product</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>no  surgery , no needle and so easy to use .</li>
            <li>Additionally, the retinol was clumpy and didn&#x27;t dispense easily with the dropper.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no odor.</li>
            <li>but they are so easy.</li>
            <li>I love that they are organic products for such a great price.</li>
            <li>I just received the Organic Liquid Facelift - which came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend all three product.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin be sure to put a good moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li>(The c &amp; e serum) just as good as the high end well known product.</li>
            <li>The products feel light and clean and make-up applies beautifully on top of it.</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best product I&#x27;ve tried in years.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine now.  </li>
            <li>After a week, my fine lines were gone.</li>
            <li>For less than $30, this is a great deal!</li>
            <li>Immediately after applying the fine lines and wrinkles disappeared.</li>
            <li>It takes, according to the manufacturer, 30 days to see results and up to 6 months for maximum results, so all the previous reviews are suspect at best.  </li>
            <li>but i love the smells of this one , that its natural, and my favorite part is it clears blackheads!</li>
            <li>shipping was very fast !!</li>
            <li>I am excited to continue the 3 bottle application process for a full month, can&#x27;t wait to see the continued results!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product which is great value for money and has made my skin feel and look younger!</li>
            <li>and I already seen huge differences in the way my skin feels and the softness of it.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this, so much</li>
            <li>Overall it is a great product that I have recommended to all my friends.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that they are organic and chemical free.  </li>
            <li>Ordered these for my mom and she was amazed by how smooth her skin feels now.  </li>
            <li>I bought this trio at a fantastic price and have been using it for almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>and I have seen fabulous results.</li>
            <li>I experienced discomfort around my eyes for several days.  </li>
            <li>This is a great combination of facial serums.</li>
            <li>They go on really smoothly</li>
            <li>Like that it is oganic, hope that it is also gmo free.</li>
            <li>It all went on smoothly; I am using it on my hands as well as face and neck.</li>
            <li>Also, think it says something of the company confidence in their product to offer free product ....</li>
            <li>So I tried each separately and each one, turned my skin light read and blotchy.</li>
            <li>This worked fabulously with the needle stamp.</li>
            <li>This product did a fantastic job rejuvenating my face and smoothing over the lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I bought it just a week ago and already my skin looks fabulous and I am going without makeup already.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and feels tighter.</li>
            <li>My field of damns I give for anti aging products was barren until now but with this, it flourishes mightily.</li>
            <li>So smooth and</li>
            <li>now hat my face is smooth again.</li>
            <li>They are organic, chemical free and do seem to give your complexion</li>
            <li>just smooth</li>
            <li>I literally get compliments about how great my skin looks on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>will give this product a good six months &amp; only discontinue if I don&#x27;t see more results.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>so I thought they were just trying to make me feel good, but they insisted that they &amp;#34;saw a lot of skin&amp;#34; and they would have guessed I was in my early fifties.</li>
            <li>The funny thing is that I see it too!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Raw Biology is just the BEST!!!!!</li>
            <li>got this for my 70 yr old mother who is beautiful but discovered the &amp;#34;joy&amp;#34; of Facebook selfies and wanted to plumpify her skin before she&#x27;d be ready for the camera, Mr. DeMille.</li>
            <li>Also the seller was very easy to work with and very reliable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you try these amazing products,</li>
            <li>The company however is FANTASTIC for customer service, when my shipment got lost, they stepped right up and helped!</li>
            <li>Just the way that it absorbs so quickly and completely convinced me my skin loved it.</li>
            <li>, it’s fragrance free, the price, and the reviews were for the most part positive.  </li>
            <li>Use it morning and night, religiously and you will see amazing results!</li>
            <li>I do not feel as if I will have significant irritation.  </li>
            <li>I really am not disappointed in these.  </li>
            <li>I now await my free full size bottle of organic vitamin c serum.  </li>
            <li>Feel fresh and pump with my skin after using three every day, like them all!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to begin using these products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to keep</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>Unbelievable, the best product of this type I have tried in years.</li>
            <li>Got my order super quick!  </li>
            <li>I am most impressed, however, that these products do not irritate or dry out my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>In order to test the product I stopped using my original cream over the trio and was extremely happy to find that my skin did not appear dry at all.  </li>
            <li>The products are easily applied and quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I am sure others will have positive results from these products.  </li>
            <li>While there, the surgeon as well as the physician&#x27;s assistant, both commented on what amazing skin I had and how young I looked for my age!</li>
            <li>At first i didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, I was looking for the best routine for my face considering i break out in the same place over and over.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to know that I&#x27;m putting such a great natural and organic product on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product especially for the price and fast shipping also!</li>
            <li>I had been using a similar product that I absolutely loved, but my sunscreen or makeup would &#x27;pill&#x27; over it.</li>
            <li>When you use the derma roller these serums will get deeper into the skin and you will get the full benefits.</li>
            <li>Thanks :-)</li>
            <li>have been using these for 3 mths now along with a good supply of organic aloe and a natural &amp;#34;tan physics&amp;#34; indoor tanning lotion and have many compliments on my colour and clarity of my young looking face for my age.</li>
            <li>I love this set and have recommended it to others who are also using it at a reasonable price of about $39.00.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know many who will pay that much.  </li>
            <li>the initials AD for this posting, rather than my full name.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife and she seems to have really loved the product enough for me to purchase it again.</li>
            <li>overall seems good and beneficial.</li>
            <li>This is better on your face and really works.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good quality product for their daily skin care.</li>
            <li>I read it may take up to 6 months to see full results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my whole skin look better.</li>
            <li>I love the product, I highly recommend Organic Facelift!</li>
            <li>I started by using the vitamin c products in this range and the three pack combination was such a good deal that I tried using them together.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered my second set since the instructions states 27 days for skin to rebuild and repair, 6 months for optimum results.  </li>
            <li>Of course, everybody&#x27;s skin is different and there&#x27;s no miracle &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; for aging skin, but these serums have been as good as some of the moisturizers and treatments I&#x27;ve thrown money at.</li>
            <li>I also do facial yoga, so at 52, I am still looking really good, with almost no wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I really like how quickly these sink into my skin so I can add moisturizer on top about 1 minute after application.</li>
            <li>Wish all of them came with a pump (only the Organic Vitamin C one does), but otherwise an excellent set overall.</li>
            <li>Having ordered it several times, I am obviously most pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using all three of these exceptional serums for several weeks.</li>
            <li>but my skin drank it up quickly.</li>
            <li>Just received my order of Organic Liquid Facelift and can&#x27;t wait to use it and see quick results.</li>
            <li>The formulas soak in quickly so you can do the rest of your skincare morning and night.</li>
            <li>I have recently ordered more of these outstanding products.  </li>
            <li>after using this three Serums my skin very dewy &amp; very smooth, very much like it..</li>
            <li>I am a native Floridian with fare skin, and light eyes and hair and have been an avid sun person all my life.</li>
            <li>Usually with so many celebrity endorsements, something like this is too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Thanks to raw biology for an awesome range of products.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and think that most users will get an excellent result, so long as it is used regularly to add collagen to aging skin and allow it to rejuvenate.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great so far &amp; hoping for more results soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my new skin .</li>
            <li>I really like to constituency &amp; how easily it absorbs.</li>
            <li>Plus my skin is very sensitive, but these products felt refreshing and didn&#x27;t sting at all.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for your product!!</li>
            <li>Stellar customer service, I just wish the items would have worked as well on my skin!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so excited to use the product, for the first used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what these products are capable of!!</li>
            <li>The darker spots on my face are not the first thing I see in the mirror anymore!  </li>
            <li>&gt; the trio is very light not heavy at all .</li>
            <li>overall skin tone is getting more even and fine lines are reduced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We will definitely reorder this amazing product.</li>
            <li>After some research I found this amazing product which I&#x27;m using last two weeks.</li>
            <li>This is a must have all in one set, the collection of these three products are amazing and will be the only thing you need to take care of your skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>I am experiencing amazing results and will definitely continue to use products from this vendor.</li>
            <li>Make up go on better and skin has been clear.</li>
            <li>I have tried lots and lots of things but this product makes my skin look clear, glow and more refreshed/</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a fresh, tightening feel upon application and brings a brightness to my face immediately  </li>
            <li>I started using all three products in the Trinity set as soon as I received them and after only a week, my skin feels so smooth and my makeup goes on even better than it did when I used a makeup primer.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin is much more sensitive when it comes to eyebrow waxing.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see that it actually worked.</li>
            <li>Deals are a rare find; this, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>and I love that the products are natural.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial products I&#x27;ve used in a long time and it does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>Wow, absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li>For 53 years old, I do not have many wrinkles</li>
            <li>I love natural products and my skin does too.  </li>
            <li>Will update after longer use but am pleased so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it morning and night on a freshly washed face.</li>
            <li>face - Using these products has considerably transformed the tone, firmness and clarity of my skin, significantly evening out the patchiness and fine lines from my years of sunbathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>daily and nightly routine are pretty much the same, cleanse, tone and apply this wonderful organic liquid facelift.  </li>
            <li>Also, the price is right.</li>
            <li>We are happy with the Raw Biology Liquid Facelift set.  </li>
            <li>I have a positive attitude towards these products that&#x27;s why I gave it 5 stars!</li>
            <li>I use Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner-Rose Petal (found it on Amazon) with a cotton ball to clean my face gently and then use the Organic Liquid Facelift.</li>
            <li>I am grateful to find they are fragrance free because I am very sensitive to smells so that was a bonus!</li>
            <li>You can not beat the price on this product leaves my skin feeling silky smooth, my  skin really is hydrated, smooth and soft right after application, serums truly are instantly absorbed,  does not leave the oily feeling on you skin,</li>
            <li>I have always wondered about reviews and how true they are, but guess what, I am writing one now because this product really works.</li>
            <li>No magic improvement at this time, but face feels great when on.</li>
            <li>My face look shiny and fresh in the first week.</li>
            <li>My husband couldn&#x27;t believe how great my skin has looked this past week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Trinity now for about 3 weeks and am loving how smooth and tight my skin feels and looks.  </li>
            <li>These do not add up to other products of the same type and Iv&#x27;e tried many, bargains and high end$$$. Best so far for the money is cosmetic skin solutions.</li>
            <li>It is amazing to find a skin care line that covers all of my problem areas, e.g., fine lines, stretch marks and uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li>nice side effect of using this is the acid caused my face to clear up, or minimize adult acne and blemishes.</li>
            <li>So light and smooth makes my skin feel tighter and younger looking thank u</li>
            <li>Received product and have only used a few days but my skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great quality products at a very reasonable price, considering I have very sensitive skin and am prone to bouts of psoriasis, using new products on my skin can cause problems, quite the opposite with this range.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and light.</li>
            <li>I have been using these three products religiously and have seen a significant improvement in fine lines around my eyes that have all but disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I will be recommending to all my friends, very reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>you so very much for taking 10 years off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annabelle  .</li>
            <li>Just received my products in the mail, an have only used it once, but I can say that the packaging is very nice, as for the actual product</li>
            <li>Thank you Raw Biology for making such an awesome organic product!</li>
            <li>It is far better than any high quality brand that you have to pay a fortune for, and find out it</li>
            <li>Definitely will have an amazing results,  lots of compliment with my face looking younger and distinguish the more I get older.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive fair skin and didn&#x27;t have much success with other serums.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Trinity for a month and was amazed by the texture of my skin in the first week.</li>
            <li>skin has never looked better and I just ordered a second set.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend a try!!</li>
            <li>this is the first time I have EVER done one.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a month and the difference in my skin is amazing...getting ready to place another order!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>As a 20 year old I know how important it is to get your anti aging routine started before all the wrinkles starts to get to you.  </li>
            <li>I see visible results with the plumped out wrinkles, even hydration under my eyes and overall better skin color and tone.  </li>
            <li>Love this group of skin care starting to see a difference as well as how my skin feels!!</li>
            <li>so I should definitely see more improvement over time.</li>
            <li>I wish for more information about the individual products, but I&#x27;ve been using them anyway, and my skin seems to be brighter and plumper already.</li>
            <li>I wish the bottles were bigger and will be ordering more product soon.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to finally have found something that works</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and chemical free.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the product about 2 weeks and am absolutely amazed!</li>
            <li>My skin not only looks better but feels more elastic and younger.</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant about ordering as I was concerned that three products on my face would make my skin feel coated and smothered but that concern disappeared after the first use.</li>
            <li>And overall just better glow or something.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about this trio of magic in a bottle...</li>
            <li>But the better part is you can actually see the results it&#x27;s been almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Really notice a difference in my skin being healthier and looking smoother!</li>
            <li>it seems to work better than using each one individually.</li>
            <li>I Love this product, my face feels brighter and softer after only a week.</li>
            <li>The Retinol with Hyaluronic and Vitamin E is on the thicker side but absorbs well after using the first 2 serums.</li>
            <li>These three products really do add moisture to your face!</li>
            <li>I have used many different C serums and mixes.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried, my skin is softer and definitely fresher looking.  </li>
            <li>the puffiness around my eyes has most definitely reduced.</li>
            <li>It took me awhile to get used to the routine application , but now I love the way my skin looks and feels and look forward to that clean fresh skin everyday.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I have added this to my daily routine for a little under 2 months now, and the results are just incredible.</li>
            <li>My wife has gone through her first order of the Organic Vitamin C Serum and enjoyed the product so much that she has ordered her second bottle today.</li>
            <li>I just received my order and am always excited to try natural and organic products.  </li>
            <li>Not as effective as other brands I have purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very light and moisturizing sinks right into the skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these products for four months and have noticed positive changes in my skin--smoother texture, fewer wrinkles, and firmer skin.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side, my skin does look plumper and tighter.</li>
            <li>After reading the positive reviews, I decided to place an order on March 13,2015,for the Organic LIQUID FACELIFT.</li>
            <li>the thank you card I got was extremely positive.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a super long way, so great value as well.</li>
            <li>They go on smoothly and dry quickly</li>
            <li>I like all the products- easy to apply and not overtly affected by added colors or scents as OTC lotions and facial treatments.  </li>
            <li>age is 53, non smoker, healthy, dry space, can&#x27;t sunbathe, water once a day,</li>
            <li>I will certainly order again</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>and I do think this will be a staple in my routine- of course once in a while trying the next new things - or more stronger serums from the doctor -</li>
            <li>Ordered this product based on reviews only to discover that all the positive reviews were a result of the promise of a free bottle of the Vitamin C serum in exchange for a review submitted within a fews days of receiving the shipment.</li>
            <li>My fine lines and wrinkles have definitely diminished along with the age enlarged pores.</li>
            <li>Can definitely tell a difference in my skin tone and the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>this is did remove my fine lines or the appearance of them though I used it twice daily as instructed and never missed a day till it was gone.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a different in my fine lines while using this product.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, well stored and packaged.</li>
            <li>I have been using this trio for a little over a month, and while I have not yet experienced any long-term changes or line reductions, I do like the daily smoothing and hydrating it provides.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, I have been using &amp;#34;The Trinity&amp;#34; for 3 months now and have seen terrific results.&lt;br /&gt; The customer service I have received has been above and beyond&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this I had a few improvements but now its amazing.</li>
            <li>A few days later she mentioned how great her skin looked and felt.</li>
            <li>It.made a huge difference having that third bottle in the set!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products!  </li>
            <li>so much so that I had to just share it with my sisters by sending them some pictures of mine and they have already ordered theirs.....</li>
            <li>Loooove this products and so much easier to put on than what you think.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>The combo of the 3 while seems like a lot to put on your face at one time, soaks in and leaves the skin smooth and with an instant refreshed feeling and glow.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product two times to give a reasonable time and I did not see any difference.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like doctors, hospitals and surgeries.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that it is organic</li>
            <li>My breakouts were fewer and lasted a much shorter time.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much with wrinkles at this point but am holding&lt;br /&gt;onto</li>
            <li>I do notice how well they really worked.</li>
            <li>I was having problems with wrinkles on my forehead and this product really help eliminate the wrinkles that I was getting.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a product that really works.</li>
            <li>have not seen any real results yet</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 weeks  now and really haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference</li>
            <li>When I apply it to my face with my fingertips, I then smooth the excess onto the front of my neck and the back of each hand.  </li>
            <li>I still get carded the package is protected very well.</li>
            <li>These are really great!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really recommend.</li>
            <li>and the vitamin C pump smells straight up like urine.&lt;br /&gt;other</li>
            <li>Getting ready to order another three.  </li>
            <li>Works fast.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This will post under my husband&#x27;s name (we share the account), but I really wanted to write a review of this product.  </li>
            <li>Should have read the reviews more carefully as I would have realized</li>
            <li>I really like all three products.</li>
            <li>I think that to be really specific about this product is to add important informations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps it penetrate and really build the collagen.</li>
            <li>The serums are plenty moisturizing and gentle around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am very</li>
            <li>Absolutely five stars based upon quality and value for money.  </li>
            <li>Product as described fast ship</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for men and women alike!</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Thanks for saving me so much money.</li>
            <li>I did think I wou receive so fast.</li>
            <li>The difference is very noticeable to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>Shipping fast.  </li>
            <li>much smoother look and feel.  </li>
            <li>After only 3 days of using these products my skin looks and feels smooth as well as brighter.</li>
            <li>Fast and efficient delivery.</li>
            <li>but once I started using this product it has helped so much, making it feel smoother.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I will diffently be ordering more when I get close to empty.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>These are really making a difference in my skin texture.</li>
            <li>is much firmer and brighter&lt;</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much of this product.</li>
            <li>For the price it’s really a win/win.  </li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds and hundred of dollars trying to find skin care that makes any kind of difference on my extremely sensitive, acne prone, aging skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed results immediately and my skin is left soft to the touch and more youthful.</li>
            <li>It is nice to finally see a product that actually delivers what it says it will.</li>
            <li>Thank you from a new long term satisfied</li>
            <li>I have a scar under my right eye that is completely disappearing.</li>
            <li>I want to look good and young as long as possible</li>
            <li>I purchased based on high reviews that I found out had to do with a promise of a free product as I was sent the same flyer.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing how fast it works and the results are unbelievable.</li>
            <li>My skin became more firm, softer, smoother and the wrinkles on my forehead diminished after the first application.</li>
            <li>So the bottom line is they have more active ingredient at about a quarter of the cost of the stuff they were using before.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a premium product without paying exorbitant department store prices.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different facial serums and creams that claim to do so much</li>
            <li>The best thing I find about all of the products from raw biology (and I also use the cellulite removal cream) is that they are not hugely potent.  </li>
            <li>I am 45 years old with fine lines from sun damage gained from deploying to the desert several times in addition to blowing winds.</li>
            <li>I did think it was odd that so many people reviewed the product immediately after receiving it.</li>
            <li>and sometimes my skin gets lightly burned and feels dry</li>
            <li>Face feels so smooth and soft just after using them for a short time!  </li>
            <li>My skin is a lot smoother and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased these for hydrating purposes, and they do just that.</li>
            <li>I am a very busy women with 5 daughters, I don&#x27;t have much time to think about me</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and packaging was of a high standard.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so anticipating a positive results with what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li>You do need to wear a high SPF when using these serums.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for ladies.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these serums to everyone.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this skin care line.</li>
            <li>- i highly recommend giving this brand a try.</li>
            <li>I have been using these products for 4 weeks and all I can say is WOW!!</li>
            <li>She has noticed slight changes, for the first couple of weeks and is excited to make another purchase for them when her supply runs out.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>hope, fine lines, the &#x27;gentle creases&#x27; I suppose, have slightly been helped.</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin feel soft after applying</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much of a chance to try them, but here&#x27;s what I know so far</li>
            <li>my skin looks more plump, not sure it takes away the wrinkles ( but does anything really)</li>
            <li>Normally I am a proactiv girl</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed in just the first two days was how my pores had shrunk considerably, that for me was  big</li>
            <li>I think that I should have bought these for my friends for Christmas instead of the keepsake ornaments I normally buy.</li>
            <li>I love it, after  less than a month I have noticed results!</li>
            <li>Had to send back, broke my face out, but I have super sensitive skin, so for me it didnt work</li>
            <li>/&gt;It soaks in quickly and the change in the quality of your skin is near instant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for ten days and have noticeable results and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin, but I read the positive reviews , from others with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use this trio morning and night and for the first three or four nights I applied my original organic retinol cream last because I felt my face would be too dry.  </li>
            <li>I have melasma pretty much all over my face, and while I know it will never go completely away, it is such a relief to have found a product that lightens and brightens my skin.</li>
            <li>I know it can take time for your skin to get use to new products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to say it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m using this new serum.  </li>
            <li>I am new to using skin care products and feel like I hit the jackpot with this set.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with all of the Raw Biology products that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>I will def buy more from Raw Biology again.</li>
            <li>After that, I applied the Raw Biology Hyaluronic Acid plus Vitamin C and also noticed that it absorbed quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>As my skin has aged, the lack of elasticity makes the scarring more obvious.</li>
            <li>I must add that I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic and am amazed that it has replaced my usual creams and moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have used many creams in the past but nothing compares to Organic Facelift.</li>
            <li>This plumps the skin, thereby making the fine lines less visible.</li>
            <li>In just a few short weeks, I can already see and feel that my skin looks better, is smoother and more firm.</li>
            <li>I can see less wrinkles and smooth lines.  </li>
            <li>My light wrinkles are less visible and my skin feels smoother and healthier.  </li>
            <li>I have never considered using any supplemental skincare products until now; I was particularly interested in these products given their organic certification, transparent ingredient list and that they include only natural preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the vitamin c in particular because I had a dark spot below each eyebrow and they were darkening to the piont where concealer did not cover adequately.  </li>
            <li>its very easy to use a little too much at times of this and the retinol gets used ahead of the other two.</li>
            <li>Skin feels tight and smooth after application.  </li>
            <li>The clear gel and the green bottle made my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I was unsure which order to use the products in as its not made that clear but after speaking to customer service - I was reassured.  </li>
            <li>My skin became cleaner, clear and smoother.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much so far.  </li>
            <li>There is a bit of lift (eyelids), and my skin of my face feels soft and it looks brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li>I see why this is considered an &amp;#34;All-in One&amp;#34; set, it tightens and lifts but also makes my face feel so soft afterward.</li>
            <li>I am hoping they are completely gone in a couple more&lt;</li>
            <li>but discovered my skin was too sensitive for these products.  </li>
            <li>I guess my skin is more delicate than even I realized.  </li>
            <li>so if you are sensitive to fragrance these shouldn&#x27;t bother your skin.</li>
            <li>and it is not heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>I was truly surprised with the immediate results.</li>
            <li>The result is soft feeling skin</li>
            <li>It truly is a natural facelift.</li>
            <li>After working almost 10 hours yesterday, I got home and my husband of 25 years hugged me and said &amp;#34;You&#x27;ve been looking just phenomenal lately.  </li>
            <li>Although the manufacturer recommends use twice daily, it will depend on your ability to tolerate that much hyaluronic acid on your face.</li>
            <li>I paid for the product, is that I like the product so far.</li>
            <li>My skin felt really soft afterwards,I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does with prolonged usage.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>But the truth is I can see a very noticeable difference, big time!</li>
            <li>I just started using this product and so far</li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth and glowing for a few application.</li>
            <li>so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and rejuvinated.</li>
            <li>This regime is quite extradinary in that can feel the action of each liquid upon application.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely be purchasing this again and adding to my daily skin routine!</li>
            <li>Tried the vitamin C so far</li>
            <li>My scars are diminished, pores clear and minimized, overall healthy glow and firm tone....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used for a few days but my skin looks and feels better.</li>
            <li>I did not have a big problem with it, but I rarely notice break-outs at all, now that I regularly use this</li>
            <li>It is certainly too soon to see any dramatic effects, but based on the other reviews, and what I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of noticing so far, I know my skin is headed in a good direction.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see how results are after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>I am slightly starting to get these fine lines, crows feet and slight wrinkles</li>
            <li>I do wish instructions came with them because I do not know if it matters which lotion you put on first, second, and then third.</li>
            <li>I am 43 and had considerably good skin throughout my years, these past few have made up for the all that had passed me by.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low, read 10000000 reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li>I spent my whole life able to go about without makeup, but the last year, my skin was uneven looking, even with the serums I was using.</li>
            <li>Still waiting for the full results, at four weeks - so far, my face and neck skin is slightly firmer (especially around the upper eyelids) and fine lines are less noticable.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product last week, received it the next day, and it&#x27;s already showing positive results.</li>
            <li>First off, I am not on a quest for the fountain of youth, so I never really bought a lot of serums and potions and lotions to wage war against my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have seen such great results over the past few weeks that I now can&#x27;t imagine not having them as part of my daily skincare regime.</li>
            <li>I was being helped by a District Manager and I told him that I have problems with my face being dry and peeling and that I have been using a product that i bought off Amazon from Raw Biology to get it better.  </li>
            <li>Very absorbent, and doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry after use.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention that they really do reduce the appearance of wrinkles and uneven skin tones, giving your complexion a much smoother look and feel.  </li>
            <li>It has definitely helped clear up my face and old acne scars are fading away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>product is fantastic, cannot wait to see the progression of my skin over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li>With all the natural ingredients used, my sensitive face is not breaking out in a rash which is a big relief.</li>
            <li>So, being somewhat skeptical, I asked my Medical Doctor who specializes in skin treatments if this would be a good product to try</li>
            <li>Skin tone is impruving, face feels very soft  and looks 5 years younger.</li>
            <li>and I am already seeing major improvements.</li>
            <li>No one wants loose or sagging skin.</li>
            <li>I use this trio as my main facial routine, twice daily.</li>
            <li>And the Vit C works super super well on uneven belly skin from past pregnancies.</li>
            <li>It is a little drying, but I use my regular SPF moisturizer with it; with no bad effects.  </li>
            <li>My teen son is using this to clear up his acne</li>
            <li>My pores around my chin area get clotted and drab looking, and I am starting to see this area clear up and feel softer.  </li>
            <li>Now at 4 weeks, my face is tighter, softer, smoother and the lines are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m too old to be looking for a face lift in a bottle, I can say that these three bottles brought a luminosity to my skin and made my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 and dealing with medical issues that compound the natural aging process that we all are going through.  </li>
            <li>I have only just begun using this product and like the results so far.  </li>
            <li>Am not really into the whole organic thingy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended my secret to many people.</li>
            <li>I have tried and spent a lot of money on other products for my skin care and and having sensitive skin , I know right away if something will work or not .</li>
            <li>and then I applied the Raw Biology Retinol 2% plus Hyaluronic and Vitamin E on my face and noticed how quickly it absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have never used Hyaluronic acid or Retinol before, then you may see more dramatic results than I did.  </li>
            <li>was really surprised it would do that because I have order several different brands</li>
            <li>It is much smoother and the wrinkles seem to be going away and dark spots are lightening.</li>
            <li>is noticeable within the first few day.</li>
            <li>So glad I gave Raw Biology a shot!!!  </li>
            <li>but I always have a mild breakout, at least.</li>
            <li>After cleansing skin, apply first serum and wait a few minutes then add the next product, eventually using all 3.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product kit especially if you have combination skin and are in lower 40s with blemishes or any scaring both surgical and a slight acne scar, fine lines and crows feet.</li>
            <li>The overall glow of my skin from the vitamin C has made a huge difference in my overall complexion and has made my skin go from appearing dull to looking renewed and refreshed!</li>
            <li>The retinol is a little too much for my skin every night.</li>
            <li>Customer service was amazing,  I received my order with one broken bottle (it was packaged fine, we have just had an extremely cold winter here in Maine and the Vitamin C froze and broke).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 8th week and still on my first bottles, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive due to different prescription medicine I have to take and this has had no reaction.  </li>

            <li> and i will be honest</li>
            <li> Nice texture to the products.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> All thoughts, opinions, and experiences are my own.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was doing any good, but I had to go to a dermatological surgeon for a suspicious growth.</li>
            <li> it seems kind of watery</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product because of the reviews and price and honestly I wanted to give my best review</li>
            <li> it was nicely done.</li>
            <li> shipped to me fast what a great product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am loving what I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li> I honestly can not say it works or does not work because I quit using it after three trys.  </li>
            <li> Loving it.</li>
            <li> And the best part is that natural and organic ingredients!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and very fast accurate service!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these magnificent three...</li>
            <li> Great price,  nicely packaged, quick ship, quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to seeing the long term affects as the 3 ingredients are the best for beautiful skin. :)</li>
            <li> So many great reviews because.... they basically offer a free product for a review.  </li>
            <li> It feels great on the skin and works quick.</li>
            <li> but it really does give my skin what it needs to get to its most perfect state.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a wonderful and safe way to keep your skin looking youthful and fast.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin and this product was just perfect, no allergic reactions!</li>
            <li> I recommended them this Organic Liquid Facelift and we&#x27;ll see which one will look the most prettier after using it! :)</li>
            <li> But so far, I&#x27;m very happy with what I see!</li>
            <li> My face looks brighter and has a nice healthy nourished glow.</li>
            <li> They were looking through a bright light and magnifying glass.</li>
            <li> After applying all three products I noticed that my skin was super soft and bright, like I&#x27;d have a really wonderful night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great solution to salon facelift procedures, try this Organic Liquid Facelift first.</li>
            <li> It soaks in fairly well, though for comparison, I have unique skin that doesn&#x27;t absorb most serums fully.</li>
            <li> I noticed a very light citrusy aroma, and the product was also in gel form and came with a dropper.</li>
            <li> These serums are very light and do not have a fragrance- which works well for me.  </li>
            <li> The organic facelift is very light and non sticky.</li>
            <li> and it goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> So amazed for the shipment, very fast!!!</li>
            <li> As I have said before, I have had the best and fastest results after using your product in just two short weeks.</li>
            <li> I will be sure to reorder and never run out now that I have seen the difference using all three serums has made in my appearance.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>

            <li> I will never use another facial product again - and the price is excellent too.</li>
            <li> I also really love the fact that the product is Organic.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic, I don&#x27;t have any reaction(yeah!)  </li>
            <li> Also I use these on my hands at night and the texture and dryness is better from the Vit C on my hands too.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed fewer break-outs and skin seems more even-toned and glowing.</li>
            <li> and I look forward to more products from you guys.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are organic and I feel confident in applying them to my skin.  </li>
            <li> A fraction of the cost of Skincueticals and way better results.</li>
            <li> I was happy with fast shipping</li>
            <li> and I am sure I will order it again when I finish..</li>
            <li> My skintone became more even and dewy.</li>
            <li> It does what naps are supposed to do, giving you that relaxed, flushed, satisfied look.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better already</li>
            <li> Because we all know many don&#x27;t work!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, it did seem to give my skin a healthy glow</li>
            <li> Finally, I&#x27;m more than happy to say this product really works.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product faithfully until the magic stops.</li>
            <li> but as of tonight - I love it..    </li>
            <li> but I am so glad I ended up getting this product.  </li>
            <li> This will surely help</li>
            <li> but this is so real and of what I experienced.</li>
            <li> Love touching my face all the time.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel after I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I listened.</li>
            <li> Similar to my experience using this brands product for cellulite removal - I am equally impressed.  </li>
            <li> These products are just OK in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I like the process of all three - I am satisfied with product</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the cost and the trio lasted me a full two months using it twice a day every day.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years of age and stays healthy with eatng healthy as well.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin feels softer and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels better than it has since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m really pleased with the results, my skin is noticeably firmer &amp; smoother &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many things, but the combination of the three hit the spot.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and softer and my skin tone looks more even.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not stupid, I ordered another set today!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m writing a good review not because they&#x27;re giving away a free full size bottle of organic Vit C Serum</li>
            <li> I waited a full month before writing this review because I value the reviews on her and wanted to give an honest posting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Telling me I look beautiful and that my skin has a young looking glow....</li>
            <li> My wife is so ecstatic and my 22-year-old daughter who doesn&#x27;t need anything to look beautiful are completely hooked on these products.</li>
            <li> Laugh line is going away, smoother and clearer skin!!</li>
            <li> so excited for their give away!</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of three products in one; It does NOT leave the skin greasy, and blends easily...</li>
            <li> Best for me though, is that it leaves such a smooth and dewy canvas for either tinted sunscreen or foundation.</li>
            <li> I was offered this Organic Liquid Facelift for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it.  </li>
            <li> It all works great and there is no strong scent, which is great for something that&#x27;s going to be on your face all day.</li>
            <li> The wife really likes the way her skin feels, and how bright her complexion is.  </li>
            <li> I find that with many creams, my foundation will not go over them smoothly.  </li>
            <li> but so far no problems just great results.</li>
            <li> many are from free samples.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and has a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> This is the full package of skincare!</li>
            <li> These products are the best, and tried other products like everyone else.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy free gift love this product</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> no  surgery , no needle and so easy to use .</li>
            <li> Additionally, the retinol was clumpy and didn&#x27;t dispense easily with the dropper.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no odor.</li>
            <li> but they are so easy.</li>
            <li> I love that they are organic products for such a great price.</li>
            <li> I just received the Organic Liquid Facelift - which came very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend all three product.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin be sure to put a good moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> (The c &amp; e serum) just as good as the high end well known product.</li>
            <li> The products feel light and clean and make-up applies beautifully on top of it.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best product I&#x27;ve tried in years.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine now.  </li>
            <li> After a week, my fine lines were gone.</li>
            <li> For less than $30, this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Immediately after applying the fine lines and wrinkles disappeared.</li>
            <li> It takes, according to the manufacturer, 30 days to see results and up to 6 months for maximum results, so all the previous reviews are suspect at best.  </li>
            <li> but i love the smells of this one , that its natural, and my favorite part is it clears blackheads!</li>
            <li> shipping was very fast !!</li>
            <li> I am excited to continue the 3 bottle application process for a full month, can&#x27;t wait to see the continued results!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product which is great value for money and has made my skin feel and look younger!</li>
            <li> and I already seen huge differences in the way my skin feels and the softness of it.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this, so much</li>
            <li> Overall it is a great product that I have recommended to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that they are organic and chemical free.  </li>
            <li> Ordered these for my mom and she was amazed by how smooth her skin feels now.  </li>
            <li> I bought this trio at a fantastic price and have been using it for almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> and I have seen fabulous results.</li>
            <li> I experienced discomfort around my eyes for several days.  </li>
            <li> This is a great combination of facial serums.</li>
            <li> They go on really smoothly</li>
            <li> Like that it is oganic, hope that it is also gmo free.</li>
            <li> It all went on smoothly; I am using it on my hands as well as face and neck.</li>
            <li> Also, think it says something of the company confidence in their product to offer free product ....</li>
            <li> So I tried each separately and each one, turned my skin light read and blotchy.</li>
            <li> This worked fabulously with the needle stamp.</li>
            <li> This product did a fantastic job rejuvenating my face and smoothing over the lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought it just a week ago and already my skin looks fabulous and I am going without makeup already.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and feels tighter.</li>
            <li> My field of damns I give for anti aging products was barren until now but with this, it flourishes mightily.</li>
            <li> So smooth and</li>
            <li> now hat my face is smooth again.</li>
            <li> They are organic, chemical free and do seem to give your complexion</li>
            <li> just smooth</li>
            <li> I literally get compliments about how great my skin looks on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> will give this product a good six months &amp; only discontinue if I don&#x27;t see more results.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> so I thought they were just trying to make me feel good, but they insisted that they &amp;#34;saw a lot of skin&amp;#34; and they would have guessed I was in my early fifties.</li>
            <li> The funny thing is that I see it too!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Raw Biology is just the BEST!!!!!</li>
            <li> got this for my 70 yr old mother who is beautiful but discovered the &amp;#34;joy&amp;#34; of Facebook selfies and wanted to plumpify her skin before she&#x27;d be ready for the camera, Mr. DeMille.</li>
            <li> Also the seller was very easy to work with and very reliable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you try these amazing products,</li>
            <li> The company however is FANTASTIC for customer service, when my shipment got lost, they stepped right up and helped!</li>
            <li> Just the way that it absorbs so quickly and completely convinced me my skin loved it.</li>
            <li> , it’s fragrance free, the price, and the reviews were for the most part positive.  </li>
            <li> Use it morning and night, religiously and you will see amazing results!</li>
            <li> I do not feel as if I will have significant irritation.  </li>
            <li> I really am not disappointed in these.  </li>
            <li> I now await my free full size bottle of organic vitamin c serum.  </li>
            <li> Feel fresh and pump with my skin after using three every day, like them all!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to begin using these products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to keep</li>
            <li> Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable, the best product of this type I have tried in years.</li>
            <li> Got my order super quick!  </li>
            <li> I am most impressed, however, that these products do not irritate or dry out my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> In order to test the product I stopped using my original cream over the trio and was extremely happy to find that my skin did not appear dry at all.  </li>
            <li> The products are easily applied and quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I am sure others will have positive results from these products.  </li>
            <li> While there, the surgeon as well as the physician&#x27;s assistant, both commented on what amazing skin I had and how young I looked for my age!</li>
            <li> At first i didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, I was looking for the best routine for my face considering i break out in the same place over and over.</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to know that I&#x27;m putting such a great natural and organic product on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product especially for the price and fast shipping also!</li>
            <li> I had been using a similar product that I absolutely loved, but my sunscreen or makeup would &#x27;pill&#x27; over it.</li>
            <li> When you use the derma roller these serums will get deeper into the skin and you will get the full benefits.</li>
            <li> Thanks :-)</li>
            <li> have been using these for 3 mths now along with a good supply of organic aloe and a natural &amp;#34;tan physics&amp;#34; indoor tanning lotion and have many compliments on my colour and clarity of my young looking face for my age.</li>
            <li> I love this set and have recommended it to others who are also using it at a reasonable price of about $39.00.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know many who will pay that much.  </li>
            <li> the initials AD for this posting, rather than my full name.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she seems to have really loved the product enough for me to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> overall seems good and beneficial.</li>
            <li> This is better on your face and really works.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good quality product for their daily skin care.</li>
            <li> I read it may take up to 6 months to see full results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my whole skin look better.</li>
            <li> I love the product, I highly recommend Organic Facelift!</li>
            <li> I started by using the vitamin c products in this range and the three pack combination was such a good deal that I tried using them together.  </li>
            <li> Just ordered my second set since the instructions states 27 days for skin to rebuild and repair, 6 months for optimum results.  </li>
            <li> Of course, everybody&#x27;s skin is different and there&#x27;s no miracle &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; for aging skin, but these serums have been as good as some of the moisturizers and treatments I&#x27;ve thrown money at.</li>
            <li> I also do facial yoga, so at 52, I am still looking really good, with almost no wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I really like how quickly these sink into my skin so I can add moisturizer on top about 1 minute after application.</li>
            <li> Wish all of them came with a pump (only the Organic Vitamin C one does), but otherwise an excellent set overall.</li>
            <li> Having ordered it several times, I am obviously most pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using all three of these exceptional serums for several weeks.</li>
            <li> but my skin drank it up quickly.</li>
            <li> Just received my order of Organic Liquid Facelift and can&#x27;t wait to use it and see quick results.</li>
            <li> The formulas soak in quickly so you can do the rest of your skincare morning and night.</li>
            <li> I have recently ordered more of these outstanding products.  </li>
            <li> after using this three Serums my skin very dewy &amp; very smooth, very much like it..</li>
            <li> I am a native Floridian with fare skin, and light eyes and hair and have been an avid sun person all my life.</li>
            <li> Usually with so many celebrity endorsements, something like this is too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Thanks to raw biology for an awesome range of products.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and think that most users will get an excellent result, so long as it is used regularly to add collagen to aging skin and allow it to rejuvenate.</li>
            <li> Other than that, great so far &amp; hoping for more results soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my new skin .</li>
            <li> I really like to constituency &amp; how easily it absorbs.</li>
            <li> Plus my skin is very sensitive, but these products felt refreshing and didn&#x27;t sting at all.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for your product!!</li>
            <li> Stellar customer service, I just wish the items would have worked as well on my skin!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so excited to use the product, for the first used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what these products are capable of!!</li>
            <li> The darker spots on my face are not the first thing I see in the mirror anymore!  </li>
            <li> &gt; the trio is very light not heavy at all .</li>
            <li> overall skin tone is getting more even and fine lines are reduced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We will definitely reorder this amazing product.</li>
            <li> After some research I found this amazing product which I&#x27;m using last two weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a must have all in one set, the collection of these three products are amazing and will be the only thing you need to take care of your skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> I am experiencing amazing results and will definitely continue to use products from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Make up go on better and skin has been clear.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots and lots of things but this product makes my skin look clear, glow and more refreshed/</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a fresh, tightening feel upon application and brings a brightness to my face immediately  </li>
            <li> I started using all three products in the Trinity set as soon as I received them and after only a week, my skin feels so smooth and my makeup goes on even better than it did when I used a makeup primer.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin is much more sensitive when it comes to eyebrow waxing.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see that it actually worked.</li>
            <li> Deals are a rare find; this, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> and I love that the products are natural.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial products I&#x27;ve used in a long time and it does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> Wow, absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li> For 53 years old, I do not have many wrinkles</li>
            <li> I love natural products and my skin does too.  </li>
            <li> Will update after longer use but am pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it morning and night on a freshly washed face.</li>
            <li> face - Using these products has considerably transformed the tone, firmness and clarity of my skin, significantly evening out the patchiness and fine lines from my years of sunbathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> daily and nightly routine are pretty much the same, cleanse, tone and apply this wonderful organic liquid facelift.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price is right.</li>
            <li> We are happy with the Raw Biology Liquid Facelift set.  </li>
            <li> I have a positive attitude towards these products that&#x27;s why I gave it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I use Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner-Rose Petal (found it on Amazon) with a cotton ball to clean my face gently and then use the Organic Liquid Facelift.</li>
            <li> I am grateful to find they are fragrance free because I am very sensitive to smells so that was a bonus!</li>
            <li> You can not beat the price on this product leaves my skin feeling silky smooth, my  skin really is hydrated, smooth and soft right after application, serums truly are instantly absorbed,  does not leave the oily feeling on you skin,</li>
            <li> I have always wondered about reviews and how true they are, but guess what, I am writing one now because this product really works.</li>
            <li> No magic improvement at this time, but face feels great when on.</li>
            <li> My face look shiny and fresh in the first week.</li>
            <li> My husband couldn&#x27;t believe how great my skin has looked this past week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Trinity now for about 3 weeks and am loving how smooth and tight my skin feels and looks.  </li>
            <li> These do not add up to other products of the same type and Iv&#x27;e tried many, bargains and high end$$$. Best so far for the money is cosmetic skin solutions.</li>
            <li> It is amazing to find a skin care line that covers all of my problem areas, e.g., fine lines, stretch marks and uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> nice side effect of using this is the acid caused my face to clear up, or minimize adult acne and blemishes.</li>
            <li> So light and smooth makes my skin feel tighter and younger looking thank u</li>
            <li> Received product and have only used a few days but my skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great quality products at a very reasonable price, considering I have very sensitive skin and am prone to bouts of psoriasis, using new products on my skin can cause problems, quite the opposite with this range.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and light.</li>
            <li> I have been using these three products religiously and have seen a significant improvement in fine lines around my eyes that have all but disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I will be recommending to all my friends, very reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> you so very much for taking 10 years off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annabelle  .</li>
            <li> Just received my products in the mail, an have only used it once, but I can say that the packaging is very nice, as for the actual product</li>
            <li> Thank you Raw Biology for making such an awesome organic product!</li>
            <li> It is far better than any high quality brand that you have to pay a fortune for, and find out it</li>
            <li> Definitely will have an amazing results,  lots of compliment with my face looking younger and distinguish the more I get older.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive fair skin and didn&#x27;t have much success with other serums.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Trinity for a month and was amazed by the texture of my skin in the first week.</li>
            <li> skin has never looked better and I just ordered a second set.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend a try!!</li>
            <li> this is the first time I have EVER done one.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month and the difference in my skin is amazing...getting ready to place another order!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> As a 20 year old I know how important it is to get your anti aging routine started before all the wrinkles starts to get to you.  </li>
            <li> I see visible results with the plumped out wrinkles, even hydration under my eyes and overall better skin color and tone.  </li>
            <li> Love this group of skin care starting to see a difference as well as how my skin feels!!</li>
            <li> so I should definitely see more improvement over time.</li>
            <li> I wish for more information about the individual products, but I&#x27;ve been using them anyway, and my skin seems to be brighter and plumper already.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottles were bigger and will be ordering more product soon.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad to finally have found something that works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and chemical free.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the product about 2 weeks and am absolutely amazed!</li>
            <li> My skin not only looks better but feels more elastic and younger.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant about ordering as I was concerned that three products on my face would make my skin feel coated and smothered but that concern disappeared after the first use.</li>
            <li> And overall just better glow or something.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this trio of magic in a bottle...</li>
            <li> But the better part is you can actually see the results it&#x27;s been almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Really notice a difference in my skin being healthier and looking smoother!</li>
            <li> it seems to work better than using each one individually.</li>
            <li> I Love this product, my face feels brighter and softer after only a week.</li>
            <li> The Retinol with Hyaluronic and Vitamin E is on the thicker side but absorbs well after using the first 2 serums.</li>
            <li> These three products really do add moisture to your face!</li>
            <li> I have used many different C serums and mixes.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried, my skin is softer and definitely fresher looking.  </li>
            <li> the puffiness around my eyes has most definitely reduced.</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to get used to the routine application , but now I love the way my skin looks and feels and look forward to that clean fresh skin everyday.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I have added this to my daily routine for a little under 2 months now, and the results are just incredible.</li>
            <li> My wife has gone through her first order of the Organic Vitamin C Serum and enjoyed the product so much that she has ordered her second bottle today.</li>
            <li> I just received my order and am always excited to try natural and organic products.  </li>
            <li> Not as effective as other brands I have purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very light and moisturizing sinks right into the skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for four months and have noticed positive changes in my skin--smoother texture, fewer wrinkles, and firmer skin.  </li>
            <li> On the positive side, my skin does look plumper and tighter.</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews, I decided to place an order on March 13,2015,for the Organic LIQUID FACELIFT.</li>
            <li> the thank you card I got was extremely positive.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a super long way, so great value as well.</li>
            <li> They go on smoothly and dry quickly</li>
            <li> I like all the products- easy to apply and not overtly affected by added colors or scents as OTC lotions and facial treatments.  </li>
            <li> age is 53, non smoker, healthy, dry space, can&#x27;t sunbathe, water once a day,</li>
            <li> I will certainly order again</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> and I do think this will be a staple in my routine- of course once in a while trying the next new things - or more stronger serums from the doctor -</li>
            <li> Ordered this product based on reviews only to discover that all the positive reviews were a result of the promise of a free bottle of the Vitamin C serum in exchange for a review submitted within a fews days of receiving the shipment.</li>
            <li> My fine lines and wrinkles have definitely diminished along with the age enlarged pores.</li>
            <li> Can definitely tell a difference in my skin tone and the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> this is did remove my fine lines or the appearance of them though I used it twice daily as instructed and never missed a day till it was gone.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a different in my fine lines while using this product.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, well stored and packaged.</li>
            <li> I have been using this trio for a little over a month, and while I have not yet experienced any long-term changes or line reductions, I do like the daily smoothing and hydrating it provides.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I have been using &amp;#34;The Trinity&amp;#34; for 3 months now and have seen terrific results.&lt;br /&gt; The customer service I have received has been above and beyond&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this I had a few improvements but now its amazing.</li>
            <li> A few days later she mentioned how great her skin looked and felt.</li>
            <li> It.made a huge difference having that third bottle in the set!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these products!  </li>
            <li> so much so that I had to just share it with my sisters by sending them some pictures of mine and they have already ordered theirs.....</li>
            <li> Loooove this products and so much easier to put on than what you think.</li>
            <li> This really works.  </li>
            <li> The combo of the 3 while seems like a lot to put on your face at one time, soaks in and leaves the skin smooth and with an instant refreshed feeling and glow.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product two times to give a reasonable time and I did not see any difference.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like doctors, hospitals and surgeries.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that it is organic</li>
            <li> My breakouts were fewer and lasted a much shorter time.</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much with wrinkles at this point but am holding&lt;br /&gt;onto</li>
            <li> I do notice how well they really worked.</li>
            <li> I was having problems with wrinkles on my forehead and this product really help eliminate the wrinkles that I was getting.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a product that really works.</li>
            <li> have not seen any real results yet</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks  now and really haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference</li>
            <li> When I apply it to my face with my fingertips, I then smooth the excess onto the front of my neck and the back of each hand.  </li>
            <li> I still get carded the package is protected very well.</li>
            <li> These are really great!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really recommend.</li>
            <li> and the vitamin C pump smells straight up like urine.&lt;br /&gt;other</li>
            <li> Getting ready to order another three.  </li>
            <li> Works fast.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This will post under my husband&#x27;s name (we share the account), but I really wanted to write a review of this product.  </li>
            <li> Should have read the reviews more carefully as I would have realized</li>
            <li> I really like all three products.</li>
            <li> I think that to be really specific about this product is to add important informations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps it penetrate and really build the collagen.</li>
            <li> The serums are plenty moisturizing and gentle around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am very</li>
            <li> Absolutely five stars based upon quality and value for money.  </li>
            <li> Product as described fast ship</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for men and women alike!</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> Thanks for saving me so much money.</li>
            <li> I did think I wou receive so fast.</li>
            <li> The difference is very noticeable to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Shipping fast.  </li>
            <li> much smoother look and feel.  </li>
            <li> After only 3 days of using these products my skin looks and feels smooth as well as brighter.</li>
            <li> Fast and efficient delivery.</li>
            <li> but once I started using this product it has helped so much, making it feel smoother.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I will diffently be ordering more when I get close to empty.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> These are really making a difference in my skin texture.</li>
            <li> is much firmer and brighter&lt;</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much of this product.</li>
            <li> For the price it’s really a win/win.  </li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds and hundred of dollars trying to find skin care that makes any kind of difference on my extremely sensitive, acne prone, aging skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed results immediately and my skin is left soft to the touch and more youthful.</li>
            <li> It is nice to finally see a product that actually delivers what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Thank you from a new long term satisfied</li>
            <li> I have a scar under my right eye that is completely disappearing.</li>
            <li> I want to look good and young as long as possible</li>
            <li> I purchased based on high reviews that I found out had to do with a promise of a free product as I was sent the same flyer.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing how fast it works and the results are unbelievable.</li>
            <li> My skin became more firm, softer, smoother and the wrinkles on my forehead diminished after the first application.</li>
            <li> So the bottom line is they have more active ingredient at about a quarter of the cost of the stuff they were using before.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a premium product without paying exorbitant department store prices.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different facial serums and creams that claim to do so much</li>
            <li> The best thing I find about all of the products from raw biology (and I also use the cellulite removal cream) is that they are not hugely potent.  </li>
            <li> I am 45 years old with fine lines from sun damage gained from deploying to the desert several times in addition to blowing winds.</li>
            <li> I did think it was odd that so many people reviewed the product immediately after receiving it.</li>
            <li> and sometimes my skin gets lightly burned and feels dry</li>
            <li> Face feels so smooth and soft just after using them for a short time!  </li>
            <li> My skin is a lot smoother and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased these for hydrating purposes, and they do just that.</li>
            <li> I am a very busy women with 5 daughters, I don&#x27;t have much time to think about me</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and packaging was of a high standard.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so anticipating a positive results with what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> You do need to wear a high SPF when using these serums.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for ladies.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these serums to everyone.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this skin care line.</li>
            <li> - i highly recommend giving this brand a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for 4 weeks and all I can say is WOW!!</li>
            <li> She has noticed slight changes, for the first couple of weeks and is excited to make another purchase for them when her supply runs out.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> hope, fine lines, the &#x27;gentle creases&#x27; I suppose, have slightly been helped.</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel soft after applying</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much of a chance to try them, but here&#x27;s what I know so far</li>
            <li> my skin looks more plump, not sure it takes away the wrinkles ( but does anything really)</li>
            <li> Normally I am a proactiv girl</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed in just the first two days was how my pores had shrunk considerably, that for me was  big</li>
            <li> I think that I should have bought these for my friends for Christmas instead of the keepsake ornaments I normally buy.</li>
            <li> I love it, after  less than a month I have noticed results!</li>
            <li> Had to send back, broke my face out, but I have super sensitive skin, so for me it didnt work</li>
            <li> /&gt;It soaks in quickly and the change in the quality of your skin is near instant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for ten days and have noticeable results and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, but I read the positive reviews , from others with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use this trio morning and night and for the first three or four nights I applied my original organic retinol cream last because I felt my face would be too dry.  </li>
            <li> I have melasma pretty much all over my face, and while I know it will never go completely away, it is such a relief to have found a product that lightens and brightens my skin.</li>
            <li> I know it can take time for your skin to get use to new products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to say it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m using this new serum.  </li>
            <li> I am new to using skin care products and feel like I hit the jackpot with this set.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with all of the Raw Biology products that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I will def buy more from Raw Biology again.</li>
            <li> After that, I applied the Raw Biology Hyaluronic Acid plus Vitamin C and also noticed that it absorbed quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> As my skin has aged, the lack of elasticity makes the scarring more obvious.</li>
            <li> I must add that I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic and am amazed that it has replaced my usual creams and moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have used many creams in the past but nothing compares to Organic Facelift.</li>
            <li> This plumps the skin, thereby making the fine lines less visible.</li>
            <li> In just a few short weeks, I can already see and feel that my skin looks better, is smoother and more firm.</li>
            <li> I can see less wrinkles and smooth lines.  </li>
            <li> My light wrinkles are less visible and my skin feels smoother and healthier.  </li>
            <li> I have never considered using any supplemental skincare products until now; I was particularly interested in these products given their organic certification, transparent ingredient list and that they include only natural preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the vitamin c in particular because I had a dark spot below each eyebrow and they were darkening to the piont where concealer did not cover adequately.  </li>
            <li> its very easy to use a little too much at times of this and the retinol gets used ahead of the other two.</li>
            <li> Skin feels tight and smooth after application.  </li>
            <li> The clear gel and the green bottle made my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I was unsure which order to use the products in as its not made that clear but after speaking to customer service - I was reassured.  </li>
            <li> My skin became cleaner, clear and smoother.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much so far.  </li>
            <li> There is a bit of lift (eyelids), and my skin of my face feels soft and it looks brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> I see why this is considered an &amp;#34;All-in One&amp;#34; set, it tightens and lifts but also makes my face feel so soft afterward.</li>
            <li> I am hoping they are completely gone in a couple more&lt;</li>
            <li> but discovered my skin was too sensitive for these products.  </li>
            <li> I guess my skin is more delicate than even I realized.  </li>
            <li> so if you are sensitive to fragrance these shouldn&#x27;t bother your skin.</li>
            <li> and it is not heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> I was truly surprised with the immediate results.</li>
            <li> The result is soft feeling skin</li>
            <li> It truly is a natural facelift.</li>
            <li> After working almost 10 hours yesterday, I got home and my husband of 25 years hugged me and said &amp;#34;You&#x27;ve been looking just phenomenal lately.  </li>
            <li> Although the manufacturer recommends use twice daily, it will depend on your ability to tolerate that much hyaluronic acid on your face.</li>
            <li> I paid for the product, is that I like the product so far.</li>
            <li> My skin felt really soft afterwards,I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does with prolonged usage.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> But the truth is I can see a very noticeable difference, big time!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and so far</li>
            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth and glowing for a few application.</li>
            <li> so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and rejuvinated.</li>
            <li> This regime is quite extradinary in that can feel the action of each liquid upon application.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely be purchasing this again and adding to my daily skin routine!</li>
            <li> Tried the vitamin C so far</li>
            <li> My scars are diminished, pores clear and minimized, overall healthy glow and firm tone....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used for a few days but my skin looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> I did not have a big problem with it, but I rarely notice break-outs at all, now that I regularly use this</li>
            <li> It is certainly too soon to see any dramatic effects, but based on the other reviews, and what I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of noticing so far, I know my skin is headed in a good direction.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see how results are after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I am slightly starting to get these fine lines, crows feet and slight wrinkles</li>
            <li> I do wish instructions came with them because I do not know if it matters which lotion you put on first, second, and then third.</li>
            <li> I am 43 and had considerably good skin throughout my years, these past few have made up for the all that had passed me by.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low, read 10000000 reviews on amazon.</li>
            <li> I spent my whole life able to go about without makeup, but the last year, my skin was uneven looking, even with the serums I was using.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for the full results, at four weeks - so far, my face and neck skin is slightly firmer (especially around the upper eyelids) and fine lines are less noticable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product last week, received it the next day, and it&#x27;s already showing positive results.</li>
            <li> First off, I am not on a quest for the fountain of youth, so I never really bought a lot of serums and potions and lotions to wage war against my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have seen such great results over the past few weeks that I now can&#x27;t imagine not having them as part of my daily skincare regime.</li>
            <li> I was being helped by a District Manager and I told him that I have problems with my face being dry and peeling and that I have been using a product that i bought off Amazon from Raw Biology to get it better.  </li>
            <li> Very absorbent, and doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry after use.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention that they really do reduce the appearance of wrinkles and uneven skin tones, giving your complexion a much smoother look and feel.  </li>
            <li> It has definitely helped clear up my face and old acne scars are fading away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> product is fantastic, cannot wait to see the progression of my skin over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> With all the natural ingredients used, my sensitive face is not breaking out in a rash which is a big relief.</li>
            <li> So, being somewhat skeptical, I asked my Medical Doctor who specializes in skin treatments if this would be a good product to try</li>
            <li> Skin tone is impruving, face feels very soft  and looks 5 years younger.</li>
            <li> and I am already seeing major improvements.</li>
            <li> No one wants loose or sagging skin.</li>
            <li> I use this trio as my main facial routine, twice daily.</li>
            <li> And the Vit C works super super well on uneven belly skin from past pregnancies.</li>
            <li> It is a little drying, but I use my regular SPF moisturizer with it; with no bad effects.  </li>
            <li> My teen son is using this to clear up his acne</li>
            <li> My pores around my chin area get clotted and drab looking, and I am starting to see this area clear up and feel softer.  </li>
            <li> Now at 4 weeks, my face is tighter, softer, smoother and the lines are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m too old to be looking for a face lift in a bottle, I can say that these three bottles brought a luminosity to my skin and made my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and dealing with medical issues that compound the natural aging process that we all are going through.  </li>
            <li> I have only just begun using this product and like the results so far.  </li>
            <li> Am not really into the whole organic thingy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended my secret to many people.</li>
            <li> I have tried and spent a lot of money on other products for my skin care and and having sensitive skin , I know right away if something will work or not .</li>
            <li> and then I applied the Raw Biology Retinol 2% plus Hyaluronic and Vitamin E on my face and noticed how quickly it absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have never used Hyaluronic acid or Retinol before, then you may see more dramatic results than I did.  </li>
            <li> was really surprised it would do that because I have order several different brands</li>
            <li> It is much smoother and the wrinkles seem to be going away and dark spots are lightening.</li>
            <li> is noticeable within the first few day.</li>
            <li> So glad I gave Raw Biology a shot!!!  </li>
            <li> but I always have a mild breakout, at least.</li>
            <li> After cleansing skin, apply first serum and wait a few minutes then add the next product, eventually using all 3.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product kit especially if you have combination skin and are in lower 40s with blemishes or any scaring both surgical and a slight acne scar, fine lines and crows feet.</li>
            <li> The overall glow of my skin from the vitamin C has made a huge difference in my overall complexion and has made my skin go from appearing dull to looking renewed and refreshed!</li>
            <li> The retinol is a little too much for my skin every night.</li>
            <li> Customer service was amazing,  I received my order with one broken bottle (it was packaged fine, we have just had an extremely cold winter here in Maine and the Vitamin C froze and broke).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 8th week and still on my first bottles, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive due to different prescription medicine I have to take and this has had no reaction.  </li>
            <li> I think very highly of the Raw Biology staff.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is natural as I have issues with reacting to a lot of ingredients in other products.</li>
            <li> I am a 68 year old woman who has tried other products and never saw the changes that I am seeing now.  </li>
            <li> I placed my order and it was delivered in less than 3 days (and it came to Arkansas all the way from New York).</li>
            <li> thanks raw bio...................</li>
            <li> I will write a new review in a few weeks .</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product especially throughout the winter months when skin is often dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trio for three days along with the dermarroller and so far my wrinkle in between my eye brows is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> So far I definitely notice that my skin is smoother and the few breakouts I had are gone.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin thanks to the Hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31, and have spent hundreds since turning 30 to help with my loss of elasticity, and larger pores.</li>
            <li> Bottles were much larger than expected.  </li>
            <li> and I am looking forward to seeing the long term results.  </li>
            <li> HOW LONG HAVE YOU USED IT</li>
            <li> and I even used them, as long as my buddies don&#x27;t find out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for just a few days, but my skin feels soft and &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using all 3 serums for 4 weeks and can see absolutely no difference, so far a total waste of money</li>
            <li> There is an overall tightening of my skin and general firmness that has come from using the three products that I have yet to find with any other products that I have purchased over the last few years.</li>
            <li> Everyone has commented on what I look like when I make my different facial expressions and how I have less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Definitely noticed a reduction of black heads, white heads and pore size.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products for my aging african american skin and am almost always disappointed.</li>
            <li> The other 2 products I tried from same company</li>
            <li> I havent been using it very long, but I do like the way it makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li> , everything change two weeks ago when one of my sisters told me that I should start using something because my skin looked dry</li>
            <li> DRY SPACE AREA/</li>
            <li> disappointing, are the recent reviews stating free product is given in exchange for reviews.</li>
            <li> but you do not have dry skin!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have seen a dramatic improvement in that my laugh lines have all but disappeared and the skin appears to have noticeably firmed around my eyes and lids.  </li>
            <li> After using this for a about a week and a half I started to notice a subtle difference in my skins smoothness, and even some of the smile lines have gone away but can still see I have a awhile before the bottle is gone</li>
            <li> It also helped with the dark circles I have under my eyes, I have tried a bunch of different products and non of them worked, except for this.</li>
            <li> spots are lightening daily to where the two dark spots I was using as a gauge have almost disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I am always skeptical buying new skin care products as I have VERY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased other more expensive products with little to no visible improvement, but after one week of use I can truly see the improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using as directed for three weeks now, and am a little disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the remarkable results as other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I use as directed being careful to use the 2.5 % Retinol judiciously on dry areas of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using these three products for three and half weeks</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin however; have not had any type of negative reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> I just would like a percentage of the active ingredients so that I can compare it to similar products and anticipate how it will act on my skin with other things that I have.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 sets of this product it caused my face to turn re and very dry</li>
            <li> I am back to going without makeup without feeling like I look like a mess.</li>
            <li> I would get a little extra of the retinol when ordered...</li>
            <li> I tried a different brand of hyaluronic acid and after 30 days saw little difference.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the hydration only lasts for about 6-8 hours before reapplication is needed, but again, that could be due to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on creams, lotions and serum that claim to promise the world...</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work… total sham</li>
            <li> Ive spent 100&#x27;s on skin care and was close to giving up.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got wrinkly and rough skin</li>
            <li> I used them until they were empty before I wrote this review.</li>
            <li> Now that they are empty and I am using something else.</li>
            <li> A few weeks, and my skin has its bounce back.</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a few days, but if the results keep up, I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and tighter after only a few applications.  </li>
            <li> Can definitely feel the difference after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product for a few days now</li>
            <li> I have used several different company&#x27;s products over the past 2 years and have little or no results until this product.</li>
            <li> I started to use this set religiously and my face feels softer, firm, my dark circles and age spots are disappearing.</li>
            <li> and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Be consistent and you won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> At the age of 46 I was beginning to get discouraged, as I have tried other retinol A products to no avail.</li>
            <li> I like to use the Retinol at night and then I rotate the two Hyaluronic and Vitamin C serums every other day.</li>
            <li> and I am hoping for the results mentioned in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Not trusted due to no results or improvement.</li>
            <li> I am 36 and got mistaken for an 18 year the other day.</li>
            <li> I had researched serveral other option before deciding on this set.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so it will be a while, but I will be repurchasing as soon as I run out!</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Thought she may like it since she has every other lotion and potion.</li>
            <li> Since I have used other brands of vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid, and Retin A (stronger form of Retinol)</li>
            <li> only issue I had was with the liquid Vitamin C , not sure how to apply as its not a jell.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long you have to use to feel like it&#x27;s doing something.  </li>
            <li> Under eye circles do not seem as dark.  </li>
            <li> Its also helped the dark circles under my eye.</li>
            <li> It just did not do was what each bottle claimed it would do and so sadly to say it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I really wish I could review products before purchasing them because I lost $$ and basically threw my money away on a useless product.  </li>
            <li> My dark sun spots are fading and my complexion is glowing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems also help lighten up the dark spots and reduce blemishes.</li>
            <li> Its almost impossible to find organic products for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I do not wear foundation or any other products with the exception of a little mascara.</li>
            <li> Cant wait to try other products from the line!</li>
            <li> The retinol has a vaguely unpleasant odor, but it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I telling you, I began to see changes on my face in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this serum but can already feel a difference compared to my previous cream.  </li>
            <li> Well, in just over 2 weeks, I have noticed that I have smoother skin and that the wrinkles on m forehead have started to fade slightly.</li>
            <li> I used the products as directed and the texture of my skin has improve in less than a week.</li>
            <li> My skin has been typically irritated when using hyaluronic acid but not with this brand.  </li>
            <li> I was using it for about a month and a half and the result was showing on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it less than a month</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give a complete review, but I feel that my face won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have tried other types of face products only to see my face get worse.</li>
            <li> I was considering some very aggressive and expensive skin peels when a friend of mine told me about Raw Biology&#x27;s &amp;#34;3 in 1 Trinity pack&amp;#34; so I thought what the heck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the trio for just less than a month, and thought it might be helping a little.  </li>
            <li> My skin is no longer splotchey and no more dark spots and dark underage bags.</li>
            <li> Have used for 2 days and see a little bit of a difference in skin clarity already.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s skin is beginning to look a little smoother.</li>
            <li> Seems a little scammy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I prefer hyaluronic acid to be a little on the runny side</li>
            <li> before, I saw little difference.</li>
            <li> am 38, have olive skin with a little sun damage / brown spots on my décolletage and</li>
            <li> My neck was looking a little crepey, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> Not very sure it is my 1st time using it , we have to wait for the end results.</li>
            <li> It helps with wrinkles/fine lines/crows feet, uneven skin tone/blemishes/age spots, acne, sun damages and so on.</li>
            <li> which is my trouble area.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for approximately a week, and I can see the difference all over my face, neck and especially my forehead and the corners of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> with wrinkles (which I have few</li>
            <li> Seems like everyday</li>
            <li> I use to smoke quite heavily so my skin was quite dried out and damaged.</li>
            <li> After using the serums for a few weeks my husband noticed a difference in my skin appearance.  </li>
            <li> only got worse.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 8 months daily.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Order was delivered within a few days.</li>
            <li> The product reached me within a few days of ordering and I like the way they make no guarantees.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this for a few reasons</li>
            <li> Was hoping  to see less wrinkling!</li>
            <li> There is no strong smells</li>
            <li> They have no strong scent, if any.</li>
            <li> (I have deep set eyes with dark circles and they are extremely difficult to cover.</li>
            <li> February weather is the worst and these products definitely have some real positive effects.  </li>
            <li> It was softer and less dull.</li>
            <li> RAW BIOLOGY</li>
            <li> After that, I applied the Raw Biology Organic Vitamin C plus Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> I plan to continue using raw biology liquid facelift.</li>
            <li> but I found Organic LIQUID FACELIFT raw biology</li>
            <li> Thank you Raw Biology.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Raw Biology products for 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am a customer of Raw Biology for quite sometime.</li>
            <li> After all, I&#x27;m nearing 40 and even though I&#x27;m late to the game, my skin may need some insurance against future ravages of time.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and thin.</li>
            <li> I had horrible dark circles, adult acne, and I noticed age spots like no other.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet</li>
            <li> it, I can see small changes.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy another round!</li>
            <li> I just get a small amount and spread it all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> NOT HEALTHY</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ll give it another round and hope for the miracle!</li>
            <li> Feels unbelievable on your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used vitamin C/ hyaluronic acid serums in the past and was always picky about the consistency.</li>
            <li> and it has unbelievable results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the organic liquid facelift all-in-one for the past six weeks.</li>
            <li> I already see and feel a difference in just a few weeks!  </li>
            <li> Its like alcoholism, but rather than sloppy behavior, life ruining decisions and looking like a pop star has-been, your skin glows, plumps, looks fresh and gives you a rock star in her blossoming youth before drugs and bad choices vibe.</li>
            <li> I either hardly saw any results or I saw none at all.</li>
            <li> Lately my face has become overwhelmed with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This started in my late 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I seen absolutely no improvement in my skin at all unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The product was quite thick</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of all the positive reviews, very skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Before, my skin looked very dull and I had small patches of breakouts.  </li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that the Vitamin C is on the thin side</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY, that happened.  </li>
            <li> retinol left sticky feeling and some break out :(</li>
            <li> I have broken capillaries, some rosacea, and this was the reason for purchasing the products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for approximately one week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced cystic acne</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t drying or irritating.</li>
            <li> Hope this secret doesn&#x27;t get out</li>
            <li> They have made a dramatic difference in the way I care for my skin.</li>
            <li> So thankful to have found the Raw Biology trinity!!!</li>
            <li> But now I need to wear foundation to cover my uneven skin tone.  :-(</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this company or product !</li>
            <li> But since it wasn&#x27;t too expensive compared to the competitors anyway, I went ahead and gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> this sadly made my face break out - and I can no longer use it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how disappointed I was since I was not able to experience the results others had.  </li>
            <li> The price you can&#x27;t go wrong will buy again.love it!!!!.Pat</li>
            <li> Needless to say that my skin has suffered some severe damage over the 54 years.</li>
            <li> If not, A. you&#x27;re napping wrong and B.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, I&#x27;ve tried products before that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how I already see a difference on my skin....</li>
            <li> Products were not as described and caused bad skin irritation on non-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it just because I hate throwing my money away</li>
            <li> Give it a try; I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed! ...</li>
            <li> it caused my face to itch terrible !</li>
            <li> Worst product I have ever used on my face.  </li>
            <li> I do not like giving a bad review because this is how someone makes a living!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had been using a similar product that I absolutely loved, but my sunscreen or makeup would &#x27;pill&#x27; over it. This doesn&#x27;t. Just the way that it absorbs so quickly and completely convinced me my skin loved it. Still waiting for the full results, at four weeks - so far, my face and neck skin is slightly firmer (especially around the upper eyelids) and fine lines are less noticable. Best for me though, is that it leaves such a smooth and dewy canvas for either tinted sunscreen or foundation.</li>
            <li> As I have said before, I have had the best and fastest results after using your product in just two short weeks. I will be sure to reorder and never run out now that I have seen the difference using all three serums has made in my appearance. Thank you for coming up with something that does as it claims!</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on creams, lotions and serum that claim to promise the world... and my search is over.  This stuff has changed my skin and it continues to improve with each passing day!  You must try it!  Be consistent and you won&#x27;t be sorry.  LOVE THESE PRODUCTS!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 sets of this product it caused my face to turn re and very dry tried 2nd set it caused my face to itch terrible ! Tried to contact COMPANY.  RAW BIOLOGY each time it said to try back in 15 mins! I am not happy with this company or product !</li>
            <li> At the age of 46 I was beginning to get discouraged, as I have tried other retinol A products to no avail. No one wants loose or sagging skin. I have been using the Trinity for a month and was amazed by the texture of my skin in the first week. Now at 4 weeks, my face is tighter, softer, smoother and the lines are barely noticeable. And as an added bonus, I decided to try it on my hands, to my surprise, my age spots have faded. Thank you so much for your product!! Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Face feels so smooth and soft just after using them for a short time!  Make up go on better and skin has been clear.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I have been using &amp;#34;The Trinity&amp;#34; for 3 months now and have seen terrific results.&lt;br /&gt; The customer service I have received has been above and beyond&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I waited a full month before writing this review because I value the reviews on her and wanted to give an honest posting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never looked better and I just ordered a second set. This product is amazing! I have tried lots and lots of things but this product makes my skin look clear, glow and more refreshed/younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a convert!!!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work… total sham</li>
            <li> Product is outstandingly well! Results were astonishing! I can see the difference in my skin already! Only been using the product for a couple of weeks and I can tell my skin is smoother and softer! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Already see a difference after 2 weeks... My scars are diminished, pores clear and minimized, overall healthy glow and firm tone.... Can&#x27;t wait to see what another two weeks shows!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for long but it works. It is amazing how fast it works and the results are unbelievable. It was so great I had to tell my friends about it. It feels great on the skin and works quick. I&#x27;m glad to know that I&#x27;m putting such a great natural and organic product on my face. Good job!</li>
            <li> I love this combo and I see and feel a difference. I wish I had taken photos. I&#x27;m thrilled with the price too! Don&#x27;t forget to wear sunscreen with any retinol product. The retinol has a vaguely unpleasant odor, but it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like to constituency &amp; how easily it absorbs. Skin definitely feels smoother</li>
            <li> I like this product very much so far.  It gives my skin a fresh, tightening feel upon application and brings a brightness to my face immediately  It is easy to use and goes on smoothly.  I look forward to continued use.</li>
            <li> Did not come close to anything it said it would do. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I started using all three products in the Trinity set as soon as I received them and after only a week, my skin feels so smooth and my makeup goes on even better than it did when I used a makeup primer. Never buying makeup primer again and going to keep using this skin care.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long you have to use to feel like it&#x27;s doing something.  In the beginning, I was using morning and night.  I only use the hyaluronic for both morning and night.  The Vit. A was drying my skin out.  It&#x27;s fine now.  So we&#x27;ll see.  One thing I think the serums help to hold the moisture in my skin from my moisturizer.  It that&#x27;s what they do, that&#x27;s a goo​d thing.</li>
            <li> I just received my order yesterday......  I have used the product twice. I can tell a difference in the moisture of my skin already!!!!  So glad I gave Raw Biology a shot!!!  Can&#x27;t wait to see the difference in the coming wks!!!!  :)</li>
            <li> This is Amazing!!!  I never used a lot of facial product but this one is the best !!! My skin looks amazing and I see a  difference on my wrinkle even after one week .&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was very fast !!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;A happy customer</li>
            <li> I like all the products- easy to apply and not overtly affected by added colors or scents as OTC lotions and facial treatments.  The size is also nice for travel and I do think this will be a staple in my routine- of course once in a while trying the next new things - or more stronger serums from the doctor - the retinol is a good %age- and just enough I do not feel as if I will have significant irritation.  Looking forward to month 2 of the products!</li>
            <li> The wife really likes the way her skin feels, and how bright her complexion is.  We will definitely reorder this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic results! I will be recommending to all my friends, very reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Enjoy free gift love this product</li>
            <li> Did not do what you said it would do, no difference in my skin, will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using &amp;#34;Organic LIQUID FACELIFT&amp;#34; for about a week now. I telling you, I began to see changes on my face in less than a week. This product is &amp;#34;magnificent&amp;#34;.... I will buy it again, and I &amp;#34;HIGHLY RECOMMEND&amp;#34; it to anyone.  Laugh line is going away, smoother and clearer skin!! &amp;#34;I LOVE IT&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Awesome all inclusive face-lift in a bottle. No need to go under the knife when you can get a face-lift at home. With the proper ingredients that his product has, it can do wonders to our sagging skin. It helps with wrinkles/fine lines/crows feet, uneven skin tone/blemishes/age spots, acne, sun damages and so on. It will uplift the skin and making it feel softer and younger. Please read the ingredients. It does contain retinol so it is never recommended to be under the sun and wear lots of sunscreen to protect the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for months now and the results are truly amazing.  For sure noticeable results; my skin is clearer, softer and glowing.  All three serums have given results.  I highly recommend these products!  Also a great price for all three!!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely amazing and I cant believe that i found something that works on my skin. Ive spent 100&#x27;s on skin care and was close to giving up. This stuff is incredible!</li>
            <li> I really liked this, so much I bought my 3 sisters it for Mother&#x27;s Day. my skin looks more plump, not sure it takes away the wrinkles ( but does anything really) but I felt my brown spots got lighter. will be buying again when I run out,and my sister asked me to get her more for her birthday so she liked it too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the money! Highly recommend a try!!</li>
            <li> It has been about a week since I received this set. There is a bit of lift (eyelids), and my skin of my face feels soft and it looks brighter and smoother. My face was in dire need of moisture, as well as my neck. I will definitely continue to buy this product from this seller.</li>
            <li> I am loving this system! I have been using it for three days.. Normally I am a proactiv girl and i will be honest it&#x27;s still my favorite but i love the smells of this one , that its natural, and my favorite part is it clears blackheads! which is my trouble area. I think I will be incorporating this into my skin care routine from here on out.</li>
            <li> I have used it for one week and I have to say it&#x27;s amazing!!! so much so that I had to just share it with my sisters by sending them some pictures of mine and they have already ordered theirs..... It&#x27;s crazy how I already see a difference on my skin.... My husband didn&#x27;t even know I was using anything for my face because I don&#x27;t, everything change two weeks ago when one of my sisters told me that I should start using something because my skin looked dry lol so I did... and my husband already have been giving me so many compliments. Telling me I look beautiful and that my skin has a young looking glow....I was in shock !!! The funny thing is that I see it too!! Loooove this products and so much easier to put on than what you think. I&#x27;m sooo happy that I just had to write my review and trust me this is the first time I have EVER done one. Hope that my review has helped you :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month and the difference in my skin is amazing...getting ready to place another order!</li>
            <li> Saw no difference in my skin at all</li>
            <li> Nice texture to the products. Not sure if it works yet i ordered another month to get enough time in.</li>
            <li> The Organic Liquid Facelift is amazing. After using this I had a few improvements but now its amazing. I&#x27;ve got better and even softer skin. If you&#x27;ve got wrinkly and rough skin I recommend you get this now!</li>
            <li> Love the way these products make my skin feel.  Placing anothet order!</li>
            <li> This really works.  Easy to use.  My skin looks radiant and lifted.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for three weeks. Great results. My skin looks brighter and my wrinkles have definitely begun to diminish. I have noticed that my skin is much more sensitive when it comes to eyebrow waxing. Overall it is a great product that I have recommended to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! It&#x27;s everything they advertise it to be.  A very good value and a great product.</li>
            <li> A dr oz must have, I like this because others are auto reorder, however I will order this again</li>
            <li> great product had to reorder</li>
            <li> My wife has gone through her first order of the Organic Vitamin C Serum and enjoyed the product so much that she has ordered her second bottle today. She says the serum has made her face and hands feel softer and so intends to continue using the serum to gain the optimum results.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with my wrinkles</li>
            <li> Used it regularly, didn&#x27;t see any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this product. I&#x27;ve only used for a few days but my skin looks and feels better. I have very sensitive skin however; have not had any type of negative reaction to this product. I would definitely recommend this product and plan on continuing to purchase it. It&#x27;s a great product especially for the price and fast shipping also! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with all of the Raw Biology products that I have purchased.  I like the fact that they are organic and chemical free.  Not to mention that they really do reduce the appearance of wrinkles and uneven skin tones, giving your complexion a much smoother look and feel.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a premium product without paying exorbitant department store prices.</li>
            <li> Happy with the packaging and costumer attention.  Noticeable smoothness and the VIT C seems to brighten skin tone.  Will update review after using longer!</li>
            <li> it resolves dryness, i love the  luminous effect</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It works wonders on my wrinkles, they are not as noticable as before.  I was just beginning to get age spots and those are gone.</li>
            <li> The combo of the 3 while seems like a lot to put on your face at one time, soaks in and leaves the skin smooth and with an instant refreshed feeling and glow.  I am excited to continue the 3 bottle application process for a full month, can&#x27;t wait to see the continued results!</li>
            <li> Does not work at all. I bought this product two times to give a reasonable time and I did not see any difference.</li>
            <li> Am a skin care specialist and many of my clients tells me they use these and their faces look amazing!! Am happy I brought these will be buying them forever!! If you need a facelift without surgery get these.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and texture of all three of these serums.  Have used for 2 days and see a little bit of a difference in skin clarity already.  Looking forward to results in the next month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this serum but can already feel a difference compared to my previous cream.  Looking forward to seeing the difference as my skin improves over time!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these serums. As a 20 year old I know how important it is to get your anti aging routine started before all the wrinkles starts to get to you.  These serums will also be a great addition to derma rolling. When you use the derma roller these serums will get deeper into the skin and you will get the full benefits. My face always looks amazing when I wake up in the morning and I will continue to use this forever.</li>
            <li> And they work!!  Non sticky, not oily. Perfectly balanced for my skin. No offensive smell. Very high quality, well stored and packaged. I see visible results with the plumped out wrinkles, even hydration under my eyes and overall better skin color and tone.  I even use it on my neck and upper chest area. This miracle trio is better than Olay, ROC, Garnier etc. Thanks :-)</li>
            <li> I want to look good and young as long as possible and I really don&#x27;t like doctors, hospitals and surgeries. The best I can do is using the right creams, serums, oils.. I also believe that organic ingredients are better for me. After some research I found this amazing product which I&#x27;m using last two weeks. Can you imagine that my friends asked me what have I done with my skin?! They are trying everything for smoother skin and to hide some age spots or sun damages. I recommended them this Organic Liquid Facelift and we&#x27;ll see which one will look the most prettier after using it! :)</li>
            <li> The Liquid Facelift Trinity has replaced products that cost 3 times the amount! I use as directed being careful to use the 2.5 % Retinol judiciously on dry areas of my face. Follow up with a good moisturizer! This is my second time ordering...definitely not my last!!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product.  I have always wondered about reviews and how true they are, but guess what, I am writing one now because this product really works. It is far better than any high quality brand that you have to pay a fortune for, and find out it they don&#x27;t even come close to doing what this product does. I have been using this product now for approximately a week, and I can see the difference all over my face, neck and especially my forehead and the corners of my mouth.  ABSOLUTELY AMAZING........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daily and nightly routine are pretty much the same, cleanse, tone and apply this wonderful organic liquid facelift.  It really has done wonders, and I am so glad that I surfed Amazon to find the best of the best.  It really is the best skin care product available for a beautiful face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so very much for taking 10 years off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annabelle  .</li>
            <li> I just received the product.  I love how it feels on my face, my skin feel smoother, softer and tighter.  Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been using the products for a week, and though I have not seen the wrinkles begin to disappear, I have noticed an evening of my skin tone. I have broken capillaries, some rosacea, and this was the reason for purchasing the products. I do like the feel of my skin, and will see what happens with continuous use.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I was thrilled to see that it actually worked. Usually with so many celebrity endorsements, something like this is too good to be true. But since it wasn&#x27;t too expensive compared to the competitors anyway, I went ahead and gave it a shot. I really appreciate that it is organic and I can understand the ingredients list. I see why this is considered an &amp;#34;All-in One&amp;#34; set, it tightens and lifts but also makes my face feel so soft afterward. Great set!</li>
            <li> I got the product about a week ago and notice the difference around my eyes already and I did not get all the products yet just two but I love it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. It has definitely helped clear up my face and old acne scars are fading away.&lt;br /&gt;I think you have to continue to use this for 6 months or more to see great results.  But in the short time I have been&lt;br /&gt;using it, I can see small changes. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL &amp;#34;TRIO&amp;#34;  my face &amp; neck feel clean AND TIGHTER...have been using these for 3 mths now along with a good supply of organic aloe and a natural &amp;#34;tan physics&amp;#34; indoor tanning lotion and have many compliments on my colour and clarity of my young looking face for my age. (68}..I highly recommend these magnificent three...I would get a little extra of the retinol when ordered...its very easy to use a little too much at times of this and the retinol gets used ahead of the other two.</li>
            <li> This does help but my skin is so damaged that I did not get a big benefit from this</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I washed my face and then I applied the Raw Biology Retinol 2% plus Hyaluronic and Vitamin E on my face and noticed how quickly it absorbed into my skin. I didn&#x27;t notice any aroma from the product. The product is a gel with a dropper. After that, I applied the Raw Biology Hyaluronic Acid plus Vitamin C and also noticed that it absorbed quickly into my skin. I noticed a very light citrusy aroma, and the product was also in gel form and came with a dropper. After that, I applied the Raw Biology Organic Vitamin C plus Hyaluronic Acid. It came with a pump and the product comes in a more liquid form, also with no noticeable aroma. It absorbed quickly and easily. After applying all three products I noticed that my skin was super soft and bright, like I&#x27;d have a really wonderful night&#x27;s rest. I recommend these products. They work so well together!</li>
            <li> Love this group of skin care starting to see a difference as well as how my skin feels!!</li>
            <li> Have ordered this product 3 times.  Great product , fast delivery</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m too old to be looking for a face lift in a bottle, I can say that these three bottles brought a luminosity to my skin and made my pores look smaller. My breakouts were fewer and lasted a much shorter time. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> What has happened?  I love this set and have recommended it to others who are also using it at a reasonable price of about $39.00.  Now I go to replace and I see a price of $199.00.  That is craziness.  I don&#x27;t know many who will pay that much.  A huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my mom and she was amazed by how smooth her skin feels now.  I&#x27;m actually setting up her account know so she can reorder when she needs it.  Awesome product and very fast accurate service!  Thanks again</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of all the positive reviews, very skeptical.  Which is why I have waited just shy&lt;br /&gt;of a month to write a review.  I really am not disappointed in these.  I have &#x27;sun spots&#x27; or &#x27;age&lt;br /&gt;spots&#x27; on both cheeks &amp; they are fading.  I am hoping they are completely gone in a couple more&lt;br /&gt;months of using these &#x27;&#x27;serums&#x27;&#x27;.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much with wrinkles at this point but am holding&lt;br /&gt;onto hope, fine lines, the &#x27;gentle creases&#x27; I suppose, have slightly been helped. This stuff does&lt;br /&gt;feel really good &amp; the smoothness of my skin &amp; softness is noticeable within the first few day. It&lt;br /&gt;feels tightened &amp; I like that &amp; then I follow with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I will give this product a good six months &amp; only discontinue if I don&#x27;t see more results.  If I do see&lt;br /&gt;results with wrinkles (which I have few) I will definitely be continuing with this, I DO think this is &#x27;&#x27;the&lt;br /&gt;one&#x27;&#x27;.  My only disappointment is that the Vitamin C is on the thin side so I tilt my head/face &amp; put&lt;br /&gt;some on that way then spread to apply.  Other than that, great so far &amp; hoping for more results soon.&lt;br /&gt;Seller was timely &amp; items were well packaged.</li>
            <li> Lately my face has become overwhelmed with wrinkles. Seems like everyday I see more and more. I ordered this product almost two weeks ago and I am already seeing major improvements. Im not the only person that can see these improvements, my family has even said I look younger. I would suggest starting this imediently! You will not be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I have been using this trio for about 3 weeks and absolutely love the way they make my skin look and feel.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these products.  I&#x27;ve been using them for approximately one week and I can already see the change in my skin for the better.</li>
            <li> In just a few short weeks, I can already see and feel that my skin looks better, is smoother and more firm. I am most impressed, however, that these products do not irritate or dry out my super sensitive skin. I will definitely be ordering the Liquid Facelift again and will be recommending it to my friends and family. Great products!</li>
            <li> Great product! All three of these work well together. I used them until they were empty before I wrote this review. Now that they are empty and I am using something else. I do notice how well they really worked. I am going to buy another round!</li>
            <li> This is a must have all in one set, the collection of these three products are amazing and will be the only thing you need to take care of your skin. These products have so many benefits and did everything I wanted it to do. I was having problems with wrinkles on my forehead and this product really help eliminate the wrinkles that I was getting. It also helped with the dark circles I have under my eyes, I have tried a bunch of different products and non of them worked, except for this. These are amazing.</li>
            <li> Perfect skin is a tall order but it really does give my skin what it needs to get to its most perfect state. I can&#x27;t say enough about it and suggest it to any mom who doesn&#x27;t have time for spa treatments.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have both been using these products for a week. I feel my sagging skin tightening when I apply them.  My daughter&#x27;s skin is beginning to look a little smoother. After three months, I believe our  skin will be firmer, clearer and glowing. I will let you know.  A cosmetician told us that best results will begin to show after 90 days.  Also, the price is right. I am 80;my daughter is 40.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about aweek now .I am already seeing a difference in deep creases around my mouth and between my eyes. will update later.</li>
            <li> I just start using this product so I can not have opinion</li>
            <li> I bought this trio at a fantastic price and have been using it for almost 2 weeks. I have already noticed the difference in my skin tone and firmness. I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer for sure!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and feels great on my skin before my night cream!</li>
            <li> this sadly made my face break out - and I can no longer use it. The company however is FANTASTIC for customer service, when my shipment got lost, they stepped right up and helped! Stellar customer service, I just wish the items would have worked as well on my skin!</li>
            <li> Nothing short of amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and I have seen fabulous results.</li>
            <li> WOW!  works great...skin looks younger, smoother, and even toned</li>
            <li> I re-ordered twice. That says it all.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my face since using this threesome.  Even my twin sister said my face has that healthy glow. Many wrinkles around my lip area have been noticeably reduced.  I&#x27;ve recommended my secret to many people. Thanks for a product that really works.</li>
            <li> but discovered my skin was too sensitive for these products.  I experienced discomfort around my eyes for several days.  I can&#x27;t tell you how disappointed I was since I was not able to experience the results others had.  I guess my skin is more delicate than even I realized.  I think very highly of the Raw Biology staff.  They went out of their way to assist me in every way they could.  I am grateful for their kindness, as well as their assistance.  I am sure others will have positive results from these products.  A.D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  Please us the initials AD for this posting, rather than my full name.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great combination of facial serums. I like to use the Retinol at night and then I rotate the two Hyaluronic and Vitamin C serums every other day. You do need to wear a high SPF when using these serums. I like to use SPF 50 on my face. I use these serums after cleansing and toning my skin. I just get a small amount and spread it all over my face and neck. There is no strong smells so if you are sensitive to fragrance these shouldn&#x27;t bother your skin. They go on really smoothly and you don&#x27;t have to tug on your skin. I really like how quickly these sink into my skin so I can add moisturizer on top about 1 minute after application. So far I definitely notice that my skin is smoother and the few breakouts I had are gone. I think they have made my skin much more hydrated and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive these for review and inspection. All thoughts, opinions, and experiences are my own.</li>
            <li> using  with a 1.5 derma roller on my face 1 month. Definitely tightened my skin</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a birthday present for my sister. She immediately opened it and started using the products. A few days later she mentioned how great her skin looked and felt. It&#x27;s been two weeks now and she&#x27;s still seeing results. Great products and customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she seems to have really loved the product enough for me to purchase it again. She says it feels revitalizing and has a tingling sensation. She has noticed slight changes, for the first couple of weeks and is excited to make another purchase for them when her supply runs out.</li>
            <li> I would like to just say I&#x27;m not being compensated for my review. I never review anything, but this stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m 31, and have spent hundreds since turning 30 to help with my loss of elasticity, and larger pores. Nothing worked like this system. After only one use I saw and felt a big difference. After a week, my fine lines were gone. A few weeks, and my skin has its bounce back. It&#x27;s even dramatically faded my stretch marks, and my appendectomy scar. A little goes a super long way, so great value as well. I love this product, please never discontinue.</li>
            <li> have not seen any real results yet</li>
            <li> overall seems good and beneficial. Like that it is oganic, hope that it is also gmo free. I now await my free full size bottle of organic vitamin c serum.  Thnaks</li>
            <li> I have not finished the treatments, but I do believe it had made a difference.  Under eye circles do not seem as dark.  Have abused my skin with tanning so not expecting any miracles.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  Wish I had used these years ago! No magic improvement at this time, but face feels great when on. Will re&#x3D;evaluate at the end of the bottles :-)</li>
            <li> This product is the best i ever try. My face look shiny and fresh in the first week. This is the third time i bought this trilogy. An excellent product 100% recomended!!!!</li>
            <li> The price was really fair.I am still finishing up the bottles.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks  now and really haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great trio for skin renewal . I love my new skin . This product delivers results</li>
            <li> Did not see improvement.</li>
            <li> I know rhis products are going to help my facelift a lot i belive in them!</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my face feel and look.I will only use this on my face.Just try them you will never go back to store products. This is better on your face and really works. The price you can&#x27;t go wrong will buy again.love it!!!!.Pat</li>
            <li> Very absorbent, and doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry after use.  Wish all of them came with a pump (only the Organic Vitamin C one does), but otherwise an excellent set overall.</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel soft after applying and it is not heavy feeling. I like the fact that it is natural as I have issues with reacting to a lot of ingredients in other products. I have only been using for a few days, but if the results keep up, I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, must try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in esthetician for 10 yrs never seen a product work so quickly love this product forever customer</li>
            <li> Bottles were much larger than expected.  My skin feels smoother and tighter after only a few applications.  I love the serum form.  I find that with many creams, my foundation will not go over them smoothly.  No problem with these products.</li>
            <li> Loved this product, made my skin look luminous and bright. Have been using for a short time and already see an improvement in the clarity. I am looking forward to seeing the long term affects as the 3 ingredients are the best for beautiful skin. :)</li>
            <li> Can definitely feel the difference after a few weeks. I use to smoke quite heavily so my skin was quite dried out and damaged. After using this for a about a week and a half I started to notice a subtle difference in my skins smoothness, and even some of the smile lines have gone away but can still see I have a awhile before the bottle is gone so I should definitely see more improvement over time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.  Raw Biology is just the BEST!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff! I wish for more information about the individual products, but I&#x27;ve been using them anyway, and my skin seems to be brighter and plumper already. Glad that the Hyaluronic Acid has vitamin C in it, and that these products layer well. I just would like a percentage of the active ingredients so that I can compare it to similar products and anticipate how it will act on my skin with other things that I have.</li>
            <li> Great products. I have tried a lot of different things and this works great! Just wish the bottles were bigger!!</li>
            <li> Having ordered it several times, I am obviously most pleased with this product.  I love that it&#x27;s organic and am amazed that it has replaced my usual creams and moisturizers.  When I apply it to my face with my fingertips, I then smooth the excess onto the front of my neck and the back of each hand.  Incredibly, this product has greatly improved the quality of my skin in all instances!</li>
            <li> I like these I&#x27;m 46 I still get carded the package is protected very well.</li>
            <li> Saw no changes in 4 months</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I just received my order and am always excited to try natural and organic products.  I am 64 and like so many try everything, but as we age, our skin grows thinner and I am hoping for the results mentioned in other reviews.  It all went on smoothly; I am using it on my hands as well as face and neck. The card included says to give it 30 days ...  I will review again and hope it deserves several reorders!!  Also, think it says something of the company confidence in their product to offer free product .... a big plus!</li>
            <li> These are really great!!!&lt;br /&gt;I used only three times and I noticed my skin tone is brighter. Definitely I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> since I&#x27;ve been using this product. I can see my wrinkles around my eyes starting to disappear. Will definitely recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> Great product! I was truly surprised with the immediate results. My skin became more firm, softer, smoother and the wrinkles on my forehead diminished after the first application. I have been using the product for one week and I am looking forward to seeing the long term results.  I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and do my best to take care of my skin.  I am grateful that a friend recommended this product for me. It makes me feel younger!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product which is great value for money and has made my skin feel and look younger!</li>
            <li> The person I bought it for wanted to say that this is great because it&#x27;s lightweight and is easy for skin to absorb. The result is soft feeling skin so she loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for four months and have noticed positive changes in my skin--smoother texture, fewer wrinkles, and firmer skin.  I plan to continue using raw biology liquid facelift.</li>
            <li> Not very sure it is my 1st time using it , we have to wait for the end results.</li>
            <li> After using the serums for a few weeks my husband noticed a difference in my skin appearance.  I have noticed the difference as well.  It is much smoother and the wrinkles seem to be going away and dark spots are lightening. It took me awhile to get used to the routine application , but now I love the way my skin looks and feels and look forward to that clean fresh skin everyday.  I have recommended others to your site as this is a better price than others with 5 star ratings.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.  I am experiencing amazing results and will definitely continue to use products from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I am a very busy women with 5 daughters, I don&#x27;t have much time to think about me but I found Organic LIQUID FACELIFT raw biology and it is wonderful,  I really recommend. I Just use twice a day and got wonderful results.  I am so happy for finding something like this,  no  surgery , no needle and so easy to use .</li>
            <li> So far, so good! I love when a product arrives quicker than what the amazon site says! I have been using all three products for about 2.5 weeks.  I have been using the product religioulsy twice a day and my skin &amp;#34;appears&amp;#34; great!  Of course it says most results occur in 30 days-so I&#x27;m saying appears great, because it does, but looking forward to 30 days.  It is a little drying, but I use my regular SPF moisturizer with it; with no bad effects.  I love that for the price of one, I got three products.  I wish the bottles were bigger and will be ordering more product soon.  Go ahead and order for yourself...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but after awhile it seem to breakdown and became like water and not effective.&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised it would do that because I have order several different brands and it&#x27;s the&lt;br /&gt;first one that did that and the most expensive of all I have ordered.</li>
            <li> I received a discount on these to review.  I haven&#x27;t had much of a chance to try them, but here&#x27;s what I know so far: they are attractively packaged in nice, glass bottles.  They go on smoothly and dry quickly and a little goes a long way.  They did not cause me to break out or turn red, etc and there was no irritation.  My teen son is using this to clear up his acne and I&#x27;m using it to avoid wrinkles!!  For less than $30, this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> At first i didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, I was looking for the best routine for my face considering i break out in the same place over and over. I searched high and low, read 10000000 reviews on amazon. This didn&#x27;t have as many as the others but i decided to just go of it, after 2 hours of searching on amazon. After 2 weeks, my acne was more under control and my face seem to have this glowing hue to it.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again for sure.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i would change is that only one of them has a pump, i feel like a scientist getting my dropper out each time to put on my hand.&lt;br /&gt;oh and the vitamin C pump smells straight up like urine.&lt;br /&gt;other than that.. just buy it... it works.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as other brands I have purchased on Amazon. I feel like I just got mystery serum in a bottle. Not trusted due to no results or improvement.</li>
            <li> LOVE  THIS  PRODUCT  CUSTOMER  SERVICE IS  THE  BOMB!!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this trio for 30 days. It caused my skin to become blatchy. I do have sensitive skin, but I read the positive reviews , from others with sensitive skin. So I tried each separately and each one, turned my skin light read and blotchy. I know it can take time for your skin to get use to new products. But the redness and blotchy/uneven skin tone  only got worse.  On the positive side, my skin does look plumper and tighter. I stopped using the products.  But now I need to wear foundation to cover my uneven skin tone.  :-(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using these three products for three and half weeks and I have already noticed a difference in my skin.  Wrinkles are flattening out and my skin feels much better.  I am a 68 year old woman who has tried other products and never saw the changes that I am seeing now.  Getting ready to order another three.  I&#x27;m sure with continued use I will see further improvement.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I like</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products for my aging african american skin and am almost always disappointed. This actually WORKS. I am so so so happy I tried it. My problem is sagging skin and jowls. My face is like caved in on the sides where I have lost most of my collagen. This started in my late 30&#x27;s and I am now 44. This is helping to tighten my skin (I also do facial exercises) and my skin has a youthful glow. Its also helped the dark circles under my eye. It truly is a natural facelift.I am shocked and delighted. I must add that I also have very sensitive skin so I worried about that but so far no problems just great results. Will update the post as time goes on. I have been using this now for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I was offered this Organic Liquid Facelift for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it.  The set cae with a bottle of Hyaluronic Acid Serum, a bottle of Organic Vitamin C Serum, and a bottle of Retinol Serum. The directions say to use in any order twice a day for a month to see the results. Well, in just over 2 weeks, I have noticed that I have smoother skin and that the wrinkles on m forehead have started to fade slightly. I plan to continue this for the rest of the 30 days and probably longer. If you are looking for a great solution to salon facelift procedures, try this Organic Liquid Facelift first.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works fast.  Will reorder again and again.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Feel fresh and pump with my skin after using three every day, like them all!</li>
            <li> This worked fabulously with the needle stamp.</li>
            <li> Had to send back, broke my face out, but I have super sensitive skin, so for me it didnt work</li>
            <li> This will post under my husband&#x27;s name (we share the account), but I really wanted to write a review of this product.  I&#x27;ve been using the trio for just less than a month, and thought it might be helping a little.  After working almost 10 hours yesterday, I got home and my husband of 25 years hugged me and said &amp;#34;You&#x27;ve been looking just phenomenal lately.  What are you doing differently?&amp;#34;  SERIOUSLY, that happened.  Since I&#x27;m not stupid, I ordered another set today!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 8 months daily. I am 45 years old with fine lines from sun damage gained from deploying to the desert several times in addition to blowing winds. This product did a fantastic job rejuvenating my face and smoothing over the lines around my eyes. Although the manufacturer recommends use twice daily, it will depend on your ability to tolerate that much hyaluronic acid on your face. I&#x27;ve found, after about 4 months of use, once a day use (at night) was sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice side effect of using this is the acid caused my face to clear up, or minimize adult acne and blemishes. I did not have a big problem with it, but I rarely notice break-outs at all, now that I regularly use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and think that most users will get an excellent result, so long as it is used regularly to add collagen to aging skin and allow it to rejuvenate.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would see a difference- but I DID!  These serums are very light and do not have a fragrance- which works well for me.  After a couple of days I could see a difference in my skin- looks younger. For the price at Amazon- I would get these again.</li>
            <li> My wifes skin looks radiant and she loves this product! Excellent seller!</li>
            <li> Not the best quality. Deals are a rare find; this, you get what you pay for. Additionally, the retinol was clumpy and didn&#x27;t dispense easily with the dropper.</li>
            <li> Omg. I never write reviews unless it&#x27;s phenomenal and let me tell you this stuff is phenomenal. I bought it just a week ago and already my skin looks fabulous and I am going without makeup already. My skin is no longer splotchey and no more dark spots and dark underage bags. My husband couldn&#x27;t believe how great my skin has looked this past week. He&#x27;s even asking me to tell all of his friends&#x27; wives about this stuff. Truly amazing product. I am a diehard fan from here on out.</li>
            <li> no noticeable changes in the appearance of my skin! Was hoping  to see less wrinkling!</li>
            <li> Omg I love this product! Not much else to say about it. It&#x27;s just amazing. Use it morning and night, religiously and you will see amazing results!</li>
            <li> So many great reviews because.... they basically offer a free product for a review.  No thank you.  Worst product I have ever used on my face.  I use prescription retinol of 1.0 % and it works great.  This is supposed to be 2.5% and does not seem to work at all.  In fact, this hyaluronic acid makes me breakout although others do not.  Waste of money.  Should have read the reviews more carefully as I would have realized many are from free samples.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with these products!!! I have been using these products for about three months now. The hyloronic acid, vitamin c, and retinol combination are what I have been searching for for years. I have spent hundreds and hundred of dollars trying to find skin care that makes any kind of difference on my extremely sensitive, acne prone, aging skin. These products feel wonderful on my skin and do not break me out. I am 36 and got mistaken for an 18 year the other day. I also recently has a former student tell her parents that I look younger now than I did when I was her teacher 5 years ago. The products feel light and clean and make-up applies beautifully on top of it. I am so glad to finally have found something that works and I love that the products are natural.</li>
            <li> I have been using all three products.  It&#x27;s all natural and chemical free.  I saw difference in my skin in three days of use.  I have been using for two weeks.  I have noticed that my acne scars are lighter and my skin feels smoother and brighter. My skin is glowing with vitamin c and hyaluronic acid serum. I can see less wrinkles and smooth lines.  I strongly recommend all three product.  It has the great results</li>
            <li> good products a nice value</li>
            <li> I really like all three products. My skin feels very soft and light. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I think that to be really specific about this product is to add important informations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. AGE&lt;br /&gt;2. SMOKER/NON SMOKER&lt;br /&gt;3. HEALTHY/NOT HEALTHY&lt;br /&gt;4. SUNBATHING OFTEN&lt;br /&gt;5. DRY SPACE AREA/HUMID LIKE FLORIDA&lt;br /&gt;6. DRINKING SODA OR WATER&lt;br /&gt;7. HOW OFTEN DO YOU USE IT&lt;br /&gt;8. HOW LONG HAVE YOU USED IT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My age is 53, non smoker, healthy, dry space, can&#x27;t sunbathe, water once a day, just started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my review, and I paid for the product, is that I like the product so far. Easy to use, no odor. It has a lift sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give you my results in a month.</li>
            <li> Just received my products in the mail, an have only used it once, but I can say that the packaging is very nice, as for the actual product it&#x27;s very light and moisturizing sinks right into the skin which is what I like. My skin felt really soft afterwards,I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does with prolonged usage.</li>
            <li> product performed as promised.  I can see my skin improving</li>
            <li> Amazing products! I just reordered it after using it for the last couple of months. My face has never looked better. I have scarring from teenage acne that even laser treatments didn&#x27;t get all the way. As my skin has aged, the lack of elasticity makes the scarring more obvious. But since using this dynamic trio my skin is tighter, brighter and healthier looking than ever before. I think it&#x27;s a double benefit that I use it nightly with my microneedle roller between each product. It helps it penetrate and really build the collagen. Awesome find...I&#x27;m hooked for life!</li>
            <li> Love these products. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These products are amazing! I had researched serveral other option before deciding on this set. I thought that I may have a problem with putting on these serums but they are so easy. My face has not felt this smooth in over a decade! Plus my skin is very sensitive, but these products felt refreshing and didn&#x27;t sting at all.  still have 10 days to go to see the toning effects and I&#x27;m so anticipating a positive results with what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> This is Amazing!!! This is the best facial products I&#x27;ve used in a long time and it does exactly what it claims to do. I&#x27;m 52 and I look 40! I will never use another facial product again - and the price is excellent too.</li>
            <li> I placed my order and it was delivered in less than 3 days (and it came to Arkansas all the way from New York). I love that they are organic products for such a great price. They have no strong scent, if any. As of today, I&#x27;ve only used the products a week. Nighttime I use all three (HA, VC, then Retinol). In the morning I use the HA and VC, but skip the Retinol as I want my skin to adjust before using twice daily. My skin type is oily and acne prone. I&#x27;ve never experienced cystic acne but I always have a mild breakout, at least. This seems to be clearing it up. I don&#x27;t moisturize with anything else. The serums are plenty moisturizing and gentle around my eyes. (I have deep set eyes with dark circles and they are extremely difficult to cover. Hopefully these help.) They make the perfect surface to apply makeup so if you use primer, you&#x27;ll no longer need it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product about 2 weeks and am absolutely amazed! I can see a noticeable difference and so have those who are close to me. My skin not only looks better but feels more elastic and younger. I am a native Floridian with fare skin, and light eyes and hair and have been an avid sun person all my life. Needless to say that my skin has suffered some severe damage over the 54 years. I was considering some very aggressive and expensive skin peels when a friend of mine told me about Raw Biology&#x27;s &amp;#34;3 in 1 Trinity pack&amp;#34; so I thought what the heck I&#x27;ll try it. I also really love the fact that the product is Organic. I&#x27;m definitely adding these to my permanent skin regimen. I will definitely keep using and recommend to friends and family! Thank you Raw Biology.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these serums for one month and very pleased with result!!! Skin tone is impruving, face feels very soft  and looks 5 years younger. Highly recommend this product for ladies.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a change in just 7 days!!!!</li>
            <li> Well if I never - something that actually does what it says it does. Superb product, I bought it at full price... doh!,... so I&#x27;m definitely reordering here on Amazon before the price goes back up.</li>
            <li> You can not beat the price on this product leaves my skin feeling silky smooth, my  skin really is hydrated, smooth and soft right after application, serums truly are instantly absorbed,  does not leave the oily feeling on you skin,</li>
            <li> Great quality products at a very reasonable price, considering I have very sensitive skin and am prone to bouts of psoriasis, using new products on my skin can cause problems, quite the opposite with this range. I have seen such great results over the past few weeks that I now can&#x27;t imagine not having them as part of my daily skincare regime.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Been using for two months and can see a difference,  also good value.</li>
            <li> I have tried and spent a lot of money on other products for my skin care and and having sensitive skin , I know right away if something will work or not . This product is fantastic, I don&#x27;t have any reaction(yeah!)  my skin feels tighter -softer.&lt;br /&gt; the trio is very light not heavy at all . I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good quality product for their daily skin care.</li>
            <li> Wow! I was a bit hesitant about ordering as I was concerned that three products on my face would make my skin feel coated and smothered but that concern disappeared after the first use. The products are easily applied and quickly absorbed into the skin. My fine lines and wrinkles have definitely diminished along with the age enlarged pores. I have purchased other more expensive products with little to no visible improvement, but after one week of use I can truly see the improvement. A little goes a long way so it will be a while, but I will be repurchasing as soon as I run out! Give it a try; I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed! ...and the customer service is also terrific!</li>
            <li> Very happy can buy it, expect it to effect</li>
            <li> I was using just the Vit C and the Hyaluronic acid for about 1.5 months and can notice a difference.  No more dry skin thanks to the Hyaluronic acid.  And overall just better glow or something.  And the Vit C works super super well on uneven belly skin from past pregnancies. I can&#x27;t believe what a difference it&#x27;s making!  Also I use these on my hands at night and the texture and dryness is better from the Vit C on my hands too.  I&#x27;m just adding the retinol in now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Raw Biology products for 4 weeks. Before, my skin looked very dull and I had small patches of breakouts.  Now, after using the &amp;#34;trilogy&amp;#34; morning and night, my face is visibly brighter and clearer! Skin tone has evened out. My face feels smooth and has a healthy glow.  I will definitely continue using this product. I read it may take up to 6 months to see full results. But so far, I&#x27;m very happy with what I see! -NJ Bostic in Louisiana</li>
            <li> I use this trio as my main facial routine, twice daily. After cleansing skin, apply first serum and wait a few minutes then add the next product, eventually using all 3. I do not wear foundation or any other products with the exception of a little mascara. Just remember to apply sunscreen before going outside. I have noticed fewer break-outs and skin seems more even-toned and glowing. I would recommend this product especially throughout the winter months when skin is often dry. Thank you Raw Biology for making such an awesome organic product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something for my acne scars for years now and chanced upon this facelift and I&#x27;m keen to keep things organic so I thought I would give it a try. What can I say but Amazing! It&#x27;s made my whole skin look better. I was even asked for ID in a bar last night. I&#x27;m 40. Now if you could get a baldness cure I&#x27;d be buying shares.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed.^^  You have to try and see the results.  And price is amazing.^^  Can not complaining. ^^</li>
            <li> Definitely a facelift in a 3 jars. The organic facelift is very light and non sticky. Makes your skin soft. Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give a complete review, but I feel that my face won&#x27;t be disappointed. I will come back for an after 30 day update.</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews, I decided to place an order on March 13,2015,for the Organic LIQUID FACELIFT. All-in-one .&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to receive the product.&lt;br /&gt;Also disappointing, are the recent reviews stating free product is given in exchange for reviews. I did think it was odd that so many people reviewed the product immediately after receiving it. Not even giving the product enough time to see any results. Seems a little scammy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend serumtologie® C º22 -Max Anti Aging serum. I have been pleased with the results, and they have great customer service.</li>
            <li> Thanks to raw biology for an awesome range of products.  I&#x27;ve been using creams and serums to counter the affects of ageing for some time and I look forward to more products from you guys.  Absolutely five stars based upon quality and value for money.  Its almost impossible to find organic products for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Not the cure-all but it does help with crows feet</li>
            <li> Wow, absolutely fabulous! I have used many creams in the past but nothing compares to Organic Facelift. My face looks brighter and has a nice healthy nourished glow. People at my work keep asking me what I have been doing. I love the product, I highly recommend Organic Facelift!</li>
            <li> This product has lived up to its hype. So light and smooth makes my skin feel tighter and younger looking thank u</li>
            <li> My pores are definitely smaller. I like well enough to keep using and will write a follow up review in 60 days.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for 4 weeks and all I can say is WOW!! I have tried everything anti-aging and these are the only ones that I have seen visible results with..smaller pores, brighter skin and lifting. I highly recommend that you try these amazing products,</li>
            <li> Great product I will definately continue to use this is amazing.  My skin is smooth and feels tighter.</li>
            <li> after using this three Serums my skin very dewy &amp; very smooth, very much like it..</li>
            <li> I like the 3 part system. It works I have noticed my skin getting tighter and my lines are fewer</li>
            <li> Product as described fast ship</li>
            <li> After using this product I have noticed a change. My skin is a lot smoother and vibrant. Would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Started using these products last week. Can definitely tell a difference in my skin tone and the fine lines around my eyes. Will continue to use. Great products!!!</li>
            <li> I started by using the vitamin c products in this range and the three pack combination was such a good deal that I tried using them together.  The best thing I find about all of the products from raw biology (and I also use the cellulite removal cream) is that they are not hugely potent.  The ingredients are organic and I feel confident in applying them to my skin.  The products always arrive on time and are well presented and packaged.  Great value and great products.  I look forward to hearing about more products from you guys!  Highly recommended for men and women alike!</li>
            <li> I love this series!  It works really well ~ I can see and feel the difference in my skin.  Very happy with product!</li>
            <li> Great product, and great customer service!</li>
            <li> I have been using these three products religiously and have seen a significant improvement in fine lines around my eyes that have all but disappeared.  There is an overall tightening of my skin and general firmness that has come from using the three products that I have yet to find with any other products that I have purchased over the last few years. The overall glow of my skin from the vitamin C has made a huge difference in my overall complexion and has made my skin go from appearing dull to looking renewed and refreshed! I cannot say enough about this trio of magic in a bottle...</li>
            <li> Just ordered my second set since the instructions states 27 days for skin to rebuild and repair, 6 months for optimum results.  I&#x27;ve been using as directed for three weeks now, and am a little disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the remarkable results as other reviewers. Of course, everybody&#x27;s skin is different and there&#x27;s no miracle &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; for aging skin, but these serums have been as good as some of the moisturizers and treatments I&#x27;ve thrown money at. So, I&#x27;ll give it another round and hope for the miracle!</li>
            <li> Oh my God! my wife and daughter love these....! A fraction of the cost of Skincueticals and way better results. I&#x27;m 52 and I even used them, as long as my buddies don&#x27;t find out. So the bottom line is they have more active ingredient at about a quarter of the cost of the stuff they were using before. But the better part is you can actually see the results it&#x27;s been almost 2 weeks. So now my mother-in-law my sisters in law and my mom are going to get some surprises. My wife is so ecstatic and my 22-year-old daughter who doesn&#x27;t need anything to look beautiful are completely hooked on these products. But the truth is I can see a very noticeable difference, big time! By the way I forgot to add that I ordered some for a gift and the thank you card I got was extremely positive.  Thanks for saving me so much money. The retinal, vitamin C and H Acid my wife was buying was over $100 bucks</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and so far I like it I&#x27;m starting to notice my complexion a lot smoother. I was happy with fast shipping I did think I wou receive so fast.</li>
            <li> Really notice a difference in my skin being healthier and looking smoother!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it every day as it makes my skin peel.  That may be what it&#x27;s supposed to do, though.  If you have sensitive skin be sure to put a good moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> Very good product ..love it ..and I am sure I will order it again when I finish..</li>
            <li> this is did remove my fine lines or the appearance of them though I used it twice daily as instructed and never missed a day till it was gone.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive fair skin and didn&#x27;t have much success with other serums. The retinol is a little too much for my skin every night. I use Neutrogena Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle Moisture for the retinol and that works. The clear gel and the green bottle made my skin smooth. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was doing any good, but I had to go to a dermatological surgeon for a suspicious growth. While there, the surgeon as well as the physician&#x27;s assistant, both commented on what amazing skin I had and how young I looked for my age! I&#x27;m in my sixties so I thought they were just trying to make me feel good, but they insisted that they &amp;#34;saw a lot of skin&amp;#34; and they would have guessed I was in my early fifties. They were looking through a bright light and magnifying glass. The surgeon said to keep doing whatever I was doing. You can&#x27;t argue with that type of reaction.</li>
            <li> I have been using all three of these exceptional serums for several weeks. My results have been amazing. I highly recommend these serums to everyone.  They have made a dramatic difference in the way I care for my skin. The difference is very noticeable to my family and friends. This product line is truly life changing.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to begin using these products.  It is amazing to find a skin care line that covers all of my problem areas, e.g., fine lines, stretch marks and uneven skin tone.  And the best part is that natural and organic ingredients!!!</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using these three products I started noticing a severe improvement in my skin. It was softer and less dull. My skintone became more even and dewy. I&#x27;m on my 8th week and still on my first bottles, a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m definitely adding these to my permanent skin regimen!</li>
            <li> First off, I am not on a quest for the fountain of youth, so I never really bought a lot of serums and potions and lotions to wage war against my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my 70 yr old mother who is beautiful but discovered the &amp;#34;joy&amp;#34; of Facebook selfies and wanted to plumpify her skin before she&#x27;d be ready for the camera, Mr. DeMille. So I bought this for her - then she discovered photoshop and made all these bottles practically obsolete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not being wasteful, I figured I should probably use them. After all, I&#x27;m nearing 40 and even though I&#x27;m late to the game, my skin may need some insurance against future ravages of time. So I&#x27;ve been using this stuff. Religiously.  For months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used anything religiously for months. My field of damns I give for anti aging products was barren until now but with this, it flourishes mightily. I cannot even go a day without this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously - even one day off and you run back to the bottle. Its like alcoholism, but rather than sloppy behavior, life ruining decisions and looking like a pop star has-been, your skin glows, plumps, looks fresh and gives you a rock star in her blossoming youth before drugs and bad choices vibe. So soft. So smooth and glorious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soaks in quickly and the change in the quality of your skin is near instant. It does what naps are supposed to do, giving you that relaxed, flushed, satisfied look. Don&#x27;t your naps do that? If not, A. you&#x27;re napping wrong and B. you need to buy this stuff now to simulate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. My field over-floweth with damns I give about this product and its awesomeness.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin looks and feels better already and I have only been using it for a week.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks it seems kind of watery but I&#x27;m going to give it some time I mix it with my moisturizer it seems to work better than using each one individually. I will let you know in how my results turn out. Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Shipping fast.  Works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and dealing with medical issues that compound the natural aging process that we all are going through.  I feel like I am drying up like a worn out dish rag. My face was looking I put one of those peel off masks on my face and forgot to peel it off! I tried a different brand of hyaluronic acid and after 30 days saw little difference.  Nothing like what people were talking about. Despertately I tried this three part system. Two weeks in I could see a big difference.  Six weeks later I walked into a Sephora to get a foundation now hat my face is smooth again. I was being helped by a District Manager and I told him that I have problems with my face being dry and peeling and that I have been using a product that i bought off Amazon from Raw Biology to get it better.  he asked to touch my face and did then he said &amp;#34;Honey I don&#x27;t know what you are putting on your face but you do not have dry skin!&amp;#34; Wowser! They sell the same type of stuff for 300.00 for all three products and it is still not the same because theirs has additives and purfumes.  All I can say is give it 30 days, I would reccommend to anyone. UP DATE!  1-2017 - I was severely burned by this product and notified Amazon. I was told by a Amazon customer service person that this was taken off your site as I was not the only person effected this way.!</li>
            <li> We are happy with the Raw Biology Liquid Facelift set.  We purchased the Organic vitamin serum set in&lt;br /&gt;a promotion for testing and review.  They are organic, chemical free and do seem to give your complexion&lt;br /&gt;a much smoother look and feel.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It all started with trying to find the best anti-aging skin care product and liquid face lift product on the market. The products that actually work.. Because we all know many don&#x27;t work!!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this skin care line. I truly saw a difference in just days! I also have very sensitive skin and this product was just perfect, no allergic reactions! I couldn&#x27;t be happier and I wouldn&#x27;t think twice on this product when choosing a skin care product to purchase!!! Also the seller was very easy to work with and very reliable. I received my shipment ontime as promised.</li>
            <li> I experienced very good results using the 3 products as directed.  I would recommend these products to others who want to improve skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a different in my fine lines while using this product. However, it did seem to give my skin a healthy glow</li>
            <li> Received product and have only used a few days but my skin feels wonderful. I&#x27;m excited to keep using.&lt;br /&gt; and see what happens.</li>
            <li> My friend told me to try this product. I was skeptical, I&#x27;ve tried products before that I either hardly saw any results or I saw none at all. Finally, I&#x27;m more than happy to say this product really works. Hands down, the best product I&#x27;ve tried in years. I noticed results immediately and my skin is left soft to the touch and more youthful. I would recommend to anyone it&#x27;s a wonderful and safe way to keep your skin looking youthful and fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trio for three days along with the dermarroller and so far my wrinkle in between my eye brows is less noticeable. However i think you have to use the dermarroller to let these three products penetrate the skin. I will write a new review in a few weeks .</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. I have to admit I was skeptical at first but I thought for the price what the heck. The first thing I noticed in just the first two days was how my pores had shrunk considerably, that for me was  big plus. I am 43 and had considerably good skin throughout my years, these past few have made up for the all that had passed me by. I used the products as directed and the texture of my skin has improve in less than a week. I will continue to use this product faithfully until the magic stops.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product because of the reviews and price and honestly I wanted to give my best review so I used this for over a month now and I seen absolutely no improvement in my skin at all unfortunately. I used this once in morning and before bed every day. It just did not do was what each bottle claimed it would do and so sadly to say it did absolutely nothing. I really wish I could review products before purchasing them because I lost $$ and basically threw my money away on a useless product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product kit especially if you have combination skin and are in lower 40s with blemishes or any scaring both surgical and a slight acne scar, fine lines and crows feet. I am slightly starting to get these fine lines, crows feet and slight wrinkles so I&#x27;m trying to improve them and what my skin is doing and it was like I didn&#x27;t use anything.  It feels good when putting it on and leaving it on but that is all I can say. I will continue to use it just because I hate throwing my money away so if anything changes by a miracle I will update this review. I&#x27;m giving it 1 star for packaging it was nicely done.</li>
            <li> I just received the Organic Liquid Facelift - which came very quickly.  Tried the products - as directed - and in one night - I saw a great difference in the tone  and tightening of my skin. February weather is the worst and these products definitely have some real positive effects.  I will keep using it  and write back with an update - but as of tonight - I love it..    thanks raw bio...................</li>
            <li> After only 3 days of using these products my skin looks and feels smooth as well as brighter. I hope this continues and my sunspots lighten up. I have a positive attitude towards these products that&#x27;s why I gave it 5 stars! Also I&#x27;m using these only my arm to see if my sunspots fade as well. Can&#x27;t wait for a 4 week report.</li>
            <li> shipped to me fast what a great product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just started using these but my face does feel softer and overall appearance is improved!</li>
            <li> Fast and efficient delivery. I have just used it one day and I adore how it makes my skin feel. I am looking forward to seeing improvements with use&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and I already seen huge differences in the way my skin feels and the softness of it.  I am in the sun a lot and sometimes my skin gets lightly burned and feels dry but once I started using this product it has helped so much, making it feel smoother.  My light wrinkles are less visible and my skin feels smoother and healthier.  I was skeptical at first but I am so glad I ended up getting this product.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I Love this product, my face feels brighter and softer after only a week. I would definitely recommend someone on the fence to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Can truly see a difference in my skin!  I will continue to use this product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product. Order was delivered within a few days. Feels unbelievable on your skin. Buy it you will love it!</li>
            <li> Got this product for my girlfriend. A friend recommended it. Thought she may like it since she has every other lotion and potion. She loves it &amp;raves about how well it wrks. If ur looking to improve ur faces skin tone &amp;over all look of ur skin. This will surely help</li>
            <li> I have used several different company&#x27;s products over the past 2 years and have little or no results until this product. I will be reordering and referring all of my family and friends. It is nice to finally see a product that actually delivers what it says it will. Thank you from a new long term satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;Tom Tobin</li>
            <li> This is the full package of skincare! Antiaging, hydrating and toning. It all works great and there is no strong scent, which is great for something that&#x27;s going to be on your face all day. It isn&#x27;t drying or irritating. I am a big fan!</li>
            <li> So amazed for the shipment, very fast!!! Can&#x27;t wait and I&#x27;m so excited to use the product, for the first used I can tell the difference. Now I&#x27;m writing a good review not because they&#x27;re giving away a free full size bottle of organic Vit C Serum but this is so real and of what I experienced. My face feels so smooth and glowing for a few application. Love touching my face all the time. Looking forward for more good results! 😃 By the way, Im so excited for their give away!</li>
            <li> Great products, great price, great service! Many thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product for a few days now and I ALREADY see and feel the difference.  My skin is noticeably brighter and feels softer. I&#x27;ve already recommended the product to my friends!! Cant wait to try other products from the line!</li>
            <li> Product arrived when promised. Each bottle was  wrapped in bubble wrap which was great because the bottles are glass. The product was quite thick but my skin drank it up quickly. I am grateful to find they are fragrance free because I am very sensitive to smells so that was a bonus! I do wish instructions came with them because I do not know if it matters which lotion you put on first, second, and then third.</li>
            <li> Just received my order of Organic Liquid Facelift and can&#x27;t wait to use it and see quick results.</li>
            <li> Great set of products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 36 with combination skin and I have a fair amount of aging around my eyes. Immediately after applying the fine lines and wrinkles disappeared. I have only been using them for about 2 weeks so I probably need to use them a bit longer to see any permanent results, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used vitamin C/ hyaluronic acid serums in the past and was always picky about the consistency. I was very happy with the consistency of these serums. I prefer hyaluronic acid to be a little on the runny side so these were perfect. The Retinol with Hyaluronic and Vitamin E is on the thicker side but absorbs well after using the first 2 serums. Loving the plump, dewey look of my skin from these products!</li>
            <li> All three products are great! I love the way it makes my skin feel after I use it. My skin feels soft and rejuvinated. I&#x27;ve even niced some of my wrinkles deminishing. My fiance was the one that turned me unto this. I&#x27;m glad I listened.</li>
            <li> product is fantastic, cannot wait to see the progression of my skin over the next few weeks. I will certainly order again</li>
            <li> I have only just begun using this product and like the results so far.  I am excited to see how results are after a few weeks.  The application is easy and it goes on great.  I have not had any reddening which I was worried about.  Skin feels tight and smooth after application.  Great value!</li>
            <li> I purchased based on high reviews that I found out had to do with a promise of a free product as I was sent the same flyer.  Products were not as described and caused bad skin irritation on non-sensitive skin. Would not recommend any of these products.</li>
            <li> These do not add up to other products of the same type and Iv&#x27;e tried many, bargains and high end$$$. Best so far for the money is cosmetic skin solutions. (The c &amp; e serum) just as good as the high end well known product. The other 2 products I tried from same company just o.k. ( 20% c and retinol. I want to send these back. Will you e-mail me on directions and if I can.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable, the best product of this type I have tried in years. I cannot recommend it enough</li>
            <li> I havent been using it very long, but I do like the way it makes my face feel.  I can tell it already working.  I will diffently be ordering more when I get close to empty.  Your makeup glides on over the serums.  My fines lines are already starting to get lighter.</li>
            <li> My skin looks happier in the 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using these 3 products. It is certainly too soon to see any dramatic effects, but based on the other reviews, and what I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of noticing so far, I know my skin is headed in a good direction. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what these products are capable of!!</li>
            <li> Product works great! Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Great product! Was recommended by a family member after a conversation one evening. Am not really into the whole organic thingy but this may have just changed my mind. Delivered quickly and packaging was of a high standard.</li>
            <li> This set is a must have in your beauty product collection! I had horrible dark circles, adult acne, and I noticed age spots like no other. I started to use this set religiously and my face feels softer, firm, my dark circles and age spots are disappearing. With all the natural ingredients used, my sensitive face is not breaking out in a rash which is a big relief. I have tried other types of face products only to see my face get worse. This is the fountain of youth in 3 bottles!</li>
            <li> This regime is quite extradinary in that can feel the action of each liquid upon application.  The Vitamin C feel as though it gets into the skin cells and nourihes skin for comfort and suppleness.</li>
            <li> Similar to my experience using this brands product for cellulite removal - I am equally impressed.  The product reached me within a few days of ordering and I like the way they make no guarantees.  I was unsure which order to use the products in as its not made that clear but after speaking to customer service - I was reassured.  They can be used in any order.  My skin has been typically irritated when using hyaluronic acid but not with this brand.  Like the cellulite removal cream - i highly recommend giving this brand a try.</li>
            <li> I have used some of the most expensive stuff sold around the world without the results I have received from Liquid Facelift.  I&#x27;ve been using this for ten days and have noticeable results and the price is right.  My skin is glowing.  I&#x27;ll be reordering.</li>
            <li> These three products really do add moisture to your face! This plumps the skin, thereby making the fine lines less visible. I have been using this trio for a little over a month, and while I have not yet experienced any long-term changes or line reductions, I do like the daily smoothing and hydrating it provides. It soaks in fairly well, though for comparison, I have unique skin that doesn&#x27;t absorb most serums fully. My skin is very dry and thin. I mainly purchased these for hydrating purposes, and they do just that. My only complaint is that the hydration only lasts for about 6-8 hours before reapplication is needed, but again, that could be due to my dry skin. I will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well after a week of using product. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> These products are just OK in my opinion. If you have never used Hyaluronic acid or Retinol before, then you may see more dramatic results than I did.  Since I have used other brands of vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid, and Retin A (stronger form of Retinol) before, I saw little difference.</li>
            <li> I am a customer of Raw Biology for quite sometime. It has wonderful products and this happen to be one of it. I bought this product a while back and it has unbelievable results. I was using it for about a month and a half and the result was showing on my skin. It improve my skin tone and it feels great. I am suprise of how my skin looks when i look at the mirror. I will def buy more from Raw Biology again.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Trinity&#x27; set WORKS.... I have a very simple skincare routine; soap, water and rosehip oil. I have never considered using any supplemental skincare products until now; I was particularly interested in these products given their organic certification, transparent ingredient list and that they include only natural preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 38, have olive skin with a little sun damage / brown spots on my décolletage and face - Using these products has considerably transformed the tone, firmness and clarity of my skin, significantly evening out the patchiness and fine lines from my years of sunbathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have added this to my daily routine for a little under 2 months now, and the results are just incredible. I wish I had taken a before and after picture so you can see the changes - OUTSTANDING!</li>
            <li> SUPER Impressed!  Used this for only a week and saw results.  My skin feels smoother and looks great.  I will absolutely be purchasing this again and adding to my daily skin routine!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t EVER stop making these products...ever! I have tried so many different facial serums and creams that claim to do so much and I haven&#x27;t seen the results that I have since using this combination &amp;#34;Trinity.&amp;#34; I was so impressed that I have 5 sets waiting just in case I can&#x27;t get my hands on it. I use a facial brush and after cleansing I apply the 3 products in the order the manufacturer suggests. My skin in one month has transformed. My dark sun spots are fading and my complexion is glowing. For 53 years old, I do not have many wrinkles but I can see a difference in those also. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin responds after I continue to use these products...Thank you so much. Suzanne</li>
            <li> Love this! Customer service was amazing,  I received my order with one broken bottle (it was packaged fine, we have just had an extremely cold winter here in Maine and the Vitamin C froze and broke). I emailed customer service and they promptly replied and had another bottle in the mail in no time! It.made a huge difference having that third bottle in the set! My skin feels great and I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the organic liquid facelift all-in-one for the past six weeks. I&#x27;ve seen a big difference in my skin. My friends notice it too . Since then two of my friends have ordered this product for themselves. Very good product and also very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it less than a month and I think I see some improvement.  Will give it another month before I make a final decision.</li>
            <li> I think that I should have bought these for my friends for Christmas instead of the keepsake ornaments I normally buy. Everyone has commented on what I look like when I make my different facial expressions and how I have less wrinkles. ...I&#x27;ve had to say it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m using this new serum.  I love natural products and my skin does too.  My face is very sensitive due to different prescription medicine I have to take and this has had no reaction.  Thank goodness!</li>
            <li> I like the process of all three - I am satisfied with product and I will continue to use for the suggested 6 months.</li>
            <li> This works wonders. I have used many different C serums and mixes. These are really making a difference in my skin texture. My skin is also prone to breakouts and this has helped that a lot. I get an occasional pimple, but it comes up and is gone in two days. My skin is no longer splotchy looking. I spent my whole life able to go about without makeup, but the last year, my skin was uneven looking, even with the serums I was using. I couldn&#x27;t leave the house without makeup. Not so anymore. I am back to going without makeup without feeling like I look like a mess. My neck was looking a little crepey, but not anymore. I also do facial yoga, so at 52, I am still looking really good, with almost no wrinkles. I think this combo will ensure that stays that way for longer!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in February and wanted to use it for a couple of months in order to see if this trio lived up to the claims.  I came across this product as I was about to order my regular organic retinol cream of which I have no complaints.  I wanted to try the vitamin c in particular because I had a dark spot below each eyebrow and they were darkening to the piont where concealer did not cover adequately.  I use this trio morning and night and for the first three or four nights I applied my original organic retinol cream last because I felt my face would be too dry.  In order to test the product I stopped using my original cream over the trio and was extremely happy to find that my skin did not appear dry at all.  In my case the results over two months of continuance use have been evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark spots are lightening daily to where the two dark spots I was using as a gauge have almost disappeared.  I no longer use concealer to cover&lt;br /&gt;lines have softened and flattened&lt;br /&gt;Skin is much firmer and brighter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am told my eyes are my best feature.  I have seen a dramatic improvement in that my laugh lines have all but disappeared and the skin appears to have noticeably firmed around my eyes and lids.  Lip lines have flattened and smoothed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed that I reordered this product at the end of March because I did not want to run out.  I am very pleased with the cost and the trio lasted me a full two months using it twice a day every day.</li>
            <li> These products are the best, and tried other products like everyone else.  But with all combinations of all three products are used in the morning and evening, the results are great...I am 40 years of age and stays healthy with eatng healthy as well.  Definitely will have an amazing results,  lots of compliment with my face looking younger and distinguish the more I get older.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Definitely noticed pore and blackhead reduction. I use Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner-Rose Petal (found it on Amazon) with a cotton ball to clean my face gently and then use the Organic Liquid Facelift. Definitely noticed a reduction of black heads, white heads and pore size. I will re-order this as needed. You don&#x27;t need to use much of this product. It should last a couple of months, depending on usage.</li>
            <li> I love it, after  less than a month I have noticed results!</li>
            <li> I just loved using this product. My skin became cleaner, clear and smoother. I love the convenience of three products in one; It does NOT leave the skin greasy, and blends easily... I noticed that price has gone UP since I bought mine... Still, I feel it&#x27;s a good product for the price. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it. Thank you guys!</li>
            <li> This trio should be the basis for all skincare regimes. It has vitamin C, retinal and hyaluronic acid and your skin will drink it up. I have noticed my skin feels softer and more moisturized. The formulas soak in quickly so you can do the rest of your skincare morning and night. Will continue to use daily!</li>
            <li> just smooth that&#x27;s all I feel. I don&#x27;t see any improvement. retinol left sticky feeling and some break out :( you get what you pay for..</li>
            <li> I have recently ordered more of these outstanding products.  Have been using the Retinol-A + Vitamin C trinity pack for over a month.  I literally get compliments about how great my skin looks on a daily basis.  My face looks and feels better than it has since I was a teenager.  So thankful to have found the Raw Biology trinity!!!</li>
            <li> I am new to using skin care products and feel like I hit the jackpot with this set. My skin feels and looks completely different. I should have started sooner. I have a scar under my right eye that is completely disappearing. I did not expect that. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Good Products , great value fof all three. I would recomend this deal,&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had was with the liquid Vitamin C , not sure how to apply as its not a jell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for just a few days, but my skin feels soft and &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product last week, received it the next day, and it&#x27;s already showing positive results.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical buying new skin care products as I have VERY sensitive skin.  I decided to try this for a few reasons, it’s fragrance free, the price, and the reviews were for the most part positive.  I am so glad I tried, my skin is softer and definitely fresher looking.  I can already see after four weeks sun spots fading.  My pores around my chin area get clotted and drab looking, and I am starting to see this area clear up and feel softer.  Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking to brighten their skin up.  For the price it’s really a win/win.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product a couple of weeks &amp; I&#x27;m really pleased with the results, my skin is noticeably firmer &amp; smoother &amp; the puffiness around my eyes has most definitely reduced. Might not need that face lift after all!!</li>
            <li> Just received but will give it 4 weeks</li>
            <li> Got my order super quick!  Excited to see the changes in my skin!!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product based on reviews only to discover that all the positive reviews were a result of the promise of a free bottle of the Vitamin C serum in exchange for a review submitted within a fews days of receiving the shipment. It takes, according to the manufacturer, 30 days to see results and up to 6 months for maximum results, so all the previous reviews are suspect at best.  I&#x27;ve been using all 3 serums for 4 weeks and can see absolutely no difference, so far a total waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many things, but the combination of the three hit the spot.  After two weeks using it, it was just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great price,  nicely packaged, quick ship, quality ingredients. Tried the vitamin C so far and it goes on very smoothly.  Will update after longer use but am pleased so far.</li>
            <li> This is the second time ordering this product, the last time I did not get the organic c serum, so adding that to my skin care routine has made me happier still to have found these products. I am loving what I&#x27;m seeing. Hope this secret doesn&#x27;t get out, I worry the price will make go out of my budget.</li>
            <li> I do not like giving a bad review because this is how someone makes a living!!!  So, I will say this product is not for me.  It leaves a sticky feeling and I simply can not stand my skin feeling sticky.  I honestly can not say it works or does not work because I quit using it after three trys.  I will stick to the one I have been using  as it works and is not sticky.</li>
            <li> I already see and feel a difference in just a few weeks!  My skin feels smoother and softer and my skin tone looks more even. I have melasma pretty much all over my face, and while I know it will never go completely away, it is such a relief to have found a product that lightens and brightens my skin. The darker spots on my face are not the first thing I see in the mirror anymore!  I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks and feels after several months of use.  I&#x27;m 41 this year but I don&#x27;t look it--the combination of these serums is going to keep it that way!</li>
            <li> I have been used all three products twice a day for three weeks and I&#x27;m more than happy  to see the improvements--&lt;br /&gt;My overall skin tone is getting more even and fine lines are reduced.&lt;br /&gt;It seems also help lighten up the dark spots and reduce blemishes.</li>
            <li> So, being somewhat skeptical, I asked my Medical Doctor who specializes in skin treatments if this would be a good product to try and she said, Yes!  I&#x27;ve been using the Trinity now for about 3 weeks and am loving how smooth and tight my skin feels and looks.  Just ordered again. I&#x27;m using it morning and night on a freshly washed face. Good stuff. Good price. Easy to use. Loving it.</li>
