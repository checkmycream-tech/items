    <ol>
            <li>I have used it on my nose and cheeks  during the day, and it works wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>This is the best lip balm I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Hands-down, the best.</li>
            <li>and I guess it fights frostbite, but it&#x27;s the best thing I know of to put on your face to prevent wind burn.</li>
            <li>Great product, excellent service</li>
            <li>really good stuff!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Seals in everything great.  </li>
            <li>Got this one time at a ski resort and worked great to prevent wind burn.</li>
            <li>Great container as well.</li>
            <li>so it really is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>To be honest, with just a bit of wind, I have welts on my face.  </li>
            <li>The product protects much better than the drug store stick stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love the metal tins and prefer it over their plastic push up style stick.  </li>
            <li>Great basic that is proven to work.</li>
            <li>And despite a full face mask I always leave the trails with some degree of wind burn.</li>
            <li>Product contents/chemistry will NOT eat up fly fishing lines or other plastics.</li>
            <li>I probably don&#x27;t need to mention that I have very sensitive skin :)  At the urging of my husband I searched for soemthing that might help.</li>
            <li>Worked great on our bike trip small and compact</li>
            <li>While not advertised as such, this product has helped me avoid frostbite on many occasions.  </li>
            <li>Package, being a tin, is easy to slip into a back pocket or shirt pocket.</li>
            <li>Best product money can buy for wind and cold protection.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I love to stay active, hiking and biking in the warmer months and skiing, snowshoeing and hiking in the winter.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff and it keeps my face warm on cold days  snow  days and windy days</li>
            <li>This product is worth the extra dollars</li>
            <li>It does not have any special flavor or gimmick, just protects from wind, sun and elements and prevents dry lips and skin.  </li>
            <li>Must have when you live in the mountains.</li>
            <li>My skin however has never adapted to my New England life.  </li>
            <li>we live in the arid desert and let me tell you, my skin and lips dry out quickly.....</li>
            <li>Product protects well, relatively long- lasting, and does not wash off from sweat easily.  </li>
            <li>I put this on my lips in the evening before bed, and I wake with soft hydrated lips!  </li>
            <li>Great for XC Skiing in high wind chill and any cold weather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because Dermatone is made for people who live, work, and exercise in extreme weather.</li>

            <li> It will last a long time, even with daily use</li>
            <li> this is clear where previously it was somewhat white, and not as effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time....</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I ever found that would help repair dried cracked hands due to frequent washing when I was working as a nurse.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that means I have to wear full face protection even in the milder winter temps.</li>
            <li> Unlike any other lip balm this stuff last and last in the little tin.</li>
            <li> Ski buddy pointing out the small sections on my face that I missed when applying were turning white in obvious streaks.  </li>
            <li> Too many Midwesterners who work and live in the constantly changing cold winter of the Midwest (windy, wet cold/windy, dry cold), don&#x27;t know about Dermatone.</li>
            <li> Product is First Rate but the packaging is flawed.</li>
            <li> The 25 gram container is about half an inch tall and 2 inches in diameter.  </li>
            <li> I live in the Wasatch Mountains and it can get dry, windy, and cold.</li>
            <li> Being a life long resident of New England, I have expreinced some cold and harsh weather.</li>
            <li> I typically use it for outdoor winter sports and activities but it works well year round.  </li>
            <li> It is a little greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to open the metal container, I need a knife or sharp object to pry it open every time.</li>
            <li> I would just apply it to my hands at night before retiring, and cover my hands with plain cheep cotton gloves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll mix in some plain zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Very seriously.  </li>
            <li> Greasy, and smells weird.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong,</li>
            <li> I tried Weleda \\&quot;Cold Cream\\&quot; with sucess but instead of wind burn</li>
            <li> It worked well on a very cold and windy winter hike and didnt irritate my skin in the least!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years and it works great. Unlike any other lip balm this stuff last and last in the little tin. It doesn&#x27;t melt or leak. I keep in my pocket and have never had a problem with melting. I live in the Wasatch Mountains and it can get dry, windy, and cold. I bought the big size by mistake and use the smaller size to carry with me. This product is worth the extra dollars</li>
            <li> Product protects well, relatively long- lasting, and does not wash off from sweat easily.  Package, being a tin, is easy to slip into a back pocket or shirt pocket. Product contents/chemistry will NOT eat up fly fishing lines or other plastics.</li>
            <li> Worked great on our bike trip small and compact</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I ever found that would help repair dried cracked hands due to frequent washing when I was working as a nurse. I would just apply it to my hands at night before retiring, and cover my hands with plain cheep cotton gloves. Great stuff. I now use it on my face to protect me from further sun damage after having to have some surgery for basal cell Ca..</li>
            <li> Use this daily OVER my Oil of Olay daily SPF moisturizer.  Seals in everything great.  I look much younger than my 61 years!</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent service</li>
            <li> I got this one by accident, hoping for a bigger jar of Z-cote.  This is very different.  Greasy, and smells weird. It does protect skin from the wind well.  I probably won&#x27;t finish the tin</li>
            <li> Must have when you live in the mountains. Great basic that is proven to work. Comes in several different sizes.</li>
            <li> Too many Midwesterners who work and live in the constantly changing cold winter of the Midwest (windy, wet cold/windy, dry cold), don&#x27;t know about Dermatone. It&#x27;s a shame because Dermatone is made for people who live, work, and exercise in extreme weather.</li>
            <li> really good stuff!  we live in the arid desert and let me tell you, my skin and lips dry out quickly.....I put this on my lips in the evening before bed, and I wake with soft hydrated lips!  I have used it on my nose and cheeks  during the day, and it works wonderfully!  It lasts a long time....something I will buy again and again when needed.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used.  Very seriously.  Hands-down, the best.</li>
            <li> Got this one time at a ski resort and worked great to prevent wind burn. Needed it at Spring Training in Arizona a couple of years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Found it on Amazon, and bought a couple to have on hand. Can&#x27;t go wrong, yes it has SPF and I guess it fights frostbite, but it&#x27;s the best thing I know of to put on your face to prevent wind burn.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Being a life long resident of New England, I have expreinced some cold and harsh weather. My skin however has never adapted to my New England life.  My husband and I love to stay active, hiking and biking in the warmer months and skiing, snowshoeing and hiking in the winter. Unfortunately that means I have to wear full face protection even in the milder winter temps. And despite a full face mask I always leave the trails with some degree of wind burn. To be honest, with just a bit of wind, I have welts on my face.  I probably don&#x27;t need to mention that I have very sensitive skin :)  At the urging of my husband I searched for soemthing that might help. I tried Weleda \\&quot;Cold Cream\\&quot; with sucess but instead of wind burn I had irritated skin.  Dermatone has been a life saver! It worked well on a very cold and windy winter hike and didnt irritate my skin in the least!! I can now expose my face to the harsher elements and not have windburn welts for days afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 20+ years.  Best product money can buy for wind and cold protection.  While not advertised as such, this product has helped me avoid frostbite on many occasions.  How do I know?  Ski buddy pointing out the small sections on my face that I missed when applying were turning white in obvious streaks.  Great container as well.</li>
            <li> Used this for my motorcycle trip.Stopped the wind burn.It is a little greasy feeling.I will be using this for every trip.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 20 years.  I typically use it for outdoor winter sports and activities but it works well year round.

            <li> I have been using what I thought was this product for some time.&lt;br /&gt;It is no longer sold where I got it before, so I ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;Not the same- this is clear where previously it was somewhat white, and not as effective.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll mix in some plain zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter.  Great for XC Skiing in high wind chill and any cold weather.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff and it keeps my face warm on cold days  snow  days and windy days dont go snow skiing without it</li>
