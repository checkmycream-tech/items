            <li>I love the packaging it looks</li>
            <li>I also love that it is  Safe To Use Everyday,and Helloooooo</li>
            <li>I love how refreshed your face feels.</li>
            <li>Most of the lines around my eyes and mouth are just about gone.</li>
            <li>My face  looks much better without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I so pleased.</li>
            <li>I must say that I pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feel on my face like most skin products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I can guarantee you I will be purchasing some more of this when I run out, this is a killer deal</li>
            <li>I love trying new products and specially serums with Vitamic C.This is an excellent price for Vitamin C Serum-</li>
            <li>This is a great natural serum!!!</li>
            <li>I am lucky to be able to try this anti aging serum in a discount price for my honest review.</li>
            <li>First I must say that it smells so good</li>
            <li>This serum smells nice - very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>leaves your skin fresh, and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li>Most people&#x27;s reviews indicate that they enjoy the scent of this product and that it is non greasy.  </li>
            <li>honestly the first morning I woke up after using it</li>
            <li>I think it is fine to put on alone.</li>
            <li>I have noticed fine lines around my eyes, forehead and mouth.</li>
            <li>By building up the collagen in your skin, the fine lines/wrinkles are suppose to lessen.  </li>
            <li>Over some time, I think it&#x27;s helping to smooth out my complexion as well.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Apart from that, it contains the hyaluronic acid which helps to draw moisture to my skin and protect from harsh effect in environmnet, for a superb moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li>That is really important to me .</li>
            <li>It works very well with a perfectly selected toner for your specific skin type, and it will keep you looking great even as you start to get into middle age.</li>
            <li>I found this Vitamin C serum which I&#x27;ve been using with my anti-aging cream and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and no irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that the online photos indicate it&#x27;s paraben free</li>
            <li>the good thing about it is that it gets the job done .It gets absorbed really fast .Definitely recommend it to all women.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with my results from using the vitamin C cream on my skin so far, and I&#x27;m encouraged to see more of those lines going away and my skin looking much brighter from using it.</li>
            <li>but This is on the top of my list right now.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it has 20% vit C and hyaluronic acid serum in one blend, it is what makes this product unique.</li>
            <li>What I love most about this product is it being natural.</li>
            <li>serum smells good, goes on smoothly, and actually works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regular use of this product will keep your skin free from pimples, and it also will keep it softer and more radiant looking, you really will not believe the difference in this product until you see it for yourself.</li>
            <li>but soon as i stumbled upon this product it helped me get rid of them in no time, such a great product for amazing price total recommend.</li>
            <li>Most serums smell like chemicals, but this was was much fresher.</li>
            <li>but maybe any good moisturizer would do the same.</li>
            <li>I am a true believer in the serum</li>
            <li>And I really like the pump at the top.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly around my eyes any my mouth, where I am getting the most lines.</li>
            <li>It obsorbs quickly and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C Serum is similar to a product I bought overseas from Japan that cost, way, way more money than this Vitamin C Serum did, and the stuff from Epique Beauty does a lot better job.</li>
            <li>There is no odor and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the combination of vitamin C serum and moisturizer has made a difference with my mild rosacea.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this serum, I really need to get rid my wrinkles and fine lines, hope this product will do well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The folks at Epique Beauty (via Profesional Biz) were nice enough to provide me with this product at a discount so that I could evaluate it.  </li>
            <li>I hope the personal thoughts I share will help you prepare for your own experience with this product.</li>
            <li>and I still get carded, so I must be doing something right.</li>
            <li>It is hard to evaluate your own skin, I think, but it does seem better and I do get compliments on my complexion at age 75.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It seemed that so many products were available that had a ton of other ingredients.</li>
            <li>The fine lines that had started to form on my forehead are now almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use just a little bit of product - I try to use products sparingly because my face tends to get greasy throughout the day, so the pump really helps me to make sure that I don&#x27;t put too much product on my face.</li>
            <li>It contains vitamin C 20% and is a great alternative to oranges, etc... for those with acid reflux having a hard time consuming the things required to absorb vitamin C nutrients.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit that i think that this one even works a little bit better than my old kind.</li>
            <li>My skin is really appreciating this treatment!</li>
            <li>It also works really well with my derma roller!</li>
            <li>But this exact brand i just started using .</li>
            <li>The entire process was overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable recommending this product since it seems it works well and that the ingredients list is quite natural.</li>
            <li>and one of my other favorite things about this brand !&lt;br /</li>
            <li>has a nice light scent and  really slick texture .  </li>
            <li>This is my very first time using a Vitamin C serum for my fine lines I have noticed over the last year.</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin makes it very hard for me to find the perfect skin product.</li>
            <li>The others smelled funny and really did nothing even after using it for a month straight.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>If anyone is interested in trying vitamin C serum, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, but the ones I have seem to smooth out a bit when I use Vitamin C Serum regularly.</li>
            <li>They take fast effect after used for 14 days in a row, twice a day.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>it does ok but not as expected</li>
            <li>I noticed my face in the mirror one day and it looked so much duller than it used to.</li>
            <li>and I have really noticed drastic improvements in my complexion and the smoothness in the skin.</li>
            <li>I love how this doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy like some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have had absolutely no bad reactions to the serum and have only seen results.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but the product absorbs really well and helps me stay fresh and clean-feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;5/5 Highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>High end</li>
            <li>I think this serum will help me keep the wrinkles at bay for a little while longer :)</li>
            <li>Product was soft and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I tried it years ago and it has really worked well for me so far.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and will not effect sensitive skin ( like mine)</li>
            <li>I just tried this serum for a week, I really like the smell and its texture, it feels soft on my face.</li>
            <li>I noticed the effect on my face after 6 weeks about my face was moturize and looks younger and fresh.</li>
            <li>and I also use a toner to help remove any left over face wash, I make sure that my face is completely dry before I apply my Vitamin C Serum in the morning an evening before i hit the bed.</li>
            <li>I was in search for a cream or serum that would help erase the lines, prevent new ones and not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you Professional Biz for your Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li>For anyone looking for a new product that works and is natural, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels ok going on but flakes off a little later.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using this serum the skin around my eyes has tightened and is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>They are natural item, thus you dont need to worry anything about their side-effects.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s makes my skin appear soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Within in the first week my face felt smoother and slightly more clear, after 30 days of use my discoloration in my skin has drastically decreased!</li>
            <li>My skin looks better and a small pigmented spot on my upper lip seems lighter.</li>
            <li>I finally found an anti-aging night cream which I absolutely love, but I thought what product can&#x27;t benefit from a little extra help?</li>
            <li>I usually have an issue with oily serums because they clog my pores and make my skin feel heavy and gross, but this was nice!</li>
            <li>And while I certainly don&#x27;t look 20, I definitely am looking much younger these days.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found a good product that really works and the price wasn&#x27;t outrageous like other products.</li>
            <li>I like putting it on after removing makeup for a clear refreshed feeling and controlling of my larger pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they really were making me look aged.</li>
            <li>I’m in my early 30’s and now starting to take charge of my skin care.</li>
            <li>The deeper lines are lighter and the light small lines are gone!</li>
            <li>I particularly like that this serum isn&#x27;t greasy like some other serums tend to be.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Most people&#x27;s reviews indicate that they enjoy the scent of this product and that it is non greasy.  </li>
            <li> honestly the first morning I woke up after using it</li>
            <li> I think it is fine to put on alone.</li>
            <li> I have noticed fine lines around my eyes, forehead and mouth.</li>
            <li> By building up the collagen in your skin, the fine lines/wrinkles are suppose to lessen.  </li>
            <li> Over some time, I think it&#x27;s helping to smooth out my complexion as well.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Apart from that, it contains the hyaluronic acid which helps to draw moisture to my skin and protect from harsh effect in environmnet, for a superb moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> That is really important to me .</li>
            <li> It works very well with a perfectly selected toner for your specific skin type, and it will keep you looking great even as you start to get into middle age.</li>
            <li> I found this Vitamin C serum which I&#x27;ve been using with my anti-aging cream and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and no irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that the online photos indicate it&#x27;s paraben free</li>
            <li> the good thing about it is that it gets the job done .It gets absorbed really fast .Definitely recommend it to all women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with my results from using the vitamin C cream on my skin so far, and I&#x27;m encouraged to see more of those lines going away and my skin looking much brighter from using it.</li>
            <li> but This is on the top of my list right now.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it has 20% vit C and hyaluronic acid serum in one blend, it is what makes this product unique.</li>
            <li> What I love most about this product is it being natural.</li>
            <li> serum smells good, goes on smoothly, and actually works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regular use of this product will keep your skin free from pimples, and it also will keep it softer and more radiant looking, you really will not believe the difference in this product until you see it for yourself.</li>
            <li> but soon as i stumbled upon this product it helped me get rid of them in no time, such a great product for amazing price total recommend.</li>
            <li> Most serums smell like chemicals, but this was was much fresher.</li>
            <li> but maybe any good moisturizer would do the same.</li>
            <li> I am a true believer in the serum</li>
            <li> And I really like the pump at the top.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly around my eyes any my mouth, where I am getting the most lines.</li>
            <li> It obsorbs quickly and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is similar to a product I bought overseas from Japan that cost, way, way more money than this Vitamin C Serum did, and the stuff from Epique Beauty does a lot better job.</li>
            <li> There is no odor and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the combination of vitamin C serum and moisturizer has made a difference with my mild rosacea.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this serum, I really need to get rid my wrinkles and fine lines, hope this product will do well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The folks at Epique Beauty (via Profesional Biz) were nice enough to provide me with this product at a discount so that I could evaluate it.  </li>
            <li> I hope the personal thoughts I share will help you prepare for your own experience with this product.</li>
            <li> and I still get carded, so I must be doing something right.</li>
            <li> It is hard to evaluate your own skin, I think, but it does seem better and I do get compliments on my complexion at age 75.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It seemed that so many products were available that had a ton of other ingredients.</li>
            <li> The fine lines that had started to form on my forehead are now almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use just a little bit of product - I try to use products sparingly because my face tends to get greasy throughout the day, so the pump really helps me to make sure that I don&#x27;t put too much product on my face.</li>
            <li> It contains vitamin C 20% and is a great alternative to oranges, etc... for those with acid reflux having a hard time consuming the things required to absorb vitamin C nutrients.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that i think that this one even works a little bit better than my old kind.</li>
            <li> My skin is really appreciating this treatment!</li>
            <li> It also works really well with my derma roller!</li>
            <li> But this exact brand i just started using .</li>
            <li> The entire process was overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable recommending this product since it seems it works well and that the ingredients list is quite natural.</li>
            <li> and one of my other favorite things about this brand !&lt;br /</li>
            <li> has a nice light scent and  really slick texture .  </li>
            <li> This is my very first time using a Vitamin C serum for my fine lines I have noticed over the last year.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin makes it very hard for me to find the perfect skin product.</li>
            <li> The others smelled funny and really did nothing even after using it for a month straight.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> If anyone is interested in trying vitamin C serum, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, but the ones I have seem to smooth out a bit when I use Vitamin C Serum regularly.</li>
            <li> They take fast effect after used for 14 days in a row, twice a day.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> it does ok but not as expected</li>
            <li> I noticed my face in the mirror one day and it looked so much duller than it used to.</li>
            <li> and I have really noticed drastic improvements in my complexion and the smoothness in the skin.</li>
            <li> I love how this doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy like some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have had absolutely no bad reactions to the serum and have only seen results.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the product absorbs really well and helps me stay fresh and clean-feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;5/5 Highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> High end</li>
            <li> I think this serum will help me keep the wrinkles at bay for a little while longer :)</li>
            <li> Product was soft and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it years ago and it has really worked well for me so far.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and will not effect sensitive skin ( like mine)</li>
            <li> I just tried this serum for a week, I really like the smell and its texture, it feels soft on my face.</li>
            <li> I noticed the effect on my face after 6 weeks about my face was moturize and looks younger and fresh.</li>
            <li> and I also use a toner to help remove any left over face wash, I make sure that my face is completely dry before I apply my Vitamin C Serum in the morning an evening before i hit the bed.</li>
            <li> I was in search for a cream or serum that would help erase the lines, prevent new ones and not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you Professional Biz for your Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li> For anyone looking for a new product that works and is natural, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels ok going on but flakes off a little later.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this serum the skin around my eyes has tightened and is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> They are natural item, thus you dont need to worry anything about their side-effects.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s makes my skin appear soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Within in the first week my face felt smoother and slightly more clear, after 30 days of use my discoloration in my skin has drastically decreased!</li>
            <li> My skin looks better and a small pigmented spot on my upper lip seems lighter.</li>
            <li> I finally found an anti-aging night cream which I absolutely love, but I thought what product can&#x27;t benefit from a little extra help?</li>
            <li> I usually have an issue with oily serums because they clog my pores and make my skin feel heavy and gross, but this was nice!</li>
            <li> And while I certainly don&#x27;t look 20, I definitely am looking much younger these days.</li>
            <li> I am glad I found a good product that really works and the price wasn&#x27;t outrageous like other products.</li>
            <li> I like putting it on after removing makeup for a clear refreshed feeling and controlling of my larger pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they really were making me look aged.</li>
            <li> I’m in my early 30’s and now starting to take charge of my skin care.</li>
            <li> The deeper lines are lighter and the light small lines are gone!</li>
            <li> I particularly like that this serum isn&#x27;t greasy like some other serums tend to be.</li>
            <li> I have not used this serum long, but i like what i am seeing.</li>
            <li> It is well facial serum to fight with aged skin and prevent wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have had lines and wrinkles around my eyes for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have a break out, this seems to help it heal more quickly and less painfully, and minimizes the scarring that I usually get from every single pimple, scratch or anything that happens to my skin.</li>
            <li> I switched because my old brand does not sell on the market no more.</li>
            <li> I recently played a game with my girl friends where we tried to guess each others&#x27; ages and everyone was sooo far off on my age!</li>
            <li> It has only been a few days since I started using this product</li>
            <li> Due to stressful life i was getting some wrinkles around eyes.</li>
            <li> I have other Items of theirs</li>
            <li> I tried two other products with no success before this one.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, always hated all the wrinkles i have</li>
            <li> It has a little tackiness to it</li>
            <li> I have noticed the serum working within a few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I am not able to apply it before/under my makeup in the morning because off the flaking.</li>
            <li> Not sure it makes any difference</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and makes my skin healthier!</li>
            <li> My skin is very firm</li>
            <li> After trying other anti aging creams, moisturizers, serums, etc I was skeptical about trying another product that just did not work and afraid it would just turn out to be another waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am a skeptical person and doubt on the product usually.</li>
            <li> But I was so wrong!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, but the ones I have seem to smooth out a bit when I use Vitamin C Serum regularly. The skin seems to look more moisturized, and stay that way. Over some time, I think it&#x27;s helping to smooth out my complexion as well.&lt;br /&gt;When I have a break out, this seems to help it heal more quickly and less painfully, and minimizes the scarring that I usually get from every single pimple, scratch or anything that happens to my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, always hated all the wrinkles i have but soon as i stumbled upon this product it helped me get rid of them in no time, such a great product for amazing price total recommend.</li>
            <li> An exceptional cream . My gf has been using it for over a month now  and she is very satisfied . Her skin is brighter and more hydrated and all visible wrinkles are almost gone . It also smells beautiful .And the good thing about it is that it gets the job done .It gets absorbed really fast .Definitely recommend it to all women.</li>
            <li> I try different facial products every night. But this one shows a remarkable improvement over the others I have used.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your skin fresh, and smelling amazing. Couldn&#x27;t recommend this product more. For anyone looking for a new product that works and is natural, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 Highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a week now, this is a good product, and I like it because It has vitamin c and hyaluronic acid in one bottle. Price is fair too. I will continue to use this serum and hope to see a good result soon.</li>
            <li> The vitamin product works excellent for me. I am a skeptical person and doubt on the product usually. However, my mother encourage me to try this because it works for them especially to moturize their face and became radiant. They take fast effect after used for 14 days in a row, twice a day. I noticed the effect on my face after 6 weeks about my face was moturize and looks younger and fresh. Thanks for the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I think this serum is great! I use it mainly around my eyes any my mouth, where I am getting the most lines. I have been using it several weeks now, and I am really impressed with the results. My skin is just looking healthier. I recently played a game with my girl friends where we tried to guess each others&#x27; ages and everyone was sooo far off on my age! No one ever believes that I am a Mom of 3! :)&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> I have not used this serum long, but i like what i am seeing. It is not sticky. It obsorbs quickly and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS! I use this all the time and have seen remarkable results! It smells great, and I have noticed the smile lines and forehead lines start to deminish in appearance. My skin is really appreciating this treatment! Its not oily nor leave a hint of residue on my face, and I am seeing results!! It also works really well with my derma roller! Helps soothe my skin after rolling. I just love this product and am so happy to have gotten it on a promotional discount.Thank you Professional Biz for your Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li> Product was soft and gentle on my skin. It has a little tackiness to it but it does go away. It made my skin feel very soft and smooth. I loved it on my legs as well as my elbows what a great feeling. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I usually have an issue with oily serums because they clog my pores and make my skin feel heavy and gross, but this was nice! It soaked in nicely and didn&#x27;t feel oily. It was nice and light and smelled nice too. Most serums smell like chemicals, but this was was much fresher. This company knows what&#x27;s up with skincare!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently tried this product for my face. I was a bit concerned with myself. But after trying this product I was very pleased. Everything just looks perfect and how it should be. What I love most about this product is it being natural. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is well facial serum to fight with aged skin and prevent wrinkles. Apart from that, it contains the hyaluronic acid which helps to draw moisture to my skin and protect from harsh effect in environmnet, for a superb moisturizing effect. My skin promoted to be more radient and healthier after used in a span of 21 days.</li>
            <li> it does ok but not as expected</li>
            <li> It feels ok going on but flakes off a little later. I am not able to apply it before/under my makeup in the morning because off the flaking. I think it is fine to put on alone. Just don&#x27;t wear anything over it.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth texture serum, feels good and is easy to use-not &amp;#34;drippy&amp;#34;.  I think it helps when used with a hyaluronic moisturizer.  My skin looks better and a small pigmented spot on my upper lip seems lighter. It is hard to evaluate your own skin, I think, but it does seem better and I do get compliments on my complexion at age 75.  I must say I have always had good skin but lately more wrinkles are appearing. This regime as recommended by &amp;#34;Dr. Oz&amp;#34;, (whom I think is a commercial shill), does not remove wrinkles but it does seem to soften them...but maybe any good moisturizer would do the same. Use what works for you.</li>
            <li> Due to stressful life i was getting some wrinkles around eyes. Yes there were 3 to 4 lines at the end of the both eyes and they really were making me look aged. If you are facing too same problem, then you should atleast try this. They are natural item, thus you dont need to worry anything about their side-effects.</li>
            <li> Not sure it makes any difference</li>
            <li> This is a great natural serum!!! I am a true believer in the serum and i have been using this kind of serum for about two years now. But this exact brand i just started using . I switched because my old brand does not sell on the market no more. I found a great substitute! I have to admit that i think that this one even works a little bit better than my old kind. It&#x27;s just perfect for my skin type and it always lubricates the skin tissue so well, that there is no need of additional creams, serums, etc...My skin is very firm and i have gotten lots of compliments since i have started using this serum. I am sold, i will keep using it, it is a must have for me...</li>
            <li> I’m in my early 30’s and now starting to take charge of my skin care. I noticed my face in the mirror one day and it looked so much duller than it used to. I have a stressful job and no time for spa days so decided to look into what I could do at home to improve the appearance and health of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about the benefits of vitamin c but was unsure about how to get it on my skin in a way that would be helpful. It seemed that so many products were available that had a ton of other ingredients. The entire process was overwhelming. I tried two other products with no success before this one. The others smelled funny and really did nothing even after using it for a month straight.&lt;br /&gt;This serum smells good, goes on smoothly, and actually works. After two weeks of use I could tell a difference but honestly the first morning I woke up after using it my skin felt smoother. I’ll never switch!</li>
            <li> I love trying new products and specially serums with Vitamic C.This is an excellent price for Vitamin C Serum- great price and good quantity.  I started using this Vitamin C Serum several months ago and I have really noticed drastic improvements in my complexion and the smoothness in the skin. Within in the first week my face felt smoother and slightly more clear, after 30 days of use my discoloration in my skin has drastically decreased! My skin care regimen is I wash my face 2 times a day  and use a standard face wash and I also use a toner to help remove any left over face wash, I make sure that my face is completely dry before I apply my Vitamin C Serum in the morning an evening before i hit the bed.Would totally recommend t.</li>
            <li> I love using vitamin C on my skin. I tried it years ago and it has really worked well for me so far. The fine lines that had started to form on my forehead are now almost completely gone. I love how this doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy like some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried. The cream feels quite luxurious despite not being greasy and seems to be good quality. I&#x27;m really happy with my results from using the vitamin C cream on my skin so far, and I&#x27;m encouraged to see more of those lines going away and my skin looking much brighter from using it. I feel comfortable recommending this product since it seems it works well and that the ingredients list is quite natural.</li>
            <li> One of the best Vitamin C Serum ever!!! It makes my face so refreshing and makes my skin feel hydrated. I use this product everyday and makes my skin healthier! If you want to have a healthier and moisturized skin than I recommend you get this amazing product now!</li>
            <li> I love this Brand . I have other Items of theirs so when I received a chance to review this Vitamine C serum I was really happy and jumped at the chance !! I love the packaging it looks High end This is a container I wouldn&#x27;t mind leaving out on my counter !  I also love that it is  Safe To Use Everyday,and Helloooooo its  Paraben Free !!!! That is really important to me . and one of my other favorite things about this brand !&lt;br /&gt;  •Made in the USA and Manufactured in our FDA Approved And GMP Certified Laboratory&lt;br /&gt;  and they offer an awesome  100% Satisfaction Guarantee !!!!&lt;br /&gt;  and now for the product it self well lets just say I am 100% satisfied !! lol  n my opinion I think it works well with the Derma Roller&lt;br /&gt;.it has a nice light scent and  really slick texture .  My skin Never looked better !</li>
            <li> After trying other anti aging creams, moisturizers, serums, etc I was skeptical about trying another product that just did not work and afraid it would just turn out to be another waste of money. But I was so wrong! The Vitamin C Serum for Anti Aging is different than any product I have ever used and that is a lot of products. I have had lines and wrinkles around my eyes for a long time. I used to photoshop them out of pictures before I shared them but I do not have to do that anymore. After a few weeks of using this serum the skin around my eyes has tightened and is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is similar to a product I bought overseas from Japan that cost, way, way more money than this Vitamin C Serum did, and the stuff from Epique Beauty does a lot better job. I love how refreshed your face feels. I like putting it on after removing makeup for a clear refreshed feeling and controlling of my larger pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular use of this product will keep your skin free from pimples, and it also will keep it softer and more radiant looking, you really will not believe the difference in this product until you see it for yourself. It works very well with a perfectly selected toner for your specific skin type, and it will keep you looking great even as you start to get into middle age.</li>
            <li> I finally found an anti-aging night cream which I absolutely love, but I thought what product can&#x27;t benefit from a little extra help? I found this Vitamin C serum which I&#x27;ve been using with my anti-aging cream and the results are fantastic. Most of the lines around my eyes and mouth are just about gone. And while I certainly don&#x27;t look 20, I definitely am looking much younger these days. I have had absolutely no bad reactions to the serum and have only seen results. Give your anti-aging regiment a boost with this vitamin c serum and see the difference!</li>
            <li> I have been using vitamin C serum twice daily for months now. Épique Vitamin c serum is a winner. There is no odor and it absorbs quickly. I put on a moisturizer afterwards and I am good to go. I have noticed that the combination of vitamin C serum and moisturizer has made a difference with my mild rosacea. My rosacea has not disappeared, however my face does not proceed to get redder throughout the day. My face  looks much better without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to test to try this product and I am so happy to have it. This vitamin C serum is a welcome addition to my medicine cabinet. If anyone is interested in trying vitamin C serum, I highly recommend this product. It is gentle and will not effect sensitive skin ( like mine)</li>
            <li> I will not buy this product again. I do not like it when it dries on your face it is flaky it makes your face look like it is peeling. I do not like it at all.</li>
            <li> This serum smells nice - very clean and fresh. And I really like the pump at the top. It&#x27;s very easy to use just a little bit of product - I try to use products sparingly because my face tends to get greasy throughout the day, so the pump really helps me to make sure that I don&#x27;t put too much product on my face. Not only that, but the product absorbs really well and helps me stay fresh and clean-feeling. I particularly like that this serum isn&#x27;t greasy like some other serums tend to be. I&#x27;m not quite 40 and I still get carded, so I must be doing something right. I think this serum will help me keep the wrinkles at bay for a little while longer :)</li>
            <li> I was given a coupon for this product to test and try it out for my honest and unbiased opinion and I so pleased. This is my very first time using a Vitamin C serum for my fine lines I have noticed over the last year. I must say that I pleased with the outcome. First I must say that it smells so good and it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feel on my face like most skin products I have tried. It has only been a few days since I started using this product but I can already notice the crows feet disappearing from around my eyes. I was really amazed because a lot products state claims and don&#x27;t work at all and are a waste of money. I am glad I found a good product that really works and the price wasn&#x27;t outrageous like other products. If your like me and want to try and preserve your youthful looking face, this product does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> I am lucky to be able to try this anti aging serum in a discount price for my honest review. I just tried this serum for a week, I really like the smell and its texture, it feels soft on my face. The fact that it has 20% vit C and hyaluronic acid serum in one blend, it is what makes this product unique. I will continue using this serum, I really need to get rid my wrinkles and fine lines, hope this product will do well.</li>
            <li> I like this serum! It&#x27;s makes my skin appear soft and supple.  There are a couple of serums I rotate between but This is on the top of my list right now.  I have a serum that I ordered from qvc that I swear by ( it&#x27;s thier best seller ) but this tops that.  This serum makes my skin look cleaner too, happy I purchased it!</li>
            <li> This is the best anti aging serum I own! I am in love with this product! It made my wrinkles and crow feet disappear to the eye. I love this stuff! I can guarantee you I will be purchasing some more of this when I run out, this is a killer deal and I think all of you should buy this! Vouch for this person and this product, I&#x27;m not kidding when I say best product I&#x27;ve ever had! Buy buy buy!</li>
            <li> I have noticed fine lines around my eyes, forehead and mouth. I was in search for a cream or serum that would help erase the lines, prevent new ones and not irritate my skin. Having sensitive skin makes it very hard for me to find the perfect skin product. This epique vitamin c serum was my answer the end of my search. I have noticed the serum working within a few weeks of using it. The deeper lines are lighter and the light small lines are gone! My skin is smooth and no irritation.</li>
            <li> This is made in the USA and is also manufactured in a FDA approved and GMP certified laboratory.  It contains vitamin C 20% and is a great alternative to oranges, etc... for those with acid reflux having a hard time consuming the things required to absorb vitamin C nutrients.  This product also contains Hyaluronic Acid Serum which will help draw moisture from the environment, resulting in a moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the online photos indicate it&#x27;s paraben free and I did not find any obvious paraben ingredients listed on the bottle.  By building up the collagen in your skin, the fine lines/wrinkles are suppose to lessen.  Most people&#x27;s reviews indicate that they enjoy the scent of this product and that it is non greasy.  Try it to see for yourself if you agree with the majority or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The folks at Epique Beauty (via Profesional Biz) were nice enough to provide me with this product at a discount so that I could evaluate it.  I agreed to provide some honest feedback when posting my review.  I hope the personal thoughts I share will help you prepare for your own experience with this product.</li>
