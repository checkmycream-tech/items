            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Great nothing like it soak your self</li>
            <li>My wife uses this mitten, she says it is great.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This Chaacoca mitt has great scrubbing power, but like I said, if you&#x27;ve used any of those Salux-type cloths, your life will remain unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>things: the square shape isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>they are durable and do a great job to exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for exfoliating, though</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the rolls of skin some reviews talked about but after using my skin did feel softer and I am quite happy with this product.</li>
            <li>then I found this one and read all the great reviews</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>works great to use before using a sunless tanning lotion,</li>
            <li>Not that great.</li>
            <li>This product is great it lasts for a couple months</li>
            <li>- you&#x27;ll be happy you did.  </li>
            <li>AND TAN LOOKS AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I went to a Turkish bath in Tunisia and had the BEST exfoliation treatment with their magical glove....</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;roughness&amp;#34; of the Chaacoca Moroccan Exfoliating Mitt material is perfect; it exfoliates the skin leaving it with a glow and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;roughest&amp;#34; and best for exfoliating of many I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>this is an excellent product i will order more just in case they run out again</li>
            <li>Follow it and you&#x27;ll should have remarkable</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the dye was very strong and it was like rinsing out hair dye in my shower!</li>
            <li>I bought it because it had good reviews</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good product to accompany me in my weight loss when skin tightening is a concern.</li>
            <li>loved this purchase.</li>
            <li>This thing feels like a brillo pad- which in the world of exfoliating is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I think it was good for about 10 scrubs</li>
            <li>It means you were doing a good job even before.</li>
            <li>It means you were doing a good job even before.</li>
            <li>Great product, I love it.</li>
            <li>It fits perfect and I am 5&#x27;10 with very large hands for a women.</li>
            <li>and i wouldnt do it more than once a week!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mitt!</li>
            <li>I love it~!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This mitt is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I liked how well it exfoliated, but then a hole ripped in it after the 4th use.</li>
            <li>Split at the seams the first month use, besides that it is ok, happy easter everyone and have a great day</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product after all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to do much because I&#x27;m very good about exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It works best if you let your bathroom get super steamy, lather soap first and rub it on your body BEFORE using the mitt.</li>
            <li>you are mostly interested in the texture of this mitt for skin sloughing/polishing, then you might be happy with this (as plenty of reviewers seem to be).</li>
            <li>mom is able to clean them up good with this mitten.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made MIT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckly I got this mitt when it was priced very cheap to try.</li>
            <li>The glove on its own is fine and it exfoliates</li>
            <li>Be sure you are good and steamed up, wash your skin first, rinse then rub in a circular motion..now look at the mitt!</li>
            <li>now I found one to have for myself here at home  :))))</li>
            <li>Just wish the ribbon to hang it was more durable; it&#x27;s already ripping off.</li>
            <li>perhaps a slimmer version might be better (for me).</li>
            <li>and the result is amazing smooth skin and save a lot on body wash</li>
            <li>if you like the top layer of your skin to come off then this is for you.</li>
            <li>just make sure to soak in a tub or stay in a steamy shower for 10 min before using it.</li>
            <li>Works ok ..</li>
            <li>Love the texture and the usage.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve used the Korean Salux-like body scrub towel (made of nylon), this bath mitt is not that impressive, especially for the cost.  </li>
            <li>I love this mitt.</li>
            <li>I got better results from using exfoliating mitts that I bought at the 99 cent store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, let your jaw hit the floor-because it will.</li>
            <li>Given the price, I was expecting a much better product.</li>
            <li>I love the mitt for my skin</li>
            <li>Sure, I know what you&#x27;re thinking...</li>
            <li>I love this exfoliating mitt for the shower, bath.</li>
            <li>yet your skin emerges glowing, and so smooth!  </li>
            <li>I love using this mitt.  </li>
            <li>It is astonishing how well this mitt exfoliates.</li>
            <li>Totally happy with this much cheaper replacement.</li>
            <li>I love these Hammam gloves--</li>
            <li>okay, 46...</li>
            <li>This means a bit more maintenance but also making smarter choices on how the skin is treated.</li>
            <li>travels took me to Turkey where I experienced real Turkish baths.</li>
            <li>but they said it was okay.</li>
            <li>It scrubs ok.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>Just in time for Summer when I need it more.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll keep better track of its whereabouts while on vacation since i go nowhere without my loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a pretty good history of using loofas and sugar scrubs</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good mitt.</li>
            <li>It was awesome, yes, but it&#x27;s also a bit strange for a westerner.</li>
            <li>I loved this mitt, it certainly did what I wanted</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>After checking out the other reviews...the Chaacoca Moroccan Exfoliating Mitt is the best.</li>
            <li>Hands down best ever.</li>
            <li>I use it with black soap and it is the best!</li>
            <li>Works fine to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I thought I was sooo smooth.</li>
            <li>Made my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>MY SKIN LOOKED AND FELT SOOO SMOOTH AND GLOWING AFTER USING THIS.</li>
            <li>and they just fit.</li>
            <li>I only use it once a week because it is very effective at doing its job.</li>
            <li>The feeling is nice, like a massage, and like you&#x27;re really getting clean.</li>
            <li>It works great, it just needs to be made a little more securely.</li>
            <li>Most of the loofah mitts out there are very wimpy and/or fall apart easily.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so fresh!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t throw this in with my laundry first.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions on the clove and love how I felt after my first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure it&#x27;s accurate and may very well be disproved scientifically</li>
            <li>I loved how well this mitt exfoliated my skin, however, the elastic cuff began to tear away from the mitt after only one use.</li>
            <li>but overall its a good tool to use in the bath or shower.</li>
            <li>Also the material isn&#x27;t as good as the last mitt I bought ( diff brand )</li>
            <li>I was worried this would hurt, but it actually feels good.  </li>
            <li>It needs things but it starts to need different things as it ages in order to look good and keep that glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure how much the mitt would work.</li>
            <li>Great when you use fake tans, it works great , I love it, gonna buy another one once this one gets old.</li>
            <li>and I think does a good job, but this mitt does a little better.  </li>
            <li>I am happy the real gloves are back</li>
            <li>In all you get a clean sexy soft skin feeling after you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li>This is a great exfoliator when used with some black soap.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it because I&#x27;ve heard they use similar gloves in South Korean bath houses that are super effective.</li>
            <li>I use a fine exfoliating cream that I really like</li>
            <li>and my skin feels great, but my bathwater is a little murky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic, 5 start absolutely</li>
            <li>Our weather is very humid and after using the mitt my skin feels smooth and the sticky feeling is gone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great mitt, but within a few days it started falling apart.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Not at all worth it.  </li>
            <li>This really irritates my skin, and doesn&#x27;t seem to exfoliate, so much as rip the top the layer of my skin.</li>
            <li>Not close to worth the price they sell it for.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li>This mitt has a rough texture, which is good for scrubbing, but not keeping the soap foamy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>$20 for a one time use mitt isn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Very nice, removes all dead skin without being too abrasive.</li>
            <li>To keep it clean, I wash it in my washing machine in a mesh bag and with a free and clear detergent.</li>
            <li>Fell apart right away.</li>
            <li>I really like the clean feeling after using the mitt.  </li>
            <li>The perfect &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; for sponging with the Moroccan Black Soap, which I&#x27;ve recently discovered.  </li>
            <li>I used it with regular soap, and loved how soft it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Works well, the glove fits my hand just right and it leaves my skin silky soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The rest of my body is smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>it is an award winning Japanese nylon scrubbing towel.  </li>
            <li>I read several reviews that said you should use a product like this to get a better faux tan.</li>
            <li>so i can scrub more of my back.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>My skin was rendered smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1.) Shower for 15 minutes in hot water&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s deceiving just how effective it is, you won&#x27;t feel too roughly scrubbed,</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the Chinese vegetable brushes that I used to be able to get.</li>
            <li>At first I freaked</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use it in the shower to know it will do exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at the amount of dead skin that was in the glove after my first use.</li>
            <li>you try to use this mitt with a soap that contains a natural moisturizer like cocoa butter, the moisturizer clogs up the pores of this mitt, thereby significantly reducing the scrubbing power.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and you should definitely give it a try if you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliator that will really get the job done.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this mitt was a little ruff, but after seeing and feeling the results I love it!</li>
            <li>right now I only use it on my legs before shaving to avoid ingrown hair, or on my feet to keep them smooth and sandal-ready.</li>
            <li>Excited to see how my skin creams work better now that they don&#x27;t have a layer of dead skin to soak through.</li>
            <li>I would like to think that maybe the first time, I had a rash because I had so much skin that needed to be sloughed off?</li>
            <li>B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil ® 100 Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert -1oz(30ml)]] to add more glow and give the skin something good to drink in.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised at how quickly this fell apart.</li>
            <li>If the Salux tears, it&#x27;s easy and inexpensive enough to replace.</li>
            <li>Kicks butt at exfoliating and leaving skin super soft.</li>
            <li>The stitching unraveled and there is a large hole in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but does exfoliate nicely.  </li>
            <li>I lived in Morrocco for seven years ,,, so I was so happy to see this natural products in Amazon ,,,and especially the Morrocan black soap ,,,useing natural sources for beauty skin is important</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know I had that much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The material works really well.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>i cant see much difference after using it...</li>
            <li>I found something very close to this mitt-</li>
            <li>You can use this on your face but only with a LIGHT touch</li>
            <li>When I started using it, the colour ran so much that it stained my wash clothes.</li>
            <li>You can find them at Asian grocery stores and even at Home Goods/TJMaxx/Ross for cheap.  </li>
            <li>This is a must for anyone and everyone in my opinion because we get exposed to so much in the air</li>
            <li>But absolutely NOTHING came off.  </li>
            <li>It almost doesn&#x27;t seem like it should do much exfoliating, but it does.  </li>
            <li>I like this mit to use at home, but I don&#x27;t feel like it really exfoliates the way it should.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, but it falls apart really well too.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this on my face but it works really well on my body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Caveat: If you are a good exfoliator of your skin, then you might not have the same crazy shedding others report, but that is good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to happen.re a good exfoliator of your skin, then you might not have the same crazy shedding others report, but that is good.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably not recommended, but it seemed like a good way to clean off dead skin cells and other microbial shower grossness and the mitt has held up well.</li>
            <li>After using this and sloughing off all that dead skin I felt amazing, and I love that I can have that experience every week for less than 10 dollars.  </li>
            <li>I put a nice all natural lotion all over my skin, let it soak in really well and soften up all the dead cells, then use this in the shower.</li>
            <li>I had this exfoliation thing down, how much better could this mitt be than what I was already doing?&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>After using this mitt lightly on my face, however, my skin would glow and I never got the dry patches.  </li>
            <li>Either way, I pair it with morracan black soap and love it.</li>
            <li>It works decent as a scrub</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t go for the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>I went to more of them but never had that same level of exfoliation because it was just maintaining it rather than starting from scratch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have never had an exfoliator be able to rub away absolutely ALL of the dead skin on my body like this</li>
            <li>The little loop broke after the first use but that was an easy fix.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the amount of dead skin that I removed was pretty gross-</li>
            <li>Wow !!  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this little mitt while it held up.  </li>
            <li>be good if you have tough skin, but I don&#x27;t…..</li>
            <li>it works great with the black soap or any other natural soap.</li>
            <li>When you slather moisturizers on top, the dead skin becomes moist and ceases to be noticeable on your skin</li>
            <li>I was SO excited when I received it, planned an intense workout followed by some time in the steam room, so that I could later indulge in scrubbing every last bit of my skin while emerging youthful as a new butterfly.  </li>
            <li>but it is huge in size like 2 feet long so much easier to get to your back and stuff.</li>
            <li>And the skin just feels like new afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to gift.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get out of the shower and you&#x27;ll feel brand new.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used VERY rough, sand filled bars of soap before</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also harder to clean.  </li>
            <li>The glove isn&#x27;t worth what they charge for it and the miracles it boasts are even more of a farce.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft now.</li>
            <li>so I thought using the black soap and this mitt would be just fine.</li>
            <li>It was glowing and soft and like a brand new baby except shinier.</li>
            <li>I will definately be buying the black soap next, along with several more mitts to give to my sisters as gifts!</li>
            <li>This mitt used in conjunction w/ the Moroccan black soap makes your skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I used Zakia&#x27;s Moroccan Black Soap - Original.</li>
            <li>I read all of the reviews and thought I was going to see a HUGE improvement of removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li>You can quite literally remove huge rolls of dead skin from your body with it.</li>
            <li>I like the deals amazon offers.  </li>
            <li>I had one I purchased from Morocca years ago which lasted far longer</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin glowing and so soft</li>
            <li>takes the old color off completely.</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t necessary for me</li>
            <li>I would not waste my money on this again .</li>
            <li>Your skin will be as soft as a baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I have others before but this one far exceeds those others purchased.</li>
            <li>My skin did feel soft afterwards though, so I still gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked in the bath with some muddy green bath salts (also available from amazon) for about 15 minutes</li>
            <li>black dye runs out pretty fast</li>
            <li>I can live with it, it did run right down the drain after all.</li>
            <li>In fact I could see if  you weren&#x27;t careful you could remove too much skin so caution would be advised if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT, you must like rough and you may not be able to use it everyday if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>testing this mitt, I would take a hot shower, wet the mitt, turn off the water and apply the soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty rough.</li>
            <li>In short, good functionality but poor longevity!</li>
            <li>According to her it is easy on the skin but has enough friction to scrub away the dead skin and dirt if any. 5 stars!</li>
            <li>The mitt has a rough texture that comes in handy when scrubbing the dead skin off your body but the only problem is that i cont reach my back</li>
            <li>……I can barely stand to wash with it….might</li>
            <li>(I have only used it once so far)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it really does exfoliate, but this mitt is extremely scratchy</li>
            <li>The first time I saw the black color I thought that its probably because it is the first time but even after using it several time the black dye does come out in shower.</li>
            <li>was still a little bit weirded out by the time I left after the first Turkish bath</li>
            <li>I bought this without the black soap, wanting to try the mitt before I bought the whole schibang.</li>
            <li>It works very well with Moroccan black soap to exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li>Really works well with the Black soap to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>that was all the semi-detached and dying skin cells still stuck to other live skin.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this mitt so badly.  </li>

            <li> lol</li>
            <li> Great nothing like it soak your self</li>
            <li> My wife uses this mitten, she says it is great.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This Chaacoca mitt has great scrubbing power, but like I said, if you&#x27;ve used any of those Salux-type cloths, your life will remain unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> things: the square shape isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> they are durable and do a great job to exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for exfoliating, though</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the rolls of skin some reviews talked about but after using my skin did feel softer and I am quite happy with this product.</li>
            <li> then I found this one and read all the great reviews</li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> works great to use before using a sunless tanning lotion,</li>
            <li> Not that great.</li>
            <li> This product is great it lasts for a couple months</li>
            <li> - you&#x27;ll be happy you did.  </li>
            <li> AND TAN LOOKS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I went to a Turkish bath in Tunisia and had the BEST exfoliation treatment with their magical glove....</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;roughness&amp;#34; of the Chaacoca Moroccan Exfoliating Mitt material is perfect; it exfoliates the skin leaving it with a glow and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;roughest&amp;#34; and best for exfoliating of many I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product i will order more just in case they run out again</li>
            <li> Follow it and you&#x27;ll should have remarkable</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the dye was very strong and it was like rinsing out hair dye in my shower!</li>
            <li> I bought it because it had good reviews</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good product to accompany me in my weight loss when skin tightening is a concern.</li>
            <li> loved this purchase.</li>
            <li> This thing feels like a brillo pad- which in the world of exfoliating is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I think it was good for about 10 scrubs</li>
            <li> It means you were doing a good job even before.</li>
            <li> It means you were doing a good job even before.</li>
            <li> Great product, I love it.</li>
            <li> It fits perfect and I am 5&#x27;10 with very large hands for a women.</li>
            <li> and i wouldnt do it more than once a week!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mitt!</li>
            <li> I love it~!</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This mitt is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I liked how well it exfoliated, but then a hole ripped in it after the 4th use.</li>
            <li> Split at the seams the first month use, besides that it is ok, happy easter everyone and have a great day</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product after all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to do much because I&#x27;m very good about exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It works best if you let your bathroom get super steamy, lather soap first and rub it on your body BEFORE using the mitt.</li>
            <li> you are mostly interested in the texture of this mitt for skin sloughing/polishing, then you might be happy with this (as plenty of reviewers seem to be).</li>
            <li> mom is able to clean them up good with this mitten.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made MIT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckly I got this mitt when it was priced very cheap to try.</li>
            <li> The glove on its own is fine and it exfoliates</li>
            <li> Be sure you are good and steamed up, wash your skin first, rinse then rub in a circular motion..now look at the mitt!</li>
            <li> now I found one to have for myself here at home  :))))</li>
            <li> Just wish the ribbon to hang it was more durable; it&#x27;s already ripping off.</li>
            <li> perhaps a slimmer version might be better (for me).</li>
            <li> and the result is amazing smooth skin and save a lot on body wash</li>
            <li> if you like the top layer of your skin to come off then this is for you.</li>
            <li> just make sure to soak in a tub or stay in a steamy shower for 10 min before using it.</li>
            <li> Works ok ..</li>
            <li> Love the texture and the usage.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve used the Korean Salux-like body scrub towel (made of nylon), this bath mitt is not that impressive, especially for the cost.  </li>
            <li> I love this mitt.</li>
            <li> I got better results from using exfoliating mitts that I bought at the 99 cent store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, let your jaw hit the floor-because it will.</li>
            <li> Given the price, I was expecting a much better product.</li>
            <li> I love the mitt for my skin</li>
            <li> Sure, I know what you&#x27;re thinking...</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliating mitt for the shower, bath.</li>
            <li> yet your skin emerges glowing, and so smooth!  </li>
            <li> I love using this mitt.  </li>
            <li> It is astonishing how well this mitt exfoliates.</li>
            <li> Totally happy with this much cheaper replacement.</li>
            <li> I love these Hammam gloves--</li>
            <li> okay, 46...</li>
            <li> This means a bit more maintenance but also making smarter choices on how the skin is treated.</li>
            <li> travels took me to Turkey where I experienced real Turkish baths.</li>
            <li> but they said it was okay.</li>
            <li> It scrubs ok.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Just in time for Summer when I need it more.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll keep better track of its whereabouts while on vacation since i go nowhere without my loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a pretty good history of using loofas and sugar scrubs</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good mitt.</li>
            <li> It was awesome, yes, but it&#x27;s also a bit strange for a westerner.</li>
            <li> I loved this mitt, it certainly did what I wanted</li>
            <li> Very cool.</li>
            <li> After checking out the other reviews...the Chaacoca Moroccan Exfoliating Mitt is the best.</li>
            <li> Hands down best ever.</li>
            <li> I use it with black soap and it is the best!</li>
            <li> Works fine to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I thought I was sooo smooth.</li>
            <li> Made my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN LOOKED AND FELT SOOO SMOOTH AND GLOWING AFTER USING THIS.</li>
            <li> and they just fit.</li>
            <li> I only use it once a week because it is very effective at doing its job.</li>
            <li> The feeling is nice, like a massage, and like you&#x27;re really getting clean.</li>
            <li> It works great, it just needs to be made a little more securely.</li>
            <li> Most of the loofah mitts out there are very wimpy and/or fall apart easily.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so fresh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t throw this in with my laundry first.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions on the clove and love how I felt after my first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure it&#x27;s accurate and may very well be disproved scientifically</li>
            <li> I loved how well this mitt exfoliated my skin, however, the elastic cuff began to tear away from the mitt after only one use.</li>
            <li> but overall its a good tool to use in the bath or shower.</li>
            <li> Also the material isn&#x27;t as good as the last mitt I bought ( diff brand )</li>
            <li> I was worried this would hurt, but it actually feels good.  </li>
            <li> It needs things but it starts to need different things as it ages in order to look good and keep that glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure how much the mitt would work.</li>
            <li> Great when you use fake tans, it works great , I love it, gonna buy another one once this one gets old.</li>
            <li> and I think does a good job, but this mitt does a little better.  </li>
            <li> I am happy the real gloves are back</li>
            <li> In all you get a clean sexy soft skin feeling after you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliator when used with some black soap.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it because I&#x27;ve heard they use similar gloves in South Korean bath houses that are super effective.</li>
            <li> I use a fine exfoliating cream that I really like</li>
            <li> and my skin feels great, but my bathwater is a little murky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic, 5 start absolutely</li>
            <li> Our weather is very humid and after using the mitt my skin feels smooth and the sticky feeling is gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great mitt, but within a few days it started falling apart.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not at all worth it.  </li>
            <li> This really irritates my skin, and doesn&#x27;t seem to exfoliate, so much as rip the top the layer of my skin.</li>
            <li> Not close to worth the price they sell it for.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li> This mitt has a rough texture, which is good for scrubbing, but not keeping the soap foamy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> $20 for a one time use mitt isn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Very nice, removes all dead skin without being too abrasive.</li>
            <li> To keep it clean, I wash it in my washing machine in a mesh bag and with a free and clear detergent.</li>
            <li> Fell apart right away.</li>
            <li> I really like the clean feeling after using the mitt.  </li>
            <li> The perfect &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; for sponging with the Moroccan Black Soap, which I&#x27;ve recently discovered.  </li>
            <li> I used it with regular soap, and loved how soft it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Works well, the glove fits my hand just right and it leaves my skin silky soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The rest of my body is smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> it is an award winning Japanese nylon scrubbing towel.  </li>
            <li> I read several reviews that said you should use a product like this to get a better faux tan.</li>
            <li> so i can scrub more of my back.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> My skin was rendered smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1.) Shower for 15 minutes in hot water&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deceiving just how effective it is, you won&#x27;t feel too roughly scrubbed,</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the Chinese vegetable brushes that I used to be able to get.</li>
            <li> At first I freaked</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use it in the shower to know it will do exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at the amount of dead skin that was in the glove after my first use.</li>
            <li> you try to use this mitt with a soap that contains a natural moisturizer like cocoa butter, the moisturizer clogs up the pores of this mitt, thereby significantly reducing the scrubbing power.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and you should definitely give it a try if you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliator that will really get the job done.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this mitt was a little ruff, but after seeing and feeling the results I love it!</li>
            <li> right now I only use it on my legs before shaving to avoid ingrown hair, or on my feet to keep them smooth and sandal-ready.</li>
            <li> Excited to see how my skin creams work better now that they don&#x27;t have a layer of dead skin to soak through.</li>
            <li> I would like to think that maybe the first time, I had a rash because I had so much skin that needed to be sloughed off?</li>
            <li> B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil ® 100 Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert -1oz(30ml)]] to add more glow and give the skin something good to drink in.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised at how quickly this fell apart.</li>
            <li> If the Salux tears, it&#x27;s easy and inexpensive enough to replace.</li>
            <li> Kicks butt at exfoliating and leaving skin super soft.</li>
            <li> The stitching unraveled and there is a large hole in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but does exfoliate nicely.  </li>
            <li> I lived in Morrocco for seven years ,,, so I was so happy to see this natural products in Amazon ,,,and especially the Morrocan black soap ,,,useing natural sources for beauty skin is important</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know I had that much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The material works really well.  </li>
            <li> It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> i cant see much difference after using it...</li>
            <li> I found something very close to this mitt-</li>
            <li> You can use this on your face but only with a LIGHT touch</li>
            <li> When I started using it, the colour ran so much that it stained my wash clothes.</li>
            <li> You can find them at Asian grocery stores and even at Home Goods/TJMaxx/Ross for cheap.  </li>
            <li> This is a must for anyone and everyone in my opinion because we get exposed to so much in the air</li>
            <li> But absolutely NOTHING came off.  </li>
            <li> It almost doesn&#x27;t seem like it should do much exfoliating, but it does.  </li>
            <li> I like this mit to use at home, but I don&#x27;t feel like it really exfoliates the way it should.  </li>
            <li> It works really well, but it falls apart really well too.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this on my face but it works really well on my body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Caveat: If you are a good exfoliator of your skin, then you might not have the same crazy shedding others report, but that is good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to happen.re a good exfoliator of your skin, then you might not have the same crazy shedding others report, but that is good.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably not recommended, but it seemed like a good way to clean off dead skin cells and other microbial shower grossness and the mitt has held up well.</li>
            <li> After using this and sloughing off all that dead skin I felt amazing, and I love that I can have that experience every week for less than 10 dollars.  </li>
            <li> I put a nice all natural lotion all over my skin, let it soak in really well and soften up all the dead cells, then use this in the shower.</li>
            <li> I had this exfoliation thing down, how much better could this mitt be than what I was already doing?&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> After using this mitt lightly on my face, however, my skin would glow and I never got the dry patches.  </li>
            <li> Either way, I pair it with morracan black soap and love it.</li>
            <li> It works decent as a scrub</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t go for the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I went to more of them but never had that same level of exfoliation because it was just maintaining it rather than starting from scratch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have never had an exfoliator be able to rub away absolutely ALL of the dead skin on my body like this</li>
            <li> The little loop broke after the first use but that was an easy fix.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the amount of dead skin that I removed was pretty gross-</li>
            <li> Wow !!  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this little mitt while it held up.  </li>
            <li> be good if you have tough skin, but I don&#x27;t…..</li>
            <li> it works great with the black soap or any other natural soap.</li>
            <li> When you slather moisturizers on top, the dead skin becomes moist and ceases to be noticeable on your skin</li>
            <li> I was SO excited when I received it, planned an intense workout followed by some time in the steam room, so that I could later indulge in scrubbing every last bit of my skin while emerging youthful as a new butterfly.  </li>
            <li> but it is huge in size like 2 feet long so much easier to get to your back and stuff.</li>
            <li> And the skin just feels like new afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to gift.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get out of the shower and you&#x27;ll feel brand new.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used VERY rough, sand filled bars of soap before</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also harder to clean.  </li>
            <li> The glove isn&#x27;t worth what they charge for it and the miracles it boasts are even more of a farce.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft now.</li>
            <li> so I thought using the black soap and this mitt would be just fine.</li>
            <li> It was glowing and soft and like a brand new baby except shinier.</li>
            <li> I will definately be buying the black soap next, along with several more mitts to give to my sisters as gifts!</li>
            <li> This mitt used in conjunction w/ the Moroccan black soap makes your skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I used Zakia&#x27;s Moroccan Black Soap - Original.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and thought I was going to see a HUGE improvement of removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li> You can quite literally remove huge rolls of dead skin from your body with it.</li>
            <li> I like the deals amazon offers.  </li>
            <li> I had one I purchased from Morocca years ago which lasted far longer</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin glowing and so soft</li>
            <li> takes the old color off completely.</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t necessary for me</li>
            <li> I would not waste my money on this again .</li>
            <li> Your skin will be as soft as a baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have others before but this one far exceeds those others purchased.</li>
            <li> My skin did feel soft afterwards though, so I still gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked in the bath with some muddy green bath salts (also available from amazon) for about 15 minutes</li>
            <li> black dye runs out pretty fast</li>
            <li> I can live with it, it did run right down the drain after all.</li>
            <li> In fact I could see if  you weren&#x27;t careful you could remove too much skin so caution would be advised if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT, you must like rough and you may not be able to use it everyday if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> testing this mitt, I would take a hot shower, wet the mitt, turn off the water and apply the soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty rough.</li>
            <li> In short, good functionality but poor longevity!</li>
            <li> According to her it is easy on the skin but has enough friction to scrub away the dead skin and dirt if any. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> The mitt has a rough texture that comes in handy when scrubbing the dead skin off your body but the only problem is that i cont reach my back</li>
            <li> ……I can barely stand to wash with it….might</li>
            <li> (I have only used it once so far)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it really does exfoliate, but this mitt is extremely scratchy</li>
            <li> The first time I saw the black color I thought that its probably because it is the first time but even after using it several time the black dye does come out in shower.</li>
            <li> was still a little bit weirded out by the time I left after the first Turkish bath</li>
            <li> I bought this without the black soap, wanting to try the mitt before I bought the whole schibang.</li>
            <li> It works very well with Moroccan black soap to exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li> Really works well with the Black soap to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> that was all the semi-detached and dying skin cells still stuck to other live skin.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this mitt so badly.  </li>
            <li> The ladies used Moroccan soap on us first and then afterward, other ladies rubbed us down with argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can press down as hard as your comfortable and start rubbinb away.</li>
            <li> I bet i lasts as long as my last one</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t personally find it to have an advantage over my other mitts, such as my Urban Spa or Kae mitts.</li>
            <li> I always thought this was just inevitable dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today and the results were instant and kind of shocking.</li>
            <li> The mitt did not hold the soap very well so there was hardly any foam</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s to be expected after you shed off an entire layer of skin like some sort of pod-person.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mitt similar to those used at the Korean Spa&#x27;s where you can actually see the dead skin being brushed off.  </li>
            <li> I was back and forth between four and five stars because the water run black out of it, at least the first time you use it</li>
            <li> My only slight complaints is that I have larger hands</li>
            <li> I think that the dry patches you see after a shower aren&#x27;t really dry skin, they are dead skin that haven&#x27;t completely fallen off.  </li>
            <li> No different than any other exfoliating mitt I have used</li>
            <li> Total crap item in nice packaging</li>
            <li> I tried other cheaper ones and they weren&#x27;t rough enough for me and a couple fell apart within a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently helps to get rid of the dead cells.</li>
            <li> Even my dry nasty skin comes out looking and feeling much softer, fresh and new!</li>
            <li> Not particularly metro, either.</li>
            <li> It is critical to follow the directions about using the black soap in a steamy environment, then rinsing it, then exfoliating to get the results.  </li>
            <li> I guess the key is teaming this mitt with Moroccan Black Soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this with the Moroccan Black soap (olives and eucalyptus formula) which can get foamy if you use it in a specific way (See my review for how I use it).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, in my quest to recreate that skin, I&#x27;ve gone through a bunch of products and several less than satisfactory gloves.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because it could be a little bigger and</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, i have always ordered my Hammam gloves from Amazon and at one point was sold a cheap Chinese knock off that was horrible.  </li>
            <li> It kind of flopped around and felt clumsy, making it awkward to rinse off while scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The part where you slide your hand in that connects with the scrubby part separated after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have noticed she scrubs the kids especially after they spend a few hours out with dad.</li>
            <li> and it did not really bother me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT DID SOAK BEFORE EXFOLIATING AND NOTICED WHITE SHREDS OF DEAD SKIN ON MY MITT.</li>
            <li> seams get open after a few uses</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe what the mitt actually feels like, but it&#x27;s not too rough and not really soft.  </li>
            <li> however i notice in warm/hot water the black bleeds and left me with black water in my sink.</li>
            <li> times after I dried off from a shower I would notice little white, flaky dry patches on my face.  </li>
            <li> This is rectangular and a little oversized (and I have long piano fingers).</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I walked around feeling really weird afterwords.</li>
            <li> and it felt like you were mostly scrubbing your skin with sand paper and water :(</li>
            <li> One of my gloves did bust at the seam but other ones I have ordered have never had this problem.</li>
            <li> so Im not sure why they said that maybe they have made it bigger.</li>
            <li> I gave it a few weeks following the instructions to a T and was still not able to get my dry skin to peel off.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the mitt&#x27;s stitching is not very good; and, after ten (10) days of use several holes developed where the two mitt scrubbing surfaces were stitched together.</li>
            <li> I dont notice my dead skin coming off every single time but</li>
            <li> It was also a little small, my hands are not that big</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s enough to say that you will be shocked the first time you use this and see the dirt coming out of your skin.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is a dark color too</li>
            <li> but I find it way too harsh and rough on the skin.  </li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t want to use this mitt everyday, it would be too rough on your skin.  </li>
            <li> , I was pretty shocked to see just how much I was missing when the dead skin rolled off into the mitt!!</li>
            <li> so you didn&#x27;t bother to write down the brand.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not easy to get them in and out of the wet mitt, and the price;  </li>
            <li> Within a few weeks the other seams started falling apart.  </li>
            <li> Also didn&#x27;t like the black dye that bled onto my shower each and every time I used it.</li>
            <li> I got the hardest one in black package.</li>
            <li> It works well, but I wish they hadn&#x27;t used black dye.  </li>
            <li> I use it with the black soap.</li>
            <li> B004AO5D0E ELMA&amp;SANA® Moroccan Black Soap eucalyptus-9oz(250gr)]]&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li> B004AO5D0E ELMA&amp;SANA® Moroccan Black Soap eucalyptus-9oz(250gr)]</li>
            <li> It bleeds black dye all over the shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as often as I would if the cuff weren&#x27;t so tight, making it a chore to get on and off my hands.</li>
            <li> The two little pot bellied men that did the washing...</li>
            <li> So much dead skin came off.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of dead skin cells, increases blood circulation, encourages cellular renewal, and tightens skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harsh but not TOO harsh.</li>
            <li> This really does work on those nasty bumps on the back of upper arms, bottom and thighs, with everyday use.</li>
            <li> But the ripped seams are pitiful, after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Ripped in a few months.</li>
            <li> Cleans dead skin, helps with impurities of the skin being released and all</li>
            <li> so perhaps that&#x27;s the reason why I don&#x27;t have a mega amount of dead skin coming off.</li>
            <li> I think because the mitt does not consist of fluffy fibers or fibers that allow a lot of air pockets to hold the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You use it to exfoliate, to take off the layers of dead skin and god knows what else.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll notice a layer of grime missing from your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the mitt, but it&#x27;s not something you can use everyday.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bath mitt, so I wouldn&#x27;t have minded except that the poor workmanship resulted in the hanging loop being so tiny that I couldn&#x27;t hang it from my shower</li>
            <li> The mitt in general is very thin and feels like it&#x27;s going to rip soon.</li>
            <li> After a month it has a small rip in it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I it fell short of my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some said it was small but mine wasn&#x27;t to small at all</li>
            <li> Really sad it took me this long to find out about this product.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if it were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> my skin was dull</li>
            <li> Wished the opening was a bit wider, as it&#x27;s hard to get your hand inside the mit.</li>
            <li> Or at least I thought I was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown this mitt in the wash in a laundry bag, and the edge of the elastic is starting to look a bit haggard with snags - a bit disappointing after 3 washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I say cleanse themselves, I really mean it.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t feel bad, I&#x27;ve done that several times.</li>
            <li> Worst mitt---------black dye came pouring off first use........</li>
            <li> But it came unsewn after only a couple of weeks :-(</li>
            <li> but I left it at a hotel on vacation :-(.  </li>
            <li> Really poor quality.</li>
            <li> but alas, it was not.  </li>
            <li> Poor workmanship</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been stepping up my game</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and found the stitching to be sloppy on one of them.</li>
            <li> about once a month I am shocked and whats going down my shower drain.  </li>
            <li> However, I am very disappointed that the seams split the second time I used it, and I now have to use it as a towel instead of a mitt.</li>
            <li> Like Keanu-Reeeves-being-unplugged-from-the-Matrix weird.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mitt for a while to get rid of my fake tan</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, about 3 months into using it, it ripped.</li>
            <li> POOR QUALITY!</li>
            <li> I consider this a useless product.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to exfoliate before using Fake Bake &amp; after reading reviews I decided to try this mitt.</li>
            <li> it is a bit bulky and awkward to use.</li>
            <li> all dirty and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out if I&#x27;m just a dirty girl or if it is the dye from the glove that others mentioned.</li>
            <li> I use it before I apply fake bake and it works like a dream!</li>
            <li> and then it was worthless.</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed that it literally began coming apart at the seams within a month of use.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I was both appalled and grossed out by how well it works!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works just like the mitt I used in Morocco during hamams.  Best exfoliating fabric for the body that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Really sad it took me this long to find out about this product. I bought it because it had good reviews but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to do much because I&#x27;m very good about exfoliating. Or at least I thought I was. So much dead skin came off. I didn&#x27;t even know I had that much. My skin feels very soft now. The first time I tried it I walked around feeling really weird afterwords. Like Keanu-Reeeves-being-unplugged-from-the-Matrix weird.I guess that&#x27;s to be expected after you shed off an entire layer of skin like some sort of pod-person. Definitely worth the money. Excited to see how my skin creams work better now that they don&#x27;t have a layer of dead skin to soak through. Will try an get an update about that.</li>
            <li> Great when you use fake tans, it works great , I love it, gonna buy another one once this one gets old.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and it looks brighter and smoother.  The rest of my body is smooth and soft.  Read Evan&#x27;s review for the best instructions.</li>
            <li> It arrived coming apart.  We re-sewed that area. Within a few weeks the other seams started falling apart.  It&#x27;s just not well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material works really well.  If it held up at all, I&#x27;d keep ordering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove looks like no-legged underwear.  You can see that in the photos.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for pampering yourself every day. Gets rid of dead skin cells, increases blood circulation, encourages cellular renewal, and tightens skin. I was looking for a good product to accompany me in my weight loss when skin tightening is a concern. Even my feet, a &amp;#34;trouble&amp;#34; area, feel smoother. Received the package practically overnight. Great product and service!!!</li>
            <li> After checking out the other reviews...the Chaacoca Moroccan Exfoliating Mitt is the best. I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I loved how well this mitt exfoliated my skin, however, the elastic cuff began to tear away from the mitt after only one use.</li>
            <li> loved this purchase. I like the deals amazon offers.  it works wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> The mitt has a rough texture that comes in handy when scrubbing the dead skin off your body but the only problem is that i cont reach my back lol but overall its a good tool to use in the bath or shower.</li>
            <li> No different than any other exfoliating mitt I have used and I was very disappointed that it literally began coming apart at the seams within a month of use. Also didn&#x27;t like the black dye that bled onto my shower each and every time I used it.</li>
            <li> The part where you slide your hand in that connects with the scrubby part separated after only a few uses. The mitt in general is very thin and feels like it&#x27;s going to rip soon. The quality is lacking...and yet I bought another one anyway. Why? Because the exfoliating part is incredible for the skin. It&#x27;s harsh but not TOO harsh. It&#x27;s like the perfect sea salt exfoliating scrub, the one you bought once and now can&#x27;t find because hey, it&#x27;s a scrub and they&#x27;re all the same so you didn&#x27;t bother to write down the brand. But don&#x27;t feel bad, I&#x27;ve done that several times. But now I don&#x27;t have to remember what scrub I like, I just use this mitt and it&#x27;s the same every time. It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I&#x27;m a dude. Not particularly metro, either. But man, exfoliating does make a difference. The feeling is nice, like a massage, and like you&#x27;re really getting clean. And the skin just feels like new afterwards. Very cool.</li>
            <li> I went to a Turkish bath in Tunisia and had the BEST exfoliation treatment with their magical glove....now I found one to have for myself here at home  :))))</li>
            <li> I bought this loofah a while ago based on the reviews and having used it in a Moroccan Hamman...it does the trick! Works well and softens the skin...however it has already started falling apart at the seams. I had one I purchased from Morocca years ago which lasted far longer so I was surprised at how quickly this fell apart. In short, good functionality but poor longevity!</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliator when used with some black soap.  I really didn&#x27;t think I had a bunch of dead skin.  Boy was I wrong.  It is critical to follow the directions about using the black soap in a steamy environment, then rinsing it, then exfoliating to get the results.  After using this and sloughing off all that dead skin I felt amazing, and I love that I can have that experience every week for less than 10 dollars.  This is my new go-to gift.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and everytime the color comes off in the shower. The first time I saw the black color I thought that its probably because it is the first time but even after using it several time the black dye does come out in shower. It has a rip in it and I have been using it for 3 months only.</li>
            <li> It works great, it just needs to be made a little more securely. After a month it has a small rip in it but it still performs well.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so fresh! Just wish the ribbon to hang it was more durable; it&#x27;s already ripping off.</li>
            <li> I bought this without the black soap, wanting to try the mitt before I bought the whole schibang. Whew! This thing feels like a brillo pad- which in the world of exfoliating is a good thing. I used it with regular soap, and loved how soft it made my skin feel. I will definately be buying the black soap next, along with several more mitts to give to my sisters as gifts!</li>
            <li> I put a nice all natural lotion all over my skin, let it soak in really well and soften up all the dead cells, then use this in the shower. Even my dry nasty skin comes out looking and feeling much softer, fresh and new!</li>
            <li> The glove isn&#x27;t worth what they charge for it and the miracles it boasts are even more of a farce. Not at all worth it.  Go to the drugstore, but a loofa and call it a day.</li>
            <li> Great product, I love it.</li>
            <li> Worst mitt---------black dye came pouring off first use........in trash it goes........do not bother i would have given 0 stars if possible</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;roughness&amp;#34; of the Chaacoca Moroccan Exfoliating Mitt material is perfect; it exfoliates the skin leaving it with a glow and feeling healthy. Unfortunately, the mitt&#x27;s stitching is not very good; and, after ten (10) days of use several holes developed where the two mitt scrubbing surfaces were stitched together. If this issue were corrected the Chaacoca Moroccan Exfoliating Mitt would receive a five (5) star review from me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to exfoliate my skin, pre-spray tan. I&#x27;ve had a pretty good history of using loofas and sugar scrubs so I thought using the black soap and this mitt would be just fine. It&#x27;s not for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it once a week for about a month, and every time, I have a rash all over my body afterward. I would like to think that maybe the first time, I had a rash because I had so much skin that needed to be sloughed off? But that&#x27;s not the case. This really irritates my skin, and doesn&#x27;t seem to exfoliate, so much as rip the top the layer of my skin. I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this mitt was a little ruff, but after seeing and feeling the results I love it! I use it with black soap and it is the best! It leaves my skin glowing and so soft</li>
            <li> it is a bit bulky and awkward to use. perhaps i&#x27;m not using it properly. perhaps a slimmer version might be better (for me).</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping I can use it for my face but I find it way too harsh and rough on the skin.  I do use it for my body and it leaves my skin feeling like a bebe&#x27;s  bottom!</li>
            <li> i cant see much difference after using it...just like any regular exfoliating glove...i wouldn&#x27;t order it again. Kinda rough on my soft skin also</li>
            <li> Great nothing like it soak your self 10 min and the result is amazing smooth skin and save a lot on body wash</li>
            <li> if you like the top layer of your skin to come off then this is for you. it works! especially good for people who self-tan. takes the old color off completely. just make sure to soak in a tub or stay in a steamy shower for 10 min before using it. I found something very close to this mitt- it is an award winning Japanese nylon scrubbing towel.  it works just as well as this mitt but it is huge in size like 2 feet long so much easier to get to your back and stuff. it works great with the black soap or any other natural soap. amazon sells fakes so I got it on saluxshop dot com after reading amazon reviews. I got the hardest one in black package. the towel itself is white. made in japan</li>
            <li> My wife uses this mitten, she says it is great. Apparently helps to get rid of the dead cells. I have noticed she scrubs the kids especially after they spend a few hours out with dad. They come home all dirty and mom is able to clean them up good with this mitten. According to her it is easy on the skin but has enough friction to scrub away the dead skin and dirt if any. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It works decent as a scrub however i notice in warm/hot water the black bleeds and left me with black water in my sink. You can use this on your face but only with a LIGHT touch and i wouldnt do it more than once a week!</li>
            <li> The glove on its own is fine and it exfoliates but I have been using mine for over a month and the colour still runs. When I started using it, the colour ran so much that it stained my wash clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mitt for a while to get rid of my fake tan and it&#x27;s great. Unfortunately, about 3 months into using it, it ripped. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after purchasing &amp;#34;Fake Bake&amp;#34;. I read several reviews that said you should use a product like this to get a better faux tan. It really wasn&#x27;t necessary for me but I never attempted to return it.</li>
            <li> Works ok .. Does the job .. Wish the mitt part was a bit smaller .. Also the material isn&#x27;t as good as the last mitt I bought ( diff brand )</li>
            <li> This really does work on those nasty bumps on the back of upper arms, bottom and thighs, with everyday use. But the ripped seams are pitiful, after just a few uses. POOR QUALITY! But, it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;roughest&amp;#34; and best for exfoliating of many I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I was worried this would hurt, but it actually feels good.  I dont notice my dead skin coming off every single time but about once a month I am shocked and whats going down my shower drain.  I sue this 1x per week before using my sunless tanner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic, 5 start absolutely</li>
            <li> Works fine to exfoliate. Not close to worth the price they sell it for. Ripped in a few months. Really poor quality. I&#x27;d try something else!</li>
            <li> It works well, but I wish they hadn&#x27;t used black dye.  I had to wash it out several times before using.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!!! It really works on removing dead skin. I use it as a daily exfoliating mitt as well. It works best if you let your bathroom get super steamy, lather soap first and rub it on your body BEFORE using the mitt. You can press down as hard as your comfortable and start rubbinb away. It takes a while to fully get the technique but it&#x27;s definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li> Love the texture and the usage.  My skin glows after usage (I use about once a week).  However, I am very disappointed that the seams split the second time I used it, and I now have to use it as a towel instead of a mitt.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mitt! Its winter n my skin was dull n ashy now it feels like silk. I use it with the black soap. I do wish they would make an adapter so i can scrub more of my back.</li>
            <li> I really like the clean feeling after using the mitt.  Our weather is very humid and after using the mitt my skin feels smooth and the sticky feeling is gone.</li>
            <li> Wow !!  This is the best thing ever !!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this mitt so badly.  I was SO excited when I received it, planned an intense workout followed by some time in the steam room, so that I could later indulge in scrubbing every last bit of my skin while emerging youthful as a new butterfly.  Unfortunately, I it fell short of my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve used the Korean Salux-like body scrub towel (made of nylon), this bath mitt is not that impressive, especially for the cost.  This Chaacoca mitt has great scrubbing power, but like I said, if you&#x27;ve used any of those Salux-type cloths, your life will remain unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you try to use this mitt with a soap that contains a natural moisturizer like cocoa butter, the moisturizer clogs up the pores of this mitt, thereby significantly reducing the scrubbing power.  It&#x27;s also harder to clean.  I&#x27;ve thrown this mitt in the wash in a laundry bag, and the edge of the elastic is starting to look a bit haggard with snags - a bit disappointing after 3 washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my personal opinion, I&#x27;d recommend buyers to purchase a Salux or Salux-type scrub towel than to spend money on this.  You can find them at Asian grocery stores and even at Home Goods/TJMaxx/Ross for cheap.  Amazon also sells them for a fraction of what 1 mitt costs.  If the Salux tears, it&#x27;s easy and inexpensive enough to replace.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it really does exfoliate, but this mitt is extremely scratchy……I can barely stand to wash with it….might be good if you have tough skin, but I don&#x27;t…..right now I only use it on my legs before shaving to avoid ingrown hair, or on my feet to keep them smooth and sandal-ready.</li>
            <li> I would not waste my money on this again . Glad I didn&#x27;t go for the more expensive brand. I think a wash cloth can d o just as well.</li>
            <li> You get the bang for your buck using this product! I used it along with Elma and Sana Moroccan soap and it did wonders for my skin!  Cleans dead skin, helps with impurities of the skin being released and all In all you get a clean sexy soft skin feeling after you&#x27;re done! This is a must for anyone and everyone in my opinion because we get exposed to so much in the air and it gets locked in our skin. Not everyone can afford a spa cleansing treatment so this is a perfect alternative all you need is a steamy shower and you&#x27;re good to go! Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good mitt. It&#x27;s my second hammam mitt and it exfoliates just as well as the last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things: the square shape isn&#x27;t great. If you take a look at the shape of your hand when you scrub, it&#x27;s a oval, rounded shape. This is rectangular and a little oversized (and I have long piano fingers). It kind of flopped around and felt clumsy, making it awkward to rinse off while scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the dye was very strong and it was like rinsing out hair dye in my shower! I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t throw this in with my laundry first. It eventually washed out after a couple of showers. I&#x27;d try soaking it in a sink with a cup of white vinegar (which will keep the dye from running) for an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: this mitt definitely did not hold up. I think it was good for about 10 scrubs and then it was worthless., not to mention the color was still running up until the day I tossed it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I love this mitt. It works very well with Moroccan black soap to exfoliate the skin. I use it every couple of weeks and have not had a problem with it. To keep it clean, I wash it in my washing machine in a mesh bag and with a free and clear detergent. That&#x27;s probably not recommended, but it seemed like a good way to clean off dead skin cells and other microbial shower grossness and the mitt has held up well.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. I read all of the reviews and thought I was going to see a HUGE improvement of removing dead skin.  But absolutely NOTHING came off.  I do exfoliate on a regular basis so perhaps that&#x27;s the reason why I don&#x27;t have a mega amount of dead skin coming off. I got better results from using exfoliating mitts that I bought at the 99 cent store.</li>
            <li> Fell apart in two weeks.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to buy a Moroccan exfoliating mitt, look elsewhere. This one ripped open after only the second use.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at the amount of dead skin that was in the glove after my first use. I followed the instructions on the clove and love how I felt after my first use. I guess the key is teaming this mitt with Moroccan Black Soap. I used Zakia&#x27;s Moroccan Black Soap - Original. My skin is glowing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black dye runs out pretty fast and it did not really bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Works really well! I was both appalled and grossed out by how well it works!</li>
            <li> Sooo. I thought I was sooo smooth. I had this exfoliation thing down, how much better could this mitt be than what I was already doing?&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was pretty shocked to see just how much I was missing when the dead skin rolled off into the mitt!! Be sure you are good and steamed up, wash your skin first, rinse then rub in a circular motion..now look at the mitt! It&#x27;s ok, let your jaw hit the floor-because it will. I will be back for another, and another. I can&#x27;t be without this.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made MIT. The stitching unraveled and there is a large hole in it. Avoid this would be my suggestion.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would work like the much more expensive Baiden mitt but alas, it was not.  I gave it a few weeks following the instructions to a T and was still not able to get my dry skin to peel off.  Given the price, I was expecting a much better product.</li>
            <li> Rips within a weeks usage. Total crap item in nice packaging</li>
            <li> This mitt has a rough texture, which is good for scrubbing, but not keeping the soap foamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this with the Moroccan Black soap (olives and eucalyptus formula) which can get foamy if you use it in a specific way (See my review for how I use it). I also used it with a regular liquid bath/shower soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When testing this mitt, I would take a hot shower, wet the mitt, turn off the water and apply the soap. The mitt did not hold the soap very well so there was hardly any foam and it felt like you were mostly scrubbing your skin with sand paper and water :( I think because the mitt does not consist of fluffy fibers or fibers that allow a lot of air pockets to hold the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckly I got this mitt when it was priced very cheap to try.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this little mitt while it held up.  Kicks butt at exfoliating and leaving skin super soft. But it came unsewn after only a couple of weeks :-(</li>
            <li> These kease made me feel as if I had just stepped out of a Turkish Hamam. My skin was rendered smooth and soft. I love it~!</li>
            <li> I lived in Morrocco for seven years ,,, so I was so happy to see this natural products in Amazon ,,,and especially the Morrocan black soap ,,,useing natural sources for beauty skin is important</li>
            <li> I love the mitt for my skin but it started to fall apart at the seam. I am going to have to replace it.</li>
            <li> I bought to use in conjunction with sunless tanning. Made my skin really smooth. Great product! would buy again in future!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but does exfoliate nicely.  I use a fine exfoliating cream that I really like and I think does a good job, but this mitt does a little better.  It&#x27;s hard to describe what the mitt actually feels like, but it&#x27;s not too rough and not really soft.  It almost doesn&#x27;t seem like it should do much exfoliating, but it does.  My only slight complaints is that I have larger hands and it&#x27;s not easy to get them in and out of the wet mitt, and the price;  I would give it 5 stars if it were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> I loved this mitt, it certainly did what I wanted and then some. I was back and forth between four and five stars because the water run black out of it, at least the first time you use it (I have only used it once so far) but, it worked so beautifully I can live with it, it did run right down the drain after all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as often as I would if the cuff weren&#x27;t so tight, making it a chore to get on and off my hands.</li>
            <li> Sure, I know what you&#x27;re thinking... \\&quot;how could a loofa possibly improve my life?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is no loofah.  This mitt is used weekly by Moroccans to cleanse themselves  in a hammam, a Turkish style bath house.  When I say cleanse themselves, I really mean it.  You wouldn&#x27;t want to use this mitt everyday, it would be too rough on your skin.  You use it to exfoliate, to take off the layers of dead skin and god knows what else.  It&#x27;s enough to say that you will be shocked the first time you use this and see the dirt coming out of your skin.  And then something will happen.  You&#x27;ll get out of the shower and you&#x27;ll feel brand new.  Your skin will be as soft as a baby&#x27;s and you&#x27;ll notice a layer of grime missing from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the face, I have a theory.  I&#x27;m not too sure it&#x27;s accurate and may very well be disproved scientifically but here it goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many times after I dried off from a shower I would notice little white, flaky dry patches on my face.  I would put a moisturizer on to remedy this and be on my way.  I always thought this was just inevitable dry skin.  After using this mitt lightly on my face, however, my skin would glow and I never got the dry patches.  I think what happens is that your skin sheds but not all at once.  I think that the dry patches you see after a shower aren&#x27;t really dry skin, they are dead skin that haven&#x27;t completely fallen off.  When you slather moisturizers on top, the dead skin becomes moist and ceases to be noticeable on your skin but it&#x27;s still there.  As you get in the habit of doing this every day, you increase the build up on your skin.  This mitt removes everything and you will feel like new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice: if you have a vent in your bathroom, turn it off when using this.  The reason being because you want the bathroom to be as steamy as possible.  The steps you should take to achieve the maximum benefit are the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Shower for 15 minutes in hot water&lt;br /&gt;2.) Shut off water&lt;br /&gt;3.) Later on soap (preferably Beldi soap such as this [[ASIN:B004AO5D0E ELMA&amp;SANA® Moroccan Black Soap eucalyptus-9oz(250gr)]]&lt;br /&gt;4.) Leave on for 5 minutes! *Important*&lt;br /&gt;5.) Wash off soap&lt;br /&gt;6.) With water turned off, rub the mitt into your skin forefully&lt;br /&gt;7.) Be amazed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always searching for an awesome exfoliating tool. This thing is really awesome. You can quite literally remove huge rolls of dead skin from your body with it. In fact I could see if  you weren&#x27;t careful you could remove too much skin so caution would be advised if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I DID NOT ORDER THE SOAP IT RECOMMENDS BUT DID SOAK BEFORE EXFOLIATING AND NOTICED WHITE SHREDS OF DEAD SKIN ON MY MITT. MY SKIN LOOKED AND FELT SOOO SMOOTH AND GLOWING AFTER USING THIS. USED BEFORE SELF TANNING TOO AND TAN LOOKS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, i have always ordered my Hammam gloves from Amazon and at one point was sold a cheap Chinese knock off that was horrible.  I am happy the real gloves are back this is an excellent product i will order more just in case they run out again</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mitt similar to those used at the Korean Spa&#x27;s where you can actually see the dead skin being brushed off.  I like this mit to use at home, but I don&#x27;t feel like it really exfoliates the way it should.  I still feel like my skin is a bit softer but I have yet to see the skin actually be taken off.  Would try a different Mit next time I order.</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliating mitt for the shower, bath. It&#x27;s deceiving just how effective it is, you won&#x27;t feel too roughly scrubbed, yet your skin emerges glowing, and so smooth!  The perfect &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; for sponging with the Moroccan Black Soap, which I&#x27;ve recently discovered.  Beautiful skin is the result, yay!</li>
            <li> I love using this mitt.  I have others before but this one far exceeds those others purchased.</li>
            <li> It works really well, but it falls apart really well too.</li>
            <li> I like the mitt, but it&#x27;s not something you can use everyday.  I only use it once a week because it is very effective at doing its job.</li>
            <li> Used this mitt twice and the stitching between the mitt and the elastic band pulled away&lt;br /&gt;in several places.  I consider this a useless product.</li>
            <li> Of all my scrubbers and loofahs...this one takes the prize! It is astonishing how well this mitt exfoliates. I use it before I apply fake bake and it works like a dream! Hands down best ever.</li>
            <li> seams get open after a few uses</li>
            <li> I liked how well it exfoliated, but then a hole ripped in it after the 4th use. Now if I want to use it, I&#x27;ll have to mend it.</li>
            <li> Split at the seams the first month use, besides that it is ok, happy easter everyone and have a great day</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a worn out Bidden mitten. I wouldn&#x27;t use this on my face but it works really well on my body. Totally happy with this much cheaper replacement.</li>
            <li> I love these Hammam gloves-- they are durable and do a great job to exfoliate the skin. One of my gloves did bust at the seam but other ones I have ordered have never had this problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great mitt, but within a few days it started falling apart. It&#x27;s great for exfoliating, though</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and found the stitching to be sloppy on one of them. It&#x27;s just a bath mitt, so I wouldn&#x27;t have minded except that the poor workmanship resulted in the hanging loop being so tiny that I couldn&#x27;t hang it from my shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are mostly interested in the texture of this mitt for skin sloughing/polishing, then you might be happy with this (as plenty of reviewers seem to be). I didn&#x27;t personally find it to have an advantage over my other mitts, such as my Urban Spa or Kae mitts.</li>
            <li> Works well, the glove fits my hand just right and it leaves my skin silky soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Fell apart right away. Poor workmanship</li>
            <li> The little loop broke after the first use but that was an easy fix. It was also a little small, my hands are not that big and they just fit. I like it and my skin feels great, but my bathwater is a little murky. I can&#x27;t figure out if I&#x27;m just a dirty girl or if it is the dye from the glove that others mentioned. Either way, I pair it with morracan black soap and love it. I give it 4 stars because it could be a little bigger and for the price I shouldn&#x27;t have to sew it up after one use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty rough. I like it. It reminds me of the Chinese vegetable brushes that I used to be able to get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 40s...okay, 46...and I&#x27;ve been stepping up my game so I don&#x27;t look it. This means a bit more maintenance but also making smarter choices on how the skin is treated. It needs things but it starts to need different things as it ages in order to look good and keep that glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My travels took me to Turkey where I experienced real Turkish baths. It was awesome, yes, but it&#x27;s also a bit strange for a westerner. The two little pot bellied men that did the washing...yes, men...in one of the baths used a glove like this and the weirdest thing happened. Your skin just comes off. At first I freaked but they said it was okay. The ladies used Moroccan soap on us first and then afterward, other ladies rubbed us down with argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was still a little bit weirded out by the time I left after the first Turkish bath but then I saw my skin when I went outside. It was glowing and soft and like a brand new baby except shinier. Amazing. I went to more of them but never had that same level of exfoliation because it was just maintaining it rather than starting from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that this glove does a type of exfoliation we just don&#x27;t do often in the west and that was all the semi-detached and dying skin cells still stuck to other live skin. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, in my quest to recreate that skin, I&#x27;ve gone through a bunch of products and several less than satisfactory gloves. This is the best glove of them all. Hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results use [[ASIN:B004AO5D0E ELMA&amp;SANA® Moroccan Black Soap eucalyptus-9oz(250gr)]] this before hand and let your skin steam in the shower so it will release easier when you use the glove. Afterwards, use [[ASIN:B00397XUIK ELMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil ® 100 Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert -1oz(30ml)]] to add more glow and give the skin something good to drink in. The instructions are included. Follow it and you&#x27;ll should have remarkable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat: If you are a good exfoliator of your skin, then you might not have the same crazy shedding others report, but that is good. It means you were doing a good job even before. You&#x27;ll still see some though. You&#x27;re not gross. It&#x27;s supposed to happen.re a good exfoliator of your skin, then you might not have the same crazy shedding others report, but that is good. It means you were doing a good job even before. You&#x27;ll still see some though. You&#x27;re not gross. It&#x27;s supposed to happen.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product after all the great reviews. I followed the directions as described and after just a couple of minutes using this the mitt ripped! $20 for a one time use mitt isn&#x27;t worth it to me. My skin did feel soft afterwards though, so I still gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to exfoliate before using Fake Bake &amp; after reading reviews I decided to try this mitt. I regularly use body scrub anyway so I wasn&#x27;t sure how much the mitt would work. I didn&#x27;t get the rolls of skin some reviews talked about but after using my skin did feel softer and I am quite happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice, removes all dead skin without being too abrasive. Wished the opening was a bit wider, as it&#x27;s hard to get your hand inside the mit.</li>
            <li> I almost order a similar product at like double the price then I found this one and read all the great reviews so I order it and it works great. It fits perfect and I am 5&#x27;10 with very large hands for a women. Some said it was small but mine wasn&#x27;t to small at all so Im not sure why they said that maybe they have made it bigger. works great to use before using a sunless tanning lotion,</li>
            <li> Not that great. I thought the price was perfect. It turns out that you get what you pay for. It scrubs ok. It bleeds black dye all over the shower. Just pay the $20 and get the Kae next time.</li>
            <li> This mitt is AMAZING. I ordered it because I&#x27;ve heard they use similar gloves in South Korean bath houses that are super effective. I used it for the first time today and the results were instant and kind of shocking. I&#x27;ve used VERY rough, sand filled bars of soap before and I have never had an exfoliator be able to rub away absolutely ALL of the dead skin on my body like this did. Honestly, the amount of dead skin that I removed was pretty gross- which is awesome because it&#x27;s not on my body anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soaked in the bath with some muddy green bath salts (also available from amazon) for about 15 minutes and then I used the glove. I absolutely love it and you should definitely give it a try if you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliator that will really get the job done.</li>
            <li> Really works well with the Black soap to exfoliate. Glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> This product is great it lasts for a couple months then I order another one.  I like that it is a dark color too doesn&#x27;t look as grimy as ones i have bought before.</li>
            <li> Most of the loofah mitts out there are very wimpy and/or fall apart easily.  I had a loofah mitt for years that stayed the same as the day I bought it.  It was perfect for me but I left it at a hotel on vacation :-(.  I tried other cheaper ones and they weren&#x27;t rough enough for me and a couple fell apart within a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I JUST opened this one, felt it and it is perfect, perfect, perfect.  I just rubbed it on my arm and that was it!!!  I don&#x27;t have to use it in the shower to know it will do exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Just in time for Summer when I need it more.  PAY the price - you&#x27;ll be happy you did.  I bet i lasts as long as my last one and I&#x27;ll keep better track of its whereabouts while on vacation since i go nowhere without my loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, you must like rough and you may not be able to use it everyday if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> This mitt used in conjunction w/ the Moroccan black soap makes your skin smooth and soft.  My skin just glows after using the above products.</li>
