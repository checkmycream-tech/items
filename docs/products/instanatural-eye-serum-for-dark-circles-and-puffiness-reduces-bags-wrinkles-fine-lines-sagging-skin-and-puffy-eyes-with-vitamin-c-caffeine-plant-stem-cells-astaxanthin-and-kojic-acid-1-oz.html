            <li>this company has a lot of really great products that I have tried if you like to put things that are good for you on your skin I would recommend trying anything in their product line</li>

            <li>awake.and bright when I use it under and around them every morning.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the results of this amazing product!</li>
            <li>My eyes look so bright since I&#x27;ve been using for over a week.</li>
            <li>This has a funky bright orange color.  </li>
            <li>I was just going to dab it under my eyes but it smelled and felt so good on my skin</li>

            <li>It seems to be a good product.</li>

            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My wife, who is 52, decided to order this based on all of the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably simply a good moisturizer after cleansing.</li>
            <li>The smell is good</li>
            <li>(good smell can also make you feel good).</li>
            <li>and you get a good amount for the money.  </li>
            <li>Carotenoids are pigment colors that occur in nature and support good health.</li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>It is smell good</li>
            <li>a good result</li>
            <li>I purchased this brands eye cream which is good too.</li>
            <li>If you know anything about what&#x27;s good for your skin this product had it.</li>
            <li>It does have good skincare ingredients</li>
            <li>This serum has a light texture and a wonderful citrus scent.</li>
            <li>Kinda sketchy on the orange color but its o good product.</li>
            <li>so I think this is s good time to start using eye serums.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t feel I can give it a completely fair review just yet.  </li>
            <li>This serum feels great and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li>The eye serum seems to work good.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer followed up with an email to me on instructional use for optimum results with this product.</li>
            <li>but it smells good.  </li>
            <li>but it smells good.</li>
            <li>I get good itemed</li>
            <li>It has a great texture and absorbs into the skin very easily without any sticky residue.</li>
            <li>: the scent was actually very pleasant and so light that it was not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li>It does look orange on the skin which is not the most beautiful thing around eyes or anywhere on the face for that matter.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li>The serum is delicious and It absorbs rt in, wonderful scent, i only wish it came with a pump to prevent oxidation upon each time the bottle is opened.</li>
            <li>The serum is a very bright, orange color, I have a naturally light skin complexion.</li>
            <li>This has done a great job softening my under eye wrinkles &amp; giving my eyes a more youthful and rested look.  </li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Odor is very appealing.  </li>

            <li>For instance, I know that many of the ingredients have benefits that you won&#x27;t see till after 2-3 years of faithful use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bright orange straight out of the bottle, but rubs in/soaks in nicely.  </li>

            <li>I expect them to look even better after extended use.  </li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>

            <li>So glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>

            <li>It smells like orange creamsicles to me. :-)</li>
            <li>I like the InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel much better.</li>
            <li>It seems to absorbs better and has a skin tightening feel the eye serum does not.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it looks, feels, and smells...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks healthier and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>My mother and sister were impressed and decided to switch to several of InstaNatural products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will get better and better.</li>
            <li>I love the citrus scent on this serum.  </li>
            <li>Very excited to start using this.</li>
            <li>so there fore my face is not frozen in time which I love, because that is natural and beautiful to my taste.</li>
            <li>It goes on lightly and spreads very easily.</li>
            <li>When looking for a new skin care routine, one of the things I was concerned about, was making sure that I could return the product if I wasn&#x27;t happy with it.</li>
            <li>This eye serum is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I really loved how this was packaged and it came so fast!</li>
            <li>Really enjoyed it and found it was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The light orange scent is refreshing and not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It feels super great though when you apply it and makes you feel really energized in the morning!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Vitamin rich serums because they are amazing at diminishing the signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too many fine lines yet</li>
            <li>The fine lines under my eyes look a lot better.</li>
            <li>The passionflower gives this serum such a pleasant aroma!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I have noticed a decrease in fine lines and several friends have noticed and commented on how great my skin and eyes look.  </li>
            <li>Awesome, works very well with the Gel, highly recomended</li>
            <li>Great serum to use with Insta Natural Eye Gel at night.</li>
            <li>I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li>At first, I liked this product and used it most every night.</li>
            <li>My skin is more smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Was nicely surprised this product has a great citrus/orange smell and its an orange color.</li>
            <li>I also noticed it helps your concealer/makeup go on more smoothly.  </li>
            <li>This pRoDuct has been great thus far.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this eye serum!</li>
            <li>(good amount for both eyes) and massage gently under the eyes, to absorb it fully.</li>
            <li>We are all beauty guru’s in our own right</li>
            <li>Seems to be very effective so far.</li>
            <li>Other than that, This is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>My wife says it is easy to use and it makes her skin look and feel refreshed and renewed.</li>
            <li>within easily 30 seconds I started to notice a change.</li>
            <li>I love InstaNatural and know a few people that this has worked wonderfully for</li>
            <li>But it smooths easily into the skin, and the orange color goes away.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>

            <li>The smell was nice and fresh, and it absorbed into my under eye area really nice and quickly too.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item at a promotional price and I am happy to share my honest views with others, so hopefully it can help in their decision to buy this product or not, just as I rely on reviews from other people to make my decisions about purchases.</li>

            <li>This product was supplied free to me for product review.</li>
            <li>: I received the eye serum and eye gel for free from BrandBacker for review purposes.</li>
            <li>It is plenty to spread around lightly with my finger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;InstaNatural applies smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>I received the product free for testing and reviewing, but the opinion is 100%</li>

            <li>Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the bright orange color</li>
            <li>I found this eye serum to be effective while still gentle.  </li>
            <li>Such a good price for so many of them</li>
            <li>I love most of Instanatural&#x27;s products, but this one doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>My skin is looking really fantastic using InstaNatural products, so glad to find that the positive reviews are well deserved!</li>
            <li>I wish I could have liked this, as it got other good reviews.</li>
            <li>The company is very nice but the orange stays on my skin so it has to be used only at night.</li>
            <li>This product feels nice and smells good but haven&#x27;t noticed any dark circle lightening.  </li>
            <li>Noticeable changes, particularly if you drink  two liters of water per day, but it also works on its own.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>There was one major drawback for me: the bright orange color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently discovered this amazing brand, InstaNatural!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was excited to offer this product to my mother for her review.</li>
            <li>Astaxanthin is actually a powerful antioxidant!</li>
            <li>For most legitimate products, it takes MONTHS to acquire this many reviews, and even then, everyone has their opinion, and most products do not get a solid 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I am always excited to try eye creams and serums.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvements.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this consistently for a week and have enjoyed seeing my puffy under-eyes tighten up each day.</li>
            <li>I found out that I would have to massage until absorbed and then use a little coconut oil for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with my new find.  </li>
            <li>InstaNatural always has contacted me directly to make sure I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This has helped clear that up pretty nicely!</li>
            <li>While there is a bit of fragrance, I found it to be fairly clean</li>
            <li>A great product all round :-)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>I was a little startled when I first opened the bottle because the serum is a bright, bright orange.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to find products that are natural, truly work, and the company is customer friendly.</li>
            <li>However, these two are specially designed for under eye.  </li>
            <li>Large bottles and work better than the algenist eye balm I was using  plus a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>The color, however, was a bright but quite deep orange which was in keeping with the citrus-y fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this so much.</li>
            <li>the recommended, tried, and true ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I waited a while to review this product, I only have good thing to say about it.</li>
            <li>Dr reccomends topical vitAmin c and from what I know this is good quality vitamin c.</li>
            <li>If you are good about wearing makeup daily</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other then that I would definitely suggest this product to anyone looking for a good eye serum.</li>
            <li>It is safe and gentle.</li>
            <li>View my full review on my blog, ABQ Inspired.</li>
            <li>I definitely will continue to use this product I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>My skin on my face was absolutely transformed by the facial serum, so I am sure this is doing just as much good for the eye area.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need a full dropper full to cover both of your eyes.  </li>
            <li>will follow up when I&#x27;m finished with the product to see what the results truly were upon full usage.</li>
            <li>Large bottle should last a while great deal for the price.</li>
            <li>This stuff seems to work pretty well on the fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs quickly into my skin</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs quickly and hasn’t stained my skin orange, in case that is a concern.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, I have tried so many different types and nothing seems to work.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>states not to rub it in, just pat, but that would leave my lower lids looking super</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs quickly and leaves the eyes soothed.</li>
            <li>Results are quick</li>
            <li>I also have the eye gel which I absolutely love and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This works great for those dark circles under your eyes and the puffiness is gone...</li>
            <li>I noticed a great difference in my dark circles and</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I am very pleased with the results, I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with the instanatural eye serum for dark circles.  </li>
            <li>That helps a great deal with keeping the dark circles and puffiness from your under-eye area.</li>
            <li>Appreciated the friendly email with detailed instructions on how to apply.  </li>
            <li>Overall a pretty good value you for what you get.</li>
            <li>It does claim to have some pretty good ingredients for improving skin texture and overall circulation, but I have yet to see any changes.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit worried about messing up my pillow, but since the serum is absorbed quickly, this did not become an issue.</li>
            <li>This one was pretty unique, too.</li>
            <li>Pat it in lightly until it is absorbed and the bright orange color dissipates (and supposedly counteracts dark circles).  </li>
            <li>Well I was happy to say that is not necessarily true.</li>
            <li>After continued use it really has helped the fine lines around my eyes too.  </li>
            <li>havent noticed too much change in the appearance of fine lines around my eyes, but will continue to use</li>
            <li>No product is a miracle, but this product does a very good job rejuvenating my delicate skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light weight and has a gentle smell.</li>
            <li>This eye serum really goes on smoothly filling in the lines and &#x27;plumping&#x27; them up.</li>
            <li>The packaging is really high-end in an amber glass dropper bottle to protect the ingredients from damaging light.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried many eye serums because I have always been quite apprehensive when it came to putting things in or around my eye area, however, being that this eye serum is natural, I was looking forward to giving it a try</li>
            <li>but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>It is safe to apply near the eyes and has no residue.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been trying all kinds of products to help with that, all with varying degrees of success.  </li>
            <li>but the smell and consistency is nice, color not really a big deal.</li>
            <li>Plus I feel more comfortable using a product with no harmful ingredients such as parabens.</li>
            <li>It feels like having your own personal consultant!</li>
            <li>This serum is quickly absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, there are so many things I like about this product, I am 30 years old</li>
            <li>I will surely be using this as time goes because I do not want wrinkles or crow feet near my eyes.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it enough to keep using it, and that&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Received a complimentary sample and</li>
            <li>There’s nothing better than putting natural ingredients on your skin.</li>
            <li>Love that it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbed immediately; if applied in the morning, I wouldn’t have to wait to put on makeup afterwards.  </li>
            <li>(Shiseido Bioperformance Super Corrective serum first, and then an eye cream or &amp;#34;Elite Serum.</li>
            <li>The orange colored serum has a pleasant hint of citrus fragrance and comes in a dark glass bottle with a dropper applicator.</li>
            <li>I love make-up , electronics , toys for the kids just about really anything I am willing to try, incase a family member wants to know if its worth the price and does it work.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, this is bright orange</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bright orange color due to the astaxanthin.</li>
            <li>works great a little tingly at first</li>
            <li>This product is full of very nourishing ingredients that are very beneficial to your skin, which leave it looking smooth.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super cool and soothing when I apply it as I live in a very hot area.</li>
            <li>helps tighten skin right away</li>
            <li>You can notice a difference right away</li>
            <li>I will ignore and start addressing what ever I can with the right products of course.</li>
            <li>Right after I ordered, the company sent me an email with helpful tips and tricks for how to apply this product.  </li>
            <li>but it does soak right into the skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using the eye serum for a couple of weeks now and have applied it right after taking off my eye make-up at night.</li>
            <li>Great product, works very well on dark circles</li>
            <li>only positive is that it smells nice</li>
            <li>After using the product a few days, I honestly don&#x27;t care what color it is, it works!    </li>
            <li>A little bit more challenging to use than the gel pump version</li>
            <li>So on a Monday morning, I woke up bushy tailed and less than bright eyed.  </li>
            <li>Absorb to my skin so quickly and very hydrating</li>
            <li>It has a great citrus scent and reading the ingredients, I can only assume it&#x27;s the grapefruit essential oil.  </li>
            <li>It makes your eyes feel fresh without being gloppy - InstaNatural isn&#x27;t too thick - great consistency.</li>
            <li>After daily use, it definitely helps, and it&#x27;s a great product for students like me who probably get 10 hours of sleep a week.</li>
            <li>I seem to need less concealer to start the day out with, that&#x27;s always good.</li>
            <li>I was a little surprised when I opened it as it is bright orange!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it is like bright orange and if you don&#x27;t really rub it in then you will have bright orange stains under your eyes.</li>
            <li>Lots of product that is very gentle to my tender eye area</li>
            <li>but I do like it very much.</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s working out fine.  </li>
            <li>My 2 older girls are sorta a hassle when its bed time , but mostly my 8 month old she used to sleep through the night</li>
            <li>Luckily, this anti-oxidant rich formula can be worn under makeup and disguised, but I wouldn’t recommend on bare skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I use it pretty liberally over my chest and neck as well</li>
            <li>It is a brighter colored orange serum and my first thoughts were that it might stain my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with these, these are definitely something to&lt;br /&gt;keep around.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle, not &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; but for the first time in my life I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>but really it can be used all over your face, plus it smells heavenly!</li>
            <li>The first thing you notice with this eye serum would be the color-</li>
            <li>When my wife first moved to Florida from the Philippine, she had to deal with a lot of skin problems.</li>
            <li>I checked the product review first, and I ordered both &amp;#34;InstaNatural Eye Serum</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the caffeine helps it work instantly.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;so&amp;#34; orange that one couldn&#x27;t use it in the daytime - you use it pretty sparingly?</li>
            <li>things first</li>
            <li>I find it very affective!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too !</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>The first time I removed the dropper from the bottle</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>I was kinda scared at first, because it has orange color.</li>
            <li>This is just my opinion, but it seems like most of these reviews are fabricated.  </li>
            <li>This eye serum is another keeper, the color might scare you, but u will love the instant tightening feel.</li>
            <li>At first I was unsure of the color of the product, but found that it does not leave a noticeable tint on my eye area.  </li>
            <li>It actually made my makeup crease more.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a serum for my eyes.</li>
            <li>After washing and toning my face, I applied the serum first.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s color reminded me of carrot juice which instantly made me think healthy.</li>
            <li>At first it feels oily but then dries without any Shine.</li>
            <li>only noticeable difference is my eyes are a bit more</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it and will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li>So with that being said I willing to try just about anything but not everything delivers.</li>
            <li>I actually think my under eye area looks more swollen.  </li>
            <li>and I am not through the first bottle.</li>
            <li>The consistency is pretty runny.  </li>
            <li>I will massage it in for about 1 minute and it absorbs pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty hydrating though, so I will finish the bottle, but not repurchase.</li>
            <li>so it seems to be able to last a while.  </li>
            <li>That was a first for me</li>
            <li>We are continue to use and buy ;)</li>
            <li>As an older adult I have recently begun using InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Eye Serum, and after only two weeks I see remarkable results!  </li>
            <li>This is very easy to apply prior to my normal moisturizing, and has no fragrance.</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
            <li>Its lighentned my dark circles for sure!</li>
            <li>It is a vibrant orange color and smells like fresh squeezed oranges.  </li>
            <li>, however, I can say that my eyes look a lot more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; and refreshed, especially since I don&#x27;t get much sleep often times.</li>
            <li>There is a gorgeous orangey smell, which is delicious…it actually reminds me of some kid’s medicine (Calpol) back in the UK.</li>
            <li>spending hours reading reviews and frustration with the freeloaders who give bogus, looong reviews, neveeeeeer really specifying their personal experience with the notable skin improvements, I thought I might just give it a try and hope for the best&lt;br /&gt;Great product I bought the face serum along with it.</li>
            <li>liked the serum a little more than the cream only because it glides on easier.</li>
            <li>since the reviews are mostly positive am hoping it works.</li>
            <li>It deserves its positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Amazingly it does help help with dark circles, and puffiness.</li>
            <li>The first thing she noticed is that it is really orange.  </li>
            <li>I use this along with the Instanatural eyegel on nights I stay in the house and don&#x27;t necessarily have to wake up early so both products can really work and become effective overnight.</li>
            <li>(the first time I did five drops, so much excess).</li>
            <li>Like it nice product compare it with others but not work well for inherited  dark circle it help to reduce in some way</li>
            <li>I put the serum on in the morning, It does a nice job of hiding my dark circles</li>
            <li>Due to holiday stress I haven&#x27;t been able to get the best sleep, which has caused some dark circles due to lack of sleep.</li>
            <li>but what I do like is that it is light, a little goes a long way, it absorbs very quickly and it doesn&#x27;t feel like its sitting on top of my skin</li>
            <li>I noticed quick results and was so surprised by the difference.  </li>
            <li>Now, after a month of daily use, I&#x27;m back to say I am very pleased with this eye serum.</li>
            <li>The second scent is the smell, as it has rather strong citrus (tangerine or orange?)</li>
            <li>see a little difference not sure yet how great it is but hopefully with more use it will do what it says because my moms want it also</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a believer that certain skin care works for some people and some may not.</li>
            <li>It comes with the little pipette applicator which is pretty cool and allows you to control the amount you use easily.</li>
            <li>Once drop of the serum under the eye is enough and is absorbed quickly by the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ingredients are pretty much all natural which is great because who likes to put chemicals on their delicate skin?</li>
            <li>I was slightly worried about the color of the serum, as it is orange, but it blends in perfectly after a short while, especially once I moisturize.  </li>
            <li>Not only has this serum softened fine lines around my eyes, but also my forehead and around my mouth.</li>
            <li>It is deep orange in color and truly works at smoothing out the fine lines under and around the eyes.</li>
            <li>and I feel that it has definitely helped to soften the fine lines around my outer eye area.</li>
            <li>I use daily, it is not irritating, moisturizes, non greasy, and lessens the darks circles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Pure and perfekt it makes my skin soft and fresh</li>
            <li>This is a great value and you get a lot in the bottle and only need a little bit on each application.  </li>
            <li>I got it because suddenly I have huge bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a great product and as all my skin issues get under control after a few weeks of constant usage, I&#x27;ll post some pictures.</li>
            <li>my eye are looks much more refreshed, smoother, and the fine lines seem to be much less apparent.  </li>
            <li>after a few applications the results are truly amazing.</li>
            <li>I used it on my whole face.</li>
            <li>(it does say it can be used on whole face.)  </li>
            <li>the shipping was lightning fast.  </li>
            <li>It does, however, feel very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I hope I am not expecting too much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as directed for 9 days now and am really beginning to see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I will say it is very orange.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to anyone, men or women, of any age!</li>
            <li>the combination seems to be working really well.  </li>
            <li>scent which I really like.  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference</li>
            <li>Well,  I really like the results I am seeing from using this Instanatural Eye Serum.</li>
            <li>It really makes my eyes feel</li>
            <li>Also very hydrating.</li>
            <li>I applied the serum and my skin turned orange and it felt really sticky.  </li>
            <li>In the morning my skin under my eyes felt much softer.  </li>
            <li>and I figured out I was using way to much</li>
            <li>It really got rid of the circles under my eyes and I look healthier</li>
            <li>and so I can&#x27;t really comment on the effects.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it contains all of the ingredients that really work in an anti-aging eye serum: Vitamins C &amp; E, Kojic acid, Caffeine, Matrixyl 3000, Hyaluronic acid, and Niacinamide.  </li>
            <li>She still uses this product because she likes it so much.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this.</li>
            <li>I will keep use it and see thanks</li>
            <li>So upon receiving a sample, I was really, REALLY hoping this would help with one, or both problems.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d you put too much or if don&#x27;t distribute well.</li>
            <li>Really takes the puffiness away.</li>
            <li>They sound totally canned</li>
            <li>(some people writing up to 5 reviews a day, really?)  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>and my eyes have been really itchy in the mornings</li>
            <li>really like the feel and smell of this serum.</li>
            <li>I really like the follow up emails from the company...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted this to work out for me</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li>so you really can’t tell but some of the time you can see the circles through the make</li>
            <li>Amino Acid Comur really up close.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye serum.  </li>
            <li>InstaNatural is a cruelty free brand and have a big range of products, so do check them out.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Its not sticky unless you put on way to much.</li>
            <li>I really like the InstaNatural product line.</li>
            <li>I felt that I had to really be sparing with it.</li>
            <li>I got to use youth express eye syrum for free simply by agreeing to write a review.</li>
            <li>It was also delivered when promised and very well packaged</li>
            <li>I really like this one</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing....</li>
            <li>Wants you to use it again.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye serum for InstaNatural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough for make up and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I am also applying a few drops around my face, and the results are a nice glow too.</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice dropper so you don&#x27;t have to waste any.  </li>
            <li>- this brightens the skin, helps reduce wrinkles, smells great, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Plus the unique fact that it&#x27;s a serum made to be used around delicate eye area provides the advantage of its quickly and easily absorbed consistency.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a very strong scent and actually is very light and citrus like.</li>
            <li>but this is the first time i can clearly see some results.  </li>
            <li>so I had many dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>love this eye serum, takes away the dark circles</li>
            <li>Well, Insta Natural emailed me asking if I would be interested in trying out 2 of their products.</li>
            <li>The dark circles are also looking much better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect a magic product that will erase my dark circle or wrinkles in a snap, but I like it keeping my eye area well-moisturized during the day and over the night.  </li>
            <li>This works better than any dark circle product i have used.</li>
            <li>the skin shrunk and it&#x27;s moved upward, so my eyes are looking normal and young!!!</li>
            <li>You need to make sure to use this every day and use it with the other product  (the InstaNatural Eye CREAM!)</li>
            <li>This serum is good, I put it on every night before I go to bed (to give the delicate and sensitive skin under my eyes a boost of nourishing ingredients).</li>
            <li>like the product, but the red-ish color needs to be rub in completely as it does have a light red color on the skin if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There really is a small scent to me its more of a flowery scent which does not bother me, I apply the gel on first then my make-up.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried numerous skin creams and lotions, but this is  one of those rare preparations which lives  up  to its promises at a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li>I have recently started using vitamin C based products on my face, and an extremely pleased to add this to my daily regimen.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and you see instant results.</li>
            <li>This serum works as well or better than any of the much more expensive eye serums I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>A week later, I see a tremendous improvement.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product a few weeks ago and I am absolutely loving the improvements so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the long term results.</li>
            <li>I ordered this eye serum right in the middle of the holidays and much to my surprise</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>I am highly recommending this product because it is working for me.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>I need a little more time, but think this is the one for me</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product and other Insta-Natural items.</li>
            <li>That ended up being a good thing because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have normal-dry skin, sometimes sensitive, so I am very cautious of what I put on my face.</li>
            <li>There is a tint of color to the gel which was unexpected, however I really do like it.</li>
            <li>If you use just a few drops, use it at night because your skin does turn orange, I feel you will love the end result.</li>
            <li>After using the it, I&#x27;ve noticed my dark circles have diminished and my eyes look more alive.</li>
            <li>I have tried several products from Instanatural and I Love then brand especially because its all natural.</li>
            <li>I do get bags and puffiness and this does feel really good on tired eyes.  </li>
            <li>It has vitamin c, plant stem cells, hyaluronic acid, caffeine, and other ingredients to help with hydration and fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>, I still see them hardly, I do not botox and</li>
            <li>After using it for 2 weeks, my skin did appear more hydrated and I noticed smoother looking skin w/ no fine lines.</li>
            <li>I would apply by lightly patting it under my eyes and letting it dry completely before adding my makeup.</li>
            <li>When I applied it beneath my eyes, it felt fresh and it dried quickly.</li>
            <li>Identifying your eye issuesâ€”puffiness, dark circles, wrinkles, drynessâ€”is easy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have huge dark spots, but as I&#x27;ve aged it&#x27;s become more apparent that there is some discoloration and sagging.  </li>
            <li>The darkness around my eyes is finally starting to lessen and the fine lines are starting to disappear.</li>
            <li>This serum is not greasy, but very hydrated I use one drop as the last step of my skin care routin, pat it on under my eye, continue to lightly pat it until almost dry.</li>
            <li>I may look around and especially since I am currently detoxing from a mercury toxicity, I thought maybe not to rush into spending the huge amount and find alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
            <li>Have noticed with every application the fine lines,  wrinkles softening, and puffiness around my eyes go down.  </li>
            <li>But, my skin must be very sensitive, for after 5-6 nights, the skin under my eyes became irritated.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft after using.  </li>
            <li>All their products are packed with high percentage and power natural ingredients that is food for the skin.</li>
            <li>Does make the skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have huge dark circle problems, so I can&#x27;t attest to that -</li>
            <li>Since I first started using eye creams in my skincare routine, about 5 years ago, I had yet to discover a product which actually delivered any impacting results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and I DON&#x27;T have any orange colors around my eyes, that&#x27;s why I make sure I have a small amount applied.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think one actually works better than the other.</li>
            <li>So my picture is only 12 days apart, while also using other InstaNatural products :)</li>
            <li>Organic and natural, ace quality ingredients, this is literally elixir in a bottle!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased a beauty product and noticed obvious results.</li>
            <li>The first time I opened the bottle of eye gel last week, I was nervous!</li>
            <li>My face is even smoother and lines around my mouth and eyes are nearly gone!</li>
            <li>For this price, it works better for me than the department store products I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>I used to use this product once daily but due to the remarkable improvement in my dark under eye circles I am now using it three to four times a week in rotation with the youth express eye gel from instanatural.</li>
            <li>I have seen fantastic results with this product and my dark circles are nearly undetectable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still waiting to see about my dark circles, but overall I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>my fine lines around the eye area have been fading a little.</li>
            <li>After finished one bottle of Eye Serum, I didn&#x27;t see significant improvement for dark circle after one month, but somehow, I like the feeling after put it on.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more when I finish this, which may be a long time from now.&amp;#34; A little goes a long way&amp;#34; is true for this product.</li>
            <li>and I think this product can help do that since its packed full of vitamins and other ingredients formulated to do that.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have bought a product and used it for less than a week because it had such adverse effects on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Rather use something that I know will improve my skin over time and prevent further damage than to use something that gives quick results with lasting damage.  </li>
            <li>the bottle is quite large for an eye product and should last a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously noticing a positive change…less puffiness and seems to address my fine lines around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments lately about how young I look....  </li>
            <li>I prefer this one by far over the cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend but just understand if you only use it once a day as I do it may take as much as 45 days to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is so so soft.</li>
            <li>But I guess the serum must get it’s orange coloring from the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I have a two year old</li>
            <li>I am 23 and had shadows because I&#x27;ve been on the midnight shift for a while &amp; this fixed it.</li>
            <li>Also use the eye gel along with the serum and have notice a considerable change.</li>
            <li>Makes the skin around my eyes feel soft.</li>
            <li>my under eyes are naturally sunken in and my skin can look a bit saggy</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive to chemicals</li>
            <li>I received this to review and am liking it so far.</li>
            <li>the Insta Natural Youth Express Eye Serum is the answer for it is.</li>
            <li>May be the color came from the natural ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li>young at heart, who doesn’t want to feel or look that way.</li>
            <li>Causes no irritation on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I only use it at night where no one see me as much.</li>
            <li>You only need a drop, anymore than that is too much (from experience).</li>
            <li>I recently fell crazy in love with the InstaNatural Vitamin C serum for face, so I was pleased to also get to try this formula for the eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already seeing marked improvement in wrinkles and puffiness.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far I can say I like it</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t notice any orange residue near my eyes.</li>
            <li>I recently started developing wrinkle around my eyes and this has really helped make them not noticeable.</li>
            <li>It does not bother my sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li>I’ve only been using it a few days, but love how it helps my eyes look less-tired in the morning.</li>
            <li>only been using it a few days, but love how it helps my eyes look less-tired in the morning.</li>
            <li>I am very happy and will continue using to see the long term effects on my tired dark circles.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever try eye serum, previously I have always been using eye cream, so as everyone knows, some eye cream can be really greasy</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product, then I read the reviews, curious by the solid 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>One around my left eye and left side of my forehead, then the other for around my right eye and right side of my forehead.</li>
            <li>I do not have dark circles so can&#x27;t speak for that, but the fine lines around my eyes are definitely improving with use.  </li>
            <li>I actually am going to get a bottle for my mother in law, this should be in every young women and older women’s beauty cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually am going to get a bottle for my mother in law, this should be in every young women and older women’s beauty cabinet.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for a few months, haven&#x27;t seen any significant results.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change the first few days.</li>
            <li>Bags and dark circles have almost disappeared with in the first weeks use!</li>
            <li>works JUST AS WELL as the grossly overpriced eye serum sold in the malls (those two mall stores with hip-dressed-in-black high pressure sales people.).</li>
            <li>The serum has a very clean citrus smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used for a few weeks so far, but the fine lines seems to be diminishing</li>
            <li>This had made a big difference in the fine lines around my eyes, and my dark circles are a bit lighter too!</li>
            <li>I use morning and night and wake up to younger looking and refreshed eyes even when I don&#x27;t get a full night sleep due to being up at night with my baby.</li>
            <li>I am still only a few days in, I will check back in with more results.</li>
            <li>Over the past few years, I haven&#x27;t been getting very good sleep due to medical conditions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a difference in the short time I used it, especially lessening my dark circles and fine</li>
            <li>I have very creppy, dry under eye skin.</li>
            <li>the texture is not my favorite or perhaps the way it comes out on the dropper you could waste allot so be careful.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is surprisingly thick, which made for an easy application to my skin.</li>
            <li>NOT safe for sensitive skin!!!!!!</li>
            <li>These two came in packages similar to the store and was very professional.  </li>
            <li>The orange color is a little off putting at first, but it blends away!</li>
            <li>My initial reaction when I opened the tube was, “wow, it’s orange!”.</li>
            <li>My major concern is &amp;#34;dark circle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Now, since I don&#x27;t have any obvious eye issues to speak of, I am a little more limited about what I can say for this product.</li>
            <li>My older daughter told her that she looks like a vampire when it is on - with the strange orange glow under her eyes.  </li>
            <li>I can see fine line around my eyes slowly disappear</li>
            <li>My eyes are still a little puffy, but they look fresh.</li>
            <li>It seemed to help with the little lines around my eyes when I smile or squint.</li>
            <li>The consistency of this one is better and I have noticed a slight difference/improvement in wrinkles and less puffiness around my eyes after over a month 1/2 of use.  </li>
            <li>The product is smooth and not sticky and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The first time I put it around my eyes, I was a little surprised that it felt &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;, but I guess that is how it works.  </li>
            <li>I have a little puffiness I am dealing with, but it is a medical issue and I am not shocked to see no change there.</li>
            <li>The puffiness is a little less noticable, but I haven&#x27;t really paid attention to how it is working on fine lines yet, I just starting using it.  </li>
            <li>Great product and doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid of the bright orange substance you are about to rub underneath your eyes...</li>
            <li>Products that I received generally do what it promises.</li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to really appreciate what it does</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t be too surprised about that when you open it!</li>
            <li>In closing, niacinamide and kojic acid act as skin-lightening agents, which are intended to lighten those dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rest assured that I will absolutely be purchasing this serum again when this bottle runs out!</li>
            <li>Ever since using this product I haven&#x27;t had dark circles or much puffiness!  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy whatsoever and is not something that requires multiple applications!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the serum for a couple weeks so far.</li>
            <li>Dark circles are much lighter and my skin is tighter and firmer!</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Dark circles are much lighter and my skin is tighter and firmer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying and noticed a difference in my tired eyes.</li>
            <li>and I doubt it&#x27;s a coincidence that several new reviews are posted on a DAILY basis!?</li>
            <li>I feel like my eyes look less tired and bright.</li>
            <li>I just turned 42 and the 6 other expensive serums were no longer effective, In fact not sure they ever were, but they came with huge claims and raves and a considerable price tag,.</li>
            <li>This serum would last for a LONG time, you really need to put just a tiny bit, because of the are under the eyes</li>
            <li>I t does or must be followed by a rich moisturizer, or at least for the over 40&#x27;s crowd, .</li>
            <li>The active ingredients minimize the appearance of puffiness, dark circles, and fine lines instantly.</li>
            <li>It did not do any good: irritating, messy, orange stuff.</li>
            <li>A little bit of this stuff goes a long way, and I&#x27;ve found that it absorbs into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>it still feels a little sticky, but not like the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I think the earlier the better, maybe we can slow them down if we start early.</li>
            <li>It really helped to hide the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with dark circles under my eyes my whole life.</li>
            <li>It feels like my skin is tightening almost immediately, and I have not noticed the dark shadows under my eyes nearly as much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple months and it got rid of the puffiness under my eyes, but didn&#x27;t do much for the dark circles.</li>
            <li>I felt that the orange color didn&#x27;t do much for the dark circles.</li>
            <li>It does have a very orange color to it, but like another review stated, the orange color helps cover those dark purple circles.</li>
            <li>The serum has a long list of anti-aging components in it and all these ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received and reviewed a few facial skin care products lately that I really liked.  </li>
            <li>You want to keep the stuff in fridge also because vitamin c properties will break down fast if not kept.</li>
            <li>I have very dark circles and fine lines and after a week and a half of using it</li>
            <li>and I want to stay young for a very long time.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t see any results right after, if you are looking for instant results or change in your look, check elsewhere, so I guess I have to go along within 2 months to see if anything changes, especially my dark circles - NO help with that so far, I have been using for weeks and only at night.</li>
            <li>It has an orangey-red color with a slight citrusy scent, but you can&#x27;t really smell it once it is on your skin.</li>
            <li>The Eye Serum definitely feels like it has lightened and tightened the skin under and around my eyes, but the dark orange color can give your skin an orange shade if you put too much on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t necessary use it for any other part of my face, I mainly focus on my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li>Firm the upper eye area and minimize the look of redness and dark circles by replenishing free radical-fighting.</li>
            <li>Really helps with dark circles!</li>
            <li>I received a discount for this product in return for my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>

            <li> My wife, who is 52, decided to order this based on all of the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably simply a good moisturizer after cleansing.</li>
            <li> The smell is good</li>
            <li> (good smell can also make you feel good).</li>
            <li> and you get a good amount for the money.  </li>
            <li> Carotenoids are pigment colors that occur in nature and support good health.</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> It is smell good</li>
            <li> a good result</li>
            <li> I purchased this brands eye cream which is good too.</li>

            <li> It does have good skincare ingredients</li>
            <li> This serum has a light texture and a wonderful citrus scent.</li>
            <li> Kinda sketchy on the orange color but its o good product.</li>
            <li> so I think this is s good time to start using eye serums.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel I can give it a completely fair review just yet.  </li>

            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not the most convenient thing to use.</li>

            <li> The light orange scent is refreshing and not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It feels super great though when you apply it and makes you feel really energized in the morning!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Vitamin rich serums because they are amazing at diminishing the signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have too many fine lines yet</li>
            <li> The fine lines under my eyes look a lot better.</li>
            <li> The passionflower gives this serum such a pleasant aroma!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I have noticed a decrease in fine lines and several friends have noticed and commented on how great my skin and eyes look.  </li>
            <li> Awesome, works very well with the Gel, highly recomended</li>
            <li> Great serum to use with Insta Natural Eye Gel at night.</li>
            <li> I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> At first, I liked this product and used it most every night.</li>
            <li> My skin is more smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Was nicely surprised this product has a great citrus/orange smell and its an orange color.</li>
            <li> I also noticed it helps your concealer/makeup go on more smoothly.  </li>
            <li> This pRoDuct has been great thus far.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this eye serum!</li>
            <li> (good amount for both eyes) and massage gently under the eyes, to absorb it fully.</li>
            <li> We are all beauty guru’s in our own right</li>
            <li> Seems to be very effective so far.</li>
            <li> Other than that, This is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> My wife says it is easy to use and it makes her skin look and feel refreshed and renewed.</li>
            <li> within easily 30 seconds I started to notice a change.</li>
            <li> I love InstaNatural and know a few people that this has worked wonderfully for</li>
            <li> But it smooths easily into the skin, and the orange color goes away.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Not yet used to the Orange color but easy application around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Good&lt;br /&gt;Ship is very quick</li>
            <li> using on undereyes &amp; top lip @ night...so far so good</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell was nice and fresh, and it absorbed into my under eye area really nice and quickly too.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item at a promotional price and I am happy to share my honest views with others, so hopefully it can help in their decision to buy this product or not, just as I rely on reviews from other people to make my decisions about purchases.</li>
            <li> For Dark Circles&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;InstaNatural THE BEST Eye Cream For Dark...&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I like to use something for a full month because I find I see more results.  </li>
            <li> Being that I am still in my 20&#x27;s, I don&#x27;t have an issue with fine lines or wrinkles, so I can&#x27;t contest to that fact</li>
            <li> Which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li> If you rub the product in, you are fine.</li>
            <li> AWESOME definitely less puffiness around eyes.</li>
            <li> Now that I am 51, I also have fine lines and puffiness from time to time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has helped with the fine lines</li>
            <li> My fine lines are disappearing with each use.</li>
            <li> I notice the fine lines under my eye is lighter, I will recommend this to friends n families</li>
            <li> Though it says to reduce wrinkles and fine lines too</li>
            <li> and I have noticed no change to any darkness, fine lines, or bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Also reduced fine lines in my forehead.</li>

            <li> Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed quickly, and I really liked this product.</li>

            <li> and it had made a huge difference in my under eye wrinkles which is one of my problem areas</li>
            <li> a night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller offered this product free or nearly free in order for my review.</li>
            <li> This product was provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> She tried the product last night and she was happy that their was no irritation.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, just a nighttime only thing for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay orange if you lightly pat it in to your skin.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the bright orange color of this product.  </li>

            <li> This product was supplied free to me for product review.</li>
            <li> : I received the eye serum and eye gel for free from BrandBacker for review purposes.</li>
            <li> It is plenty to spread around lightly with my finger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;InstaNatural applies smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> I received the product free for testing and reviewing, but the opinion is 100%</li>
            <li> This eye serum is fantastic because it does reduce some puffiness.</li>
            <li> I used it under my eyes at night and it didn&#x27;t irritate or bother my skin which is important to me.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an eye gel I have my eyes on too, but for now I recommend this product, which is available on Amazon.</li>

            <li> Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the bright orange color</li>
            <li> I found this eye serum to be effective while still gentle.  </li>
            <li> Such a good price for so many of them</li>
            <li> I love most of Instanatural&#x27;s products, but this one doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> My skin is looking really fantastic using InstaNatural products, so glad to find that the positive reviews are well deserved!</li>
            <li> I wish I could have liked this, as it got other good reviews.</li>
            <li> The company is very nice but the orange stays on my skin so it has to be used only at night.</li>
            <li> This product feels nice and smells good but haven&#x27;t noticed any dark circle lightening.  </li>
            <li> Noticeable changes, particularly if you drink  two liters of water per day, but it also works on its own.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> There was one major drawback for me: the bright orange color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered this amazing brand, InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was excited to offer this product to my mother for her review.</li>
            <li> Astaxanthin is actually a powerful antioxidant!</li>
            <li> For most legitimate products, it takes MONTHS to acquire this many reviews, and even then, everyone has their opinion, and most products do not get a solid 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I am always excited to try eye creams and serums.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this consistently for a week and have enjoyed seeing my puffy under-eyes tighten up each day.</li>
            <li> I found out that I would have to massage until absorbed and then use a little coconut oil for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with my new find.  </li>
            <li> InstaNatural always has contacted me directly to make sure I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This has helped clear that up pretty nicely!</li>
            <li> While there is a bit of fragrance, I found it to be fairly clean</li>
            <li> A great product all round :-)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh, but not too strong.</li>
            <li> I was a little startled when I first opened the bottle because the serum is a bright, bright orange.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to find products that are natural, truly work, and the company is customer friendly.</li>
            <li> However, these two are specially designed for under eye.  </li>
            <li> Large bottles and work better than the algenist eye balm I was using  plus a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> The color, however, was a bright but quite deep orange which was in keeping with the citrus-y fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this so much.</li>
            <li> the recommended, tried, and true ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I waited a while to review this product, I only have good thing to say about it.</li>
            <li> Dr reccomends topical vitAmin c and from what I know this is good quality vitamin c.</li>
            <li> If you are good about wearing makeup daily</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other then that I would definitely suggest this product to anyone looking for a good eye serum.</li>
            <li> It is safe and gentle.</li>
            <li> View my full review on my blog, ABQ Inspired.</li>
            <li> I definitely will continue to use this product I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> My skin on my face was absolutely transformed by the facial serum, so I am sure this is doing just as much good for the eye area.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need a full dropper full to cover both of your eyes.  </li>
            <li> will follow up when I&#x27;m finished with the product to see what the results truly were upon full usage.</li>
            <li> Large bottle should last a while great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work pretty well on the fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs quickly into my skin</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs quickly and hasn’t stained my skin orange, in case that is a concern.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, I have tried so many different types and nothing seems to work.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> states not to rub it in, just pat, but that would leave my lower lids looking super</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs quickly and leaves the eyes soothed.</li>
            <li> Results are quick</li>
            <li> I also have the eye gel which I absolutely love and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This works great for those dark circles under your eyes and the puffiness is gone...</li>
            <li> I noticed a great difference in my dark circles and</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I am very pleased with the results, I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the instanatural eye serum for dark circles.  </li>
            <li> That helps a great deal with keeping the dark circles and puffiness from your under-eye area.</li>
            <li> Appreciated the friendly email with detailed instructions on how to apply.  </li>
            <li> Overall a pretty good value you for what you get.</li>
            <li> It does claim to have some pretty good ingredients for improving skin texture and overall circulation, but I have yet to see any changes.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about messing up my pillow, but since the serum is absorbed quickly, this did not become an issue.</li>
            <li> This one was pretty unique, too.</li>
            <li> Pat it in lightly until it is absorbed and the bright orange color dissipates (and supposedly counteracts dark circles).  </li>
            <li> Well I was happy to say that is not necessarily true.</li>
            <li> After continued use it really has helped the fine lines around my eyes too.  </li>
            <li> havent noticed too much change in the appearance of fine lines around my eyes, but will continue to use</li>
            <li> No product is a miracle, but this product does a very good job rejuvenating my delicate skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light weight and has a gentle smell.</li>
            <li> This eye serum really goes on smoothly filling in the lines and &#x27;plumping&#x27; them up.</li>
            <li> The packaging is really high-end in an amber glass dropper bottle to protect the ingredients from damaging light.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many eye serums because I have always been quite apprehensive when it came to putting things in or around my eye area, however, being that this eye serum is natural, I was looking forward to giving it a try</li>
            <li> but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> It is safe to apply near the eyes and has no residue.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been trying all kinds of products to help with that, all with varying degrees of success.  </li>
            <li> but the smell and consistency is nice, color not really a big deal.</li>
            <li> Plus I feel more comfortable using a product with no harmful ingredients such as parabens.</li>
            <li> It feels like having your own personal consultant!</li>
            <li> This serum is quickly absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, there are so many things I like about this product, I am 30 years old</li>
            <li> I will surely be using this as time goes because I do not want wrinkles or crow feet near my eyes.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it enough to keep using it, and that&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> Received a complimentary sample and</li>
            <li> There’s nothing better than putting natural ingredients on your skin.</li>
            <li> Love that it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbed immediately; if applied in the morning, I wouldn’t have to wait to put on makeup afterwards.  </li>
            <li> (Shiseido Bioperformance Super Corrective serum first, and then an eye cream or &amp;#34;Elite Serum.</li>
            <li> The orange colored serum has a pleasant hint of citrus fragrance and comes in a dark glass bottle with a dropper applicator.</li>
            <li> I love make-up , electronics , toys for the kids just about really anything I am willing to try, incase a family member wants to know if its worth the price and does it work.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, this is bright orange</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bright orange color due to the astaxanthin.</li>
            <li> works great a little tingly at first</li>
            <li> This product is full of very nourishing ingredients that are very beneficial to your skin, which leave it looking smooth.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super cool and soothing when I apply it as I live in a very hot area.</li>
            <li> helps tighten skin right away</li>
            <li> You can notice a difference right away</li>
            <li> I will ignore and start addressing what ever I can with the right products of course.</li>
            <li> Right after I ordered, the company sent me an email with helpful tips and tricks for how to apply this product.  </li>
            <li> but it does soak right into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye serum for a couple of weeks now and have applied it right after taking off my eye make-up at night.</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well on dark circles</li>
            <li> only positive is that it smells nice</li>
            <li> After using the product a few days, I honestly don&#x27;t care what color it is, it works!    </li>
            <li> A little bit more challenging to use than the gel pump version</li>
            <li> So on a Monday morning, I woke up bushy tailed and less than bright eyed.  </li>
            <li> Absorb to my skin so quickly and very hydrating</li>
            <li> It has a great citrus scent and reading the ingredients, I can only assume it&#x27;s the grapefruit essential oil.  </li>
            <li> It makes your eyes feel fresh without being gloppy - InstaNatural isn&#x27;t too thick - great consistency.</li>
            <li> After daily use, it definitely helps, and it&#x27;s a great product for students like me who probably get 10 hours of sleep a week.</li>
            <li> I seem to need less concealer to start the day out with, that&#x27;s always good.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised when I opened it as it is bright orange!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is like bright orange and if you don&#x27;t really rub it in then you will have bright orange stains under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Lots of product that is very gentle to my tender eye area</li>
            <li> but I do like it very much.</li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s working out fine.  </li>
            <li> My 2 older girls are sorta a hassle when its bed time , but mostly my 8 month old she used to sleep through the night</li>
            <li> Luckily, this anti-oxidant rich formula can be worn under makeup and disguised, but I wouldn’t recommend on bare skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I use it pretty liberally over my chest and neck as well</li>
            <li> It is a brighter colored orange serum and my first thoughts were that it might stain my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these, these are definitely something to&lt;br /&gt;keep around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle, not &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; but for the first time in my life I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> but really it can be used all over your face, plus it smells heavenly!</li>
            <li> The first thing you notice with this eye serum would be the color-</li>
            <li> When my wife first moved to Florida from the Philippine, she had to deal with a lot of skin problems.</li>
            <li> I checked the product review first, and I ordered both &amp;#34;InstaNatural Eye Serum</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the caffeine helps it work instantly.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;so&amp;#34; orange that one couldn&#x27;t use it in the daytime - you use it pretty sparingly?</li>
            <li> things first</li>
            <li> I find it very affective!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too !</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> The first time I removed the dropper from the bottle</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I was kinda scared at first, because it has orange color.</li>
            <li> This is just my opinion, but it seems like most of these reviews are fabricated.  </li>
            <li> This eye serum is another keeper, the color might scare you, but u will love the instant tightening feel.</li>
            <li> At first I was unsure of the color of the product, but found that it does not leave a noticeable tint on my eye area.  </li>
            <li> It actually made my makeup crease more.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a serum for my eyes.</li>
            <li> After washing and toning my face, I applied the serum first.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s color reminded me of carrot juice which instantly made me think healthy.</li>
            <li> At first it feels oily but then dries without any Shine.</li>
            <li> only noticeable difference is my eyes are a bit more</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it and will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> So with that being said I willing to try just about anything but not everything delivers.</li>
            <li> I actually think my under eye area looks more swollen.  </li>
            <li> and I am not through the first bottle.</li>
            <li> The consistency is pretty runny.  </li>
            <li> I will massage it in for about 1 minute and it absorbs pretty well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty hydrating though, so I will finish the bottle, but not repurchase.</li>
            <li> so it seems to be able to last a while.  </li>
            <li> That was a first for me</li>
            <li> We are continue to use and buy ;)</li>
            <li> As an older adult I have recently begun using InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Eye Serum, and after only two weeks I see remarkable results!  </li>
            <li> This is very easy to apply prior to my normal moisturizing, and has no fragrance.</li>
            <li> My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
            <li> Its lighentned my dark circles for sure!</li>
            <li> It is a vibrant orange color and smells like fresh squeezed oranges.  </li>
            <li> , however, I can say that my eyes look a lot more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; and refreshed, especially since I don&#x27;t get much sleep often times.</li>
            <li> There is a gorgeous orangey smell, which is delicious…it actually reminds me of some kid’s medicine (Calpol) back in the UK.</li>
            <li> spending hours reading reviews and frustration with the freeloaders who give bogus, looong reviews, neveeeeeer really specifying their personal experience with the notable skin improvements, I thought I might just give it a try and hope for the best&lt;br /&gt;Great product I bought the face serum along with it.</li>
            <li> liked the serum a little more than the cream only because it glides on easier.</li>
            <li> since the reviews are mostly positive am hoping it works.</li>
            <li> It deserves its positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Amazingly it does help help with dark circles, and puffiness.</li>
            <li> The first thing she noticed is that it is really orange.  </li>
            <li> I use this along with the Instanatural eyegel on nights I stay in the house and don&#x27;t necessarily have to wake up early so both products can really work and become effective overnight.</li>
            <li> (the first time I did five drops, so much excess).</li>
            <li> Like it nice product compare it with others but not work well for inherited  dark circle it help to reduce in some way</li>
            <li> I put the serum on in the morning, It does a nice job of hiding my dark circles</li>
            <li> Due to holiday stress I haven&#x27;t been able to get the best sleep, which has caused some dark circles due to lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> but what I do like is that it is light, a little goes a long way, it absorbs very quickly and it doesn&#x27;t feel like its sitting on top of my skin</li>
            <li> I noticed quick results and was so surprised by the difference.  </li>
            <li> Now, after a month of daily use, I&#x27;m back to say I am very pleased with this eye serum.</li>
            <li> The second scent is the smell, as it has rather strong citrus (tangerine or orange?)</li>
            <li> see a little difference not sure yet how great it is but hopefully with more use it will do what it says because my moms want it also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer that certain skin care works for some people and some may not.</li>
            <li> It comes with the little pipette applicator which is pretty cool and allows you to control the amount you use easily.</li>
            <li> Once drop of the serum under the eye is enough and is absorbed quickly by the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ingredients are pretty much all natural which is great because who likes to put chemicals on their delicate skin?</li>
            <li> I was slightly worried about the color of the serum, as it is orange, but it blends in perfectly after a short while, especially once I moisturize.  </li>
            <li> Not only has this serum softened fine lines around my eyes, but also my forehead and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> It is deep orange in color and truly works at smoothing out the fine lines under and around the eyes.</li>
            <li> and I feel that it has definitely helped to soften the fine lines around my outer eye area.</li>
            <li> I use daily, it is not irritating, moisturizes, non greasy, and lessens the darks circles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> Pure and perfekt it makes my skin soft and fresh</li>
            <li> This is a great value and you get a lot in the bottle and only need a little bit on each application.  </li>
            <li> I got it because suddenly I have huge bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a great product and as all my skin issues get under control after a few weeks of constant usage, I&#x27;ll post some pictures.</li>
            <li> my eye are looks much more refreshed, smoother, and the fine lines seem to be much less apparent.  </li>
            <li> after a few applications the results are truly amazing.</li>
            <li> I used it on my whole face.</li>
            <li> (it does say it can be used on whole face.)  </li>
            <li> the shipping was lightning fast.  </li>
            <li> It does, however, feel very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I hope I am not expecting too much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as directed for 9 days now and am really beginning to see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I will say it is very orange.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to anyone, men or women, of any age!</li>
            <li> the combination seems to be working really well.  </li>
            <li> scent which I really like.  </li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference</li>
            <li> Well,  I really like the results I am seeing from using this Instanatural Eye Serum.</li>
            <li> It really makes my eyes feel</li>
            <li> Also very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I applied the serum and my skin turned orange and it felt really sticky.  </li>
            <li> In the morning my skin under my eyes felt much softer.  </li>
            <li> and I figured out I was using way to much</li>
            <li> It really got rid of the circles under my eyes and I look healthier</li>
            <li> and so I can&#x27;t really comment on the effects.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it contains all of the ingredients that really work in an anti-aging eye serum: Vitamins C &amp; E, Kojic acid, Caffeine, Matrixyl 3000, Hyaluronic acid, and Niacinamide.  </li>
            <li> She still uses this product because she likes it so much.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this.</li>
            <li> I will keep use it and see thanks</li>
            <li> So upon receiving a sample, I was really, REALLY hoping this would help with one, or both problems.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d you put too much or if don&#x27;t distribute well.</li>
            <li> Really takes the puffiness away.</li>
            <li> They sound totally canned</li>
            <li> (some people writing up to 5 reviews a day, really?)  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> and my eyes have been really itchy in the mornings</li>
            <li> really like the feel and smell of this serum.</li>
            <li> I really like the follow up emails from the company...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted this to work out for me</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> so you really can’t tell but some of the time you can see the circles through the make</li>
            <li> Amino Acid Comur really up close.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye serum.  </li>
            <li> InstaNatural is a cruelty free brand and have a big range of products, so do check them out.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Its not sticky unless you put on way to much.</li>
            <li> I really like the InstaNatural product line.</li>
            <li> I felt that I had to really be sparing with it.</li>
            <li> I got to use youth express eye syrum for free simply by agreeing to write a review.</li>
            <li> It was also delivered when promised and very well packaged</li>
            <li> I really like this one</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing....</li>
            <li> Wants you to use it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye serum for InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough for make up and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I am also applying a few drops around my face, and the results are a nice glow too.</li>
            <li> It comes with a nice dropper so you don&#x27;t have to waste any.  </li>
            <li> - this brightens the skin, helps reduce wrinkles, smells great, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Plus the unique fact that it&#x27;s a serum made to be used around delicate eye area provides the advantage of its quickly and easily absorbed consistency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very strong scent and actually is very light and citrus like.</li>
            <li> but this is the first time i can clearly see some results.  </li>
            <li> so I had many dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> love this eye serum, takes away the dark circles</li>
            <li> Well, Insta Natural emailed me asking if I would be interested in trying out 2 of their products.</li>
            <li> The dark circles are also looking much better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a magic product that will erase my dark circle or wrinkles in a snap, but I like it keeping my eye area well-moisturized during the day and over the night.  </li>
            <li> This works better than any dark circle product i have used.</li>
            <li> the skin shrunk and it&#x27;s moved upward, so my eyes are looking normal and young!!!</li>
            <li> You need to make sure to use this every day and use it with the other product  (the InstaNatural Eye CREAM!)</li>
            <li> This serum is good, I put it on every night before I go to bed (to give the delicate and sensitive skin under my eyes a boost of nourishing ingredients).</li>
            <li> like the product, but the red-ish color needs to be rub in completely as it does have a light red color on the skin if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There really is a small scent to me its more of a flowery scent which does not bother me, I apply the gel on first then my make-up.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried numerous skin creams and lotions, but this is  one of those rare preparations which lives  up  to its promises at a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li> I have recently started using vitamin C based products on my face, and an extremely pleased to add this to my daily regimen.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and you see instant results.</li>
            <li> This serum works as well or better than any of the much more expensive eye serums I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> A week later, I see a tremendous improvement.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago and I am absolutely loving the improvements so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this eye serum right in the middle of the holidays and much to my surprise</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am highly recommending this product because it is working for me.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> I need a little more time, but think this is the one for me</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product and other Insta-Natural items.</li>
            <li> That ended up being a good thing because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have normal-dry skin, sometimes sensitive, so I am very cautious of what I put on my face.</li>
            <li> There is a tint of color to the gel which was unexpected, however I really do like it.</li>
            <li> If you use just a few drops, use it at night because your skin does turn orange, I feel you will love the end result.</li>
            <li> After using the it, I&#x27;ve noticed my dark circles have diminished and my eyes look more alive.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products from Instanatural and I Love then brand especially because its all natural.</li>
            <li> I do get bags and puffiness and this does feel really good on tired eyes.  </li>
            <li> It has vitamin c, plant stem cells, hyaluronic acid, caffeine, and other ingredients to help with hydration and fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> , I still see them hardly, I do not botox and</li>
            <li> After using it for 2 weeks, my skin did appear more hydrated and I noticed smoother looking skin w/ no fine lines.</li>
            <li> I would apply by lightly patting it under my eyes and letting it dry completely before adding my makeup.</li>
            <li> When I applied it beneath my eyes, it felt fresh and it dried quickly.</li>
            <li> Identifying your eye issuesâ€”puffiness, dark circles, wrinkles, drynessâ€”is easy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have huge dark spots, but as I&#x27;ve aged it&#x27;s become more apparent that there is some discoloration and sagging.  </li>
            <li> The darkness around my eyes is finally starting to lessen and the fine lines are starting to disappear.</li>
            <li> This serum is not greasy, but very hydrated I use one drop as the last step of my skin care routin, pat it on under my eye, continue to lightly pat it until almost dry.</li>
            <li> I may look around and especially since I am currently detoxing from a mercury toxicity, I thought maybe not to rush into spending the huge amount and find alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
            <li> Have noticed with every application the fine lines,  wrinkles softening, and puffiness around my eyes go down.  </li>
            <li> But, my skin must be very sensitive, for after 5-6 nights, the skin under my eyes became irritated.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft after using.  </li>
            <li> All their products are packed with high percentage and power natural ingredients that is food for the skin.</li>
            <li> Does make the skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have huge dark circle problems, so I can&#x27;t attest to that -</li>
            <li> Since I first started using eye creams in my skincare routine, about 5 years ago, I had yet to discover a product which actually delivered any impacting results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and I DON&#x27;T have any orange colors around my eyes, that&#x27;s why I make sure I have a small amount applied.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think one actually works better than the other.</li>
            <li> So my picture is only 12 days apart, while also using other InstaNatural products :)</li>
            <li> Organic and natural, ace quality ingredients, this is literally elixir in a bottle!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased a beauty product and noticed obvious results.</li>
            <li> The first time I opened the bottle of eye gel last week, I was nervous!</li>
            <li> My face is even smoother and lines around my mouth and eyes are nearly gone!</li>
            <li> For this price, it works better for me than the department store products I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product once daily but due to the remarkable improvement in my dark under eye circles I am now using it three to four times a week in rotation with the youth express eye gel from instanatural.</li>
            <li> I have seen fantastic results with this product and my dark circles are nearly undetectable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting to see about my dark circles, but overall I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> my fine lines around the eye area have been fading a little.</li>
            <li> After finished one bottle of Eye Serum, I didn&#x27;t see significant improvement for dark circle after one month, but somehow, I like the feeling after put it on.</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase more when I finish this, which may be a long time from now.&amp;#34; A little goes a long way&amp;#34; is true for this product.</li>
            <li> and I think this product can help do that since its packed full of vitamins and other ingredients formulated to do that.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have bought a product and used it for less than a week because it had such adverse effects on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Rather use something that I know will improve my skin over time and prevent further damage than to use something that gives quick results with lasting damage.  </li>
            <li> the bottle is quite large for an eye product and should last a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously noticing a positive change…less puffiness and seems to address my fine lines around the eye area.  </li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments lately about how young I look....  </li>
            <li> I prefer this one by far over the cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend but just understand if you only use it once a day as I do it may take as much as 45 days to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is so so soft.</li>
            <li> But I guess the serum must get it’s orange coloring from the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I have a two year old</li>
            <li> I am 23 and had shadows because I&#x27;ve been on the midnight shift for a while &amp; this fixed it.</li>
            <li> Also use the eye gel along with the serum and have notice a considerable change.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin around my eyes feel soft.</li>
            <li> my under eyes are naturally sunken in and my skin can look a bit saggy</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive to chemicals</li>
            <li> I received this to review and am liking it so far.</li>
            <li> the Insta Natural Youth Express Eye Serum is the answer for it is.</li>
            <li> May be the color came from the natural ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li> young at heart, who doesn’t want to feel or look that way.</li>
            <li> Causes no irritation on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I only use it at night where no one see me as much.</li>
            <li> You only need a drop, anymore than that is too much (from experience).</li>
            <li> I recently fell crazy in love with the InstaNatural Vitamin C serum for face, so I was pleased to also get to try this formula for the eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already seeing marked improvement in wrinkles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far I can say I like it</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t notice any orange residue near my eyes.</li>
            <li> I recently started developing wrinkle around my eyes and this has really helped make them not noticeable.</li>
            <li> It does not bother my sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li> I’ve only been using it a few days, but love how it helps my eyes look less-tired in the morning.</li>
            <li> only been using it a few days, but love how it helps my eyes look less-tired in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am very happy and will continue using to see the long term effects on my tired dark circles.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever try eye serum, previously I have always been using eye cream, so as everyone knows, some eye cream can be really greasy</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, then I read the reviews, curious by the solid 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> One around my left eye and left side of my forehead, then the other for around my right eye and right side of my forehead.</li>
            <li> I do not have dark circles so can&#x27;t speak for that, but the fine lines around my eyes are definitely improving with use.  </li>
            <li> I actually am going to get a bottle for my mother in law, this should be in every young women and older women’s beauty cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually am going to get a bottle for my mother in law, this should be in every young women and older women’s beauty cabinet.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for a few months, haven&#x27;t seen any significant results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change the first few days.</li>
            <li> Bags and dark circles have almost disappeared with in the first weeks use!</li>
            <li> works JUST AS WELL as the grossly overpriced eye serum sold in the malls (those two mall stores with hip-dressed-in-black high pressure sales people.).</li>
            <li> The serum has a very clean citrus smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used for a few weeks so far, but the fine lines seems to be diminishing</li>
            <li> This had made a big difference in the fine lines around my eyes, and my dark circles are a bit lighter too!</li>
            <li> I use morning and night and wake up to younger looking and refreshed eyes even when I don&#x27;t get a full night sleep due to being up at night with my baby.</li>
            <li> I am still only a few days in, I will check back in with more results.</li>
            <li> Over the past few years, I haven&#x27;t been getting very good sleep due to medical conditions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a difference in the short time I used it, especially lessening my dark circles and fine</li>
            <li> I have very creppy, dry under eye skin.</li>
            <li> the texture is not my favorite or perhaps the way it comes out on the dropper you could waste allot so be careful.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is surprisingly thick, which made for an easy application to my skin.</li>
            <li> NOT safe for sensitive skin!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These two came in packages similar to the store and was very professional.  </li>
            <li> The orange color is a little off putting at first, but it blends away!</li>
            <li> My initial reaction when I opened the tube was, “wow, it’s orange!”.</li>
            <li> My major concern is &amp;#34;dark circle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Now, since I don&#x27;t have any obvious eye issues to speak of, I am a little more limited about what I can say for this product.</li>
            <li> My older daughter told her that she looks like a vampire when it is on - with the strange orange glow under her eyes.  </li>
            <li> I can see fine line around my eyes slowly disappear</li>
            <li> My eyes are still a little puffy, but they look fresh.</li>
            <li> It seemed to help with the little lines around my eyes when I smile or squint.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this one is better and I have noticed a slight difference/improvement in wrinkles and less puffiness around my eyes after over a month 1/2 of use.  </li>
            <li> The product is smooth and not sticky and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The first time I put it around my eyes, I was a little surprised that it felt &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;, but I guess that is how it works.  </li>
            <li> I have a little puffiness I am dealing with, but it is a medical issue and I am not shocked to see no change there.</li>
            <li> The puffiness is a little less noticable, but I haven&#x27;t really paid attention to how it is working on fine lines yet, I just starting using it.  </li>
            <li> Great product and doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the bright orange substance you are about to rub underneath your eyes...</li>
            <li> Products that I received generally do what it promises.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to really appreciate what it does</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t be too surprised about that when you open it!</li>
            <li> In closing, niacinamide and kojic acid act as skin-lightening agents, which are intended to lighten those dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rest assured that I will absolutely be purchasing this serum again when this bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> Ever since using this product I haven&#x27;t had dark circles or much puffiness!  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy whatsoever and is not something that requires multiple applications!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the serum for a couple weeks so far.</li>
            <li> Dark circles are much lighter and my skin is tighter and firmer!</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Dark circles are much lighter and my skin is tighter and firmer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying and noticed a difference in my tired eyes.</li>
            <li> and I doubt it&#x27;s a coincidence that several new reviews are posted on a DAILY basis!?</li>
            <li> I feel like my eyes look less tired and bright.</li>
            <li> I just turned 42 and the 6 other expensive serums were no longer effective, In fact not sure they ever were, but they came with huge claims and raves and a considerable price tag,.</li>
            <li> This serum would last for a LONG time, you really need to put just a tiny bit, because of the are under the eyes</li>
            <li> I t does or must be followed by a rich moisturizer, or at least for the over 40&#x27;s crowd, .</li>
            <li> The active ingredients minimize the appearance of puffiness, dark circles, and fine lines instantly.</li>
            <li> It did not do any good: irritating, messy, orange stuff.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this stuff goes a long way, and I&#x27;ve found that it absorbs into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li> it still feels a little sticky, but not like the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I think the earlier the better, maybe we can slow them down if we start early.</li>
            <li> It really helped to hide the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with dark circles under my eyes my whole life.</li>
            <li> It feels like my skin is tightening almost immediately, and I have not noticed the dark shadows under my eyes nearly as much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple months and it got rid of the puffiness under my eyes, but didn&#x27;t do much for the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I felt that the orange color didn&#x27;t do much for the dark circles.</li>
            <li> It does have a very orange color to it, but like another review stated, the orange color helps cover those dark purple circles.</li>
            <li> The serum has a long list of anti-aging components in it and all these ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received and reviewed a few facial skin care products lately that I really liked.  </li>
            <li> You want to keep the stuff in fridge also because vitamin c properties will break down fast if not kept.</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles and fine lines and after a week and a half of using it</li>
            <li> and I want to stay young for a very long time.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t see any results right after, if you are looking for instant results or change in your look, check elsewhere, so I guess I have to go along within 2 months to see if anything changes, especially my dark circles - NO help with that so far, I have been using for weeks and only at night.</li>
            <li> It has an orangey-red color with a slight citrusy scent, but you can&#x27;t really smell it once it is on your skin.</li>
            <li> The Eye Serum definitely feels like it has lightened and tightened the skin under and around my eyes, but the dark orange color can give your skin an orange shade if you put too much on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessary use it for any other part of my face, I mainly focus on my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li> Firm the upper eye area and minimize the look of redness and dark circles by replenishing free radical-fighting.</li>
            <li> Really helps with dark circles!</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product in return for my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>
            <li> the other natural ingredients combined leave your skin silky and improved.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin like other products can.</li>
            <li> Ive started putting some on my dark spots from old acne scars, theyre fading!</li>
            <li> Since using it I have seen a difference and can not really tell my dark circles are there unless your really up close.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad that people are okay with deceiving others, as long as they&#x27;re being paid to do so.  </li>
            <li> You only use a pea size amount of serum for both eyes, so the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> You only use a pea size amount of serum for both eyes, so the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I usually dispense a large drop from the dropper and distribute between my ring fingers and put onto my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The puffiness was gone, the aforementioned delicate skin felt and looked more moisturized than ever, and it didn&#x27;t appear so drab, dull, and tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far have not seen any difference in my dark circles but am sticking with it for a couple months to see&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my skin around my eyes feel soft &amp; looks smoother and the dark circles seem to be fading away.</li>
            <li> But I do see that this product, in the long run, could make your eyes look a lot healthier and younger, so I will keep using.  </li>
            <li> are as flat as they were before.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit goes a very long way</li>
            <li> However, you only need the slightest amount - this bottle should last a LONG time!!!  </li>
            <li> Then I started to notice that I woke up with a rash where I had used it and that the upper sides of my nose had dry, scaly skin.</li>
            <li> So even though I&#x27;m only in my late 20s, I&#x27;m starting to really notice the dark circles, tiredness and general puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product has helped the bags under my eyes seem less pronounced so far and has moisturized the area around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Took a few days to notice a difference, but it was clear that they are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> right away I feel it stiff and firm around the eyes where I applied.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised when I opened the bottle and saw the serum is orange color.</li>
            <li> at least I see one shade lighter and that makes me very</li>
            <li> My first reaction was not good.  </li>
            <li> and now she is on a schedule waking up at least 2 times a night and wanting a bottle, and then after that she wants to watch cartoons so I am barley getting sleep.</li>
            <li> I also with this company would stop giving out the product for free to those who leave silly reviews, like listing the ingredients what what they are suppose to do</li>
            <li> I have noticed a big difference in my dark circles without a doubt, but I use it only at night.  </li>
            <li> and when I apply my make-up my dark circles under the eyes are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I like the results I am seeing and will continue to use this product as long as I continue seeing results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think with long period of use</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve never really had a big problem with my eyes, I have noticed that I do have a problem with under eye circles and puffiness (damn you 30&#x27;s!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want long term results, than the eye gel is needed as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was quite surprised that it worked after a few uses.</li>
            <li> However when other brands advertise that their products have astaxanthin, it&#x27;s not NEARLY as orange as this serum which means they are relatively generous with the astaxanthin.</li>
            <li> Overall I like it, but gave it away to my Mom and moved to other serums and brands.</li>
            <li> Went back to my other eye cream, which works</li>
            <li> Due to that I would only use this at night.  </li>
            <li> a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m seeing a difference in discolored skin, but I haven&#x27;t been using it very long.</li>
            <li> And brought a lot of hydration to my dry skin this winter.</li>
            <li> It does work well although it did dry the skin around my eye out.  </li>
            <li> Allow to air dry for the product to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> It does take awhile to dry</li>
            <li> They really stand behind everything they make, and the quality is second to none</li>
            <li> every single day.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way, so this bottle would last a long time.</li>
            <li> A very little amount is required for complete coverage around the eyes and don’t worry the serum do not sting when applied to the under-eye</li>
            <li> Comes with an orange color, smells like tangerine, almost instantly helped with my dark circles.</li>
            <li> The red and dark circles were gone, but you could still see some orange.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a decrease in the dark bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> what contains to make the dark circles go away and your skin feel healthier and younger?</li>
            <li> So what contains to make the dark circles go away and your skin feel healthier and younger?</li>
            <li> I think the orange color is what gives you that instant results; it seems to hide the blue/purple tint in dark circles.</li>
            <li> SInce I have used the Insta Natural Eye Serum I have noticed that my eyes don&#x27;t look as puffy as usual.</li>
            <li> oh my god this decreased them so much!</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way so this will last</li>
            <li> This is a product that every person that suffers from Dark circles, puffiness wrinkles, and fine lines should use I totally recommend it..</li>
            <li> The only thing is it leaves a slight orange tint.  </li>
            <li> Im Greek and have terrine black circles.</li>
            <li> This syrum has a slight citrus scent, it goes on thin not thick, a bit silky, and dried fast.</li>
            <li> I think I am starting to see little lines by my eyes, my friends say its all in my head</li>
            <li> I tried using as little as possible, but it still bothers me.</li>
            <li> I only need a little bit</li>
            <li> so I would remember to use it and the other one every single day.</li>
            <li> Mine had gotten bad to point of using dermatologica, a heavy pancake/theater concealer, and am now able to use a regular makeup concealer (lorac)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
            <li> You simply pat a tiny bit of the serum into the under-eye area with your ring finger to minimize tugging or pulling on the delicate eye skin.  </li>
            <li> Please read ingredients carefully.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful when closing it up...  </li>
            <li> She spent hundreds of dollars at the mall for products that would work for her.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for only a few days.  </li>
            <li> Be careful if you wear contacts.</li>
            <li> Of course, if I had a rough night, it does not create miracles, but which product does?</li>
            <li> looks pink but blends into skin</li>
            <li> Its not very noticeable but because of the lighting at my salon</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it performs with dark circles, but overall I think it keeps the area around my eyes hydrated and definitely puffiness has become a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for around 5 months now (still have over half a bottle left), but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s made a permanent, lasting difference on my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It applies so easy and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or unpleasant after feeling.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this serum so it should last a few months.  </li>
            <li> Yet, other people notice a difference even though I really do not.</li>
            <li> This small container seems like it will last a few months up to a year possibly.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a couple of weeks, but it has made a difference in the texture of the skin under my eyes and lightened the dark circles a little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients like caffeine, Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid have gone a long way towards helping that delicate skin around my eyes in several ways.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and have noticed a difference in puffiness, but still have dark circles!!</li>
            <li> and I only need a little less than a pea size to fully cover each eye area.</li>
            <li> This serum seems to be working well and little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and being that the bottle comes with a high-quality dropper, you don&#x27;t need to be concerned with wasting any.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this for tired eyes!!&lt;br /&gt; .</li>
            <li> It is quite thick and you only need a small amount so the bottle will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> though I would try this out due to this.</li>
            <li> is such a small area and doesn&#x27;t need a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Contrary to what other reviewers have reported, it still appears orange on her even after drying, so she does not use it during the day.  </li>
            <li> She uses other products during the day</li>
            <li> and she did not have an overnight immediate miracle like some other reviewers reported.  </li>
            <li> Taking away years of skin damage due to the sun or just age.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how this eye serum would affect makeup or if it would require a short wait before applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> I use it morning and night and will continue to use the products as I am beginning to use other Insta-Natural products.</li>
            <li> This serum does the same job if not better.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product for eyes with this ingredient, so I am curious to see its impact on dark circles over time.    </li>
            <li> bought other instanatural products will wait to see the results.</li>
            <li> Look at the other reviews that the authors of this product have posted-all five star reports on every product, across the board.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the other eye cream to use together</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the eye serum and look forward to trying their other products.</li>
            <li> You need use only a small drop to do the job.  </li>
            <li> I ended up just taking a small dab from the outside of the dropper.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any problem with orange tint around my eyes after application like some other reviewers reported.  </li>
            <li> One is called Youth Express Eye Gel and the other is called Youth express Eye serum.</li>
            <li> No really!</li>
            <li> I will look at some of their other products to try as well.</li>
            <li> Orion in Bev Hills due to one of the procedures he does for the eyes which in non-eveassive</li>
            <li> I will look into InstaNatural&#x27;s other</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is some of the serum rubs off when the dropper comes in contact with the bottle and then dries up, so a little waste there.  </li>
            <li> A few of my other favorites are the b3 serum and hyaluronic acid serum, also retinol, wont dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> the retinol moisturizer cream and the other eye cream for dark circles,puffiness and wrinkles....</li>
            <li> But I tried it any way for the dark circle under my eyes due to lack of sleep</li>
            <li> I had an obvious blue tint from thin skin previously, and now it&#x27;s there but not standoutish.</li>
            <li> The serum itself was thick and not runny like some of the other facial serums that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> but I can only use it at night due to the orange coloring and the thick blobs that occur if it doesn&#x27;t all soak in (I think a pump applicator would help to alleviate this).  </li>
            <li> I typically rotated using this one with the eye cream every other day....</li>
            <li> Helps to eliminate dark circles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> It is an orange in color but the dark circles disappear.</li>

            <li> Dark circles still there and no sign of change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect effect on dark circle by using one month of InstaNatural Eye Serum, but I hope I can see some improvement after three months application.</li>
            <li> For those mornings where I&#x27;m lacking sleep and wake up with puffy and dark eyes.  </li>

            <li> and I have noticeably less dark circle</li>
            <li> I notice less dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> The purpose of using this was to use less concealer to cover up my dark circles.</li>
            <li> It is slightly sticky, as opposed to runny, so it’s not running down your face as you apply.  </li>
            <li> A little bit thick to apply and gives off an orange colour under your eyes (would scare whoever you&#x27;re sleeping next to!).</li>
            <li> I place HALF a pea size drop on my fingers</li>
            <li> There is less sagging under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have to use less concealer in the mornings to cover up circles than before.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that my eyes are less puffy and brighter.  </li>
            <li> I like the slight citrus aroma and the value for the money...</li>
            <li> It leaves a slight orange tint that&#x27;s not visible once you put make up on or if you have medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> Also, the darkness is less day by day.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Immediately after application, I could feel the skin slightly tightening under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It’s just one less headache for worrying over harmful products.</li>
            <li> I like how this serum helps the eye gel glide under my eyes with less tugging.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using it at night because it did leave a slight orange coloring to my skin.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are a little bit lighter, I know they won&#x27;t just disappear because they  are hereditary.</li>
            <li> I found that the product delivers, I do have a baby which equals to little sleep which leads to puffy eyes and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I was having some issues with darkness under my eyes and just General tired looking under eye area.  </li>
            <li> Since I have to get up at 6 am get the 2 older girls ready for school, I always look tired and have really bad dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this product at night, I have noticed the skin around my eyes is less puffy in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I started to feel disappointed until about day 10 when I noticed a significant difference in the color of the circles under my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you can imagine the dark bags under my eyes!</li>
            <li> Made my dark circles darker than ever!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it for a week longer because I know it can take a little longer than a week for changes and update</li>
            <li> I can feel my skin is a little firmer after applying.</li>
            <li> At what age do you start to address the little lines by your eyes?&lt;br /&gt;Forever</li>
            <li> At what age do you start to address the little lines by your eyes?  </li>
            <li> I know you can cover up with a little bit of concealer, but sometimes I just don&#x27;t want to wear any.</li>
            <li> I do see that the dark circle under my eyes have lightened up!  </li>
            <li> This had been helping with that a little, and I&#x27;m noticing my dehydration lines getting plumped up as I use it.</li>
            <li> I can tell a little difference but not a significant change yet.</li>
            <li> This serum is extremely hydrating!!</li>
            <li> My circles weren&#x27;t very dark, but enough to always look tired.</li>
            <li> I got this Serum product few days ago.</li>
            <li> Wash my face and apply this around my eyes and literally within a few minutes I can see drastic results.  </li>
            <li> I could feeling working since the 1st time and after a few uses my eye lids</li>
            <li> I was sold on this serum because of the powerhouse of ingredients: vitamin C, caffeine, passionflower and kojic acid to name a few.</li>
            <li> But again, just my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> Wasted money and time.</li>
            <li> Just a drop everyday.</li>
            <li> Not impressed so far.</li>
            <li> READ MY FULL REVIEW HERE: [...]    </li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in the few shorts weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I started to notice some lines around my eyes, ever so small, but never the less noticeable , and some puffiness in the morning, runs in my family,</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles that are hard to cover, even with concealer.</li>
            <li> Dark circles are slowly improving.</li>
            <li> The dark circles have decreased little by little.</li>
            <li> This leaves your face a little orange, people though I was wearing make up!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Use very little time</li>
            <li> So as long as your not causing harm to yourself what wrong with a little upgrade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle but after a week my skin has tightened and the sagging is less visible.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything as of yet,</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> I’ve been patting a small amount under my eyes in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was working or not, I continued with my morning routine, applying moisturizer and makeup and by the time I was done, I did notice a change.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I can see a small difference around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the fuss about.</li>
            <li> Have been using for past 1 month and no difference</li>
            <li> The directions say put a small amount around the eyes, forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li> have seen a small difference since using the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another product in the past</li>
            <li> no more Puffiness</li>
            <li> what happened to her?&amp;#34; Being my circles are so dark and getting worse with age.</li>
            <li> I look tired all the time because with the dark circles, I have puffiness.</li>
            <li> high-potency serum smoothes and refreshes tired and delicate under-eyes and lids to help diminish the appearance of puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> After 3 days use, I noticed improvement in under eye hydration and looked less tired.</li>
            <li> Even my husband has told me that I look less tired lately.  </li>
            <li> My eyes doesn&#x27;t look as puffy and dull.</li>
            <li> hard to tell if it does a lot.</li>
            <li> although I am still in the turbo detox mode, and the lines around my eyes are hardly noticeble.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for approximately one week, and have seen a little change.  </li>
            <li> It’s by no means a bad thing, just unexpected.</li>
            <li> icky over powering scents&lt;br</li>
            <li> But around Day 10 I noticed the color of the &amp;#34;bruise&amp;#34; had lightened up at least one shade.</li>
            <li> Peptide complex</li>
            <li> Peptide complex  4.Matrixyl 3000  5.</li>
            <li> I slowly see some results.</li>
            <li> The bottle comes with a dropper and the serum is thick liquid that is orange in color</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in my undereyes, I didn&#x27;t have awful dark circles either.</li>
            <li> No more exhausted looking eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using a very small drop on each eye for a week and didn&#x27;t notice it doing anything.</li>
            <li> No more restless tired eyes.</li>
            <li> I’ve been patting a very small amount under my eyes before I go to bed and</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with dark circle serum!</li>
            <li> I have a tendency, being in my late 30&#x27;s to look tired and this has helped brighten up my appearance.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too thin and it&#x27;s not too thick.</li>
            <li> one thing that I found very odd about this product is that its has a weird peachy orange color.</li>
            <li> At first I was shocked by the orange color of the serum!!</li>
            <li> This product caused an allergic reaction all over my face including painful blisters and dry patches around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> She also said that it dries sticky - so putting makeup or concealer over it is not really a great idea.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C, Plant Stem Cells, and Astaxanthin help to prevent premature aging of the thin skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is too thick and the color is weird (orange).</li>
            <li> Also, it leaves behind orange stain over the skin</li>
            <li> During the day, I do not &#x27;look&#x27; as tired because my eye &#x27;bags&#x27; are smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to test and try this product during a promotional period.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have that problem and don&#x27;t need to hide behind cover-up make-up.</li>
            <li> Kinda makes it worse</li>
            <li> I was shocked because I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun to try to get rid of the dark circles since I was a teenager</li>
            <li> The horrible dark circles under my eyes are extremely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Now they say they are not as bad an the puffiness has gone down.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in caring for my face by preventing the signs of aging as in doing is virtually impossible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good look!  </li>
            <li> but I still have dark circles. :(</li>
            <li> No more bags!!!</li>
            <li> Needless to say I think this eye serum is a go.</li>
            <li> Once you get over the shocking color of the serum, it&#x27;s a terrific product.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed!</li>
            <li> All the reviews must be fake.</li>
            <li> Lack of sleep in combination with a so-so eye cream (expensive) gave me hooded lids.</li>
            <li> to expensive for nothing.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s been difficult to find a product that I could tolerate without my skin flaming up and getting even</li>
            <li> I thought since the problem is so faint</li>
            <li> with applying a very very thin amount of serum, there is still a residual orange tint that didn’t fully absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li> So I would buy this and use it all over my face very thin amount</li>
            <li> I have very bad dark circles</li>
            <li> and It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes look worst than what they did before applying which has been the case for other eye serums, gels, creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> She has terrible dark circles under her eyes and we always attributed it to her having an iron deficiency.</li>
            <li> I have horrific dark circles and bags</li>
            <li> Company cares about their customers and listens, so dont be afraid to respond to aj.</li>
            <li> I don’t want to give it a bad review</li>
            <li> No irritation or bad reaction at all.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed the puffiness has diminished and the darkness isn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> I was gleefully shocked.</li>
            <li> Disappointed ..</li>
            <li> The serum is a crazy orange color which made me skeptical but after about 3 days of use I am hooked!!!  </li>
            <li> at all... hate the feeling of money...</li>
            <li> Once at work someone thought that I had been hit in the eye - it is just that embarrassingly terrible!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A  HORRIBLE PRODUCT.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased three items in this InstaNatural line....the retinol moisturizer cream and the other eye cream for dark circles,puffiness and wrinkles....I prefer this one by far over the cream.  The consistency of this one is better and I have noticed a slight difference/improvement in wrinkles and less puffiness around my eyes after over a month 1/2 of use.  I typically rotated using this one with the eye cream every other day....now I prefer to just use this on a daily basis...along with the retinol moisturizer cream too.  Love the consistency of this and I use it pretty liberally over my chest and neck as well daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend but just understand if you only use it once a day as I do it may take as much as 45 days to notice a difference.  I will reorder again soon....I still have plenty left since I was rotating use of the eye cream and did that for a time with the moisturizer too because I was using another product up.</li>
            <li> This is a great serum. You only need alittle bit every night.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Eye Serum has the absolute best smelling serum of any eye or face product I have ever applied to my face! I daily have under eye circles. I though I would try this out due to this. I was just going to dab it under my eyes but it smelled and felt so good on my skin I used it on my whole face. (it does say it can be used on whole face.)  It works and I have been using it twice daily and I have noticeably less dark circle and my skin is so so soft. I am so happy with InstaNarural Eye Serum!</li>
            <li> i loved it and i smells real good and feels good on my skin</li>
            <li> Great serum to use with Insta Natural Eye Gel at night. Helps to eliminate dark circles and puffy eyes. Use with the eye gel for best results. I was given this product to use and review.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I noticed quick results and was so surprised by the difference.  Do hesitate to try this.</li>
            <li> This works great for those dark circles under your eyes and the puffiness is gone... yes!  It is an orange in color but the dark circles disappear. One drop is all you need. Love this product and will recommend.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a good product. I applied it and it does not irritate my skin at all. It will tell the effect maybe when I use it for a while. Just started to use it. Will update later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 months now, and I absolutely love it! I Instantly notice brightening and uplifted effect. Plus the unique fact that it&#x27;s a serum made to be used around delicate eye area provides the advantage of its quickly and easily absorbed consistency. Since I first started using eye creams in my skincare routine, about 5 years ago, I had yet to discover a product which actually delivered any impacting results. But I will definitely be ordering this one again when I run out</li>
            <li> I wish I could have liked this, as it got other good reviews. But, my skin must be very sensitive, for after 5-6 nights, the skin under my eyes became irritated.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any change in my under eye puffiness from using this product. I feel I have paid money , once again, for something that does not do what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been switching between the eye serum and the eye cream and both are great. I&#x27;m 49 and have under eye sagging. It&#x27;s subtle but after a week my skin has tightened and the sagging is less visible. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> A great product, goes on great not sticky nor oily, too early to see results.</li>
            <li> I got this Serum product few days ago. It is orange liquid. This eye serum has done wonders for my dark circles under my eyes as well as the puffiness. The dark circles have decreased little by little. Absorbs well into the skin. Doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling. nice product. great buy.</li>
            <li> I love this so much. It is very easy to use, goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. It does not leave a greasy residue and all. It&#x27;s ingredients are pretty much all natural which is great because who likes to put chemicals on their delicate skin? I have tried many of InstaNaturals products and I love all of them, this one included.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way so this will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;No icky over powering scents&lt;br /&gt;Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Easily absorbs</li>
            <li> I ordered this eye serum right in the middle of the holidays and much to my surprise the shipping was lightning fast.  The serum is a crazy orange color which made me skeptical but after about 3 days of use I am hooked!!!  I am a wife and homeschooling mom so I had many dark circles under my eyes. But not anymore!!</li>
            <li> This serum seems to be working well and little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I feel that it made a difference to my skin. They also have amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> I can see a big difference when I wake up. My eyes doesn&#x27;t look as puffy and dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for around 5 months now (still have over half a bottle left), but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s made a permanent, lasting difference on my wrinkles. It does, however, feel very moisturizing and I like the smell, so I will continue to use it simply as a moisturizer. The orange color is a little off putting at first, but it blends away! Overall a pretty good value you for what you get.</li>
            <li> Nice serum. I bought it for $21.95 on Amazon. Smells like tangerine though (oranges) and its color is orange. I place HALF a pea size drop on my fingers (good amount for both eyes) and massage gently under the eyes, to absorb it fully. This serum would last for a LONG time, you really need to put just a tiny bit, because of the are under the eyes is such a small area and doesn&#x27;t need a lot of it. It is NOT too oily - the feel is kind of immediate absorption and right away I feel it stiff and firm around the eyes where I applied. It&#x27;s not greasy and I DON&#x27;T have any orange colors around my eyes, that&#x27;s why I make sure I have a small amount applied. But I don&#x27;t see any results right after, if you are looking for instant results or change in your look, check elsewhere, so I guess I have to go along within 2 months to see if anything changes, especially my dark circles - NO help with that so far, I have been using for weeks and only at night. Overall I like it, but gave it away to my Mom and moved to other serums and brands.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many eye serums because I have always been quite apprehensive when it came to putting things in or around my eye area, however, being that this eye serum is natural, I was looking forward to giving it a try and I am glad I did. Being that I am still in my 20&#x27;s, I don&#x27;t have an issue with fine lines or wrinkles, so I can&#x27;t contest to that fact, however, I can say that my eyes look a lot more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; and refreshed, especially since I don&#x27;t get much sleep often times. Needless to say I think this eye serum is a go.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything as of yet, but it will definitely stay as part of my daily rituals.  One thing I love about InstaNatural is they use the best ingredients....the recommended, tried, and true ingredients.  I&#x27;m not expecting overnight results.  For instance, I know that many of the ingredients have benefits that you won&#x27;t see till after 2-3 years of faithful use.  Which is fine with me.  Rather use something that I know will improve my skin over time and prevent further damage than to use something that gives quick results with lasting damage.  It&#x27;s bright orange straight out of the bottle, but rubs in/soaks in nicely.  I like this product much better than the eye gel by InstaNatural.  Will continue to use.  Great ingredients (vegan &amp; proven) and SUPERB CUSTOMER SERVICE! I like that InstaNatural always has contacted me directly to make sure I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this InstaNatural Eye Serum. Easy dropper to apply and the smell is amazing!  The vitamin C, plant stem cells along w/the other natural ingredients combined leave your skin silky and improved.  The passionflower gives this serum such a pleasant aroma!</li>
            <li> Love this serum. It smells like oranges and has a good texture. It gives my eye area a good amount of moisture and also make my eyes look more awake. The price for the quality is unbeatable!  Update: now I have been using it for 2 years and I still love it.</li>
            <li> I lub this serum, cool.ing on the face and thicck, I luv serum, absorbs better in the skin. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> this is nice!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; must have</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy that I had the chance to try this eye serum complimentary for review. I absolutely love it. It is a brighter colored orange serum and my first thoughts were that it might stain my skin. That is not the case and it doesn&#x27;t do that. I have found that it has added a sort of glow or brightness if you will around my eye area. It comes in a glass bottle that has an eye dropper style top. The eye dropper is great at dispersing just the right amount of product. The serum absorbs quickly into my skin and I only need a little less than a pea size to fully cover each eye area. I also love the scent of it. It&#x27;s not a very strong scent and actually is very light and citrus like. The skin area around my eyes is more radiant because of this serum and I will definitely be buying this when I run out of the bottle I currently have.</li>
            <li> Smells great and tightens</li>
            <li> Used this product and found that my dark circles have lightened.</li>
            <li> I see no difference at all</li>
            <li> I am using this serum morning and night under my eyes.  I am already noticing the fine wrinkles disappearing!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for dark circles under my eyes.  I have tried so many items but this is the first time i can clearly see some results.  I hope I am not expecting too much.  I can olny give four star because I am still using the item.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 3 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any change in dark circles around my eyes. It does claim to have some pretty good ingredients for improving skin texture and overall circulation, but I have yet to see any changes.  I will continue to use this product until I am finished with it, however I wI&#x27;ll not be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Comes with an orange color, smells like tangerine, almost instantly helped with my dark circles. Good product.</li>
            <li> dark circles doesnt go a way with this products nothing change</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well on dark circles</li>
            <li> These are awesome! I&#x27;m in love with these, these are definitely something to&lt;br /&gt;keep around.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in my undereyes, I didn&#x27;t have awful dark circles either. The serum itself is lovely. It has a pleasant smell, and is bright orange light a carrot, but blends in easily. Also, a little goes a long way, so this bottle would last a long time. I use it hoping to keep my eye area nourished and moisturized and prevent wrinkles/puffiness/darkness that comes with age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as directed for 9 days now and am really beginning to see a noticeable difference. The dark circles under my eyes are fading and it seems to be reducing some of the puffiness.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before buying this product. I was worried about the comments about making your face look orange. If you rub the product in, you are fine. I have notice a different since using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to help with some darkness under my eyes.  I am so happy with this product!!!  The darkness has definitely gone away!  I will say it is very orange.  However, you only need the slightest amount - this bottle should last a LONG time!!!  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was excited to offer this product to my mother for her review. She has terrible dark circles under her eyes and we always attributed it to her having an iron deficiency. She takes an iron supplement and contacted her doctor before trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her words:&lt;br /&gt;This was very easy to use. I just put it in the bathroom so I would remember to use it and the other one every single day. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change the first few days. I started to feel disappointed until about day 10 when I noticed a significant difference in the color of the circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It always looked as if I had a bruise under my eyes. But around Day 10 I noticed the color of the &amp;#34;bruise&amp;#34; had lightened up at least one shade. I was shocked because I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun to try to get rid of the dark circles since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m in my 60s now). You need to make sure to use this every day and use it with the other product  (the InstaNatural Eye CREAM!) every single day. Morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle, not &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; but for the first time in my life I noticed a difference. Even if it doesn&#x27;t lighten up up the under eye circles anymore at least I see one shade lighter and that makes me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep using this and I&#x27;ll have my daughter update this review as time goes by if there are anymore changes. By instant I don&#x27;t think it means the next day, but you wake up one morning and boom -- the circles all of a sudden are one shade lighter. That&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the serum a little more than the cream only because it glides on easier. I don&#x27;t think one actually works better than the other. I used the cream in the morning and the serum a night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller offered this product free or nearly free in order for my review. This is my 100% HONEST OPINION of the eye serum</li>
            <li> This serum is extremely hydrating!! It&#x27;s made for the eyes but really it can be used all over your face, plus it smells heavenly! It&#x27;s very light. It really helped to hide the dark circles under my eyes. And brought a lot of hydration to my dry skin this winter. Great price and great brand. Highly recommend this product to anyone, men or women, of any age!</li>
            <li> I use this product with my Mary Kay...AWESOME definitely less puffiness around eyes.</li>
            <li> Did not help my dark circles and the puffiness around the eyes.</li>
            <li> My wife, who is 52, decided to order this based on all of the good reviews.  She waited quite awhile to form an opinion because she did not want to decide what whether it worked prematurely.  The first thing she noticed is that it is really orange.  Contrary to what other reviewers have reported, it still appears orange on her even after drying, so she does not use it during the day.  My older daughter told her that she looks like a vampire when it is on - with the strange orange glow under her eyes.  She also said that it dries sticky - so putting makeup or concealer over it is not really a great idea.  That having been said, she has been using it at night now for awhile, and has concluded that the area of her eyes have fewer wrinkles or puffiness over time.  She uses other products during the day (Shiseido Bioperformance Super Corrective serum first, and then an eye cream or &amp;#34;Elite Serum. Defend. Protect. Rejuvenate&amp;#34;on top of the serum) and the combination seems to be working really well.  She noticed that even when she does not get a lot of sleep, this product seems to take away puffiness or dark circles in the morning.  She did say that the product took some time to work and she did not have an overnight immediate miracle like some other reviewers reported.  Great price.  Good product. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Ecellent product.  Purchased for my wife.  Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> PRETTY GOOD EYE SERUM!!!  WISH THAT IT WORKED BETTER ON PUFFINESS!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I never write reviews but I have to tell you... It truly works. My crows feet disappeared!! It didn&#x27;t happen over night but well worth the wait. It does a great job with puffiness too.</li>
            <li> This serum is good, I put it on every night before I go to bed (to give the delicate and sensitive skin under my eyes a boost of nourishing ingredients). Keeps the eye area moisturized!</li>
            <li> This eye serum is pretty good.  I use it nightly and so far it&#x27;s working out fine.  It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks so I will check back later to give a follow up review.</li>
            <li> Excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really works</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It isn&#x27;t too greasy and it does what it says it does. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne. My skin looks awesome!!!</li>
            <li> **This product was provided for free for testing purposes. **  The first thing you notice with this eye serum would be the color- it&#x27;s neon orange, so bright it almost glows.  The second scent is the smell, as it has rather strong citrus (tangerine or orange?) scent which I really like.  The formula was thinner than I thought, and it won&#x27;t irritate your skin.  It gets absorbed quickly, and I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve debated what to say in my review and rather it take up on the 100% guarantee. Not sure if I&#x27;ll order again. It does smell great! And it is def orange. The company is very nice but the orange stays on my skin so it has to be used only at night. It does fade but it takes a couple of hours for me. I really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference so I asked some people at work and they said they could def tell a difference because sometimes Id&#x27; get to work and they thought &amp;#34;wow what happened to her?&amp;#34; Being my circles are so dark and getting worse with age. Now they say they are not as bad an the puffiness has gone down. So there is improvement but I still have dark circles. :( Yet, other people notice a difference even though I really do not. I wish I had taken pictures before and after. I&#x27;ve been using the product now for about 3 weeks. Still kind of up in the air as to rather I&#x27;ll buy again. If it weren&#x27;t for my circles I&#x27;d look so much younger.</li>
            <li> This product feels nice and smells good but haven&#x27;t noticed any dark circle lightening.  It&#x27;s probably simply a good moisturizer after cleansing.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this serum better than their cream! Absorb to my skin so quickly and very hydrating</li>
            <li> Do not use! This product caused an allergic reaction all over my face including painful blisters and dry patches around my mouth and eyes. Please read ingredients carefully. NOT safe for sensitive skin!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really loved how this was packaged and it came so fast! I also loved how it was so easy and effective to use. Also it did reduced the amount of puffiness under my eye, so it is firmer than it was before! I will defiantly purchase after I run out!</li>
            <li> Works great. I noticed a great difference in my dark circles and my fine lines around the eye area have been fading a little. I use morning and night and wake up to younger looking and refreshed eyes even when I don&#x27;t get a full night sleep due to being up at night with my baby.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with dark circles under my eyes my whole life. I inherited it from my grandmother and my father. Once at work someone thought that I had been hit in the eye - it is just that embarrassingly terrible! Now that I am 51, I also have fine lines and puffiness from time to time.  They definitely can use some firming up! I bought this item at a promotional price and I am happy to share my honest views with others, so hopefully it can help in their decision to buy this product or not, just as I rely on reviews from other people to make my decisions about purchases. Well,  I really like the results I am seeing from using this Instanatural Eye Serum. The darkness around my eyes is finally starting to lessen and the fine lines are starting to disappear. I feel like this is plumping up the eye area and it looks firmer,  more youthful. There is less sagging under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This product has many antioxidants that help it to be so good.  Vitamin C, Plant Stem Cells, and Astaxanthin help to prevent premature aging of the thin skin around the eyes. The caffeine in this serum absorbs excess water and constricts the skin,  making it firmer and Hyaluronic Acid moisturizes and plumps the skin. Niacinamide and Kojic Acid work to lighten the skin. I have been impressed with this product.  It smells like citrus and is non greasy. It absorbs quickly into my skin. I recommend this product to others who may have eye problems similar to mine.</li>
            <li> This had made a big difference in the fine lines around my eyes, and my dark circles are a bit lighter too! It&#x27;s very light and refreshing. I keep mine in the refrigerator and it&#x27;s super cool and soothing when I apply it as I live in a very hot area. Will keep buying!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously noticing a positive change…less puffiness and seems to address my fine lines around the eye area.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is some of the serum rubs off when the dropper comes in contact with the bottle and then dries up, so a little waste there.  Have to be careful when closing it up...  Otherwise very good product!</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing amazing.  I was having some issues with darkness under my eyes and just General tired looking under eye area.  This product did an amazing job.  After three days I got compliments that I looked more rested.  I have noticed darkness fading and my eye area looks well rested.  The orange smell is very nice and just a drop goes along  way under the eye area.  Install naturals did it again with another amazing product. I have to say something about the amazing customer service of the company!!! If I could give 10 stars I would! You don&#x27;t find many companies that truly  care how the consumer feels.  Thumbs up way up for the product and customer service. I bought this product on my  own and was not paid to give this review.</li>
            <li> This serum is great! It applies so easy and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or unpleasant after feeling. It really makes my eyes feel awake.and bright when I use it under and around them every morning. I&#x27;m excited to see the long term results. So happy I was able to use a promotional discount to purchase this!</li>
            <li> Have been using it every morning for about two weeks. Dark circles still there and no sign of change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes me wondering how this product got so many good review.</li>
            <li> Great product, thank you very much! Works well!</li>
            <li> They really stand behind everything they make, and the quality is second to none</li>
            <li> We received this product for free, the review and opinions are our own. This product has a purpose and that purpose it to renew the look of your skin. Taking away years of skin damage due to the sun or just age. The InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Serum is a great product. My wife says it is easy to use and it makes her skin look and feel refreshed and renewed. My wife is middle-aged and she says she likes how this product feels on her skin. When my wife first moved to Florida from the Philippine, she had to deal with a lot of skin problems. She spent hundreds of dollars at the mall for products that would work for her. This product works as well or better than those expensive product. She tried the product last night and she was happy that their was no irritation. My wife look forward to continue to use this product and enjoy all of the great results. She has to deal with lines around her eyes during the most stressful times at her job.</li>
            <li> My initial reaction when I opened the tube was, “wow, it’s orange!”. It’s by no means a bad thing, just unexpected. But I guess the serum must get it’s orange coloring from the natural ingredients. Don’t worry, the serum does’t burn or anything when applied to the under-eye area. I’ve only been using it a few days, but love how it helps my eyes look less-tired in the morning. I’ve been patting a small amount under my eyes in the morning and evening. The serum absorbs quickly and hasn’t stained my skin orange, in case that is a concern. But only a small amount is needed, I tend to squeeze too much out of the dropper! I’m definitely going to add it in to my daily skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>
            <li> nice and light weight. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes. Also very hydrating. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I checked the product review first, and I ordered both &amp;#34;InstaNatural Eye Serum For Dark Circles&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;InstaNatural THE BEST Eye Cream For Dark...&amp;#34;. My major concern is &amp;#34;dark circle&amp;#34;. This bottle last one month to finish. After finished one bottle of Eye Serum, I didn&#x27;t see significant improvement for dark circle after one month, but somehow, I like the feeling after put it on. The smell is good (good smell can also make you feel good). Following the instruction, I also tried neck. Even the skin cell type is different, but it seems good for neck too.&lt;br /&gt;Compared with InstaNatural THE BEST Eye Cream, this InstaNatural Eye Serum seems good for me. So I re-ordered two bottles of InstaNatural Eye Serum. I don&#x27;t expect effect on dark circle by using one month of InstaNatural Eye Serum, but I hope I can see some improvement after three months application. So now, I give four stars.</li>
            <li> This works great! Instantly got rid of my bags!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to write my review until using this product for a while. Now, after a month of daily use, I&#x27;m back to say I am very pleased with this eye serum. It has a lovely citrus smell and feels nice and soft. One month of use and I can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, I have tried so many different types and nothing seems to work. My dark circles are a little bit lighter, I know they won&#x27;t just disappear because they  are hereditary. Nevertheless, I am very pleased with the results, I will definitely buy this product again. I waited a while to review this product, I only have good thing to say about it.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for only a few days.  My first reaction was not good.  I applied the serum and my skin turned orange and it felt really sticky.  In the morning my skin under my eyes felt much softer.  I now use the serum at night and I figured out I was using way to much and that was why it was so sticky,  it still feels a little sticky, but not like the first time I used it.  Now that I have used the serum I can say I would recommend it to others.  If you use just a few drops, use it at night because your skin does turn orange, I feel you will love the end result.</li>
            <li> Noticeable improvement with only one use!  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> This product absorbs beautifully.  I got it because suddenly I have huge bags under my eyes. This product helped a great deal. I am impressed.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing eye serum!  I love the fact that the caffeine helps it work instantly.  For those mornings where I&#x27;m lacking sleep and wake up with puffy and dark eyes.  Wash my face and apply this around my eyes and literally within a few minutes I can see drastic results.  After continued use it really has helped the fine lines around my eyes too.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> WORKED AMAZING!! LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> This eye serum is fantastic.  It really got rid of the circles under my eyes and I look healthier</li>
            <li> This product has been ok. I like the eye gel much better. I don&#x27;t have too many fine lines yet and so I can&#x27;t really comment on the effects. I love the scent and feel it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Works wonders!  Bags and dark circles have almost disappeared with in the first weeks use!</li>
            <li> I love the way this serum makes my eye area nice and smooth. It smells so refreshing too!</li>
            <li> This Serum is one of my favorites. It is carrot coloured formula and gives an immediate brightening effect to the under eye area. It has ingredients that are designed to protect the skin and give it an even tone. I used to use this product once daily but due to the remarkable improvement in my dark under eye circles I am now using it three to four times a week in rotation with the youth express eye gel from instanatural. It isn&#x27;t too thin and it&#x27;s not too thick. It&#x27;s a light weight and has a gentle smell. A tiny drop is all you need to  apply over the entire eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review. I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> My eye circles are already some diminished after 2 weeks and I have not had any reactions to it yet, either.  Many products including the expensive department store stuff (and I&#x27;ve tried them all--Estee, lancome, clinique, clarins, origins, aveda, dr. perricone, you name it) didn&#x27;t do squat except give me acne or eye-oil bubbles underneath my eye.  And cost a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does not do that and actually seems to be fading the circles some.  I have to use less concealer in the mornings to cover up circles than before.  Mine had gotten bad to point of using dermatologica, a heavy pancake/theater concealer, and am now able to use a regular makeup concealer (lorac)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: I use my serum with a clairsonic opal so most disappears in a minute, and the rest I pat in. It is a tiny bit orange, but I use at night so I don&#x27;t care.  After using with opal, most disappears anyway.  If you just pat it on, though, you probably cannot layer makeup over it immediately.  It is a bit sticky if not vibrated in or given time to absorb.  Wonderful citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this eye serum in conjunction with the eye cream.  I have been using it for approximately one week, and have seen a little change.  I have noticed that my eyes are less puffy and brighter.  I expect them to look even better after extended use.  I was slightly worried about the color of the serum, as it is orange, but it blends in perfectly after a short while, especially once I moisturize.  It is slightly sticky, as opposed to runny, so it’s not running down your face as you apply.  I am not a makeup wearer so I am not sure how this eye serum would affect makeup or if it would require a short wait before applying makeup.  But I do see that this product, in the long run, could make your eyes look a lot healthier and younger, so I will keep using.  I received a discount for this product in return for my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> At first, I liked this product and used it most every night. Then I started to notice that I woke up with a rash where I had used it and that the upper sides of my nose had dry, scaly skin. And finally, the last time I used it, I saw the rash appearing before my eyes within ten minutes of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have returned it 5 days ago and requested a refund if I had realized what was happening. I&#x27;m bummed, because now I am stuck with a product I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. My skin around my eyes looks softer and has a nice glow. My eyes are still a little puffy, but they look fresh. I am also applying a few drops around my face, and the results are a nice glow too. I am definitely buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It makes my skin feel very soft after using.  I have noticed that the dark circles and wrinkles under my eyes are not as noticeable after using.  Will continue to see and see if the results continue!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all with  this product. I wake up with bags under my eyes.Went back to my other eye cream, which works</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the instanatural eye serum for dark circles.  I have noticed a big difference in my dark circles without a doubt, but I use it only at night.  It adds kind of an orange &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; under my eyes, I don&#x27;t know how else to explain it.  So I use it at night when I wash my face and by the morning, it is not visible, but the dark circles are gone. It smells great, just a nighttime only thing for me.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing. I have a two year old so you can imagine the dark bags under my eyes! With this serum I&#x27;m seeing definite improvement.</li>
            <li> Worked well and you get a good amount for the money.  I deduct one star because of the dispenser.  It&#x27;s a dropper and it&#x27;s not the most convenient thing to use.</li>
            <li> Wife says: &amp;#34;Great stuff. Use it every day.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The eye serum is great.  I have noticed a difference and so did my husband and he never notices anything lol.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, this is bright orange so don&#x27;t be too surprised about that when you open it! It doesn&#x27;t stay orange if you lightly pat it in to your skin. Maybe a hint of orange, but it didn&#x27;t bother me. It seemed to help with the little lines around my eyes when I smile or squint.</li>
            <li> Not only has this serum softened fine lines around my eyes, but also my forehead and around my mouth. Terrific product!</li>
            <li> This stuff works!!! I&#x27;m a believer that certain skin care works for some people and some may not. You just have to find what works for you!</li>
            <li> I feel the skin become refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Invest for the skin. Will be repurchased.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time researching face/eye products and testing them out.  I am thrilled with my new find.  This eye serum really goes on smoothly filling in the lines and &#x27;plumping&#x27; them up. A little goes a long way with this serum so it should last a few months.  In my opinion, it contains all of the ingredients that really work in an anti-aging eye serum: Vitamins C &amp; E, Kojic acid, Caffeine, Matrixyl 3000, Hyaluronic acid, and Niacinamide.  I am very happy and will continue using to see the long term effects on my tired dark circles.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my mom. She was always saying something about her wrinkles around her eyes. She stayed using this product and her wrinkles started disappearing and also the dark spots. She still uses this product because she likes it so much. She had not had another product work as well as this product. She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Great Value!&lt;br /&gt;very good!!</li>
            <li> Once you get over the shocking color of the serum, it&#x27;s a terrific product.  I use it at night, tho it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;so&amp;#34; orange that one couldn&#x27;t use it in the daytime - you use it pretty sparingly? I use it with the face serum and sleep with it on, in the morning I use an exfoliant with my foaming face soap and my skin is GLEAMING!  No product is a miracle, but this product does a very good job rejuvenating my delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Being a middle-aged woman, it is more important than ever to get good, quality sleep. That helps a great deal with keeping the dark circles and puffiness from your under-eye area. Who likes carrying around more under-eye bags than a luggage carousel? With that in mind, I was offered the chance to try this at a one-time 100% discount and of course, I happily accepted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first: the scent was actually very pleasant and so light that it was not at all overpowering. The consistency is surprisingly thick, which made for an easy application to my skin. The color, however, was a bright but quite deep orange which was in keeping with the citrus-y fragrance. A little goes a long way, and being that the bottle comes with a high-quality dropper, you don&#x27;t need to be concerned with wasting any. It goes on lightly and spreads very easily. Absorption into your skin will be amazingly quick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients like caffeine, Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid have gone a long way towards helping that delicate skin around my eyes in several ways. The puffiness was gone, the aforementioned delicate skin felt and looked more moisturized than ever, and it didn&#x27;t appear so drab, dull, and tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some ingredients I&#x27;d never heard of, so I took the time to look them up. For instance, astaxanthin is where this serum&#x27;s orange color comes from. Pronounced &amp;#34;asta-ZAN-thin&amp;#34;, it is a naturally-occurring carotenoid. Carotenoids are pigment colors that occur in nature and support good health. Astaxanthin is actually a powerful antioxidant! In closing, niacinamide and kojic acid act as skin-lightening agents, which are intended to lighten those dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rest assured that I will absolutely be purchasing this serum again when this bottle runs out!</li>
            <li> I tend to get dark circles under my eyes or puffiness. Let&#x27;s face with who think that&#x27;s at all attractive.....not me! Ever since using this product I haven&#x27;t had dark circles or much puffiness!  I find it very affective! I use it daily in my facial routine! It took about 7 days before I started noticing a difference! It also smells good! It&#x27;s also really easy to use!  I recieved this ateam a discounted price to test and review!</li>
            <li> This is very easy to apply prior to my normal moisturizing, and has no fragrance. It feels like my skin is tightening almost immediately, and I have not noticed the dark shadows under my eyes nearly as much. I like knowing that I am feeding my skin at the place where it needs it the most.</li>
            <li> I really loved it!  The smell was nice and fresh, and it absorbed into my under eye area really nice and quickly too.  I&#x27;ve seen a difference in the short time I used it, especially lessening my dark circles and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that InstaNatural is so confident in their products that they offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee.  Also, they don&#x27;t do any animal testing!</li>
            <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
            <li> Not impressed! No visible difference. Using all 3 products as instructed.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning after I shower and let it soak in before applying my make up. I have horrific dark circles and bags and i&#x27;m seeing them dissipate with daily use. I like the way it smells and the texture is nice and does not even feel like I&#x27;ve applied anything when it dries. I like the results I am seeing and will continue to use this product as long as I continue seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of the product around the eye.  It is safe to apply near the eyes and has no residue.  I think with long period of use it might help with under eye bags - we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I dislike that this leave a yellow tint on my skin/eyes</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! No more sark circles you start to see them disappear with consistent use twice daily. I was shocked I never I imagined anything would get rid of the circles under my eyes. Be careful if you wear contacts.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying this product.  It has a great citrusy smell and is light when applied.  I don&#x27;t really know I have it on when I wear it.  I was surprised by the bright orange color of this product.  Due to that I would only use this at night.  I seem to be noticing lots of great results around my eyes since starting with this product!</li>
            <li> helps tighten skin right away</li>
            <li> Easy to use! Not greasy.</li>
            <li> It is smell good but it did not help improving my eye bag or wrinkle</li>
            <li> a good result but it is not yet understand&lt;br /&gt;Use very little time</li>
            <li> You can notice a difference right away</li>
            <li> using on undereyes &amp; top lip @ night...so far so good</li>
            <li> I bought this eye serum on a whim.  I&#x27;m getting to the age where my eyes are starting to sag and I&#x27;ve been trying all kinds of products to help with that, all with varying degrees of success.  So on a Monday morning, I woke up bushy tailed and less than bright eyed.  I opened up the serum and applied it to the under eye area.  It has a great citrus scent and reading the ingredients, I can only assume it&#x27;s the grapefruit essential oil.  Dotted it an on and worked it into the area and within easily 30 seconds I started to notice a change. Not sure if it was working or not, I continued with my morning routine, applying moisturizer and makeup and by the time I was done, I did notice a change.  My eyes are not as puffy and looked refreshed.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would work but I thought, &amp;#34;eh, why not just give it a try?&amp;#34; Well, bags are gone. No more exhausted looking eyes. I wish it could get rid of the discoloration under my eyes, but I&#x27;ll take no bags for sure.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I use daily, it is not irritating, moisturizes, non greasy, and lessens the darks circles and fine lines. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Completely lovely, superb, the best-working serum. When I look in the mirror, I get a shock. It changes the texture under your eyes and you look much younger. Just yesterday someone asked me if I was bringing cake to the daycare. What daycare? My son is 19!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  For years have been dealing with puffiness under the eyes and have tried everything to minimize the puffiness.  Finally something that works and I have had many compliments that my eyes look so much better....  I will continue to use on a regular basis</li>
            <li> I love the product. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time and will update results.</li>
            <li> like the product, but the red-ish color needs to be rub in completely as it does have a light red color on the skin if you don&#x27;t. but the smell and consistency is nice, color not really a big deal.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It has an orange color to it, so I wear it at night. This product is full of very nourishing ingredients that are very beneficial to your skin, which leave it looking smooth. It smells and feels amazing on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have looked and looked for something to ease the puffiness under my eyes and I finally found it. I love this product! Fast shipping too !</li>
            <li> This product is too thick and the color is weird (orange). I am not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this. It&#x27;s fresh, but not too strong. Kind of smells like someone 10 feet away from you started peeling an orange. It&#x27;s a bright orange color due to the astaxanthin. However when other brands advertise that their products have astaxanthin, it&#x27;s not NEARLY as orange as this serum which means they are relatively generous with the astaxanthin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple months and it got rid of the puffiness under my eyes, but didn&#x27;t do much for the dark circles. However, I think that might be hormonal or something.</li>
            <li> see a little difference not sure yet how great it is but hopefully with more use it will do what it says because my moms want it also</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and have noticed a difference in puffiness, but still have dark circles!!</li>
            <li> Definitely saw an improvement after using this product. Would recommend it</li>
            <li> Pure and perfekt it makes my skin soft and fresh</li>
            <li> Made my dark circles darker than ever!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Insta-Natural Eye Serum for about two weeks and love the product! It is deep orange in color and truly works at smoothing out the fine lines under and around the eyes. I also don&#x27;t seem to have the morning puffy eyes in the upper eyelids. There is a definite difference. I use it morning and night and will continue to use the products as I am beginning to use other Insta-Natural products. All their products are packed with high percentage and power natural ingredients that is food for the skin. I have used many products, even high-end skin care products that turned out to be all hype and nothing else. It is nice to find products that are natural, truly work, and the company is customer friendly. I strongly recommend this product and other Insta-Natural items. I have normal-dry skin, sometimes sensitive, so I am very cautious of what I put on my face. These products are a winner!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  It does work well although it did dry the skin around my eye out.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Best eye cream I have ever bought. I need a little more time, but think this is the one for me</li>
            <li> There was one major drawback for me: the bright orange color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with applying a very very thin amount of serum, there is still a residual orange tint that didn’t fully absorb into my skin. The red and dark circles were gone, but you could still see some orange. Luckily, this anti-oxidant rich formula can be worn under makeup and disguised, but I wouldn’t recommend on bare skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for free for review purposes</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Instanatural eyegel on nights I stay in the house and don&#x27;t necessarily have to wake up early so both products can really work and become effective overnight. I use the youth express eye serum 5 minutes after applying the youth express eyegel. I like to apply 3-4 drops and spread onto 2 cotton balls. One around my left eye and left side of my forehead, then the other for around my right eye and right side of my forehead. I don&#x27;t necessary use it for any other part of my face, I mainly focus on my eyes and forehead. This serum liquid looks red/orange and has a citrus-like scent. The key ingredients that make this product is Vitamin C, Plant Stem Calls, Astaxanthin, Kojic Acid, Passionflower, Caffeine, &amp; Hyaluronic. This small container seems like it will last a few months up to a year possibly. So far I wake up with my eyes looking less tired. I notice less dark circles and puffiness. Seems to be working great for me!</li>
            <li> I use this serum under an eye gel from the same company. I have been using it for about 10 days twice a day, and my experience has been pleasant so far. I feel like my eyes look less tired and bright. Of course, if I had a rough night, it does not create miracles, but which product does? The serum has a long list of anti-aging components in it and all these ingredients are natural. This alone motivates me to use it. I have used a department store brand when I hit 40 paying big bucks. This serum does the same job if not better. Plus I feel more comfortable using a product with no harmful ingredients such as parabens. I am particularly happy that this serum has kojic acid in it, which is known its brightening effects. I have never used a product for eyes with this ingredient, so I am curious to see its impact on dark circles over time.    This product has been provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I am not seeing any effects of this serum on my skin.</li>
            <li> Like it nice product compare it with others but not work well for inherited  dark circle it help to reduce in some way I will keep use it and see thanks</li>
            <li> I use this daily and when I leave it at home when traveling, I notice.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen a change yet</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a couple of weeks, but it has made a difference in the texture of the skin under my eyes and lightened the dark circles a little.</li>
            <li> This thing hasnt worked for me not even one bit.The bottle is almost done and no improvement!</li>
            <li> These things work great! Such a good price for so many of them</li>
            <li> This was the second bottle I purchased. I have very puffy eyes in the morning and when I put this on after my shower, the puffiness is gone within a few minutes.  When I remember to put it on at night, it greatly reduces the puffiness in the morning.  It&#x27;s has helped with the fine lines but I still have some work to do in that area..  I have received so many compliments lately about how young I look....  I will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> I love the scent. I use it all over my face cause it has A LOT  of Peptides. I will buy again and again. Its amazing how my skin drinks InstaNatural products I bought a lot cause I&#x27;m seeing results I&#x27;m 28 and I want to stay young for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the results of this amazing product!</li>
            <li> love this eye serum, takes away the dark circles</li>
            <li> My mamma loves it!!! She uses it every day and plans on buying more :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried similar products to this but this eye serum is the best. I purchased it for my mom but after seeing her results I started using also. Planning on purchasing more. Highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for three weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li> This serum is sticky and leaves a layer or orange on my face!</li>
            <li> Love this serum. It&#x27;s made a big difference in my crows feet and wrinkles. Would recommend this to you, if you want a great affordable eye serum.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the darkness under my eyes is starting to lighten after a week of use.</li>
            <li> The first time I removed the dropper from the bottle I was gleefully shocked. The serum is a very bright, orange color, I have a naturally light skin complexion. The horrible dark circles under my eyes are extremely noticeable. I look tired all the time because with the dark circles, I have puffiness. So upon receiving a sample, I was really, REALLY hoping this would help with one, or both problems.  I receive this product on a discount price or free for reviewing purposes</li>
            <li> All the reviews must be fake. I used it for a month. No change. It does not moisturize skin under eye at all.</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye serum for over 30 days and I must say I am very impressed.  This has done a great job softening my under eye wrinkles &amp; giving my eyes a more youthful and rested look.  This is a must have!</li>
            <li> I received this along with the InstaNatural Eye Cream for Dark Circles.  I&#x27;ve received and reviewed a few facial skin care products lately that I really liked.  However, these two are specially designed for under eye.  I don&#x27;t have huge dark spots, but as I&#x27;ve aged it&#x27;s become more apparent that there is some discoloration and sagging.  I tested both out for 3 days and saw a difference.  Under my eyes seemed tighter and brighter.  I also have this nagging dermatitis spotted lightly around my eyes and I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of it.  This actually has helped it diminish and it&#x27;s almost gone.  Another thing I was impressed with was the packaging.  I review products here and there and mostly they come intact but just bubble wrapped.  These two came in packages similar to the store and was very professional.  The serum itself was thick and not runny like some of the other facial serums that I&#x27;ve used.  All in all, this is a great product and as all my skin issues get under control after a few weeks of constant usage, I&#x27;ll post some pictures.</li>
            <li> Seems to be very effective so far. I like the slight citrus aroma and the value for the money...the bottle is quite large for an eye product and should last a while. I plan to buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li> One of my most Favorite Serums!</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a decrease in the dark bags under my eyes. Im very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what every one is talking about this product has not done anything for me. No difference at alll!!!</li>
            <li> I saw an improvement from puffy eyes/dark circles after a week plus of using this product. Really enjoyed it and found it was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Have not been able to see an improvement</li>
            <li> This thing works great! I have big eyelids and with them it comes the risk of them sagging late in life. I&#x27;ve been using any type of eye cream since 18 y.o., now I&#x27;m close to 40 and have a toddler. Lack of sleep in combination with a so-so eye cream (expensive) gave me hooded lids. I researched and found this serum. IT WORKS! I could feeling working since the 1st time and after a few uses my eye lids are as flat as they were before. It will only look orange on your lids I&#x27;d you put too much or if don&#x27;t distribute well. And instructions say to follow with a moisturizer so this should be your only eye routine. I purchased this brands eye cream which is good too.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL AND FAST RESULTS</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this product.Met my expectations 100%!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a spa gift basket.</li>
            <li> I can see a small difference around my eyes. But what do expect it&#x27;s not a miracle in a bottle. It&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> havent noticed too much change in the appearance of fine lines around my eyes, but will continue to use</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this product at night, I have noticed the skin around my eyes is less puffy in the morning.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin like other products can.</li>
            <li> This eye serum helps with the wrinkles and dark circles. Works well under makeup too</li>
            <li> Great to put on before bed and before makeup.  Reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect miracles from this serum just something to reduce the puffiness, using it twice daily and I didn&#x27;t see any improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I bought other instanatural products will wait to see the results.</li>
            <li> Really takes the puffiness away. I put it on at night and in the morning. Love it.</li>
            <li> Its lighentned my dark circles for sure! Ive started putting some on my dark spots from old acne scars, theyre fading! will be buying more</li>
            <li> Literally the only thing that works for my eye. I used to have skin that would get puffy and move downward, now (12 days laters) the skin shrunk and it&#x27;s moved upward, so my eyes are looking normal and young!!! So my picture is only 12 days apart, while also using other InstaNatural products :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all as it claims.I didn&#x27;t see any changes even after using it for a month.  Also, it leaves behind orange stain over the skin and so it can be used only overnight as you can wash off the stain in the morning.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of instanatural products! Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE EVERY THING THEY MAKE</li>
            <li> I love this serum. Over the past few years, I haven&#x27;t been getting very good sleep due to medical conditions. So even though I&#x27;m only in my late 20s, I&#x27;m starting to really notice the dark circles, tiredness and general puffiness around my eyes. I was sold on this serum because of the powerhouse of ingredients: vitamin C, caffeine, passionflower and kojic acid to name a few. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way, and I&#x27;ve found that it absorbs into my skin quickly. I use this at nighttime.</li>
            <li> It has nice orange /citrus smell AND color. I was kinda scared at first, because it has orange color. But it works for puffiness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with dark circle serum! Due to holiday stress I haven&#x27;t been able to get the best sleep, which has caused some dark circles due to lack of sleep. This has helped clear that up pretty nicely! I was happy when I was approached to review this for the company. Thank you for letting me do so.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister.  She has those big &amp;#34;ravioli eyes&amp;#34;.  Sometimes when she puts too many hours in at work she gets that &amp;#34;look&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s not a good look!  (Love you, sista&#x27;!).  She started using this eye serum and loves how it has helped get rid of her under eye circles.  Yes.  She looks beautiful!</li>
            <li> I used to have lines around my eyes &amp; oh my god this decreased them so much! I am 23 and had shadows because I&#x27;ve been on the midnight shift for a while &amp; this fixed it. Get this bottle you will not regret it! The serum soaks so well into your eyes and the nutrients help your vessels become nourished &amp; stronger which in turn helps them prevent leaking any blood that causes dark circle. I love instanatural—their products and moisturizers are the only ones I use! Organic and natural, ace quality ingredients, this is literally elixir in a bottle! For the price, give it a try you will NOT regret it guaranteed!</li>
            <li> There is a tint of color to the gel which was unexpected, however I really do like it. I put the serum on in the morning, It does a nice job of hiding my dark circles and then I put my concealer and makeup over it. It seems like it moisterizes and covers. I am still only a few days in, I will check back in with more results.</li>
            <li> Wanted to get this product for my sister to try. She&#x27;s always had dark circles under her eyes. She&#x27;s been applying it at night and in the morning. Took a few days to notice a difference, but it was clear that they are starting to fade. Great product and doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor.</li>
            <li> Irritated the skin around my eyes. Thought maybe it was a fluke so tried it a second time and the same redness happened so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Eye serum is effective with wrinkles around my eyes. Also use the eye gel along with the serum and have notice a considerable change.</li>
            <li> helpful for dark circles</li>
            <li> hmmm. I was excited to try this product, then I read the reviews, curious by the solid 5 stars.  I don&#x27;t know if I trust this company.  This is just my opinion, but it seems like most of these reviews are fabricated.  They sound totally canned and I doubt it&#x27;s a coincidence that several new reviews are posted on a DAILY basis!? For most legitimate products, it takes MONTHS to acquire this many reviews, and even then, everyone has their opinion, and most products do not get a solid 5 stars.  Look at the other reviews that the authors of this product have posted-all five star reports on every product, across the board.  (some people writing up to 5 reviews a day, really?)  It&#x27;s sad that people are okay with deceiving others, as long as they&#x27;re being paid to do so.  But again, just my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> Ok I will say this the smell I like the texture is not my favorite or perhaps the way it comes out on the dropper you could waste allot so be careful.  The ingredients are what matters here. If you know anything about what&#x27;s good for your skin this product had it. Dr reccomends topical vitAmin c and from what I know this is good quality vitamin c. I use to get vitamin c from a friends brother dermatologist in the philPines and it&#x27;s not cheap but it has a similar coloration and texture. It will work if you use it. I have this product a 3 1/2 star simply because of the dropper/ packaging not product. You want to keep the stuff in fridge also because vitamin c properties will break down fast if not kept. So I would buy this and use it all over my face very thin amount is all you need.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this serum. It is light and gentle and goes on easily and absorbs nicely. It is not heavy whatsoever and is not something that requires multiple applications! I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Love the eye serum - seeing results already!</li>
            <li> The area under my eyes is noticeably brighter since using this product.The light orange scent is refreshing and not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference at all.</li>
            <li> looks pink but blends into skin</li>
            <li> It does turn your eye orange but after you use a moisturizer and make up it&#x27;s not visible. I&#x27;m really enjoying and noticed a difference in my tired eyes. I ordered the other eye cream to use together</li>
            <li> I don’t want to give it a bad review but it I didn’t feel it worked for me. I used it for about a week and my eyes have been really itchy in the mornings and I don’t see a difference in the puffiness or darkness under my eyes. I can’t stand itchy eyes so I discontinued its use</li>
            <li> so far have not seen any difference in my dark circles but am sticking with it for a couple months to see&lt;br /&gt;if anything improves!  since the reviews are mostly positive am hoping it works.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin around my eyes feel soft.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!! No complaints.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased a beauty product and noticed obvious results. For me, it only took a week before I forgot to put concealer under my eyes before leaving the house. I had an obvious blue tint from thin skin previously, and now it&#x27;s there but not standoutish. Will definitely keep buying this.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would work if I was in my 50&#x27;s at most.  Does nothing for 60 +</li>
            <li> The eye serum seems to be very effective.  I&#x27;ve only used for a few weeks so far, but the fine lines seems to be diminishing and I can feel the tightening as my eyes do not seem so puffy at this point.  So, I think the product is very good.  I would recommend it to see if it works as well for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using instanatural products for about 2 to 3 mos now. I have to say i have liked and used most of the skincare. This eye serum is another keeper, the color might scare you, but u will love the instant tightening feel. A few of my other favorites are the b3 serum and hyaluronic acid serum, also retinol, wont dry out your skin. Company cares about their customers and listens, so dont be afraid to respond to aj.</li>
            <li> I was given the oppertunity to review another product from Insta Naturals recently. I am always excited to try eye creams and serums. While I&#x27;ve never really had a big problem with my eyes, I have noticed that I do have a problem with under eye circles and puffiness (damn you 30&#x27;s!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the feel and smell of this serum. It has a great texture and absorbs into the skin very easily without any sticky residue. While there is a bit of fragrance, I found it to be fairly clean and I was very comfortable using it around my eyes. I have definitely noticed a change with my under eye circles over the time I have used it. I am fairly confident that prolonged usage will give me even better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I found very odd about this product is that its has a weird peachy orange color. I understand that the orange helps combat the blue tones in under eye circles. Its not very noticeable but because of the lighting at my salon I decided to refrain from using it in the morning before going to work. If you are good about wearing makeup daily then I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it at all. Unfortunately for me, I tend to be lazy in the morning and rarely wear foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other then that I would definitely suggest this product to anyone looking for a good eye serum.</li>
            <li> I love most of Instanatural&#x27;s products, but this one doesn&#x27;t do much for me. It leaves a slight orange tint that&#x27;s not visible once you put make up on or if you have medium skin tone. I can imagine that if you have very fair skin, the orange tint might be noticeable. I have been using a very small drop on each eye for a week and didn&#x27;t notice it doing anything. It does have good skincare ingredients so I guess I will just use it up. A couple good nights of rest is still the best solution for dark circles. “Product provided for free for testing purposes.”</li>
            <li> Great eye serum. I have very creppy, dry under eye skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now, and I can definitely see the difference. My skin is more smooth and moisturized. Also, the darkness is less day by day. I highly recommended this for tired eyes!!&lt;br /&gt; .</li>
            <li> Youth Express Eye Serum is a product that has worked for me.  After using the it, I&#x27;ve noticed my dark circles have diminished and my eyes look more alive.</li>
            <li> PPH is better this stuff and WAY!!!!! to expensive for nothing.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to see some results but havent seen anything. Disappointed .. another product to throw away.</li>
            <li> I like the way the serum seems to have brightened my complexion. Have noticed a reduction in darkness under eyes as well. I really like the follow up emails from the company...It feels like having your own personal consultant!</li>
            <li> This is a amazing serum. This serum has a light texture and a wonderful citrus scent. This serum is quickly absorbed into your skin. My eye area is brighter. My fine lines are disappearing with each use. My concealer goes on better and stays longer. This serum is loaded with some of the best anti-aging ingredients on the market today. I would highly recommend this product to everyone. This product was provided free for testing. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great product, will purchase again. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This eye serum is amazing!  I use it not just for around my eyes but all over my face.  It tightens your skin and reduces the size of your pores.  I will continue to use the eye serum and look forward to trying their other products.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever try eye serum, previously I have always been using eye cream, so as everyone knows, some eye cream can be really greasy n will cost u to get lil bumps under ur eyes. This serum is not greasy, but very hydrated I use one drop as the last step of my skin care routin, pat it on under my eye, continue to lightly pat it until almost dry. I notice the fine lines under my eye is lighter, I will recommend this to friends n families&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
            <li> This product make me feel and look so refreshed. My dark circles have improved and I use it along with the eye gel which helps with puffiness.</li>
            <li> i felt instant tightening after application, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month morning and night and theres definitely been an improvement in appearance of my circles. my under eyes are naturally sunken in and my skin can look a bit saggy (mind u I&#x27;m only 25-its genetics) in drier weather such as now. this has helped improve the appearance of my under eye area and i would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I used this product for almost 4 weeks.  So far so good.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the way it feels. No staining.</li>
            <li> This serum instantly absorbs into the delicate eye area.  You need use only a small drop to do the job.  At first I was unsure of the color of the product, but found that it does not leave a noticeable tint on my eye area.  I have found with the combined use of the Instanatural eye gel and this serum my eye are looks much more refreshed, smoother, and the fine lines seem to be much less apparent.  This product was supplied free to me for product review.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted this to work out for me but it just fell short. I have very dark circles and fine lines and after a week and a half of using it I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvements. I would apply by lightly patting it under my eyes and letting it dry completely before adding my makeup. It actually made my makeup crease more. I felt that the orange color didn&#x27;t do much for the dark circles. I love InstaNatural and know a few people that this has worked wonderfully for so I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS A  HORRIBLE PRODUCT. I will continue to use it for a week longer because I know it can take a little longer than a week for changes and update then.&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided for testing purposes All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> The active ingredients minimize the appearance of puffiness, dark circles, and fine lines instantly. Firm the upper eye area and minimize the look of redness and dark circles by replenishing free radical-fighting. Identifying your eye issuesâ€”puffiness, dark circles, wrinkles, drynessâ€”is easy. high-potency serum smoothes and refreshes tired and delicate under-eyes and lids to help diminish the appearance of puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Out of all the products I use for my skin this is one of my favorites. I use it for my under eye bags and circles. I sue it at night and in the morning.I have really seen a great improvement.</li>
            <li> I was given a chance to use a promotion to review this unbiased. I love this serum. I have been using it for about a week and a half. I slowly see some results. You only need a droplet to put under your eyes. (the first time I did five drops, so much excess). Also, make sure you rub it in because otherwise your under eye lids will be orange! Other than that, This is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the fuss about. It did not do any good: irritating, messy, orange stuff. It does look orange on the skin which is not the most beautiful thing around eyes or anywhere on the face for that matter. Should have returned it but I kept thinking &amp;#34;maybe it will work if I continue using it&amp;#34; Nope. Wasted money and time.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a serum for my eyes. I&#x27;ve used gels and creams, but never a serum. This one was pretty unique, too. It&#x27;s bright orange! But, it smells awesome. Like citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark circles and puffiness around my eyes. I used this serum in conjunction with InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Eye Gel. After washing and toning my face, I applied the serum first. You really don&#x27;t need a lot. I ended up just taking a small dab from the outside of the dropper. I applied it underneath and around my eyes. It absorbs quickly. I then applied the eye gel after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the serum for a couple weeks so far. I am seeing some lightening of the dark circles and some lessening of the puffiness under my eyes. Even my husband has told me that I look less tired lately.  So, that&#x27;s a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(NOTE: I received the eye serum and eye gel for free from BrandBacker for review purposes. All opinions are my own.)</li>
            <li> Kinda sketchy on the orange color but its o good product. Works over time.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Vitamin rich serums because they are amazing at diminishing the signs of aging.  This Youth Express serum is made specifically for use around the eyes.  It is a vibrant orange color and smells like fresh squeezed oranges.  I did not experience any problem with orange tint around my eyes after application like some other reviewers reported.  It disappeared into my skin immediately and left no residue.  I wear it under my make up without a problem.  This serum is loaded with nutrients to combat puffiness, dark circles and wrinkles.  I have seen fantastic results with this product and my dark circles are nearly undetectable.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and definitely need all the help I can get with wrinkle prevention.  I can honestly say I have noticed a decrease in fine lines and several friends have noticed and commented on how great my skin and eyes look.  I purchased Youth Express eye serum during a promotion to try and share my experience.  Would I purchase this product again?  Yes!</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few months, haven&#x27;t seen any significant results.</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Nice texture.</li>
            <li> Saw results within minutes.  Don&#x27;t let the orange color repel you. It fades quickly and works phenomenally.  I am in love with this product. No more bags!!!</li>
            <li> I have had wrinkles or &#x27;bags&#x27; under my eyes for forever. I have tried any and all eye creams that claim to do something. THIS ONE DOES. Are my wrinkles gone? No; I am not claiming miracles. The skin under my eyes is firmer and tighter, that is for sure. My &#x27;bags&#x27; appear smaller to me. I apply this every night and every morning. In the morning my eye wrinkles are not as puffy as they used to be. During the day, I do not &#x27;look&#x27; as tired because my eye &#x27;bags&#x27; are smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to test and try this product during a promotional period. I plan to purchase more when I finish this, which may be a long time from now.&amp;#34; A little goes a long way&amp;#34; is true for this product. I place one drop under each eye - that is all. It is plenty to spread around lightly with my finger. I can tell almost immediately if a product bothers my eyes; this one does not. It is safe and gentle. I am highly recommending this product because it is working for me.</li>
            <li> This serum does the job but I can only use it at night due to the orange coloring and the thick blobs that occur if it doesn&#x27;t all soak in (I think a pump applicator would help to alleviate this).  I found out that I would have to massage until absorbed and then use a little coconut oil for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the combination of ingredients.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for me. Have been using for past 1 month and no difference</li>
            <li> hard to tell if it does a lot. I use it at night because of the color. Wonderful scent and soaks in nicely.</li>
            <li> Lots of product that is very gentle to my tender eye area</li>
            <li> I love make-up , electronics , toys for the kids just about really anything I am willing to try, incase a family member wants to know if its worth the price and does it work. Well, Insta Natural emailed me asking if I would be interested in trying out 2 of their products. One is called Youth Express Eye Gel and the other is called Youth express Eye serum. Well lets get started on these facial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to start out with the Youth Express Eye Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there are so many things I like about this product, I am 30 years old a mother of 3 girls and a wife. My 2 older girls are sorta a hassle when its bed time , but mostly my 8 month old she used to sleep through the night and now she is on a schedule waking up at least 2 times a night and wanting a bottle, and then after that she wants to watch cartoons so I am barley getting sleep. Since I have to get up at 6 am get the 2 older girls ready for school, I always look tired and have really bad dark circles around my eyes. Which is a reason I wear make-up so you really can’t tell but some of the time you can see the circles through the make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you are probably wondering what are the steps to take to help reduce the circles. The directions say put a small amount around the eyes, forehead and cheeks. Allow to air dry for the product to absorb into the skin. For best results I use the product as directed 2 times a day. If you are wanting to , to help the aging process you can use this all over the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a small difference since using the product. Products like these take time to have a affect to the process, it just don’t happen over night. I apply this all over the face and when I apply my make-up my dark circles under the eyes are barely noticeable. Which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There really is a small scent to me its more of a flowery scent which does not bother me, I apply the gel on first then my make-up. Since using it I have seen a difference and can not really tell my dark circles are there unless your really up close. I actually am going to get a bottle for my mother in law, this should be in every young women and older women’s beauty cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what contains to make the dark circles go away and your skin feel healthier and younger? Well i’ll tell you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Hyalurobic Acid –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Plant Stem Cell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Peptide complex&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.Matrixyl 3000&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Amino Acid Comur really up close.

            <li> works great a little tingly at first but it worked well</li>
            <li> No more restless tired eyes. It made my eyes look and feel more refreshed. Just a drop everyday.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m seeing a difference in discolored skin, but I haven&#x27;t been using it very long. The consistency is nice, it applies well. Packaging was excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it all the time morning and night.</li>
            <li> I love this serum it&#x27;s color reminded me of carrot juice which instantly made me think healthy. The Fragrance of this eye serum is lovely. My eyes look so bright since I&#x27;ve been using for over a week. At first it feels oily but then dries without any Shine. It made my skin around my eyes feel soft &amp; looks smoother and the dark circles seem to be fading away. I would highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the bright orange substance you are about to rub underneath your eyes... it&#x27;s just as magical it sounds!    No really! The first time I opened the bottle of eye gel last week, I was nervous! It&#x27;s literally bright orange!!! After using the product a few days, I honestly don&#x27;t care what color it is, it works!    I&#x27;ve recently discovered this amazing brand, InstaNatural! I bought the line, so I am going to dissect each product one by one. When looking for a new skin care routine, one of the things I was concerned about, was making sure that I could return the product if I wasn&#x27;t happy with it. InstaNatural gives you a 100% lifetime guarantee that you will LOVE their products! This brand confidence, made me want to take a chance on them and I am so glad I did! I have been using these products for a week now and I can already see a difference in my skin!    View my full review on my blog, ABQ Inspired.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING!  Immediately after application, I could feel the skin slightly tightening under my eyes.  After only 3 days, there was a noticeable decrease in the circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Love this eye serum. Used daily i have zero dark circles and puffiness. Comes in a glass bottle with a dropper. Large bottle should last a while great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I was a little startled when I first opened the bottle because the serum is a bright, bright orange.  But it smooths easily into the skin, and the orange color goes away.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work pretty well on the fine lines around the eyes. I can feel my skin is a little firmer after applying. The company has incredible customer service. I will look at some of their other products to try as well.</li>
            <li> The description says it has caffeine in it and it will help with dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;The only noticeable difference is my eyes are a bit more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;The serum is orange so it leaves a noticeable color difference between my lower lids and the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;It states not to rub it in, just pat, but that would leave my lower lids looking super orangey.&lt;br /&gt;Not my favorite eye cream/serum.</li>
            <li> I have been on the lookout for a product that would help reduce puffy eyes and dark circles. My skin is extremely sensitive to chemicals so it&#x27;s been difficult to find a product that I could tolerate without my skin flaming up and getting even puffier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural applies smoothly and evenly. It makes your eyes feel fresh without being gloppy - InstaNatural isn&#x27;t too thick - great consistency. From the moment I put it on, I could feel it working to reduce eye puffiness. I look forward to continued use of the serum to see the longer term benefits.</li>
            <li> I am liking the way it feels.  It makes the senstive skin under around the eyes feel moist.  The puffiness is a little less noticable, but I haven&#x27;t really paid attention to how it is working on fine lines yet, I just starting using it.  Does make the skin very soft.</li>
            <li> too soon to know if it will work.  Catherine</li>
            <li> I received this to review and am liking it so far. My only complaint is that it is like bright orange and if you don&#x27;t really rub it in then you will have bright orange stains under your eyes. It feels super great though when you apply it and makes you feel really energized in the morning! I would definitely repurchase this item!</li>
            <li> I have been using the InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Serum for around a week now and just wanted to let everyone know that I LOVE IT!!!  I was a little surprised when I opened it as it is bright orange! I have never seen any skincare product this colour! It comes with the little pipette applicator which is pretty cool and allows you to control the amount you use easily. There is a gorgeous orangey smell, which is delicious…it actually reminds me of some kid’s medicine (Calpol) back in the UK. When I applied it beneath my eyes, it felt fresh and it dried quickly. I haven’t had any problems with using it under makeup either! A great product all round :-)  Review powered by Brandbacker!</li>
            <li> I received the product free for testing and reviewing, but the opinion is 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;If you have eye puffiness and dark circles the Insta Natural Youth Express Eye Serum is the answer for it is. Though it says to reduce wrinkles and fine lines too but I would not know that because I am still to get those.&lt;br /&gt; The serum comes in a glass bottle with a dropper. I was a little surprised when I opened the bottle and saw the serum is orange color. Not that the color matter but I have never used a serum that is orange in color. May be the color came from the natural ingredients in the product. I even the like the orange smell of the serum. A very little amount is required for complete coverage around the eyes and don’t worry the serum do not sting when applied to the under-eye area.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve only been using it a few days, but love how it helps my eyes look less-tired in the morning. I’ve been patting a very small amount under my eyes before I go to bed and my dark circles have almost vanished. The serum absorbs quickly and leaves the eyes soothed. I will surely be using this as time goes because I do not want wrinkles or crow feet near my eyes.</li>
            <li> My over all opinion of this product was great I love to use eye serums i&#x27;m almost in my mid 30&#x27;s so I think this is s good time to start using eye serums. I love the way the product looked and smelled. The packaging was great, I seen that my skin did look some what brighter so I know with continuous use it would look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used this product I put on a toner and a face serum before I put on the eye serum and it worked out great. I definitely will continue to use this product I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles, or wrinkles, but I do have puffiness. This eye serum is fantastic because it does reduce some puffiness. The formula moisturizes well and absorbs into my skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this consistently for a week and have enjoyed seeing my puffy under-eyes tighten up each day. Big fan!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for two weeks so I don&#x27;t feel I can give it a completely fair review just yet.  I like to use something for a full month because I find I see more results.  I will update in a month with more.  So far, I like it enough to keep using it, and that&#x27;s great.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have bought a product and used it for less than a week because it had such adverse effects on my skin.  This serum feels nice... and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. I am pleased with it and will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This product has helped give me a more &amp;#34;&amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; and refreshed looked! My circles weren&#x27;t very dark, but enough to always look tired. Now I don&#x27;t have that problem and don&#x27;t need to hide behind cover-up make-up. It&#x27;s even helped my entire face! My skin is firmer and even more glowing!! Just a tiny bit goes a very long way and that&#x27;s an extra plus!! It&#x27;s a can&#x27;t be without product for me now!!&lt;br /&gt;I received a second bottle to continue reviewing at no charge for my unbiased feedback. It has continued to work wonders on my under eye circles! My face is even smoother and lines around my mouth and eyes are nearly gone! I definitely don&#x27;t look or feel like a grandmother of three anymore!!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;good stuff&amp;#34; NICE CONSISTENCY AND FEEL</li>
            <li> Was nicely surprised this product has a great citrus/orange smell and its an orange color. I used it under my eyes at night and it didn&#x27;t irritate or bother my skin which is important to me. I will continue using it I am trying to combat signs of aging and I think this product can help do that since its packed full of vitamins and other ingredients formulated to do that.  Received a complimentary sample and the reviews and opinion are my own.</li>
            <li> At what age do you start to address the little lines by your eyes?&lt;br /&gt;Forever young at heart, who doesn’t want to feel or look that way. They say your neck tells your age, so does your eyes! I think I am starting to see little lines by my eyes, my friends say its all in my head but it’s all in my mirrors too. At what age do you start to address the little lines by your eyes?  I think the earlier the better, maybe we can slow them down if we start early. What ever that number is to address aging I will ignore and start addressing what ever I can with the right products of course. We are all beauty guru’s in our own right we all know what works for us and what don’t. So as long as your not causing harm to yourself what wrong with a little upgrade. I came across this Youth express eye serum, the name was partly why I wanted to try it out. Hey Youth Express screams try me now! so i did just that. I have tried several products from Instanatural and I Love then brand especially because its all natural. There’s nothing better than putting natural ingredients on your skin. It’s just one less headache for worrying over harmful products. I found that the product delivers, I do have a baby which equals to little sleep which leads to puffy eyes and dark circles. So with that being said I willing to try just about anything but not everything delivers. The product is smooth and not sticky and a little goes a long way. What I notice after just one use was brightness in my eye area.&lt;br /&gt; Youth Express screams try me now!</li>
            <li> After a week of use I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. I actually think my under eye area looks more swollen.  Not impressed so far.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye serum.  It comes with a nice dropper so you don&#x27;t have to waste any.  I do not have dark circles so can&#x27;t speak for that, but the fine lines around my eyes are definitely improving with use.  The first time I put it around my eyes, I was a little surprised that it felt &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;, but I guess that is how it works.  It also smells lovely - like oranges.  Definitely recommend for puffiness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> A little bit thick to apply and gives off an orange colour under your eyes (would scare whoever you&#x27;re sleeping next to!). Smells like vitamin C only.&lt;br /&gt;But woke up with under eyes pulled and healthy. Would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this.  Dark circles are slowly improving.</li>
            <li> Very excited to start using this. I see great reviews and for what i received at a great price.</li>
            <li> The Eye Serum definitely feels like it has lightened and tightened the skin under and around my eyes, but the dark orange color can give your skin an orange shade if you put too much on. (it is the product color, it doesn&#x27;t change the color of your skin)  But, I do like what the product has done and I am not through the first bottle. Will I purchase again, definitely.  For this price, it works better for me than the department store products I have purchased in the past. (and cost $80 to $100 or more)</li>
            <li> This serum feels great and smells nice. It is orange in color, but once applied the color disappears. Love that it has all natural ingredients. Hoping to see a difference as time goes by.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye serum for about 2 weeks and I can see a difference in the puffiness  under my eyes. The dark circles are also looking much better. So glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Works great for eliminating puffiness in the morning!</li>
            <li> READ MY FULL REVIEW HERE: [...]    After daily use, it definitely helps, and it&#x27;s a great product for students like me who probably get 10 hours of sleep a week. There&#x27;s an eye gel I have my eyes on too, but for now I recommend this product, which is available on Amazon. InstaNatural is a cruelty free brand and have a big range of products, so do check them out.</li>
            <li> Awesome, works very well with the Gel, highly recomended</li>
            <li> excellent I use it everyday</li>
            <li> As an older adult I have recently begun using InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Eye Serum, and after only two weeks I see remarkable results!  Over the years I have tried numerous skin creams and lotions, but this is  one of those rare preparations which lives  up  to its promises at a very affordable price.  Keep up the great work!</li>
            <li> i tried this out, but it made no noticeable difference after 6 weeks for me.  at 6 weeks it made the area around one of my eyes break out with a couple pimples, so i had to throw it away.  only positive is that it smells nice</li>
            <li> I have recently started using vitamin C based products on my face, and an extremely pleased to add this to my daily regimen.  Results are quick - this brightens the skin, helps reduce wrinkles, smells great, and a little goes a long way.  This is a great value and you get a lot in the bottle and only need a little bit on each application.  I also noticed it helps your concealer/makeup go on more smoothly.  There is definitely a reduction in under eye circles after a short time of using this product.  Causes no irritation on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product. Arrived on time.  Will update once I&#x27;ve tried.  Wish it was 100% organic</li>
            <li> Amazingly it does help help with dark circles, and puffiness. However, one BIG thing, I didn&#x27;t like about this product is the orange tint that leave under your eyes. I know you can cover up with a little bit of concealer, but sometimes I just don&#x27;t want to wear any. The purpose of using this was to use less concealer to cover up my dark circles. I tried using as little as possible, but it still bothers me. I only use it at night where no one see me as much. Lol</li>
            <li> I am in love with this InstaNatural Eye Serum!!  My eyes had never looked better!! My Dark circles and puffiness are going away. This is a product that every person that suffers from Dark circles, puffiness wrinkles, and fine lines should use I totally recommend it..&lt;br /&gt;Ps. I use it under my makeup it helps me cover up and it fades the darkness away.. I use this product with the Youth Express Eye Gel and Retinol moisturizer they work great together.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Product provided for free for testing purposes”</li>
            <li> This leaves your face a little orange, people though I was wearing make up!</li>
            <li> This has a funky bright orange color.  It is doing a great job of removing sun damage around the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t considering this product, but I wanted to take advantage of their coupon codes. So, I went for it. I am glad I did. It is perfect for use with their Eye Gel. You only need a drop, anymore than that is too much (from experience). I put a drop on my fingertip then I rub it in. It dries quickly and you see instant results. If you want long term results, than the eye gel is needed as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is orange and smells like oranges. I think the orange color is what gives you that instant results; it seems to hide the blue/purple tint in dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a solid month, as directed, day and night and I have noticed no change to any darkness, fine lines, or bags under my eyes. I&#x27;m usually impressed with their products, but not this one</li>
            <li> I recently fell crazy in love with the InstaNatural Vitamin C serum for face, so I was pleased to also get to try this formula for the eyes. My skin on my face was absolutely transformed by the facial serum, so I am sure this is doing just as much good for the eye area. Now, since I don&#x27;t have any obvious eye issues to speak of, I am a little more limited about what I can say for this product. I have a little puffiness I am dealing with, but it is a medical issue and I am not shocked to see no change there. After using this product and the Eye Gel I can say that I like the way they both absorb. This product is orange as opposed to the yellow facial serum, but beyond that they seem very similar in consistency and absorption. My skin is looking really fantastic using InstaNatural products, so glad to find that the positive reviews are well deserved! I have to note that this product was received free for testing purposes, but I am planning to continue to use this product along with the Vitamin C serum for face.</li>
            <li> This serum works as well or better than any of the much more expensive eye serums I&#x27;ve tried.  I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already seeing marked improvement in wrinkles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> The eye serum seems to work good. The only thing is it leaves a slight orange tint.  It smells great and makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Definitely improved the puffiness of my eyes. Also reduced fine lines in my forehead.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. What I have noticed the most is the isn&#x27;t forming it does, while reducing puffiness. I will update the review after I have gone through the bottle.</li>
            <li> I like how this serum helps the eye gel glide under my eyes with less tugging. In my opinion I think it helps boost the effects of the eye gel. I have no irritation and it does not burn being so close to my eyes either. Its not sticky unless you put on way to much. It dries very nicely and leave no residue. It helps to immediately tighten my eyes in a pleasant way. I think because of the serum I&#x27;m seeing faster improvement of my dark circles. I will continue to use with my eye gel. Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I like it. Not yet used to the Orange color but easy application around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Love it! I apply in the morning under my makeup and it instantly brightens my eyes and it had made a huge difference in my under eye wrinkles which is one of my problem areas</li>
            <li> I can see fine line around my eyes slowly disappear</li>
            <li> The product comes in an opaque bottle with a dropper.  It has an orangey-red color with a slight citrusy scent, but you can&#x27;t really smell it once it is on your skin. The consistency is pretty runny.  I usually dispense a large drop from the dropper and distribute between my ring fingers and put onto my eyes.  I will massage it in for about 1 minute and it absorbs pretty well.  I will use another eye cream to seal the moisture in.  I am pretty happy with the product.  I didn&#x27;t expect a magic product that will erase my dark circle or wrinkles in a snap, but I like it keeping my eye area well-moisturized during the day and over the night.  No irritation or bad reaction at all.  Nice eye serum for me!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I really like the InstaNatural product line. Products that I received generally do what it promises.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells like oranges and it seems to be helping with my morning puffiness. My eyes also do not seem so dark.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin. Great purchase!! I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes was firmer with just one use. I have noticed a reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles since using this. After two weeks, my eyes have never looked better! Dark circles are much lighter and my skin is tighter and firmer! You only use a pea size amount of serum for both eyes, so the bottle will last a long time. I am happy to recieve this serum to review.</li>
            <li> The formula had a floral-citrus scent.  It was dispensed out of a dropper, so I felt that I had to really be sparing with it. That ended up being a good thing because a little goes a long way.  The serum absorbed immediately; if applied in the morning, I wouldn’t have to wait to put on makeup afterwards.  The eye serum didn’t have the instant results I noticed with the gel, but it did seem to brighten my complexion.  I’ll continue to use the serum and hope to see those bags disappear altogether. I received this product to review. Opinions shared here are mine.</li>
            <li> Great Eye Serum. It is a pleasant citrus smell almost- like oranges? I have been using it for about a week now and see the fine lines decreasing. I hope it helps with the discoloration too. I got a great discount for this product to give it a try and let them know what I think! I would recommend this and buy again!</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in caring for my face by preventing the signs of aging as in doing is virtually impossible. I got to use youth express eye syrum for free simply by agreeing to write a review. This syrum has a slight citrus scent, it goes on thin not thick, a bit silky, and dried fast. It left my skin feeling soft. After using it for 2 weeks, my skin did appear more hydrated and I noticed smoother looking skin w/ no fine lines. I recommend trying Youth Express and seeing for yourself.</li>
            <li> I use this serum together with the eye gel and have had great results. Large bottles and work better than the algenist eye balm I was using  plus a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Bright orange, light and silky texture, absorbs easily into the skin.  Right after I ordered, the company sent me an email with helpful tips and tricks for how to apply this product.  You simply pat a tiny bit of the serum into the under-eye area with your ring finger to minimize tugging or pulling on the delicate eye skin.  Pat it in lightly until it is absorbed and the bright orange color dissipates (and supposedly counteracts dark circles).  I don&#x27;t have huge dark circle problems, so I can&#x27;t attest to that - but it is light and refreshing and a pleasant experience to use - I do get bags and puffiness and this does feel really good on tired eyes.  The packaging is really high-end in an amber glass dropper bottle to protect the ingredients from damaging light.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Did not help remove the puffiness around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement in under eye circles. It&#x27;s pretty hydrating though, so I will finish the bottle, but not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two weeks now and will continue to use it!  I do see that the dark circle under my eyes have lightened up!  So happy! My dark circles have faded. The puffy eyes are improving!</li>
            <li> I was always told there was nothing I could do about dark circles because it was &amp;#34;hereditary&amp;#34;. Well I was happy to say that is not necessarily true. It took sometime but it worked. This eye serum helped a lot. just a drop of the serum was enough to do both eyes. I have noticed the puffiness has diminished and the darkness isn&#x27;t as bad. I was surprised by the bright orange color but it does soak right into the skin. I would recommend using it at night because it did leave a slight orange coloring to my skin.</li>
            <li> This pRoDuct has been great thus far. Odor is very appealing.  I only need a little bit so it seems to be able to last a while.  Skin around eyes seems healthier</li>
            <li> Used on my husbands face, improved is baggy eyes.</li>
            <li> not reducing my dark circles yet</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of weeks and I am thrilled with the results.  It was also delivered when promised and very well packaged</li>
            <li> I really like this one and I feel that it has definitely helped to soften the fine lines around my outer eye area. It has helped with the dark circles too.  This serum is thicker and it is an orange color.  It also has a wonderful orange scent smell to it that does not seem chemically at all.  It is quite thick and you only need a small amount so the bottle will last for a long time.  You don&#x27;t even need a full dropper full to cover both of your eyes.  I did use this at night before sleep. The directions state to use it both in the morning and night and you can wear makeup over the serum.  It comes packaged so that it will not leak and it has a safety seal present.  It does have an expiration date and mine expires 5/16.  Yes I would suggest this product and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Im Greek and have terrine black circles. This works better than any dark circle product i have used. two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Feels great, smells great, and is the perfect addition to my skincare arsenal. The fine lines under my eyes look a lot better. I&#x27;m still waiting to see about my dark circles, but overall I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product has a pleasant smell and feels good on your skin. After 3 days use, I noticed improvement in under eye hydration and looked less tired.</li>
            <li> So glad this was a good product, good price to buy. Once you feel is best - use it the better the effect seems to appear.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have noticed with every application the fine lines,  wrinkles softening, and puffiness around my eyes go down.  I have used may face products in my day and this it tops hands down. I use it all over my face and to my surprise have noticed my age spots disappearing.  I am on my second bottle and will keep ordering .  Can&#x27;t get to much of a good thing! Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> A very good serum for eyes, I really like it</li>
            <li> Hmmm been using... not seeing changes... at all... hate the feeling of money... I&#x27;ve used another product in the past and I seen results in a day or two... Been using for a dew months... Does absolutely nothing.... Kinda makes it worse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this eye serum for about two weeks but I do like it very much. It&#x27;s very thick so a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s also orange and while it doesn&#x27;t transfer color on me it might on some people preventing them from using during the day. I&#x27;d pre-test this just to be sure whether it&#x27;ll transfer color on you or not.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have terribly dark circles but this seems to have helped with the bluish tint that is there. I seem to need less concealer to start the day out with, that&#x27;s always good. The manufacturer followed up with an email to me on instructional use for optimum results with this product. Honestly, I have to admit being impressed with that. That was a first for me and I do appreciate that they took extra step.&lt;br /&gt;I will follow up when I&#x27;m finished with the product to see what the results truly were upon full usage.</li>
            <li> So far I can say I like it ALTHOUGH I can&#x27;t say that I have seen any drastic changes but I do know these things take time but what I do like is that it is light, a little goes a long way, it absorbs very quickly and it doesn&#x27;t feel like its sitting on top of my skin and It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes look worst than what they did before applying which has been the case for other eye serums, gels, creams I&#x27;ve used. That in my book is a plus. The serum is orange and I apply this in the morning after cleansing and toning my face and I do not notice any leftover tint from the color. It has a pleasant scent. It smells like orange creamsicles to me. :-)</li>
            <li> Wife likes. Wants you to use it again.</li>
            <li> I like the InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel much better. It seems to absorbs better and has a skin tightening feel the eye serum does not.  I would not purchase the eye serum again.</li>
            <li> I use this serum every day in the morning. I love the way it looks, feels, and smells... I actually use it all over my face. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks healthier and more moisturized. It does have a very orange color to it, but like another review stated, the orange color helps cover those dark purple circles.</li>
            <li> I finished the bottle , but i can&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> has help my dark circles</li>
            <li> The bottle comes with a dropper and the serum is thick liquid that is orange in color but it smells good.  It has vitamin c, plant stem cells, hyaluronic acid, caffeine, and other ingredients to help with hydration and fine lines and wrinkles. This product has helped the bags under my eyes seem less pronounced so far and has moisturized the area around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I just turned 42 and the 6 other expensive serums were no longer effective, In fact not sure they ever were, but they came with huge claims and raves and a considerable price tag,. I started to notice some lines around my eyes, ever so small, but never the less noticeable , and some puffiness in the morning, runs in my family, never thought I d get those however. I made an appointment with DR. Orion in Bev Hills due to one of the procedures he does for the eyes which in non-eveassive and when I heard the price tag: 2900 USD I thought since the problem is so faint I may look around and especially since I am currently detoxing from a mercury toxicity, I thought maybe not to rush into spending the huge amount and find alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;after spending hours reading reviews and frustration with the freeloaders who give bogus, looong reviews, neveeeeeer really specifying their personal experience with the notable skin improvements, I thought I might just give it a try and hope for the best&lt;br /&gt;Great product I bought the face serum along with it. I t does or must be followed by a rich moisturizer, or at least for the over 40&#x27;s crowd, . A week later, I see a tremendous improvement.  no more Puffiness although I am still in the turbo detox mode, and the lines around my eyes are hardly noticeble., I still see them hardly, I do not botox and so there fore my face is not frozen in time which I love, because that is natural and beautiful to my taste. The serum is delicious and It absorbs rt in, wonderful scent, i only wish it came with a pump to prevent oxidation upon each time the bottle is opened. I also with this company would stop giving out the product for free to those who leave silly reviews, like listing the ingredients what what they are suppose to do</li>
            <li> A little bit more challenging to use than the gel pump version but it also makes eye products go on well and reduce my puffiness and dark circles. I recommend storing this in the fridge for an extra depuffing effect!!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this eye serum! I was sent a bottle to review which I&#x27;m so thankful for. When I saw that this was a bright orange, it was interesting to me. However, it blends in well and I don&#x27;t notice any orange residue near my eyes. I have hereditary dark circles that are hard to cover, even with concealer. This had been helping with that a little, and I&#x27;m noticing my dehydration lines getting plumped up as I use it. Great product InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to really appreciate what it does</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It deserves its positive reviews. It brightens the area around the eyes. Noticeable changes, particularly if you drink  two liters of water per day, but it also works on its own.</li>
            <li> Really helps with dark circles!</li>
            <li> I can tell a little difference but not a significant change yet.</li>
            <li> Its real good its a product that cost the money</li>
            <li> This product works well for fine lines around the eyes.  I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in the few shorts weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!  I actually see a difference!  I also use it on my face and feel it’s improving my skin’s texture without creating blemishes – still a problem at 40-something years of age!</li>
            <li> Awesome product ... after a few applications the results are truly amazing. I have very bad dark circles and I have tried several branded eye cream in the market but Nothing beats InstaNatural .... it&#x27;s a must have. My mother and sister were impressed and decided to switch to several of InstaNatural products. I am very pleased with my purchase. Thank You</li>
            <li> I used for 2 weeks, I did not see any result for my dark circles. but it smells good. Hope it works.</li>
            <li> I use this twice per day, morning and night.  Great price.  Appreciated the friendly email with detailed instructions on how to apply.  InstaNatural has me as a customer for life !!!  I will look into InstaNatural&#x27;s other products.&lt;br /&gt;It works JUST AS WELL as the grossly overpriced eye serum sold in the malls (those two mall stores with hip-dressed-in-black high pressure sales people.).</li>
            <li> Will buy again. Great with bags under your eyes. Makes you look refresher as ever. Faster shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye serum for InstaNatural. I recently started developing wrinkle around my eyes and this has really helped make them not noticeable. It has also helped with my puffiness and dark circles. It is easy to apply and absorbs quickly. It does not bother my sensitive skin either. I received to review and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes was firmer with just one use. I have noticed a reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles since using this. After two weeks, my eyes have never looked better! Dark circles are much lighter and my skin is tighter and firmer! You only use a pea size amount of serum for both eyes, so the bottle will last a long time. I am happy to recieve this serum to review.</li>
            <li> The orange colored serum has a pleasant hint of citrus fragrance and comes in a dark glass bottle with a dropper applicator. I have been using the eye serum for a couple of weeks now and have applied it right after taking off my eye make-up at night. Once drop of the serum under the eye is enough and is absorbed quickly by the skin. I was a bit worried about messing up my pillow, but since the serum is absorbed quickly, this did not become an issue. SInce I have used the Insta Natural Eye Serum I have noticed that my eyes don&#x27;t look as puffy as usual. So would I recommend this product? I don&#x27;t know how well it performs with dark circles, but overall I think it keeps the area around my eyes hydrated and definitely puffiness has become a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago and I am absolutely loving the improvements so far.  One thing I have noticed since I started using the eye serum in both the am and the pm is it is really starting to brighten under my eyes.  I have a tendency, being in my late 30&#x27;s to look tired and this has helped brighten up my appearance.  The serum has a very clean citrus smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My eyes look amazing since I began using this serum</li>
            <li> Good&lt;br /&gt;Ship is very quick&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy&lt;br /&gt;Because I get good itemed</li>
            <li> Great bang for you buck in terms of price! I found this eye serum to be effective while still gentle.  It does take awhile to dry so it&#x27;s best for night time use if you&#x27;re like me and in a hurry to get out the door in the morning.</li>
            <li> At first I was shocked by the orange color of the serum!! But I tried it any way for the dark circle under my eyes due to lack of sleep and I was quite surprised that it worked after a few uses. Do not let the color of the serum scare you away. I also let me mom, 61, give it a try and she said it has also worked wonder for her age spots!! We are continue to use and buy ;)</li>
            <li> this serum is fantastic I have been using it for 3 weeks and have noticed a brightness firmness and overalldiminishing of the fine lines that I haveas I continue to use it I&#x27;m sure it will get better and better. I also have the eye gel which I absolutely love and highly recommend. this company has a lot of really great products that I have tried if you like to put things that are good for you on your skin I would recommend trying anything in their product line</li>
            <li> I love the citrus scent on this serum.  Both my husband and I use it morning and night. It&#x27;s light enough for make up and not greasy at all.  Thank you.</li>
    </ol>
