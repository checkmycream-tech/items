            <li>I love this stamping plate</li>
            <li>The plates look good, exactly as pictured on site.  </li>
            <li>but once I did the stamp came out perfect it really helps if you have a good stamping polish to get a clean clear stamp and a credit card helps too</li>
            <li>and I used a different plate with a lace design along with it and its beautiful</li>
            <li>BUT Be very aware!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this stamping plate all too often that I&#x27;ve forgotten if this order is now my fourth or fifth purchase LOL.</li>
            <li>For my first design I ended up doing the C&#x27;s on my nails across the bottom and on top</li>
            <li>I did this because I think it will look nice for New Years Eve and my nails usually stay chip proof for about a week so it will be perfect.</li>
            <li>5 Stars, this plate is so cool</li>
            <li>totally love it came in pretty fast definately worth waiting for all my friends love it</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t seem to get the full stamp on nail.</li>
            <li>This plate is really cool because of all the logos on it</li>
            <li>, i love it, it has all my favorite logo especially the Channel.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and packaged to protect the product.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I really have created unique nail art designs</li>
            <li>My favorite is the chanel stamp it looks so classy and was easy and clear to stamp without a problem.</li>
            <li>You will enjoy having this for your collection, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I received the shipment super fast.</li>
            <li>Click on this link if you&#x27;re interested:</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Get compliments everytime I flash the rabbit ;-)</li>
            <li>, it looks expensive and elegant and if your good at thinking about the right colors to use it can look like you got designer nails, it&#x27;s something I would wear for a night</li>
            <li>image stamps clean and clear.</li>
            <li>I believe its great how it&#x27;s not just one logo and a bunch of unnecessary stamps on the plate.</li>
            <li>oh and also would have appreciated a description to all of them.</li>
            <li>I really think this is a quality product</li>
            <li>thank you for fast shipping but images do not appear.</li>
            <li>I use it often and really like the effect on the nail beds.</li>
            <li>, I am really thinking of painting it multicolor (</li>
            <li>If you adore this stamping plate for the Chanel logo as much as I do, look out for the stamping plate made particularly for Chanel logos.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s good for a little and the big stamps.</li>
            <li>I mainly bought it for the cancer ribbon.</li>
            <li>and so far I have really liked these plates from this seller, it was hard to decide what to stamp first, I like the fact it has an apple on it</li>
            <li>For the price, this plate is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>early 90&#x27;s maybe over gray because then it will really look like a computer, and there&#x27;s the bunny</li>
            <li>(actually the major reason I bought this I collect like everything with that logo from perfumes to jewelery and many other items.)</li>
            <li>When I went to peel off the protective film the \\&quot;LV\\&quot; (which was actually the whole reason I bought this) is scratched OUT right down the middle.</li>
            <li>Need to use thick polish so that you  can get a clean and clear image.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Stupid how nail plates have such random designs together on one plate</li>
            <li> and I AM SO MAD.</li>
            <li> Too bad you can&#x27;t use any nail polish, had to be konad.</li>

            <li> This would have to be my favorite plate of the three I had purchased. I believe its great how it&#x27;s not just one logo and a bunch of unnecessary stamps on the plate. Also, did I mention one of the stamps is chanel which is my fav.</li>
            <li> My plate did not come scratched, just the blue part looks that way...I pulled off the blue and it was perfect I never did nail stamping before so it took me a minute to figure it out but once I did the stamp came out perfect it really helps if you have a good stamping polish to get a clean clear stamp and a credit card helps too, I also bought the Konad double sided Stamper with it and that&#x27;s good for a little and the big stamps. I also bought the other plate from this seller to make the back design.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I received this plate in the mail! When I went to peel off the protective film the \\&quot;LV\\&quot; (which was actually the whole reason I bought this) is scratched OUT right down the middle. Just my luck. I am so disappointed! I hope the seller resolves this issue and gives me a replacement.</li>
            <li> The stamping plate was just what I wanted! It came in record time and I love the way they look on my nails!</li>
            <li> I really have created unique nail art designs w/this plate &amp; would love more designer plates:  example..Gucci, DG, spelled out Coco Channel oh and also would have appreciated a description to all of them.</li>

I use it often and really like the effect on the nail beds. Get compliments everytime I flash the rabbit ;-)</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Item as described. I mainly bought it for the cancer ribbon. Stupid how nail plates have such random designs together on one plate but I knew what I was ordering so its okay. Happy with transaction.</li>
