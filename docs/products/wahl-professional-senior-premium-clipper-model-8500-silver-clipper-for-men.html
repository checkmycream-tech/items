            <li>When it cuts it cuts good</li>
            <li>no problem with these seniors you don&#x27;t even need a detachable clipper unless you want one, and also they give a good taper fade, these clippers are buffalo soldiers.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on good sets of clippers and came across this one.  </li>
            <li>Good quality at a good price.</li>
            <li>They cut good.</li>
            <li>These clippers are exactly as good as everyone says.</li>

            <li>I really love these clippers!</li>
            <li>and it does a better job than this $100 &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; clipper!</li>
            <li>great clippers cut smooth</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing clippers.</li>
            <li>Great for fades and runs beautifully smooth.</li>
            <li>she was esctatic to receive these as a gift and the price was AMAZING</li>
            <li>Amazing clippers in every way but</li>
            <li>But this clippers are amazing</li>
            <li>use this for trimming both my hair and beard, and I&#x27;ve found it effective for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after 5 min used, it getting warm on the handle.</li>
            <li>The senior is better because the body is all metal, the armature inside is more sturdy, wahl clipper guards fit best on the senior, the blades are signicantly improved from a walmart wahl.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t feel like I had time to write an honest review .</li>
            <li>I started to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally I asked a friend who runs his own salon for advice.  </li>
            <li>but i honestly don&#x27;t think i will have to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a pro, I just cut my kids and my own hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and comfy.</li>
            <li>These clippers are by far the best ive had.</li>
            <li>The purchaser was a pleasure to do business with, the clippers arrived early and they were in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>The best we have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Good motor precise cuts.</li>
            <li>The clipper is great but be sure to read the instructions I thought I try it out on myself and chose what I thought looked like the right length.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Senior does cut better than a home clipper.</li>
            <li>in couple more months...</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and these are my favorite clippers everrr.</li>
            <li>My favorite clippers.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>i love them</li>
            <li>Okay,  </li>
            <li>At the price point, you will not find better clippers.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite clippers.</li>
            <li>but they are more durable and have more power than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>For sure.</li>
            <li>I lower my facial hair to stubble once a week and this puppy does the job, perfectly.</li>
            <li>This item gets too hot after 20 minutes!!!</li>
            <li>These work great but not as good as my limited edition ones.</li>
            <li>Cuts hair super nice.</li>
            <li>What it did do was give me a nice crisp fade!</li>
            <li>they cut very quick and don&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li>Easy to service.</li>
            <li>Plenty of power and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, well balanced.</li>
            <li>Strong motor.</li>
            <li>Product works fine.</li>
            <li>Shipment was quick and packaging was appropriate.</li>
            <li>bough this one as a gift; my original is still going strong after 15 years</li>
            <li>Overall I think wahl clippers are generally great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember if you buy that it is important to oil your blades often or the product will wear out quicker.</li>
            <li>Regarding that issue i dont feel comfortable working with it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>but you have to watch who you buy them from, these clipper are powerful will and able to mow threw all kinds of hair like nothing</li>
            <li>recommend to buy and enjoy.</li>
            <li>but they make my oster fast feeds feel like a piece of junk, these are much more powerful and because of that they do warm up a bit</li>
            <li>works great after months of use.  would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>the wahls seniors are a great clipper to learn with especially because they are adjustable</li>
            <li>Smooth motor operation.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>This is a far superior clipper compared to the Wahl I bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li>Cuts hair easy and machine stays cool.</li>
            <li>My daughter is studying to be a hair dresser and these came highly recommended from several hair dressers and barbers as the best.</li>
            <li>The cut is precise and quick.</li>
            <li>Great clippers, not real noisy and</li>
            <li>Work good and last if taken care of</li>
            <li>I found them after looking thru online reviews and everything ppl claim about these is absolutely true.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, powerful, comfortable to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li>also good company too order from, don&#x27;t be worried they&#x27;re definitely band</li>
            <li>Very Nice, just what I expected for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>I was able to replace the cord on the older clippers and realign the blades</li>
            <li>They are quite and do not heat up quickly.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews I was worried the machine was gonna warmup quick and burn my head</li>
            <li>This time around, I thought that I would get the better one with the expectation that it would last me 10 or more years.  </li>
            <li>Great clippers cut very well only problem is that they do run hot so make sure to have a back up for bulk and use these for detail also invest in a fade blade if you want an even cleaner sharper cut just a tip other than that great clippers!</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, it was in the first 30 days</li>
            <li>These cut very clean and are Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>You have to go through the same section 3-5 times to make sure its all cut evenly!</li>
            <li>Plus I noticed pretty much any Wahl guard&#x27;s fit right onto them with a snug fit.</li>
            <li>These cut my husbands very thick hair great!!</li>
            <li>They do get a little warm with prolonged use, but are far superior to any clippers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>but that is not a problem, it does get warm to the touch, however, I only cut 1 or 2 persons at a time.</li>
            <li>I found a really useful video on the company website.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>These clippers are worth the money</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too powerful for my needs and sparks come out each time I turn the lever</li>
            <li>clipper has a nice heft too it, it feels SOLID and hums authoritatively without buzzing or clacking.  </li>
            <li>I like senior with Wahl more softly.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor, cuts like a dream.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using Wahl clippers to cut my own hair for the last twenty years.  </li>
            <li>Very quiet, easy to grip,very easy to do haircuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He was absolutely right.  </li>
            <li>For the right amount.</li>
            <li>Nice and weighted and is the exact same one my sister in law uses in her salon.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping, this machine is super powerful.</li>
            <li>They are solid in construction and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I am a pro in thos profetion, and a i said that this machine its very good, work well and very hard</li>
            <li>It is heavier, but seems to allow more control, cuts precisely, and I&#x27;m more confident while cutting their hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought these and midway through the first trim..the bottom blade snapped....</li>
            <li>but I took two stars off because of the way the clippers looked when I first got them they looked like they have been used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not sure if they are the real deal , first day at work with them they seem great no complaints</li>
            <li>I am a licensed cosmetologist, they were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments since I started using this razor and definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a change.</li>
            <li>oh well, Such is life :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had them for a couple months, and I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>The first haircut my wife gave me with this took about two minutes and never caught or pulled.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I noticed a burnt smell when they got a hot.</li>
            <li>Exactly What i needed.</li>
            <li>And they still work as well as when i first got em.</li>
            <li>I would like the top to be metal instead of plastic, but no big deal.</li>
            <li>Ironically, on the two haircuts that I did get, I noticed that the quality was better but that doesn&#x27;t help, if it doesn&#x27;t work or doesn&#x27;t last!</li>
            <li>I returned the first one and bought another thinking</li>
            <li>This replaces my first one that lasted 17 years..</li>
            <li>They are heavy weight and have a good balanced feel to them.  </li>
            <li>I cut my own thick hair as easily as any barber I have ever been to.  </li>
            <li>Very well made, smooth, quiet, and clean cut.  </li>
            <li>They also get pretty hot - thanks to the metal body.</li>
            <li>The senior is very simular to a regular walmart wahl, but it is better.</li>
            <li>But, I wasn&#x27;t even able to locate what part of the clipper hit the floor first; it was unaffected.  </li>
            <li>I am a hairdresser and honestly something is not right about them.</li>
            <li>Solid, reliable, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly do business with them again.</li>
            <li>This Wahl has been a great replacement for the cheaper-quality set I previously purchased at our local big-box store.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves this clipper, she can cut all day long , it feels strong, and won&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>We live on a boat and do our own haircuts on the guys and tried a couple of other clippers.  </li>
            <li>A very helpful guy said these.</li>
            <li>Fast clippers, do not clog.  </li>
            <li>I use these to cut my hair and beard and they work very well.</li>
            <li>But my husband really enjoys the clippers I got for him to use.</li>
            <li>but I used only cheap ~$20 razors from Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li>I was on the fence about spending so much for a razor</li>
            <li>its the real deal</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go cheap, get these, and get extra guides.</li>
            <li>Very durable clippers.</li>
            <li>Very rugged and durable.</li>
            <li>The razor is making a grinding noise intermittently very unprofessional for salon work</li>
            <li>I used them for the first time today and they are very loud.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and it does the job, but it&#x27;s very slick</li>
            <li>new clippers don&#x27;t have to worry about being used and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to finish in less than 30 minutes,</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty coarse, and it cuts it like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>Very heavy duty and great long term investment.</li>
            <li>These clippers are highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>cuts very smoothly; a high quality clipper.</li>
            <li>Others have commented on the quality of this manufacturer, and I would have to agree it is worth the extra price</li>
            <li>Has more of a heavy duty feel.</li>
            <li>These do a great job but my barber (my wife) says they are a little heavy for her.</li>
            <li>The model I purchased has the new 9000v motor and is not noisy at all.  </li>
            <li>He had been saying he needed new clippers for a couple months already.  </li>
            <li>but I live in Fla.</li>
            <li>and it was brand new.</li>
            <li>IT DIDNT LOOK NEW.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money ive only done acouple cuts with them so far</li>
            <li>Very loud.</li>
            <li>this is a option worth considering, otherwise a lot of other machines will do a respectable job for less.</li>
            <li>I definitely plan on investing in more Wahl clippers in the future because they are already paying for themselves since I haven&#x27;t gone back to the barber since.</li>
            <li>Overall they work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>After making the first pass I had no choice but to finish giving myself a military super short cut.</li>
            <li>Its a good clipper ,im not a barber or anything still learning how to cut hair but it cuts well and works for me,gets hot at about an hour of cutting,</li>
            <li>but the second was just as loud as the first.</li>
            <li>I dropped it hard on a tile floor and felt sure I must have damaged it.</li>
            <li>Sturdy design and great cutting capacity.  </li>
            <li>Works as promised, instructions for use and care are clear.  </li>
            <li>The quality far exceeds my expectations.  </li>
            <li>but I felt it was time to replace my old clipper.  </li>
            <li>Professional grade.&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li>They even arrived a day early.</li>
            <li>its better to just use an open 1 guard or an open empty clipper for that matter</li>
            <li>(30 year old guy) to save money and time to the barber.</li>
            <li>I am a professional barber</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s not really a firm grip.</li>
            <li>Have used this 4x on my dog so far</li>
            <li>The blade was wonky like many others have noted, but the instructions tell you how to align them.</li>
            <li>, it was way too loud.</li>
            <li>Professional quality.</li>
            <li>The blades do need to be aligned straight from the box which is expected and stated in the small manual, I did my fade in 15 minutes and the machine never shut down on me as one unlucky reviewer has experienced and also i did notice a respectable amount of heat, nothing serious,  </li>
            <li>Pretty funny because I have full head of hair and my friends and family were pretty shocked</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side, compared to a Five Star clipper, but it&#x27;s good for barbering, overall.</li>
            <li>I wanted a strong long lasting professional grade clipper that will live 10 years as did my previous clipper.</li>
            <li>It tends to run a little hot after awhile but that might have more to do with me taking a little longer while getting used to cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li>As a professional machine it doesnt meet my expectation because in less than 10 minutes it become so hot.</li>
            <li>My son in particular dreaded them they were so long and unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars but the motor gets hot really fast, but I still think that you should at least give it a try.</li>
            <li>I was unaware that the Wahl Professional Clipper was made so well.  </li>
            <li>My wife is a professional and will only use this brand.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by cheaper models.</li>
            <li>just remember they have to be broken in before they work the way your favorite clippers do.</li>
            <li>I was tired of replacing clippers every couple years and decided to purchase a better product.  </li>
            <li>While they are a tad heavy she is getting used to them, well worth the money  </li>
            <li>The  blades  are not  very sharp.</li>
            <li>I used other guides from other kits and the seem to work better on other clippers than on this model.</li>
            <li>Not long after I bought this clipper</li>
            <li>Not only will this razor cut through your hair like a hot knife through butter, but it cuts it evenly each time which cuts down the overall time it takes for each cut.</li>
            <li>Yeah, they are a little pricey, but they are well worth the investment as you will save in the long run.  </li>
            <li>Gets hot fast, and all in all, just does a poor</li>
            <li>I had a less expensive WAHL clipper for 20+ years that I loved and when it died decided to upgrade.</li>
            <li>but the price was a little to much for my budget especially after adding $20 for guide combs.</li>

            <li> When it cuts it cuts good</li>
            <li> no problem with these seniors you don&#x27;t even need a detachable clipper unless you want one, and also they give a good taper fade, these clippers are buffalo soldiers.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on good sets of clippers and came across this one.  </li>
            <li> Good quality at a good price.</li>

            <li> and it does a better job than this $100 &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; clipper!</li>
            <li> great clippers cut smooth</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing clippers.</li>
            <li> Great for fades and runs beautifully smooth.</li>
            <li> she was esctatic to receive these as a gift and the price was AMAZING</li>
            <li> Amazing clippers in every way but</li>
            <li> But this clippers are amazing</li>
            <li> use this for trimming both my hair and beard, and I&#x27;ve found it effective for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after 5 min used, it getting warm on the handle.</li>
            <li> The senior is better because the body is all metal, the armature inside is more sturdy, wahl clipper guards fit best on the senior, the blades are signicantly improved from a walmart wahl.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t feel like I had time to write an honest review .</li>
            <li> I started to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally I asked a friend who runs his own salon for advice.  </li>
            <li> but i honestly don&#x27;t think i will have to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a pro, I just cut my kids and my own hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and comfy.</li>
            <li> These clippers are by far the best ive had.</li>
            <li> The purchaser was a pleasure to do business with, the clippers arrived early and they were in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> The best we have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Good motor precise cuts.</li>
            <li> The clipper is great but be sure to read the instructions I thought I try it out on myself and chose what I thought looked like the right length.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Senior does cut better than a home clipper.</li>
            <li> in couple more months...</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and these are my favorite clippers everrr.</li>
            <li> My favorite clippers.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> i love them</li>
            <li> Okay,  </li>
            <li> At the price point, you will not find better clippers.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite clippers.</li>
            <li> but they are more durable and have more power than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> For sure.</li>
            <li> I lower my facial hair to stubble once a week and this puppy does the job, perfectly.</li>
            <li> This item gets too hot after 20 minutes!!!</li>
            <li> These work great but not as good as my limited edition ones.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair super nice.</li>
            <li> What it did do was give me a nice crisp fade!</li>
            <li> they cut very quick and don&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> Easy to service.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, well balanced.</li>
            <li> Strong motor.</li>
            <li> Product works fine.</li>
            <li> Shipment was quick and packaging was appropriate.</li>
            <li> bough this one as a gift; my original is still going strong after 15 years</li>
            <li> Overall I think wahl clippers are generally great</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember if you buy that it is important to oil your blades often or the product will wear out quicker.</li>
            <li> Regarding that issue i dont feel comfortable working with it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> but you have to watch who you buy them from, these clipper are powerful will and able to mow threw all kinds of hair like nothing</li>
            <li> recommend to buy and enjoy.</li>
            <li> but they make my oster fast feeds feel like a piece of junk, these are much more powerful and because of that they do warm up a bit</li>
            <li> works great after months of use.  would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> the wahls seniors are a great clipper to learn with especially because they are adjustable</li>
            <li> Smooth motor operation.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> This is a far superior clipper compared to the Wahl I bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair easy and machine stays cool.</li>
            <li> My daughter is studying to be a hair dresser and these came highly recommended from several hair dressers and barbers as the best.</li>
            <li> The cut is precise and quick.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, not real noisy and</li>
            <li> Work good and last if taken care of</li>
            <li> I found them after looking thru online reviews and everything ppl claim about these is absolutely true.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, powerful, comfortable to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> also good company too order from, don&#x27;t be worried they&#x27;re definitely band</li>
            <li> Very Nice, just what I expected for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I was able to replace the cord on the older clippers and realign the blades</li>
            <li> They are quite and do not heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I was worried the machine was gonna warmup quick and burn my head</li>
            <li> This time around, I thought that I would get the better one with the expectation that it would last me 10 or more years.  </li>
            <li> Great clippers cut very well only problem is that they do run hot so make sure to have a back up for bulk and use these for detail also invest in a fade blade if you want an even cleaner sharper cut just a tip other than that great clippers!</li>
            <li> Fortunately for me, it was in the first 30 days</li>
            <li> These cut very clean and are Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> You have to go through the same section 3-5 times to make sure its all cut evenly!</li>
            <li> Plus I noticed pretty much any Wahl guard&#x27;s fit right onto them with a snug fit.</li>
            <li> These cut my husbands very thick hair great!!</li>
            <li> They do get a little warm with prolonged use, but are far superior to any clippers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> but that is not a problem, it does get warm to the touch, however, I only cut 1 or 2 persons at a time.</li>
            <li> I found a really useful video on the company website.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> These clippers are worth the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too powerful for my needs and sparks come out each time I turn the lever</li>
            <li> clipper has a nice heft too it, it feels SOLID and hums authoritatively without buzzing or clacking.  </li>
            <li> I like senior with Wahl more softly.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor, cuts like a dream.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using Wahl clippers to cut my own hair for the last twenty years.  </li>
            <li> Very quiet, easy to grip,very easy to do haircuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He was absolutely right.  </li>
            <li> For the right amount.</li>
            <li> Nice and weighted and is the exact same one my sister in law uses in her salon.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, this machine is super powerful.</li>
            <li> They are solid in construction and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I am a pro in thos profetion, and a i said that this machine its very good, work well and very hard</li>
            <li> It is heavier, but seems to allow more control, cuts precisely, and I&#x27;m more confident while cutting their hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought these and midway through the first trim..the bottom blade snapped....</li>
            <li> but I took two stars off because of the way the clippers looked when I first got them they looked like they have been used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure if they are the real deal , first day at work with them they seem great no complaints</li>
            <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist, they were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received many compliments since I started using this razor and definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a change.</li>
            <li> oh well, Such is life :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had them for a couple months, and I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> The first haircut my wife gave me with this took about two minutes and never caught or pulled.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I noticed a burnt smell when they got a hot.</li>
            <li> Exactly What i needed.</li>
            <li> And they still work as well as when i first got em.</li>
            <li> I would like the top to be metal instead of plastic, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> Ironically, on the two haircuts that I did get, I noticed that the quality was better but that doesn&#x27;t help, if it doesn&#x27;t work or doesn&#x27;t last!</li>
            <li> I returned the first one and bought another thinking</li>
            <li> This replaces my first one that lasted 17 years..</li>
            <li> They are heavy weight and have a good balanced feel to them.  </li>
            <li> I cut my own thick hair as easily as any barber I have ever been to.  </li>
            <li> Very well made, smooth, quiet, and clean cut.  </li>
            <li> They also get pretty hot - thanks to the metal body.</li>
            <li> The senior is very simular to a regular walmart wahl, but it is better.</li>
            <li> But, I wasn&#x27;t even able to locate what part of the clipper hit the floor first; it was unaffected.  </li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser and honestly something is not right about them.</li>
            <li> Solid, reliable, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly do business with them again.</li>
            <li> This Wahl has been a great replacement for the cheaper-quality set I previously purchased at our local big-box store.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this clipper, she can cut all day long , it feels strong, and won&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> We live on a boat and do our own haircuts on the guys and tried a couple of other clippers.  </li>
            <li> A very helpful guy said these.</li>
            <li> Fast clippers, do not clog.  </li>
            <li> I use these to cut my hair and beard and they work very well.</li>
            <li> But my husband really enjoys the clippers I got for him to use.</li>
            <li> but I used only cheap ~$20 razors from Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about spending so much for a razor</li>
            <li> its the real deal</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go cheap, get these, and get extra guides.</li>
            <li> Very durable clippers.</li>
            <li> Very rugged and durable.</li>
            <li> The razor is making a grinding noise intermittently very unprofessional for salon work</li>
            <li> I used them for the first time today and they are very loud.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and it does the job, but it&#x27;s very slick</li>
            <li> new clippers don&#x27;t have to worry about being used and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to finish in less than 30 minutes,</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty coarse, and it cuts it like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> Very heavy duty and great long term investment.</li>
            <li> These clippers are highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> cuts very smoothly; a high quality clipper.</li>
            <li> Others have commented on the quality of this manufacturer, and I would have to agree it is worth the extra price</li>
            <li> Has more of a heavy duty feel.</li>
            <li> These do a great job but my barber (my wife) says they are a little heavy for her.</li>
            <li> The model I purchased has the new 9000v motor and is not noisy at all.  </li>
            <li> He had been saying he needed new clippers for a couple months already.  </li>
            <li> but I live in Fla.</li>
            <li> and it was brand new.</li>
            <li> IT DIDNT LOOK NEW.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money ive only done acouple cuts with them so far</li>
            <li> Very loud.</li>
            <li> this is a option worth considering, otherwise a lot of other machines will do a respectable job for less.</li>
            <li> I definitely plan on investing in more Wahl clippers in the future because they are already paying for themselves since I haven&#x27;t gone back to the barber since.</li>
            <li> Overall they work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> After making the first pass I had no choice but to finish giving myself a military super short cut.</li>
            <li> Its a good clipper ,im not a barber or anything still learning how to cut hair but it cuts well and works for me,gets hot at about an hour of cutting,</li>
            <li> but the second was just as loud as the first.</li>
            <li> I dropped it hard on a tile floor and felt sure I must have damaged it.</li>
            <li> Sturdy design and great cutting capacity.  </li>
            <li> Works as promised, instructions for use and care are clear.  </li>
            <li> The quality far exceeds my expectations.  </li>
            <li> but I felt it was time to replace my old clipper.  </li>
            <li> Professional grade.&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li> They even arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> its better to just use an open 1 guard or an open empty clipper for that matter</li>
            <li> (30 year old guy) to save money and time to the barber.</li>
            <li> I am a professional barber</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s not really a firm grip.</li>
            <li> Have used this 4x on my dog so far</li>
            <li> The blade was wonky like many others have noted, but the instructions tell you how to align them.</li>
            <li> , it was way too loud.</li>
            <li> Professional quality.</li>
            <li> The blades do need to be aligned straight from the box which is expected and stated in the small manual, I did my fade in 15 minutes and the machine never shut down on me as one unlucky reviewer has experienced and also i did notice a respectable amount of heat, nothing serious,  </li>
            <li> Pretty funny because I have full head of hair and my friends and family were pretty shocked</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side, compared to a Five Star clipper, but it&#x27;s good for barbering, overall.</li>
            <li> I wanted a strong long lasting professional grade clipper that will live 10 years as did my previous clipper.</li>
            <li> It tends to run a little hot after awhile but that might have more to do with me taking a little longer while getting used to cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> As a professional machine it doesnt meet my expectation because in less than 10 minutes it become so hot.</li>
            <li> My son in particular dreaded them they were so long and unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars but the motor gets hot really fast, but I still think that you should at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was unaware that the Wahl Professional Clipper was made so well.  </li>
            <li> My wife is a professional and will only use this brand.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by cheaper models.</li>
            <li> just remember they have to be broken in before they work the way your favorite clippers do.</li>
            <li> I was tired of replacing clippers every couple years and decided to purchase a better product.  </li>
            <li> While they are a tad heavy she is getting used to them, well worth the money  </li>
            <li> The  blades  are not  very sharp.</li>
            <li> I used other guides from other kits and the seem to work better on other clippers than on this model.</li>
            <li> Not long after I bought this clipper</li>
            <li> Not only will this razor cut through your hair like a hot knife through butter, but it cuts it evenly each time which cuts down the overall time it takes for each cut.</li>
            <li> Yeah, they are a little pricey, but they are well worth the investment as you will save in the long run.  </li>
            <li> Gets hot fast, and all in all, just does a poor</li>
            <li> I had a less expensive WAHL clipper for 20+ years that I loved and when it died decided to upgrade.</li>
            <li> but the price was a little to much for my budget especially after adding $20 for guide combs.</li>
            <li> After a while of being on it gets a little warm and may be slightly uncomfortable for the person being trimmed (if providing back to back haircuts this may be an issue).</li>
            <li> Haircuts where long and painful with cheap consumer grade clippers that pulled and wouldn&#x27;t cut after the first haircut.  </li>
            <li> but if your a barber u should have two of these one with the fade blade one with the taper, long story short</li>
            <li> After I had to adjust them a little as your supposed to with any new clippers</li>
            <li> These clippers are very loud and heavy.</li>
            <li> White guard comes loose</li>
            <li> I have spent years trying to find good clippers, buying very expensive oster and other brands.</li>
            <li> the motor is very good and strong,the weight is a matter of getting used to,but the blades are crap!</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find any aftermarket magnetic clips that fit these Wahl Seniors.</li>
            <li> Clipper is heavy and feels professional.  </li>
            <li> I did buy other attachments because it only comes with one I believe.</li>
            <li> This clipper feels heavy and solid in your hand and immediately gives you confidence that it is built to last.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these for work and the senior has rubbed off on the front and the screw keeps coming loose.</li>
            <li> bad n get hot fast</li>
            <li> Easy cutting.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a black and most of the time I cut our texture hair and these clippers cut threw it no problem and some of the hair I have cut with these clippers are like cutting carpet</li>
            <li> Cutting guides seem cheap and move while using.  </li>
            <li> Just need to be careful as this buzzer&#x27;s goal in life is to cut any hair that gets in its way.</li>
            <li> Works as as expected.</li>
            <li> The clippers came with everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful looking for the lowest prices.</li>
            <li> Heavy Duty clipper that looks like it will last.</li>
            <li> I work in a barbershop and do roughly 15 haircuts a day.</li>
            <li> I also have used Andis Masters and Oster 76&#x27;ers (Other powerhouse clippers) and these are still my go-to pair.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have speculated that these might be factory seconds</li>
            <li> very disappointed, I expected Wahl to be a really good choice</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for work, I am a little dissapponted the wahl and the senior on the front has come off , and the screw in front is a litle loose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional hair stylist, but am big on quality products and wanted a clipper that would last a long time vs. paying crazy amounts for hair cuts each month.</li>
            <li> My last clipper was an Andis and nearly lasted 10-12 years until recently the motor began to slowly fade to silence also adding the fact that i was careless with it and never oiled the blades.</li>
            <li> only negative about this product, it over heats.</li>
            <li> so if you put a number 1 guard on you can make it a 1 and a half by adjusting the side…</li>
            <li> I will have to look for a less noisy version.</li>
            <li> So in a tight economy I ended up getting the Wahl senior</li>
            <li> I saw little clunks of hair or something on the on the blades</li>
            <li> This trimmer has worked extremely well for the past 1 month+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> little heavy</li>
            <li> He has very thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Multiple passes each time barely cutting the hair and pulling the rest, 30-40 minutes for a simple men&#x27;s cut.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> PART OF THE NAME &amp;#34;SENIOR&amp;#34; WAS MISSING.  </li>
            <li> Misses cuts, leaving the hair choppy.</li>
            <li> They are a bit heavy</li>
            <li> Took me a few minutes, and now it&#x27;s even.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the cheaper one and it typically lasts me about five years before it breaks.  </li>
            <li> So it is not forgiving at all if you mess up!</li>
            <li> My husband is increasingly disabled; going to the barbershop has been difficult and becoming nearly impossible .  </li>
            <li> I usually get 5+ yrs, out of a Senior clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my screw is faulty or if that&#x27;s how they all are.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they were used before.</li>
            <li> We usually used the wahl&#x27;s vac clippers, but they are getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> Long, sturdy cord, and a few accessories helped me get started in cutting hair.</li>
            <li> I have to buy one a year as I am a hairdresser and use it at least 10 times a day.  </li>
            <li> Plus it was delivered late.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this clipper to anyone cutting human hair.</li>
            <li> He told me &amp;#34;Buy a Wahl, and spend a least $50 since the cheaper ones tend to be junk for household</li>
            <li> after of course i did my delicate research</li>
            <li> Poorly assembled was missing a screw and leaves lines</li>
            <li> And there is no way to get my money back :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for 7 years and these are my go-to everyday clippers.</li>
            <li> also the 1 and a half and the half guards are terrible.</li>
            <li> If your a stylist or have skill with cutting hair or need power with mowing through thick hair</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m saving on hair cuts and haven&#x27;t had to try the clipper out since.</li>
            <li> looks like someone tried to zero gap it and did a horrible job and just left it.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at ALL!!!!</li>
            <li> The machine made a weird noise about 3 days after I used it, I didn&#x27;t drop it once.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair now for about 6 years</li>
            <li> THIS BROKE WHILE I WAS CUTTING MY SONS HAIR.  </li>
            <li> THE SCREW BROKE AND THE CUTTING BLADE FLEW OFF.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Disgusting.</li>
            <li> The clips that ship with them are flimsy and terrible.</li>
            <li> and I mean that with every ounce of breath ....BUY THEM!!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great clippers cut very well only problem is that they do run hot so make sure to have a back up for bulk and use these for detail also invest in a fade blade if you want an even cleaner sharper cut just a tip other than that great clippers!</li>
            <li> Package was on time. Machine works great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have to buy one a year as I am a hairdresser and use it at least 10 times a day.  I have found the Senior stronger than the Designer.</li>
            <li> Received USED clippers with hair in them.  Disgusting.</li>
            <li> I bought these and midway through the first trim..the bottom blade snapped....The clipper itself works brilliantly... I guess this one was faulty.</li>
            <li> Work real good, but I prefer the five star seniors.</li>
            <li> This item gets too hot after 20 minutes!!!</li>
            <li> I was unaware that the Wahl Professional Clipper was made so well.  The pictures on the Amazon web site do not do it justice. The quality far exceeds my expectations.  The clipper just feels right in the hand and the heft is perfect.  The model I purchased has the new 9000v motor and is not noisy at all.  The factory blade alignment is perfect unlike some difficulties others have experienced in this area.  These clippers replace a  Wahl that I have used for over 25 years.  The cord finally broke at the point where it enters the clipper.  I was able to replace the cord on the older clippers and realign the blades but I felt it was time to replace my old clipper.  All in all a quality made in USA product that I am very pleased with.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a anniversary present for my hubby. He had been saying he needed new clippers for a couple months already.  I went to sally beauty supply and asked what they suggested for Hispanic hair. He hates when clippers pull his hair! As all men do. A very helpful guy said these. But they were over $100 with tax. I looked it up online and found these and saved $50!!!</li>
            <li> Work good and last if taken care of</li>
            <li> My sister boasts this as being the # 1 clipper for her beauty salon.</li>
            <li> great clippers cut smooth but I took two stars off because of the way the clippers looked when I first got them they looked like they have been used I saw little clunks of hair or something on the on the blades</li>
            <li> Love it. Nice and weighted and is the exact same one my sister in law uses in her salon. After borrowing hers, I loved it and had to have it. Works like a charm. No need to go over the same area repeatedly nor worry about rogue hairs that stand taller than the rest. The cut is precise and quick. Just need to be careful as this buzzer&#x27;s goal in life is to cut any hair that gets in its way. So it is not forgiving at all if you mess up!</li>
            <li> Fast clippers, do not clog.  Professional grade.&lt;br /&gt;Need to purchase Wahl 3173-500 Replacement Plastic Guide Combs, Set of 10 for Standard Clippers separately.</li>
            <li> Nice for cutting hair. But for close shaving, I had to remove the 2 bushings at bottom blade and use longer 6/32 bolts to hold them together. They also get pretty hot - thanks to the metal body. Overall I think wahl clippers are generally great, only I didn&#x27;t get that different feeling with this one compared to the walmart one I had.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has worked extremely well for the past 1 month+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for trimming both my hair and beard, and I&#x27;ve found it effective for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember if you buy that it is important to oil your blades often or the product will wear out quicker.</li>
            <li> I am not Pro. But after 5 min used, it getting warm on the handle. That why I rate it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> great clippers for my son&#x27;s summer haircut</li>
            <li> I have a used wahl clipper for approx 10 years. The senior is very simular to a regular walmart wahl, but it is better. The senior is better because the body is all metal, the armature inside is more sturdy, wahl clipper guards fit best on the senior, the blades are signicantly improved from a walmart wahl. Senior does cut better than a home clipper. I am happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative about this product, it over heats. I can remedy this problem by using andis kool care.</li>
            <li> My wife is a professional and will only use this brand.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by cheaper models.</li>
            <li> I got these for a Fathers Day gift. He loved them. They even arrived a day early. Awesome gift idea!</li>
            <li> Gift for Barber.....he loved it.</li>
            <li> I use these to cut my hair and beard and they work very well.</li>
            <li> I ordered the clipper on the advice of a friend who is a master barber. The clipper is great but be sure to read the instructions I thought I try it out on myself and chose what I thought looked like the right length. After making the first pass I had no choice but to finish giving myself a military super short cut. Needless to say I&#x27;m saving on hair cuts and haven&#x27;t had to try the clipper out since. Pretty funny because I have full head of hair and my friends and family were pretty shocked but I live in Fla. and it feels GREAT! I can&#x27;t wait to try it again.... in couple more months...LOL. I give this tool 5 stars.</li>
            <li> As promised.  Strong motor. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> My husband is increasingly disabled; going to the barbershop has been difficult and becoming nearly impossible .  Now, I can keep his hair trimmed and groomed whenever it&#x27;s needed.  Works as promised, instructions for use and care are clear.  This clipper was recommended by a friend who has used a Wahl for years. Also purchased the Wahl Hair Clipper Guide Comb Set.  Together, they have  proved to be truly good purchases.</li>
            <li> These work great but not as good as my limited edition ones. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever find those again.</li>
            <li> if it wasn&#x27;t for the blades on this thing i would give it a 5. but my blades had to be sharpened out the box when i got these clippers. the motor is very good and strong,the weight is a matter of getting used to,but the blades are crap! also the 1 and a half and the half guards are terrible. its better to just use an open 1 guard or an open empty clipper for that matter cause they dont even work right.so when you get these just remember they have to be broken in before they work the way your favorite clippers do.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this clipper, she can cut all day long , it feels strong, and won&#x27;t get hot. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure if they are the real deal , first day at work with them they seem great no complaints , I don&#x27;t feel like I had time to write an honest review .</li>
            <li> These clippers are very loud and heavy. The clips that ship with them are flimsy and terrible. I have been unable to find any aftermarket magnetic clips that fit these Wahl Seniors.</li>
            <li> The wahl clippers are great!!!! My husband has been in the barbering business for 32yrs &amp; I&#x27;ve been in the barbering business for 24yr now, &amp; all we&#x27;ve used is wahl clipped I&#x27;ve never used anything else. We usually used the wahl&#x27;s vac clippers, but they are getting hard to find. But my husband really enjoys the clippers I got for him to use.</li>
            <li> my co-worker husband and her loves it.</li>
            <li> Cuts well, without pulling.  little heavy but that is not a problem, it does get warm to the touch, however, I only cut 1 or 2 persons at a time. Shipment was quick and packaging was appropriate.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, not real noisy and they cut very quick and don&#x27;t pull. I use them in children and they have been great!</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the product. Blade was crooked looks like someone tried to zero gap it and did a horrible job and just left it. Plus it was delivered late. Not satisfied at ALL!!!!</li>
            <li> Works as as expected. Very good clipper. You must read the instructions to align the clipper blade and guard blade before using. I found a really useful video on the company website.</li>
            <li> I am a pro in thos profetion, and a i said that this machine its very good, work well and very hard</li>
            <li> I got a deffective clipper, if it wasn&#x27;t for that I&#x27;d give it five stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve cut hair for 30yrs. I have Oster, Andis and Wahl clippers. All serve their purpose, I use the Wahl Senior to fade. I usually get 5+ yrs, out of a Senior clipper. Great clippers if it&#x27;s not defective!</li>
            <li> As a professional machine it doesnt meet my expectation because in less than 10 minutes it become so hot. Regarding that issue i dont feel comfortable working with it.</li>
            <li> Easy cutting. Not too heavy.  I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> as described happy with product!</li>
            <li> Clippers arrived on time. I am a licensed cosmetologist, they were exactly what I needed. So far, so good. I will update my review in the future.</li>
            <li> Good price, delivery time, and quality.</li>
            <li> Works Great - Love it!!</li>
            <li> Blades have fallen off multiple times. I&#x27;m not sure if my screw is faulty or if that&#x27;s how they all are. However. When it cuts it cuts good</li>
            <li> This clipper feels heavy and solid in your hand and immediately gives you confidence that it is built to last.  Not long after I bought this clipper I dropped it hard on a tile floor and felt sure I must have damaged it. But, I wasn&#x27;t even able to locate what part of the clipper hit the floor first; it was unaffected.  I cut my own thick hair as easily as any barber I have ever been to.  I would recommend this clipper to anyone cutting human hair.</li>
            <li> Solid, reliable, and easy to use.  Great investment.</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d  be writing a review for a razor, yet here I am. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years now but I used only cheap ~$20 razors from Walmart or Target. I was on the fence about spending so much for a razor but it is definitely worth it. Not only will this razor cut through your hair like a hot knife through butter, but it cuts it evenly each time which cuts down the overall time it takes for each cut. I&#x27;ve received many compliments since I started using this razor and definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a change. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Does a wonderful job of grooming my dog.  Very pleased with the product.  Because of the continuous cost of grooming , I had to find an alternate.  This is it.  Great clipper.</li>
            <li> I am not a hair dresser but i cut my husband and 2 boys hair every month. These clippers are by far the best ive had. I have spent years trying to find good clippers, buying very expensive oster and other brands. These cut my husbands very thick hair great!! Love them!!</li>
            <li> Product works fine. Only problem I have is the zero guard is not as low as I thought it was going to be. oh well, Such is life :)</li>
            <li> I started to cut my own hair. (30 year old guy) to save money and time to the barber. And this works great!  Done in minutes. I did buy other attachments because it only comes with one I believe. I have had this for about 6 months and no issues at all. Good product!!</li>
            <li> These clippers are highly recommended.  As soon as you take them out of the box you can immediately tell the difference from those that you purchase from the big box stores.  I was tired of replacing clippers every couple years and decided to purchase a better product.  There is no comparison between these clippers and those that you find at your local store.  Highly recommend.  The purchaser was a pleasure to do business with, the clippers arrived early and they were in perfect condition.  I would certainly do business with them again.</li>
            <li> These do a great job but my barber (my wife) says they are a little heavy for her.</li>
            <li> I am a professional barber and i can tell you that these clippers are great .</li>
            <li> The machine made a weird noise about 3 days after I used it, I didn&#x27;t drop it once. Must of been a manufacturing mistake.</li>
            <li> These clippers are worth the money but you have to watch who you buy them from, these clipper are powerful will and able to mow threw all kinds of hair like nothing, I&#x27;m a black and most of the time I cut our texture hair and these clippers cut threw it no problem and some of the hair I have cut with these clippers are like cutting carpet but these seniors no problem with these seniors you don&#x27;t even need a detachable clipper unless you want one, and also they give a good taper fade, these clippers are buffalo soldiers. Buy them! And if you have a problem with your clippers call wahl clipper company they stand by there products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side, compared to a Five Star clipper, but it&#x27;s good for barbering, overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too powerful for my needs and sparks come out each time I turn the lever and it was brand new.</li>
            <li> Amazing clippers. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does not come with a case to store them in.</li>
            <li> The best we have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for work, I am a little dissapponted the wahl and the senior on the front has come off , and the screw in front is a litle loose and i have only used them for a month. Not sure if they were used before. I will not buy these from this vendor again i will go to my beautiy supply store if i want them .  I am a hairdresser and honestly something is not right about them.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I&#x27;m very satisfied. The clippers came with everything I expected. A year ago I had bout the same clippers at Sally&#x27;s beauty salon for 100.00, so i know what to expect, and yeah its the real deal, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper a month ago and they broke already... I dont lnow if they send me some used ones or what? But mime didnt last... And there is no way to get my money back :(</li>
            <li> I have been using these clippers for almost two months now and they have done what I needed them to do. It tends to run a little hot after awhile but that might have more to do with me taking a little longer while getting used to cutting my own hair. I definitely plan on investing in more Wahl clippers in the future because they are already paying for themselves since I haven&#x27;t gone back to the barber since.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for work and the senior has rubbed off on the front and the screw keeps coming loose. I&#x27;ve only had them for a couple months, and I&#x27;m pretty sure these are used or knockoff. Never purchasing work tools off the internet again</li>
            <li> This is the third hair clipper we&#x27;ve tried.  We live on a boat and do our own haircuts on the guys and tried a couple of other clippers.  Haircuts where long and painful with cheap consumer grade clippers that pulled and wouldn&#x27;t cut after the first haircut.  Multiple passes each time barely cutting the hair and pulling the rest, 30-40 minutes for a simple men&#x27;s cut.  My son in particular dreaded them they were so long and unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I asked a friend who runs his own salon for advice.  He told me &amp;#34;Buy a Wahl, and spend a least $50 since the cheaper ones tend to be junk for household use.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was absolutely right.  The first haircut my wife gave me with this took about two minutes and never caught or pulled.  Same with my son&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper has a nice heft too it, it feels SOLID and hums authoritatively without buzzing or clacking.  It is almost all metal and feels like a quality, well built piece of machinery.  You know, just like the ones you are used to when you sit in the barber&#x27;s chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the way this thing is built and works, with only two of us getting cuts I suspect it will be the last clipper we ever buy.</li>
            <li> The clippers came used.  They had been cleaned but there was oil and a hair or two on them.  Overall they work pretty well.  I have a basic low all around hair cut which is simple.  Be careful looking for the lowest prices.</li>
            <li> This was a great clipper however I ended up returning it for the 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I really love these clippers! I&#x27;ve been cutting hair now for about 6 years and these are my favorite clippers everrr. Great for fades and runs beautifully smooth. They are priced extremely low here so just grab them! Plus I noticed pretty much any Wahl guard&#x27;s fit right onto them with a snug fit.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very good for fades.</li>
            <li> White guard comes loose</li>
            <li> Very loud. It didn&#x27;t work the way it said it would. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> Sturdy design and great cutting capacity.  Looks like this one could be used in a commercial setting.  Others have commented on the quality of this manufacturer, and I would have to agree it is worth the extra price</li>
            <li> My daughter is studying to be a hair dresser and these came highly recommended from several hair dressers and barbers as the best. While they are a tad heavy she is getting used to them, well worth the money  she was esctatic to receive these as a gift and the price was AMAZING</li>
            <li> Great Machine Great Provider, it&#x27;s working in outstanding way! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Poorly assembled was missing a screw and leaves lines bad n get hot fast</li>
            <li> As a mom of three boys, I needed a reliable, quality clipper.  I&#x27;m not a professional hair stylist, but am big on quality products and wanted a clipper that would last a long time vs. paying crazy amounts for hair cuts each month. I did a lot of research on good sets of clippers and came across this one.  This Wahl has been a great replacement for the cheaper-quality set I previously purchased at our local big-box store.  It is heavier, but seems to allow more control, cuts precisely, and I&#x27;m more confident while cutting their hair.  My husband also has noticed the difference.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I do my own haircuts and find myself cutting my family hair as well. I was undecided between the the Andis Improved master and the Wahl senior. I wanted a strong long lasting professional grade clipper that will live 10 years as did my previous clipper. My last clipper was an Andis and nearly lasted 10-12 years until recently the motor began to slowly fade to silence also adding the fact that i was careless with it and never oiled the blades. It still fights to continue and cuts hair but its done its service wonderfully. So with that in mind, my eyes were set on another Andis but the price was a little to much for my budget especially after adding $20 for guide combs. So in a tight economy I ended up getting the Wahl senior after of course i did my delicate research and I am happy to say i don&#x27;t regret it. The motor power is there, the blades were easily aligned and I performed a wonderful fade haircut on myself within minutes. The blades do need to be aligned straight from the box which is expected and stated in the small manual, I did my fade in 15 minutes and the machine never shut down on me as one unlucky reviewer has experienced and also i did notice a respectable amount of heat, nothing serious,  but that should be expected coming from a professional clipper. This was all in one day so hopefully i will not have to return to this review and change my view on this clipper but i honestly don&#x27;t think i will have to. So all in all I think this is a great clipper. If your a stylist or have skill with cutting hair or need power with mowing through thick hair this is a option worth considering, otherwise a lot of other machines will do a respectable job for less.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair super nice. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars but the motor gets hot really fast, but I still think that you should at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> cuts very smoothly; a high quality clipper. bough this one as a gift; my original is still going strong after 15 years</li>
            <li> Good quality at a good price. Has more of a heavy duty feel. And it cuts awesome!</li>
            <li> They burn through hair with no problem.  They are heavy weight and have a good balanced feel to them.  My hair is pretty coarse, and it cuts it like a hot knife through butter.  Same thing with my boys.  No pinching, no OUCH, no problems.  Yeah, they are a little pricey, but they are well worth the investment as you will save in the long run.  Don&#x27;t go cheap, get these, and get extra guides.</li>
            <li> Very durable clippers. Good motor precise cuts.</li>
            <li> My favorite clippers. I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for 7 years and these are my go-to everyday clippers. These cut very clean and are Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and it does the job, but it&#x27;s very slick and there&#x27;s not really a firm grip.</li>
            <li> They cut good. I used them for the first time today and they are very loud. I noticed a burnt smell when they got a hot.</li>
            <li> Very Nice, just what I expected for the price I paid. They are quite and do not heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> Great clippers and good price. I&#x27;m not a pro, I just cut my kids and my own hair. This is a far superior clipper compared to the Wahl I bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it, love it, love it. Very quiet, easy to grip,very easy to do haircuts. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to buy and enjoy.</li>
            <li> C&#x27;est un clipper exceptionnel.</li>
            <li> Simply AWESOME.  Lives up to its reputation.  Very well made, smooth, quiet, and clean cut.  Easy to service.</li>
            <li> excellent quality - the best we&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I bought These clippers and I have use them several times now and I must say they are very good and I mean that with every ounce of breath ....BUY THEM!!!!!!</li>
            <li> THIS BROKE WHILE I WAS CUTTING MY SONS HAIR.  THE SCREW BROKE AND THE CUTTING BLADE FLEW OFF.  ALSO WHEN  I GOT THE PRODUCT IT DIDNT LOOK NEW.  PART OF THE NAME &amp;#34;SENIOR&amp;#34; WAS MISSING.  I THREW IT IN THE TRASH</li>
            <li> Worth the money ive only done acouple cuts with them so far but they make my oster fast feeds feel like a piece of junk, these are much more powerful and because of that they do warm up a bit but if your a barber u should have two of these one with the fade blade one with the taper, long story short i love them id say they need to be a part of everybodys arsonal of clippers</li>
            <li> Exactly What i needed. I bought these about 7 months ago and use them sometimes 2 times a week. And they still work as well as when i first got em.</li>
            <li> Great quality clippers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is Okay,  I like senior with Wahl more softly.</li>
            <li> These clippers are exactly as good as everyone says. I found them after looking thru online reviews and everything ppl claim about these is absolutely true. Sturdy, powerful, comfortable to hold and maneuver. At the price point, you will not find better clippers.</li>
            <li> Great design, nice balance, good value.</li>
            <li> works great after months of use.  would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Closest and cleanest clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. There&#x27;s a reason barbers use this brand. Very rugged and durable. Would recommend to anyone looking to replace their entry level clippers.</li>
            <li> These clippers work amazing !!</li>
            <li> Powerful motor, cuts like a dream. These are my favorite clippers. I also have used Andis Masters and Oster 76&#x27;ers (Other powerhouse clippers) and these are still my go-to pair.</li>
            <li> I am a female barber i started off using wahl seniors and eventually moved to oster 76ers. the wahls seniors are a great clipper to learn with especially because they are adjustable so if you put a number 1 guard on you can make it a 1 and a half by adjusting the side…also good company too order from, don&#x27;t be worried they&#x27;re definitely band new clippers don&#x27;t have to worry about being used and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Very heavy duty and great long term investment. Buy it good once so you don&#x27;t have to buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for months. Works exceedingly well. After a while of being on it gets a little warm and may be slightly uncomfortable for the person being trimmed (if providing back to back haircuts this may be an issue).</li>
            <li> Misses cuts, leaving the hair choppy. You have to go through the same section 3-5 times to make sure its all cut evenly! Gets hot fast, and all in all, just does a poor job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed, I expected Wahl to be a really good choice and it just isn&#x27;t. I have a clipper that I purchased from Walmart for $27 and it does a better job than this $100 &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; clipper!</li>
            <li> Clipper is heavy and feels professional.  Cutting guides seem cheap and move while using.  I used other guides from other kits and the seem to work better on other clippers than on this model.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this as my go to clippers. They are solid in construction and easy to clean. Smooth motor operation. Maintenance is key to avoid pulling hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing clippers in every way but the only problem I have is they heat up after about 30 min.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I was worried the machine was gonna warmup quick and burn my head but it didn&#x27;t. What it did do was give me a nice crisp fade! It&#x27;s nice and comfy.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair like a dream! Heavy Duty clipper that looks like it will last. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Its a good clipper ,im not a barber or anything still learning how to cut hair but it cuts well and works for me,gets hot at about an hour of cutting,</li>
            <li> The razor is making a grinding noise intermittently very unprofessional for salon work</li>
            <li> Bought this to groom my 60lb Shepherd cattle dog mix. He has very thick coarse hair. Animal Clippers always give out on me and even some human ones overheat before I&#x27;m close to finished! Have used this 4x on my dog so far and it works amazing! I&#x27;m able to finish in less than 30 minutes, use to take me an hour plus!</li>
            <li> The  blades  are not  very sharp. It does  not give  you a  close shave</li>
            <li> These for the price are the best set of clippers.  They are a bit heavy but they are more durable and have more power than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> A quiet, solid clipper. I would like the top to be metal instead of plastic, but no big deal. The blade was wonky like many others have noted, but the instructions tell you how to align them. Took me a few minutes, and now it&#x27;s even. Long, sturdy cord, and a few accessories helped me get started in cutting hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with a Marine haircut and I&#x27;ve been using Wahl clippers to cut my own hair for the last twenty years.  I usually buy the cheaper one and it typically lasts me about five years before it breaks.  This time around, I thought that I would get the better one with the expectation that it would last me 10 or more years.  On my second haircut, the clipper wouldn&#x27;t run and when I jiggled the cord the power came on.  Fortunately for me, it was in the first 30 days and I can send it back to Amazon no problem, but it makes you wonder about the quality.  Other reviewers have speculated that these might be factory seconds and of course I don&#x27;t know, but I would NOT recommend buying one.  Ironically, on the two haircuts that I did get, I noticed that the quality was better but that doesn&#x27;t help, if it doesn&#x27;t work or doesn&#x27;t last!</li>
            <li> I had a less expensive WAHL clipper for 20+ years that I loved and when it died decided to upgrade. Although the clipper felt very solid in my hand and I&#x27;m sure it would have cut great, it was way too loud. I measured it at 112 decibals, it was louder than the hair dryer. My ears were ringing with it on for 45 seconds. I attempted to used the side screw to adjust but that did not do anything. Customer service was contacted and was unhelpful. I returned the first one and bought another thinking it was a fluke but the second was just as loud as the first. I will have to look for a less noisy version.</li>
            <li> best for my husband whose a barber</li>
            <li> These clippers are great. Plenty of power and easy to maintain. They do get a little warm with prolonged use, but are far superior to any clippers I have ever owned. Very pleased with my purchase. I also purchased a Wahl clipper guide comb set to maximize my use of these clippers.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, this machine is super powerful. Cuts hair easy and machine stays cool. For the right amount. Whal Machine is durable. Professional quality. Barber Shop. For sure. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I work in a barbershop and do roughly 15 haircuts a day. These have been amazing!</li>
            <li> I lower my facial hair to stubble once a week and this puppy does the job, perfectly. This replaces my first one that lasted 17 years..Easy to use, well balanced.</li>
            <li> After I had to adjust them a little as your supposed to with any new clippers I got them to work as I wanted them to work. But this clippers are amazing I couldn&#x27;t complain on how great they work.</li>
            <li> Hefty and well made. Cut real good, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase. It came on time and was well packaged. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great machine. It cuts through hair with ease. I recommend to anyone looking to purchase a clipper.</li>
