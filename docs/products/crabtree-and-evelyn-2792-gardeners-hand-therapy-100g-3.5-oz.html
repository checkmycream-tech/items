            <li>I LOVE this handlotion!  </li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>We love this!  </li>
            <li>this item was ordered as a gift, but I love it, too!</li>
            <li>We both love it!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s none better!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love how this feels and makes skin look moistened!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Lovely!</li>
            <li>Wish there was more inside the tube!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, earthy, grassy scent that I can live with, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or silky or gloppy, and best of all, it works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>it smells amazing</li>
            <li>This cream is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>I try to remember to use gloves when digging about in dirt, but sometimes it&#x27;s a spur-of-the-moment activity and the gloves aren&#x27;t handy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotten my hands and forearms (and feet sometimes) through 84 rose bushes,</li>
            <li>really feel wonderful after lotion is applied!</li>
            <li>this is the best all-around handcream...nourishes hands and nails.  </li>
            <li>But if you want a powdery or rose scented, this might not work for you-</li>
            <li>One physician I work with has asthma and is allergic to almost every kind of lotion there is.</li>
            <li>Tried it at a friends and immediately ordered my own.</li>
            <li>All the fragrances are nice.</li>
            <li>The reason why I gave this a one star is that I liked the scent, otherwise I would have given no star.  </li>
            <li>But, I really liked this one.  </li>
            <li>the way, this product is very strong smelling.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.  </li>
            <li>The scent is great and the fact that my hands are not rough in the winter is a great selling</li>
            <li>The hand therapy goes on very smooth and non greasy but the scent is very strong and spicy</li>
            <li>Love love love this lotion!</li>
            <li>perfect for your dry chafed hands, even smells wonderful...makes my hands feel smooth and happy after using it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great -- I&#x27;ve used it ever since they first came out with it</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave hands &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; since it&#x27;s absorbed easily</li>
            <li>works very good to keep your hands soft.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>I like nivea or loccitane better.</li>
            <li>gardening takes it toll, and this cream not only smells wonderful</li>
            <li>My wife and her mom love this cream.  </li>
            <li>I am a nurse and wash my hands more times in one day than most think about doing in a month.</li>
            <li>This hand cream has been my favorite for many years.</li>
            <li>Put it before you do work, wear gloves and even better all day care.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best hand cream you can get, ever, anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I found an outlet store about 70 miles from me but find ordering from Amazon much more convenient.</li>
            <li>my favorite hand cream (I&#x27;ve used many many)</li>
            <li>I even love it on the rest of my thirsty body.  </li>
            <li>I would have to buy more than one of the largest tubes each time because I used it on my body.  </li>
            <li>Except for cooperative weather, I can&#x27;t think of anything else more helpful for us gardeners, except for maybe the gardener&#x27;s hand soap.</li>
            <li>My knuckles were my problem area and it looks 100% better.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many as gifts for others.</li>
            <li>It is OK.</li>
            <li>So glad I took a chance and bought this scent :)</li>
            <li>I do a lot of garden work and most of time I don&#x27;t wear gloves.</li>
            <li>My friend bought me a rosewater two years ago and i just fall in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Some places charge $20 or more.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I love this hand cream.  </li>
            <li>Better than &amp;#34;Source&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love Crabtree &amp; Evelyn.</li>
            <li>and I love it; I use at night before bed;</li>
            <li>Bought more and have given as a gift.  </li>
            <li>the pain is more severe.</li>
            <li>My husband fell in love with this lotion many years ago, and his love continues.  </li>
            <li>I love this hand lotion.</li>
            <li>love this stuff</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I received the Gardner&#x27;s Hand Therapy from a friend as a Christmas Gift and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love this hand cream.</li>
            <li>I love the scent too.  </li>
            <li>Of all Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products this line is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used grabtree&amp;evelyyn gardeners hand therapy for many years.  </li>
            <li>The cream lasts for many hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love my hands more now.</li>
            <li>I feel like I use them more for the scent rather than to moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me many years ago.</li>
            <li>but you will be able to smell it when you put it on.</li>
            <li>It has an herby, pine like, almost christmasy smell that I love.</li>
            <li>I love it, but it&#x27;s kinda pricey at fifteen bucks.</li>
            <li>Love how it feels and smells</li>
            <li>we all love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li>My granddaughter&#x27;s hands would sting from most hand creams not Gardeners.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and the fragrance</li>
            <li>I love gardening</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t love washing pots and pans</li>
            <li>this is a good price for this and as long as ot stays on &amp;#34;PRIME&amp;#34; it is a great deal.  </li>
            <li>It is the BEST hand cream I used, and I am not young. :)</li>
            <li>It works wonders and has a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li>Great smelling, non-greasy, and yet soaks in to provide soft, emollient nourished hands!!  </li>
            <li>My wife has used this product for years and says it is the best thing she has found on the market for really dry, chapped hands.</li>
            <li>It smells like rosemary and moisturizes my chapped dry hands until they feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for exceptionally dry skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a pleasant smell, not too &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;, and it is really moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best creams for dry hands on the market!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wonderful for dry winter hands.</li>
            <li>I have used this hand therapy for years and think it&#x27;s the best for dry, winter chapped skin as well as &amp;#34;dig-in-the-dirt&amp;#34; hands.</li>
            <li>The seller was very nice and compensated me with a new tube after I sent pictures of the damages.  </li>
            <li>But, the best thing that I figured to use it for, was for my very dry cracked skin on my feet.</li>
            <li>and was pleased when i saw  it available on amazon.</li>
            <li>Was the product expected in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Plus it is perfectly masculine (although great for women too.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and does the job better than most.</li>
            <li>It is such a great, clean scent-not overpowering and the staying power on your hands is amazing-</li>
            <li>So easy no hassle ..</li>
            <li>This hand cream smells wonderful, and it really soaks into my hands, making them feel soothed and soft.  </li>
            <li>and I kinda like it since it&#x27;s not so strong.</li>
            <li>Whatever it is, it is strong to my nose and NOT at all pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so strong you can smell if for hours afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The smell is too strong on this lotion.</li>
            <li>I prefer the lighter scents without the eucalyptus or whatever the strong smell is.</li>
            <li>It DOES soften, but so does the rose, or the Nantucket Briar, and the smell on those is so pretty.</li>
            <li>Whether or not you are a gardener, the cream soothes chapped hands, and the relaxing sage-like scent is fine for both men and women.  </li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful and dissipates quickly so as not to interfere with any perfume scent.</li>
            <li>This hand cream is simply the best I&#x27;ve ever used...not greasy or smelly, just very clean and effective for rehydrating hands, especially after working outdoors.</li>
            <li>The entire Crabtree &amp; Evelyn hand therapy line is great, as are the rest of their products.</li>
            <li>Just a fantastic cream and value.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d have it available every day.</li>
            <li>Not cheap, but the best!</li>
            <li>Prices from different vendors can vary greatly.</li>
            <li>Fantastic hand cream for winter...</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic as well.</li>
            <li>Not sticky, feels smooth</li>
            <li>And told me it has a light scent that&#x27;s pleasent and that it is not greasy at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have a light floral scent, so if you do not like floral scents then this might not be the product for you.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer described the smell as a cheap aftershave.</li>
            <li>Fantastic relief for hands after a day of gardening.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>My husband said that it smells herbal, but to me it smells like cheap aftershave.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy; feels great and really softens my much used hands.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and completely moisturizes my skin without leaving the oily residue.</li>
            <li>This cream has been my favorite for many years because it really heals the skin even after washing it off, it is still working.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most importantly, this rubs right in and leaves hands moisturized without any stickiness.</li>
            <li>i love this cover the color is right and the reverse side is just the color i was looking for</li>
            <li>I was worried about the tube being crushed but the shipping package was good as well!</li>
            <li>Been using for years, light clean aroma</li>
            <li>This hand cream is so rich and silky.  </li>
            <li>Great for guys with dry hands.</li>
            <li>She was so right!  </li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t mind the floral scent, this stuff is not greasy, it soaks right in and FEELS like it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin!</li>
            <li>This product is a very effective tool to use when battling the effects of the dry air winter brings and its effect on hands.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I have found for hard working hands.  </li>
            <li>scent is wonderful too, at least I think so.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the creme is very concentrated, I DO recommend letting it soak in well before you go driving or touching door knobs, etc.</li>
            <li>The odor of the product is also gender neutral and not flowery or too sweet.</li>
            <li>I need them to be as soft and healthy as can be for my massage clients, so this is a truly effective cream that I can use in small amounts and still be perfectly happy with the results.</li>
            <li>my hands feel smooth and none greesy when it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>and I truly don&#x27;t think the tube was full.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly, smells wonderful and relieves dry skin better than other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>it does have a lavender aroma that is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>Great hand cream for after gardening or any other time.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product works like no other all year long.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best hand cream ever.</li>
            <li>Throughout the day I will use another lotion as I don&#x27;t want to breeze through this so quickly.</li>
            <li>Came quick.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, especially if you don&#x27;t shop around for it, but I got a good deal right before christmas this year and so into his stocking it went.  </li>
            <li>The very first time I tried it I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>The feel of the cream as I rub it in, along with the slight, but enticing background aroma, are a joy.</li>
            <li>ok, not far better than what I bought for couples of dollars.</li>
            <li>My hands look and feel good again, even in dry winter offices and apartments.</li>
            <li>The lotion is absorbed quickly and does not leave hands slippery.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t strongly scented, and really helps his hands.</li>
            <li>The smell is extra strong and unpleasant~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Not good for young ladies</li>
            <li>The gardener is a little bit thicker than i thought it is, i will save it for winter.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing effect great.</li>
            <li>Working in the garden is tough on your hands, this is the best product yet</li>
            <li>Love what this does for my hands, really keeps them soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>No more pain for me, I now have beautifully moisturized hands.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price for the value.</li>
            <li>It is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>While this lotion is better than the cheap stuff, I don&#x27;t think it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Consider a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I also work in an elementary school.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This product is exceptional for dry hand restoration.  </li>
            <li>Far and away, my all-time favorite.</li>
            <li>Besides which, it&#x27;s totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>This hand lotion soaks right in, does not leave a greasy residue and makes your hands feel like silk.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size to leave at the office as well or in my purse.</li>
            <li>It really seems to sink in and make the skin on my hands feel more elastic and soft, and the scent is very pleasant and subtle.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin/allergies, and tend to avoid anything with strong fragrances.</li>
            <li>A small, pea sized or so, dab after washing your hands works great.</li>
            <li>A small amount  works great.</li>
            <li>Soaks right into the skin in a couple of minutes and the hand feels better instantly.</li>
            <li>From the first time I tried it I was &#x27;sold&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I first received a tube as a gift.</li>
            <li>Will by more in the future.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this hand cream whole- heartedly!</li>
            <li>I dove the product, hope I have better luck the next time I order</li>
            <li>Dependable and consistent</li>
            <li>The first day I got it, it was delivered to me at work.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer; it has a definite scent, but it&#x27;s not floral or cloying at all.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product as a gift.</li>
            <li>I love this and will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>Soothing and effective in assisting healing of nicks and rough hands.</li>
            <li>I got an extra hug at Christmas and now I&#x27;ll be getting more for Valentine&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li>Be aware what is listed is not what you will get.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Being a new Mom again, frequently washing my hands, and house work, my hands start showing the abuse, this hand cream is not crease, magically stayed on and healed all the chipped skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a moisturizer it works great, especially around the nails and fingertips where my hands get dry and crack.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my hands and it does work better at keeping my hands soft better than any other hand lotion that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has helped many people with dry hands, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the very strong smell long enough to find out if it would help mine.  </li>
            <li>Quite unique and natural, but not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is aromatherapeutic, the texture is rich and healing but not heavy or greasy, you don&#x27;t feel it sitting on your skin.</li>
            <li>Something about the way this lotion smells is so exotic and lovely - like frankincense and myrrh - but it&#x27;s subtle, not like anyone</li>
            <li>I have found it to be a great help to hands working hard inside the house too!  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this hand treatment from a garden center - what a favorite it has become.</li>
            <li>That \\&quot;Gardeners Secret\\&quot; soaked in quickly and completely without making my hands feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I, personally, cannot handle strong scents because I&#x27;m prone to headaches, but this has never given me problems.</li>
            <li>I tend to wash my hands a lot and notice during the winter that my skin cracks and with certain products</li>
            <li>I like to spend ten dollars on lotion, but i suppose that&#x27;s the price you gotta pay for comfort and peace of mind in this twenty-first century fox life we live in. :)</li>
            <li>And nothing helps my skin more and really help the cracks and dry skin for me except this.</li>
            <li>works better for dry hands (and feet) than anything I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t care much for the scent.  </li>
            <li>Crabtree and Evelyn Gardners therapy is very helpful and help to relieve cracked hands and cuticles.  </li>
            <li>The lotion really does provide therapy for your hands.  </li>
            <li>I really does help restore your hands after digging in the garden (or washing dishes in the sink, if you&#x27;re old-fashioned like me).</li>
            <li>After using Gardeners Hand Therapy my hands are much softer.</li>
            <li>I know that this hand cream is for gardeners, but since I am zealous about wearing gloves, I don&#x27;t really need this cream during spring and summer.</li>
            <li>It really does wonders in keeping your hands moisturized.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>Really like this hand cream.</li>
            <li>They shouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;gardeners&amp;#34; because really it&#x27;s for anyone.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a cheap red candle to me...</li>
            <li>Thanks, I did not have to go to the mall</li>
            <li>This stuff really works to defend my hands from the evils of manufacturing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really rocks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This is a real luxury lotion.  </li>
            <li>oily and very creamy.</li>
            <li>and it really softens up my hands.  </li>
            <li>A nice subtle fragrance that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed right away and seems to be very healing to dry skin.</li>
            <li>It truely does provide moisurizing that you notice the next morning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricier than many other creams, but does the job!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little too much, i can smell it all over me, but the smell of herb is quite refreshing.</li>
            <li>or maybe I just got lucky when I visited that store last time.</li>
            <li>I found the classic L&#x27;Occitane too greasy, and smelled too grandma-like or like baby powder.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>A respected massage client highly recommended this product to me and I immediately purchased it.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend...</li>
            <li>The old Gardener&#x27;s Hand Cream sold in the stores was much denser than this newly created tubing which is much runnier, hence does not have the creamier consistency.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it has a piney, cinnamony smell and works great on dry hands from winter cold.  </li>
            <li>A few minutes after I applied the hand cream, my hands were so dry that I got static when I touched light switch.  </li>
            <li>With little convincing, my friends all use this lotion now.</li>
            <li>Although it is rich, I feel my hands dry again after I applied the cream for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>But this routine really goes so far in keeping my hands intact.</li>
            <li>It must have some kind of compound in it that I reacted to in a negative way.</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance and the lotion keeps our hands soft for a long time...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s not oily but waxy and thick.</li>
            <li>I love this product especially during winter for dry hands.</li>
            <li>The herbs listed are not in the new</li>
            <li>They quickly become so chaffed, dry and scaly that I can use the side of my hand to scratch my face.</li>
            <li>The smell is very loud.</li>
            <li>It seems slightly lighter but works fine.</li>
            <li>Not sure what ingredient moisturizes the skin, but this product has plenty of it. :-)</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a little strong for some of my friends with allergies</li>
            <li>I am a professional gardener, and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>(the regular mechanic hands I have seen haha)</li>
            <li>The tube version - 3.4 oz - is by far</li>
            <li>It leaves me with soft, soothed hands.</li>
            <li>She has the same problem and it really help her hand also.  </li>
            <li>Wow....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and neat looking.</li>
            <li>An old girlfriend gave me some as a gift</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised by the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves hands greaseless and soft.  </li>
            <li>Maybe i am supoosed to usemore frequently?</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, especially in the wintertime!</li>
            <li>Absorbs immediately, completely non-greasy after a couple seconds.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on, but I am not very happy with the scent; and the tube does not stand up, so I have to keep it in its box in order to keep it standing in the place</li>
            <li>had high hopes for this lotion, especially at the $22/tube price.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Aveda, Jack Black and Kiels rough hand therapy lotions.</li>
            <li>I THINK IT CAN BE USED FOR A LONG TIME, AND I REALLY LIKE ITS SMELL</li>
            <li>I am really tough on my hands, but this cream really helps to keep them moisturized and callous free.</li>
            <li>I am a senior and my feet really do get dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry hands, as my job requires me to wash them very often.</li>
            <li>This really didn&#x27;t do anything for my dry hands after a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li>I have used several Crabtree and Evelyn hand creams and this is probably my least favorite because of the scent.</li>
            <li>She is spoiled and will use no other.  </li>
            <li>Only half the price,shipped free and 3 times larger than the tube in the store (7 0z.</li>
            <li>Paired with a little exfoliation my hands look soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had rough hands and found Gardeners cream has worked very well on my hands.</li>
            <li>I work in the medical field and have REAL problems with dry and damaged hands.  </li>
            <li>A little bit of pure luxury every time I use it!</li>
            <li>My husband has very dry hands from working outside all the time and this product really does the trick for him.</li>
            <li>Much more expensive than other hand cremes, but well worth the extra bucks.</li>
            <li>There is no other hand treatment (and I have tried substitutes including The Body Shop Hemp which comes in similar packaging) that comes even close.</li>
            <li>I rely on Gardeners Hand Therapy to keep my hands soft all year long.</li>
            <li>The thick, rich, lotion acts like an ointment on the nicks and scratches inevitably received from a productive session in the garden.  </li>
            <li>This lotion really does help your dry, sore, rough hands.</li>

            <li> it smells amazing</li>
            <li> This cream is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> I try to remember to use gloves when digging about in dirt, but sometimes it&#x27;s a spur-of-the-moment activity and the gloves aren&#x27;t handy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotten my hands and forearms (and feet sometimes) through 84 rose bushes,</li>
            <li> really feel wonderful after lotion is applied!</li>
            <li> this is the best all-around handcream...nourishes hands and nails.  </li>
            <li> But if you want a powdery or rose scented, this might not work for you-</li>
            <li> One physician I work with has asthma and is allergic to almost every kind of lotion there is.</li>
            <li> Tried it at a friends and immediately ordered my own.</li>
            <li> All the fragrances are nice.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave this a one star is that I liked the scent, otherwise I would have given no star.  </li>
            <li> But, I really liked this one.  </li>
            <li> the way, this product is very strong smelling.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.  </li>
            <li> The scent is great and the fact that my hands are not rough in the winter is a great selling</li>
            <li> The hand therapy goes on very smooth and non greasy but the scent is very strong and spicy</li>
            <li> Love love love this lotion!</li>
            <li> perfect for your dry chafed hands, even smells wonderful...makes my hands feel smooth and happy after using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great -- I&#x27;ve used it ever since they first came out with it</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave hands &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; since it&#x27;s absorbed easily</li>
            <li> works very good to keep your hands soft.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite brand.</li>
            <li> I like nivea or loccitane better.</li>
            <li> gardening takes it toll, and this cream not only smells wonderful</li>
            <li> My wife and her mom love this cream.  </li>
            <li> I am a nurse and wash my hands more times in one day than most think about doing in a month.</li>
            <li> This hand cream has been my favorite for many years.</li>
            <li> Put it before you do work, wear gloves and even better all day care.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best hand cream you can get, ever, anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I found an outlet store about 70 miles from me but find ordering from Amazon much more convenient.</li>
            <li> my favorite hand cream (I&#x27;ve used many many)</li>
            <li> I even love it on the rest of my thirsty body.  </li>
            <li> I would have to buy more than one of the largest tubes each time because I used it on my body.  </li>
            <li> Except for cooperative weather, I can&#x27;t think of anything else more helpful for us gardeners, except for maybe the gardener&#x27;s hand soap.</li>
            <li> My knuckles were my problem area and it looks 100% better.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many as gifts for others.</li>
            <li> It is OK.</li>
            <li> So glad I took a chance and bought this scent :)</li>
            <li> I do a lot of garden work and most of time I don&#x27;t wear gloves.</li>
            <li> My friend bought me a rosewater two years ago and i just fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Some places charge $20 or more.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream.  </li>
            <li> Better than &amp;#34;Source&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love Crabtree &amp; Evelyn.</li>
            <li> and I love it; I use at night before bed;</li>
            <li> Bought more and have given as a gift.  </li>
            <li> the pain is more severe.</li>
            <li> My husband fell in love with this lotion many years ago, and his love continues.  </li>
            <li> I love this hand lotion.</li>
            <li> love this stuff</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I received the Gardner&#x27;s Hand Therapy from a friend as a Christmas Gift and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream.</li>
            <li> I love the scent too.  </li>
            <li> Of all Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products this line is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used grabtree&amp;evelyyn gardeners hand therapy for many years.  </li>
            <li> The cream lasts for many hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love my hands more now.</li>
            <li> I feel like I use them more for the scent rather than to moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me many years ago.</li>
            <li> but you will be able to smell it when you put it on.</li>
            <li> It has an herby, pine like, almost christmasy smell that I love.</li>
            <li> I love it, but it&#x27;s kinda pricey at fifteen bucks.</li>
            <li> Love how it feels and smells</li>
            <li> we all love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> My granddaughter&#x27;s hands would sting from most hand creams not Gardeners.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and the fragrance</li>
            <li> I love gardening</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t love washing pots and pans</li>
            <li> this is a good price for this and as long as ot stays on &amp;#34;PRIME&amp;#34; it is a great deal.  </li>
            <li> It is the BEST hand cream I used, and I am not young. :)</li>
            <li> It works wonders and has a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li> Great smelling, non-greasy, and yet soaks in to provide soft, emollient nourished hands!!  </li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for years and says it is the best thing she has found on the market for really dry, chapped hands.</li>
            <li> It smells like rosemary and moisturizes my chapped dry hands until they feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for exceptionally dry skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a pleasant smell, not too &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;, and it is really moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best creams for dry hands on the market!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wonderful for dry winter hands.</li>
            <li> I have used this hand therapy for years and think it&#x27;s the best for dry, winter chapped skin as well as &amp;#34;dig-in-the-dirt&amp;#34; hands.</li>
            <li> The seller was very nice and compensated me with a new tube after I sent pictures of the damages.  </li>
            <li> But, the best thing that I figured to use it for, was for my very dry cracked skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> and was pleased when i saw  it available on amazon.</li>
            <li> Was the product expected in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Plus it is perfectly masculine (although great for women too.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and does the job better than most.</li>
            <li> It is such a great, clean scent-not overpowering and the staying power on your hands is amazing-</li>
            <li> So easy no hassle ..</li>
            <li> This hand cream smells wonderful, and it really soaks into my hands, making them feel soothed and soft.  </li>
            <li> and I kinda like it since it&#x27;s not so strong.</li>
            <li> Whatever it is, it is strong to my nose and NOT at all pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so strong you can smell if for hours afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The smell is too strong on this lotion.</li>
            <li> I prefer the lighter scents without the eucalyptus or whatever the strong smell is.</li>
            <li> It DOES soften, but so does the rose, or the Nantucket Briar, and the smell on those is so pretty.</li>
            <li> Whether or not you are a gardener, the cream soothes chapped hands, and the relaxing sage-like scent is fine for both men and women.  </li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful and dissipates quickly so as not to interfere with any perfume scent.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is simply the best I&#x27;ve ever used...not greasy or smelly, just very clean and effective for rehydrating hands, especially after working outdoors.</li>
            <li> The entire Crabtree &amp; Evelyn hand therapy line is great, as are the rest of their products.</li>
            <li> Just a fantastic cream and value.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d have it available every day.</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but the best!</li>
            <li> Prices from different vendors can vary greatly.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hand cream for winter...</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic as well.</li>
            <li> Not sticky, feels smooth</li>
            <li> And told me it has a light scent that&#x27;s pleasent and that it is not greasy at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a light floral scent, so if you do not like floral scents then this might not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer described the smell as a cheap aftershave.</li>
            <li> Fantastic relief for hands after a day of gardening.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> My husband said that it smells herbal, but to me it smells like cheap aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy; feels great and really softens my much used hands.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and completely moisturizes my skin without leaving the oily residue.</li>
            <li> This cream has been my favorite for many years because it really heals the skin even after washing it off, it is still working.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Most importantly, this rubs right in and leaves hands moisturized without any stickiness.</li>
            <li> i love this cover the color is right and the reverse side is just the color i was looking for</li>
            <li> I was worried about the tube being crushed but the shipping package was good as well!</li>
            <li> Been using for years, light clean aroma</li>
            <li> This hand cream is so rich and silky.  </li>
            <li> Great for guys with dry hands.</li>
            <li> She was so right!  </li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t mind the floral scent, this stuff is not greasy, it soaks right in and FEELS like it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin!</li>
            <li> This product is a very effective tool to use when battling the effects of the dry air winter brings and its effect on hands.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have found for hard working hands.  </li>
            <li> scent is wonderful too, at least I think so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the creme is very concentrated, I DO recommend letting it soak in well before you go driving or touching door knobs, etc.</li>
            <li> The odor of the product is also gender neutral and not flowery or too sweet.</li>
            <li> I need them to be as soft and healthy as can be for my massage clients, so this is a truly effective cream that I can use in small amounts and still be perfectly happy with the results.</li>
            <li> my hands feel smooth and none greesy when it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> and I truly don&#x27;t think the tube was full.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly, smells wonderful and relieves dry skin better than other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> it does have a lavender aroma that is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> Great hand cream for after gardening or any other time.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product works like no other all year long.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best hand cream ever.</li>
            <li> Throughout the day I will use another lotion as I don&#x27;t want to breeze through this so quickly.</li>
            <li> Came quick.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, especially if you don&#x27;t shop around for it, but I got a good deal right before christmas this year and so into his stocking it went.  </li>
            <li> The very first time I tried it I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> The feel of the cream as I rub it in, along with the slight, but enticing background aroma, are a joy.</li>
            <li> ok, not far better than what I bought for couples of dollars.</li>
            <li> My hands look and feel good again, even in dry winter offices and apartments.</li>
            <li> The lotion is absorbed quickly and does not leave hands slippery.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t strongly scented, and really helps his hands.</li>
            <li> The smell is extra strong and unpleasant~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Not good for young ladies</li>
            <li> The gardener is a little bit thicker than i thought it is, i will save it for winter.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing effect great.</li>
            <li> Working in the garden is tough on your hands, this is the best product yet</li>
            <li> Love what this does for my hands, really keeps them soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> No more pain for me, I now have beautifully moisturized hands.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price for the value.</li>
            <li> It is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> While this lotion is better than the cheap stuff, I don&#x27;t think it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Consider a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I also work in an elementary school.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product is exceptional for dry hand restoration.  </li>
            <li> Far and away, my all-time favorite.</li>
            <li> Besides which, it&#x27;s totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> This hand lotion soaks right in, does not leave a greasy residue and makes your hands feel like silk.  </li>
            <li> Just the right size to leave at the office as well or in my purse.</li>
            <li> It really seems to sink in and make the skin on my hands feel more elastic and soft, and the scent is very pleasant and subtle.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin/allergies, and tend to avoid anything with strong fragrances.</li>
            <li> A small, pea sized or so, dab after washing your hands works great.</li>
            <li> A small amount  works great.</li>
            <li> Soaks right into the skin in a couple of minutes and the hand feels better instantly.</li>
            <li> From the first time I tried it I was &#x27;sold&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I first received a tube as a gift.</li>
            <li> Will by more in the future.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this hand cream whole- heartedly!</li>
            <li> I dove the product, hope I have better luck the next time I order</li>
            <li> Dependable and consistent</li>
            <li> The first day I got it, it was delivered to me at work.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer; it has a definite scent, but it&#x27;s not floral or cloying at all.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love this and will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> Soothing and effective in assisting healing of nicks and rough hands.</li>
            <li> I got an extra hug at Christmas and now I&#x27;ll be getting more for Valentine&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li> Be aware what is listed is not what you will get.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a new Mom again, frequently washing my hands, and house work, my hands start showing the abuse, this hand cream is not crease, magically stayed on and healed all the chipped skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a moisturizer it works great, especially around the nails and fingertips where my hands get dry and crack.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my hands and it does work better at keeping my hands soft better than any other hand lotion that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it has helped many people with dry hands, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the very strong smell long enough to find out if it would help mine.  </li>
            <li> Quite unique and natural, but not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is aromatherapeutic, the texture is rich and healing but not heavy or greasy, you don&#x27;t feel it sitting on your skin.</li>
            <li> Something about the way this lotion smells is so exotic and lovely - like frankincense and myrrh - but it&#x27;s subtle, not like anyone</li>
            <li> I have found it to be a great help to hands working hard inside the house too!  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this hand treatment from a garden center - what a favorite it has become.</li>
            <li> That \\&quot;Gardeners Secret\\&quot; soaked in quickly and completely without making my hands feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I, personally, cannot handle strong scents because I&#x27;m prone to headaches, but this has never given me problems.</li>
            <li> I tend to wash my hands a lot and notice during the winter that my skin cracks and with certain products</li>
            <li> I like to spend ten dollars on lotion, but i suppose that&#x27;s the price you gotta pay for comfort and peace of mind in this twenty-first century fox life we live in. :)</li>
            <li> And nothing helps my skin more and really help the cracks and dry skin for me except this.</li>
            <li> works better for dry hands (and feet) than anything I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t care much for the scent.  </li>
            <li> Crabtree and Evelyn Gardners therapy is very helpful and help to relieve cracked hands and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> The lotion really does provide therapy for your hands.  </li>
            <li> I really does help restore your hands after digging in the garden (or washing dishes in the sink, if you&#x27;re old-fashioned like me).</li>
            <li> After using Gardeners Hand Therapy my hands are much softer.</li>
            <li> I know that this hand cream is for gardeners, but since I am zealous about wearing gloves, I don&#x27;t really need this cream during spring and summer.</li>
            <li> It really does wonders in keeping your hands moisturized.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> Really like this hand cream.</li>
            <li> They shouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;gardeners&amp;#34; because really it&#x27;s for anyone.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a cheap red candle to me...</li>
            <li> Thanks, I did not have to go to the mall</li>
            <li> This stuff really works to defend my hands from the evils of manufacturing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really rocks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a real luxury lotion.  </li>
            <li> oily and very creamy.</li>
            <li> and it really softens up my hands.  </li>
            <li> A nice subtle fragrance that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed right away and seems to be very healing to dry skin.</li>
            <li> It truely does provide moisurizing that you notice the next morning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricier than many other creams, but does the job!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little too much, i can smell it all over me, but the smell of herb is quite refreshing.</li>
            <li> or maybe I just got lucky when I visited that store last time.</li>
            <li> I found the classic L&#x27;Occitane too greasy, and smelled too grandma-like or like baby powder.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A respected massage client highly recommended this product to me and I immediately purchased it.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend...</li>
            <li> The old Gardener&#x27;s Hand Cream sold in the stores was much denser than this newly created tubing which is much runnier, hence does not have the creamier consistency.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it has a piney, cinnamony smell and works great on dry hands from winter cold.  </li>
            <li> A few minutes after I applied the hand cream, my hands were so dry that I got static when I touched light switch.  </li>
            <li> With little convincing, my friends all use this lotion now.</li>
            <li> Although it is rich, I feel my hands dry again after I applied the cream for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> But this routine really goes so far in keeping my hands intact.</li>
            <li> It must have some kind of compound in it that I reacted to in a negative way.</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance and the lotion keeps our hands soft for a long time...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s not oily but waxy and thick.</li>
            <li> I love this product especially during winter for dry hands.</li>
            <li> The herbs listed are not in the new</li>
            <li> They quickly become so chaffed, dry and scaly that I can use the side of my hand to scratch my face.</li>
            <li> The smell is very loud.</li>
            <li> It seems slightly lighter but works fine.</li>
            <li> Not sure what ingredient moisturizes the skin, but this product has plenty of it. :-)</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a little strong for some of my friends with allergies</li>
            <li> I am a professional gardener, and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> (the regular mechanic hands I have seen haha)</li>
            <li> The tube version - 3.4 oz - is by far</li>
            <li> It leaves me with soft, soothed hands.</li>
            <li> She has the same problem and it really help her hand also.  </li>
            <li> Wow....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and neat looking.</li>
            <li> An old girlfriend gave me some as a gift</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised by the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves hands greaseless and soft.  </li>
            <li> Maybe i am supoosed to usemore frequently?</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, especially in the wintertime!</li>
            <li> Absorbs immediately, completely non-greasy after a couple seconds.</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on, but I am not very happy with the scent; and the tube does not stand up, so I have to keep it in its box in order to keep it standing in the place</li>
            <li> had high hopes for this lotion, especially at the $22/tube price.</li>
            <li> I like it better than Aveda, Jack Black and Kiels rough hand therapy lotions.</li>
            <li> I THINK IT CAN BE USED FOR A LONG TIME, AND I REALLY LIKE ITS SMELL</li>
            <li> I am really tough on my hands, but this cream really helps to keep them moisturized and callous free.</li>
            <li> I am a senior and my feet really do get dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry hands, as my job requires me to wash them very often.</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t do anything for my dry hands after a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li> I have used several Crabtree and Evelyn hand creams and this is probably my least favorite because of the scent.</li>
            <li> She is spoiled and will use no other.  </li>
            <li> Only half the price,shipped free and 3 times larger than the tube in the store (7 0z.</li>
            <li> Paired with a little exfoliation my hands look soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had rough hands and found Gardeners cream has worked very well on my hands.</li>
            <li> I work in the medical field and have REAL problems with dry and damaged hands.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of pure luxury every time I use it!</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry hands from working outside all the time and this product really does the trick for him.</li>
            <li> Much more expensive than other hand cremes, but well worth the extra bucks.</li>
            <li> There is no other hand treatment (and I have tried substitutes including The Body Shop Hemp which comes in similar packaging) that comes even close.</li>
            <li> I rely on Gardeners Hand Therapy to keep my hands soft all year long.</li>
            <li> The thick, rich, lotion acts like an ointment on the nicks and scratches inevitably received from a productive session in the garden.  </li>
            <li> This lotion really does help your dry, sore, rough hands.</li>
            <li> My coworkers now stop by to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing, with a deep scent of rosemary and other herbs - it&#x27;s almost masculine -not floral or fruity at all.</li>
            <li> again a person who has her hands in water or other liquid nearly all day.</li>
            <li> use the Hand Recovery Cream first, rinse and dry, then a small dab on each cuticle and massage in for softer hands.</li>
            <li> This is the only hand lotion that actually works on my dry hands during Colorado winters.  </li>
            <li> This size (100g) is a generous tube and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have very dry and rough hands and want them to be soft.</li>
            <li> Since I wash my hands frequently and knit also, my hands can get very dry and rough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling or a coating like many other hand creams.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and its the only lotion that heals my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only hand cream that works for his dry hands and keeps cuticles in shape.</li>
            <li> All the splits and open cuts in my dry fingers healed over.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick body and lasting effect are a relief for hours and the culminating effect is very beneficial.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that actually soaks in and helps relieve my constantly dry, cracked hands!!!</li>
            <li> my hands get very dry and this hand cream is grease less and makes hands extremely soft.</li>
            <li> It may seem pricey, but I actually use less of this than regular hand lotion</li>
            <li> have received this shipment in the past from the same seller once in a good condition, once in a bad condition (because it was sent in a paper envelope and squished).</li>
            <li> I will try other scents in the future.</li>
            <li> To hold it up so it don&#x27;t slide off from animals jumping on it all the time I&#x27;m recommending  putting a ribbon or elastic tie from one end to the other in back or under the couch</li>
            <li> my hands are still dry after use.</li>
            <li> Gloves or not, my getting-older hands dry out and this cream has a long-lasting effect.</li>
            <li> After doing a kitchen remodel again my hands were dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> I have problems with dry skin on my feet as well as my hands.  </li>
            <li> Did not do anything for my dry hands after slathering them everynight until the tube was finished.  </li>
            <li> I have dry cuticles and this cream</li>
            <li> You can do this at bedtime and sleep away that dry skin.</li>
            <li> Its not just for gardeners either, my hands tend to get chapped and dry during the winter</li>
            <li> My wife will not go without and I use at work when it is extremely dry.</li>
            <li> and my hands are really dry.</li>
            <li> hands feel greasy, yet dry.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm to fix dry skin wherever it is.  </li>
            <li> We have used lots of lotions for dry, cracked, over worked hands.  </li>
            <li> However, my hands are dry when i wake up.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on severely dry hands!  </li>
            <li> , so I thought I&#x27;d save some money and try this dispenser (larger, less $ per oz).</li>
            <li> and my hands get dry and rough.</li>
            <li> I have extremely rough, dry skin</li>
            <li> Softens and heals rough dry hands.</li>
            <li> someone who has rough, dry, hands.</li>
            <li> During the winter months, the skin on my hands gets very dry.</li>
            <li> My husband works on cars and his hands are very dry and rough</li>
            <li> I had hoped this might be similar to something called \\&quot;Gardeners Secret\\&quot; that I bought years ago in a little beach town boutique.  </li>
            <li> I bought this creme because I garden and my hands get very rough and dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe you can feel greasy and dry, but there really is no other way to describe this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband had bad cracking in his heels and this worked better than anything else</li>
            <li> , it has the consistency to stand up to the rigors of those who dig, scrape and generally rough up their hands.</li>
            <li> But shop carefully.</li>
            <li> so my hands are rough from gardening and woodworking, but this cream works wonders.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy film.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different lotions on my hands which really crack bad in the winter.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way! :</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> As I live working in the garden, my friend thought this cream would help my poor weathered hands.  </li>
            <li> The smell is so strong and so bad that I just can&#x27;t stand to use it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never experienced such a difference in the texture and overall feel of my hands until I used Gardener&#x27;s Hand Therapy.  </li>
            <li> that i have found for dried hands from gardening or the winter dry air.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> I rub my feet and put on my socks and no more dry cracked skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight medicinal smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, the only hand cream you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li> It helps with dry skin, and I use it constantly on my hands, especially in the cold winter months.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes along way.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this hand lotion to me a little over a year ago</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> i use it everyday</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it works wonderfully on, not just my dry hands, but my dry feet as well.</li>
            <li> Luckily no one complained.</li>
            <li> After gardening, washing dishes and laundring there is no better cream than this product, it restores the softness and delicacy of your hands in seconds</li>
            <li> The small compact size makes it portable.</li>
            <li> There is no better way of restoring your weather beaten hands than a dab of this&lt;br /&gt;aromatic skin soothing cream.</li>
            <li> This is not a very good moisturizer (I use something with 20% shea butter for that)</li>
            <li> Everyone should try it at least once, of course by then</li>
            <li> It is a very thick formula, requiring very little product with each use.  </li>
            <li> Dealt well with seriously roughened hands that were baptized by fire.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone who suffers with dry hands and cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into scented products, but this one is subtle and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I also use it to sooth tired and aching hands after a cold round of golf in the winter.</li>
            <li> It absorbs so readily into the skin and smooths out those nasty looking old-lady wrinkles, it seems miraculous.  </li>
            <li> It smells really weird.</li>
            <li> Although a bit pricey, you won&#x27;t be sorry with its performance.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not as expensive as it may seem.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, especially in cold, dry weather.</li>
            <li> However, once it gets cold, I purchase this hand cream because it works.</li>
            <li> I use it all year for gardening and cold weather...</li>
            <li> I am seriously obsessed with this lotion!  </li>
            <li> Now when his hands get bad he always asks me for it.</li>
            <li> and he was even shocked on how well it worked.</li>
            <li> but nothing works as well for the painful cracks.  </li>
            <li> Was disappointed that there was no &amp;#34;safety seal&amp;#34; on the tube under the cap</li>
            <li> I hate hand creams and lotions.  </li>
            <li> Really HATE them.  </li>
            <li> I hate the way they smell, and I hate the way they feel on my skin.  </li>
            <li> My friend hated the smell of it (a bath and bodyworks brand).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my hands are still dry after use. Not my favorite brand. I like nivea or loccitane better.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this hand cream; and she&#x27;s a complainer !!!  :-D. â™¥â™¥â™¥  Prime membership</li>
            <li> Love what this does for my hands, really keeps them soft and smooth.  But I don&#x27;t care much for the scent.  I prefer Rosewater.</li>
            <li> gardening takes it toll, and this cream not only smells wonderful, it has the consistency to stand up to the rigors of those who dig, scrape and generally rough up their hands.</li>
            <li> My wife and her mom love this cream.  It&#x27;s thick body and lasting effect are a relief for hours and the culminating effect is very beneficial.</li>
            <li> Great hand cream for after gardening or any other time.  I try to remember to use gloves when digging about in dirt, but sometimes it&#x27;s a spur-of-the-moment activity and the gloves aren&#x27;t handy.  Gloves or not, my getting-older hands dry out and this cream has a long-lasting effect.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. And nothing helps my skin more and really help the cracks and dry skin for me except this. Especially in the winter time. Even after using it one time you will notice a difference. My husband works on cars and his hands are very dry and rough (the regular mechanic hands I have seen haha) and he was even shocked on how well it worked. Now when his hands get bad he always asks me for it. Wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else for my skin cuz nothing else has worked except this.</li>
            <li> A nice subtle fragrance that dissipates quickly. Dealt well with seriously roughened hands that were baptized by fire. I paid nothing for the product (gift to a family member) but wouldn&#x27;t argue w/ this price.</li>
            <li> I am seriously obsessed with this lotion!  A friend recommended it to me about ten years ago, and I can&#x27;t stop using it!  I have tubes all over the place- my car, my purse, my bedside table, my kitchen, my bathroom...  Once you use this, you won&#x27;t want to use anything else.  This hand lotion soaks right in, does not leave a greasy residue and makes your hands feel like silk.  Try it- you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and wash my hands more times in one day than most think about doing in a month. I purchased this lotion after hearing rave reviews on it. Within 2 days, my cracked and bleeding hands were cured! This lotion is a miracle worker. No more pain for me, I now have beautifully moisturized hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this creme for about 20 years now. It&#x27;s amazing stuff. It&#x27;s gotten my hands and forearms (and feet sometimes) through 84 rose bushes, countless tree prunings, landscape rehabbing, etc. I have found that even with cuts and scratches, this lotion never stings. All the herbs probably have an antiseptic effect on injuries, but who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is wonderful too, at least I think so. Quite unique and natural, but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the creme is very concentrated, I DO recommend letting it soak in well before you go driving or touching door knobs, etc. A little goes a LONG way! :0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad they keep making this great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PJ</li>
            <li> This hand cream has been my favorite for many years. It goes on so smoothly, smells wonderful and relieves dry skin better than other creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> Excellent product works like no other all year long. Put it before you do work, wear gloves and even better all day care. Great delivery from vendor.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best hand cream you can get, ever, anywhere.  I am a professional gardener, and can&#x27;t live without it.  Also Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Gardeners Hand Recovery... practically scrubs your fingerprints off.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years as it helps protect my fingernails.  I found an outlet store about 70 miles from me but find ordering from Amazon much more convenient.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift and it was requested again the following year</li>
            <li> After gardening, washing dishes and laundring there is no better cream than this product, it restores the softness and delicacy of your hands in seconds</li>
            <li> The tube version - 3.4 oz - is by far my favorite hand cream (I&#x27;ve used many many), so I thought I&#x27;d save some money and try this dispenser (larger, less $ per oz). It seems slightly lighter but works fine.</li>
            <li> Is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;The product has to inform good friends</li>
            <li> I work in the medical field and have REAL problems with dry and damaged hands.  Crabtree and Evelyn Gardners therapy is very helpful and help to relieve cracked hands and cuticles.  Well worth the price for the value.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever tried, bar none.  The entire Crabtree &amp; Evelyn hand therapy line is great, as are the rest of their products.</li>
            <li> I THINK IT CAN BE USED FOR A LONG TIME, AND I REALLY LIKE ITS SMELL, I THINK I WILL COME AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I have to give this hand cream rave reviews. I even love it on the rest of my thirsty body.  I would have to buy more than one of the largest tubes each time because I used it on my body.  Just recently they have made a larger size in a pump bottle and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.  It really is a Great Product.</li>
            <li> The lotion really does provide therapy for your hands.  I use it nightly and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.  It truely does provide moisurizing that you notice the next morning.  I keep on in my nightstand and a pump version at work!</li>
            <li> Except for cooperative weather, I can&#x27;t think of anything else more helpful for us gardeners, except for maybe the gardener&#x27;s hand soap. This stuff is great -- I&#x27;ve used it ever since they first came out with it and it has no peer!</li>
            <li> Been using it for years!!!  Great smelling, non-greasy, and yet soaks in to provide soft, emollient nourished hands!!  We keep one in our cars and use it daily!!!</li>
            <li> Just a fantastic cream and value. A little goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy film. Just the right size to leave at the office as well or in my purse.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for years and says it is the best thing she has found on the market for really dry, chapped hands.A small, pea sized or so, dab after washing your hands works great. She also bought this product for someone else and once he tried it out he couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked. The odor of the product is also gender neutral and not flowery or too sweet. It is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Paired with a little exfoliation my hands look soft and pretty. My knuckles were my problem area and it looks 100% better.</li>
            <li> I rely on Gardeners Hand Therapy to keep my hands soft all year long. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hands constantly during the day and in the winter my skin cracks and hurts.  This is not a very good moisturizer (I use something with 20% shea butter for that) but nothing works as well for the painful cracks.  Immediate relief!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this hand treatment from a garden center - what a favorite it has become. I really does help restore your hands after digging in the garden (or washing dishes in the sink, if you&#x27;re old-fashioned like me). I have purchased many as gifts for others. This size (100g) is a generous tube and will last a long time. I gave it four stars only because it is more expensive here than at the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn outlet store - or maybe I just got lucky when I visited that store last time. Truth is, I&#x27;ll buy it wherever I can find it.</li>
            <li> My grandkids gave me a crabtree &amp; evelyn gardeners kit for mother&#x27;s day.  It included a mini sized tube of the hand therapy.  From the first time I tried it I was &#x27;sold&#x27;.  Not greasy; feels great and really softens my much used hands.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Love love love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this handlotion!  I have used it for years and its the only lotion that heals my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The old Gardener&#x27;s Hand Cream sold in the stores was much denser than this newly created tubing which is much runnier, hence does not have the creamier consistency.</li>
            <li> It is OK. Although it is rich, I feel my hands dry again after I applied the cream for 10 minutes. Actually, I do not do any housework. I do not know why.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites! So glad I took a chance and bought this scent :) I only wish the tube lasted longer! It is such a great, clean scent-not overpowering and the staying power on your hands is amazing-your hands (feet too!) really feel wonderful after lotion is applied!</li>
            <li> After I found this among the &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; of a Master Gardener and tried it for myself, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to order some so I&#x27;d have it available every day. It leaves me with soft, soothed hands.</li>
            <li> This sent me to the hospital in anaphalaxtic shock. I am allergic to sulfa. It must have some kind of compound in it that I reacted to in a negative way.</li>
            <li> My husband and I fight over this stuff every year.  It works wonders on severely dry hands!  A winter staple and the BEST stocking stuffer.  It does not make your hands slippery and smells great (without being girlie).</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!!!!! The scent is just so delicate and fresh.</li>
            <li> I first received a tube as a gift. As I live working in the garden, my friend thought this cream would help my poor weathered hands.  She was so right!  After doing a kitchen remodel again my hands were dry and cracked.  This hand cream brought them back to life.  The fragrance is a little strong for some of my friends with allergies but I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  works very good to keep your hands soft. I do a lot of garden work and most of time I don&#x27;t wear gloves.</li>
            <li> I work outside my and my hands get dry and rough. After using Gardeners Hand Therapy my hands are much softer. Also it smells good to.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is as described. I like it.</li>
            <li> My friend bought me a rosewater two years ago and i just fall in love with it. So i decided to try this scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little too much, i can smell it all over me, but the smell of herb is quite refreshing. Still like rosewater though, it is sweeter. The gardener is a little bit thicker than i thought it is, i will save it for winter.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing effect great. Soaks right into the skin in a couple of minutes and the hand feels better instantly.</li>
            <li> You cannot get this price for this size in any store. I was worried about the tube being crushed but the shipping package was good as well!</li>
            <li> I have been gardening for years and this is a great hand therapy..  I love the smell and it makes my hands feel great.</li>
            <li> I have problems with dry skin on my feet as well as my hands.  This works exceptionally well for both my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have found for hard working hands.  The thick, rich, lotion acts like an ointment on the nicks and scratches inevitably received from a productive session in the garden.  The fragrance is soothing as well and is not overbearing.  I have found it to be a great help to hands working hard inside the house too!  This product is a very effective tool to use when battling the effects of the dry air winter brings and its effect on hands.  An All Season product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I identify with what happens to gardeners&#x27; hands.  I love the way it goes on, but I am not very happy with the scent; and the tube does not stand up, so I have to keep it in its box in order to keep it standing in the place I keep this sort of thing.  But I DO like the way my hands feel.</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but the best! I love this stuff. A little bit goes along way. But shop carefully. Prices from different vendors can vary greatly. I paid $10 for a 100gm tube. Some places charge $20 or more.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for my dry hands after slathering them everynight until the tube was finished.  It used to work great.  Any changes made E&amp;C?</li>
            <li> This hand cream is simply the best I&#x27;ve ever used...not greasy or smelly, just very clean and effective for rehydrating hands, especially after working outdoors.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite a few years.  Love it!  From the scent to the texture. It is the perfect end to the perfect day of gardening.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different lotions on my hands which really crack bad in the winter.  My daughter gave me some of the Crabtree Evelyn Gardener Hand Therapy and it did wonders.  She has the same problem and it really help her hand also.  I ordered two so she could have one.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> While this lotion is better than the cheap stuff, I don&#x27;t think it is worth the extra money. It leaves a greasy feeling coating on my hands that makes me feel like I need to wash it off.  I had hoped this might be similar to something called \\&quot;Gardeners Secret\\&quot; that I bought years ago in a little beach town boutique.  That \\&quot;Gardeners Secret\\&quot; soaked in quickly and completely without making my hands feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years since I was given some as a thank you present.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my husband in his Christmas stocking and he loves it also.  It smells&lt;br /&gt;great and is not greasy.  I would recommend it for anyone who suffers with dry hands and cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and even better since they updated their packaging.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a birthday gift for a gardener friend.  She loves it, and assures me that she uses it even on days when she&#x27;s not gardening.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is head and shoulders above anything I could buy off the shelf at the suoermarket or drugstore chains. It really seems to sink in and make the skin on my hands feel more elastic and soft, and the scent is very pleasant and subtle. I am going to buy it again. I like to keep one in my purse and one on my nightstand.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hand cream for winter...my hands get very dry and this hand cream is grease less and makes hands extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Gardeners Hand Therapy cream is one of the best creams ever used.  Will by more in the future.  Thank you</li>
            <li> A respected massage client highly recommended this product to me and I immediately purchased it.  When I used the cream, I was just as happy with it as she said I would be.  Since I wash my hands frequently and knit also, my hands can get very dry and rough.  I need them to be as soft and healthy as can be for my massage clients, so this is a truly effective cream that I can use in small amounts and still be perfectly happy with the results.</li>
            <li> it smells amazing i love it i use it everyday it moisturizes all the cracks great for the winter im definitely buying another one when im done with this one</li>
            <li> I am an RN and wash my hands about 30 times a day.  This is non-oily and does the job keeping my skin moisturized.  It does have a slight medicinal smell to it.  I will try other scents in the future.</li>
            <li> We love this!  Whether or not you are a gardener, the cream soothes chapped hands, and the relaxing sage-like scent is fine for both men and women.  It&#x27;s pricier than many other creams, but does the job!</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream.  I don&#x27;t like wearing gloves so my hands are rough from gardening and woodworking, but this cream works wonders.  It absorbs so readily into the skin and smooths out those nasty looking old-lady wrinkles, it seems miraculous.  I am giving these as gifts to friends oversees.</li>
            <li> I know that this hand cream is for gardeners, but since I am zealous about wearing gloves, I don&#x27;t really need this cream during spring and summer. However, once it gets cold, I purchase this hand cream because it works. It smells like rosemary and moisturizes my chapped dry hands until they feel wonderful. The scent is great and the fact that my hands are not rough in the winter is a great selling point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a great product! I haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well.</li>
            <li> i had used the lotion years ago when i had a garden. and was pleased when i saw  it available on amazon. it does have a lavender aroma that is pretty strong. my hands feel smooth and none greesy when it is absorbed. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> this is a good price for this and as long as ot stays on &amp;#34;PRIME&amp;#34; it is a great deal.  Better than &amp;#34;Source&amp;#34;. I use it all year for gardening and cold weather...</li>
            <li> I love Crabtree &amp; Evelyn. It really does wonders in keeping your hands moisturized. It smells fantastic as well. The aluminum bottle helps protect the lotion from damage from the heat or the sun&#x27;s rays. The small compact size makes it portable.</li>
            <li> this is excellent product after used my skin was very smooth i will recommend to my family and my friend to buy</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!!  It feels wonderful on my hands.  I have shared it with friends and they love it too!!!</li>
            <li> It is the best smelling softening handcreme I have ever purchased.  Only half the price,shipped free and 3 times larger than the tube in the store (7 0z. for $20).</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best hand cream ever. I am really tough on my hands, but this cream really helps to keep them moisturized and callous free. It&#x27;s thick but doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling or a coating like many other hand creams. It has an herbal scent that is pleasant but not overpowering. I, personally, cannot handle strong scents because I&#x27;m prone to headaches, but this has never given me problems. The tube is convenient to carry around in my purse and never leaks, breaks or anything so I never have to worry about a lotion spill. Seriously, the only hand cream you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li> Always a great product.</li>
            <li> Much more expensive than other hand cremes, but well worth the extra bucks. Not sure what ingredient moisturizes the skin, but this product has plenty of it. :-) I&#x27;m not into scented products, but this one is subtle and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me some and I love it; I use at night before bed; especially nice hint of flowers scent.  Bought more and have given as a gift.  Consider a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hand creams around. The feel of the cream as I rub it in, along with the slight, but enticing background aroma, are a joy. And I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully for 12+ years! I recommend this hand cream whole- heartedly!</li>
            <li> Was disappointed that there was no &amp;#34;safety seal&amp;#34; on the tube under the cap and I truly don&#x27;t think the tube was full. I dove the product, hope I have better luck the next time I order</li>
            <li> this is the best all-around handcream...nourishes hands and nails.  will continue to buy it, and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Pricey but a very good hand cream.  I have dry cuticles and this cream is the best fix I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, especially after gardening or deep-cleaning here at home.</li>
            <li> use the Hand Recovery Cream first, rinse and dry, then a small dab on each cuticle and massage in for softer hands. Really a great gift for any gardener.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well! However, if your hands are already chapped and cracking you should reconsider using this product. I tend to wash my hands a lot and notice during the winter that my skin cracks and with certain products the pain is more severe. This product may contain alcohol. Over all, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> Best hand cream ever.  When I use it at night, my hands still feel great in the morning....and the scent is awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband. It&#x27;s the only hand cream that works for his dry hands and keeps cuticles in shape.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep at my desk at work. My coworkers now stop by to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing, with a deep scent of rosemary and other herbs - it&#x27;s almost masculine -not floral or fruity at all. But if you want a powdery or rose scented, this might not work for you- try another C&amp;E scent.&lt;br /&gt;Less greasy than L&#x27;Occitane hand cream. I found the classic L&#x27;Occitane too greasy, and smelled too grandma-like or like baby powder.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturier for hands. Dependable and consistent</li>
            <li> Every gardener should have this, and even non-gardeners.  Smells great, and softens like nothing else. This is a very good value.</li>
            <li> During the winter months, the skin on my hands gets very dry. This hand cream restores a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; feel without being greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for exceptionally dry skin. I searched for the best price per ounce, this was the best deal I found! The hand therapy was in the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn box and arrived wrapped in tissue as well. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have very dry and rough hands and want them to be soft. This product seems to work well. My only complaint is the smell. It smells really weird. The smell is very loud. The first day I got it, it was delivered to me at work. I immediately put it on to check it out.... Wow.... I smelled myself in my cube all day. Luckily no one complained.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size to fit in your purse... It has a light fragrance and the lotion keeps our hands soft for a long time... Highly recommend...</li>
            <li> My husband fell in love with this lotion many years ago, and his love continues.  It is pricey, especially if you don&#x27;t shop around for it, but I got a good deal right before christmas this year and so into his stocking it went.  This lotion has a pleasant smell, not too &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;, and it is really moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best creams for dry hands on the market!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not offensive so I never hesitate to apply wherever I am.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for dry winter hands.</li>
            <li> I love this hand lotion. It is absorbed right away and seems to be very healing to dry skin. I work with paper alot resulting in the moisture getting sucked out of my hands. This lotion works well for me and it has a wonderful smell which is great also.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful and works...love this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had rough hands and found Gardeners cream has worked very well on my hands. I am very happy with it</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift. I have used it on my hands and it does work better at keeping my hands soft better than any other hand lotion that I have tried. But, the best thing that I figured to use it for, was for my very dry cracked skin on my feet. I am a senior and my feet really do get dry skin. This cream is the best for my feet. I rub my feet and put on my socks and no more dry cracked skin on my feet. You can do this at bedtime and sleep away that dry skin.</li>
            <li> purse size container and great for your hands</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this hand lotion to me a little over a year ago and I&#x27;ve never experienced such a difference in the texture and overall feel of my hands until I used Gardener&#x27;s Hand Therapy.  Its not just for gardeners either, my hands tend to get chapped and dry during the winter and i work in an office.  this non-greasy lotion, makes your hands feel like silk.  It makes a great gift too.  With little convincing, my friends all use this lotion now.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as I&#x27;d hope.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream ever.  Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. The only hand lotion my husband will use and he won&#x27;t share it. The end.</li>
            <li> I have dry hands, as my job requires me to wash them very often. I have very sensitive skin/allergies, and tend to avoid anything with strong fragrances. This is my favorite moisturizer; it has a definite scent, but it&#x27;s not floral or cloying at all. Most importantly, this rubs right in and leaves hands moisturized without any stickiness.</li>
            <li> Great gift for gardening enthusiasts</li>
            <li> Yes, men who use their hands need a good hand cream just as women do.  I have used this product for over 20 years.  I like it not only because it works but because it has a non-greasy formula.  It is a very thick formula, requiring very little product with each use.  Although a bit pricey, you won&#x27;t be sorry with its performance.</li>
            <li> My wife will not go without and I use at work when it is extremely dry. Absorbs quickly and does the job better than most.</li>
            <li> Great to purchase my favorite product from Amazon.  So easy no hassle ..no gas to put in my car and search. thank you</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite. I received the Gardner&#x27;s Hand Therapy from a friend as a Christmas Gift and immediately fell in love with it. I am a nurse practitioner and wash my hands numerous times daily. During the winter months they crack and peel. Once I started using my Gardener&#x27;s Hand Therapy cream, my hands were revitalized. I was so impressed I gave these as gifts to my coworkers. One physician I work with has asthma and is allergic to almost every kind of lotion there is. She reluctantly tried her hand therapy, and she was so impressed she orders it all the time.  This stuff is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it works wonderfully on, not just my dry hands, but my dry feet as well. I have and will continue to recommend Gardner&#x27;s Hand Therapy to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I have extremely rough, dry skin and this is what works!  On elbows, knees, heels, AND hands!</li>
            <li> this item was ordered as a gift, but I love it, too! works better for dry hands (and feet) than anything I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> There is no better way of restoring your weather beaten hands than a dab of this&lt;br /&gt;aromatic skin soothing cream.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream. It really works well. It has no overpowering scent and it&#x27;s not greasy. My husband has very dry hands from working outside all the time and this product really does the trick for him. We both love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Gardeners Hand Therapy over the years and am always happy with it. Terrific lotion for hands and feet too!</li>
            <li> i love this cover the color is right and the reverse side is just the color i was looking for it&#x27;s soft and neat looking. To hold it up so it don&#x27;t slide off from animals jumping on it all the time I&#x27;m recommending  putting a ribbon or elastic tie from one end to the other in back or under the couch so it don&#x27;t slide, for this price you can&#x27;t beat it .Susan</li>
            <li> This hand cream is so rich and silky.  I love the scent too.  Of all Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products this line is my favorite.  Good price on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> Really like this hand cream. Tried it at a friends and immediately ordered my own. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product as a gift. In a sense, it was the best gift I ever received, as it put me onto something wonderful I will use forever. There is no other hand treatment (and I have tried substitutes including The Body Shop Hemp which comes in similar packaging) that comes even close. The scent is aromatherapeutic, the texture is rich and healing but not heavy or greasy, you don&#x27;t feel it sitting on your skin. It smooths away and you can almost feel in sinking in. I am a compulsive hand washer. I also work in an elementary school. In NY. The winters wreak all types of havoc on my hands. They quickly become so chaffed, dry and scaly that I can use the side of my hand to scratch my face. I use Gardeners Hand Therapy at bedtime and before I leave in the morning. Throughout the day I will use another lotion as I don&#x27;t want to breeze through this so quickly. But this routine really goes so far in keeping my hands intact. Makes a great gift for anyone. I stock up at the outlet.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve come across. Smells good and completely moisturizes my skin without leaving the oily residue. Great for guys with dry hands.</li>
            <li> This actually works. My husband had bad cracking in his heels and this worked better than anything else he&#x27;s ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it when I&#x27;ve been working without my gloves (again!) and my hands are really dry. Fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Feels so good, makes hands look good, not greasy. The scent is wonderful and dissipates quickly so as not to interfere with any perfume scent. It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used grabtree&amp;evelyyn gardeners hand therapy for many years.  This product is exceptional for dry hand restoration.  There&#x27;s none better!</li>
            <li> It is the BEST hand cream I used, and I am not young. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a new Mom again, frequently washing my hands, and house work, my hands start showing the abuse, this hand cream is not crease, magically stayed on and healed all the chipped skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 5 star!</li>
            <li> I have used this hand therapy for years and think it&#x27;s the best for dry, winter chapped skin as well as &amp;#34;dig-in-the-dirt&amp;#34; hands.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  perfect for your dry chafed hands, even smells wonderful...makes my hands feel smooth and happy after using it.</li>
            <li> It smells like herb for me and I kinda like it since it&#x27;s not so strong. The cream lasts for many hours.&lt;br /&gt;I love my hands more now.</li>
            <li> My mom swears by this product.  She is spoiled and will use no other.  All the fragrances are nice. And it&#x27;s a good price</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I work outside doing construction and my hands get destroyed. This seems to be the only stuff that works. An old girlfriend gave me some as a gift and I was hooked. I can&#x27;t remember the chicks name but I do remember the Crabtree and Evelyn name.</li>
            <li> Was given a tube of this as a gift. Wonderful for my hands &amp; heavenly scent. Also gave to friends.</li>
            <li> I tried this at a store and loved it. Not sticky, feels smooth</li>
            <li> Wonderful hand cream. Been using for years, light clean aroma</li>
            <li> This lotion really does help your dry, sore, rough hands. Or it is just a decadent way to treat yourself. The smell is terrific!</li>
            <li> The odor is not the type I like but all the others are perfect.</li>
            <li> So one day when I was hanging out with my friend, I put on a lotion I had in my purse. My friend hated the smell of it (a bath and bodyworks brand). So I was complaining that although I like bath and bodyworks, their lotions and body butters tend to be greasy for me and take forever for them to soak in! I feel like I use them more for the scent rather than to moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my friend told me their mother has always used Crabtree &amp; Evelyn. And told me it has a light scent that&#x27;s pleasent and that it is not greasy at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it on here, bought it, used it, and OH MY GOSH! I love it! It does have a light floral scent, so if you do not like floral scents then this might not be the product for you. However, if you don&#x27;t mind the floral scent, this stuff is not greasy, it soaks right in and FEELS like it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin! I love this and will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> This is the only hand lotion that actually works on my dry hands during Colorado winters.  It was recommended to me many years ago.</li>
            <li> Came quick. Was the product expected in perfect condition. Cheaper than the store bought brand. I love this product especially during winter for dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have used this hand cream several times and purchased several to give to my girlfriends.  Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave hands &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; since it&#x27;s absorbed easily</li>
            <li> even in the winter, my hands need the ultimate nourishment and repair that this product gives. I&#x27;ve used it for years and nothing else comes close.</li>
            <li> This makes my hands feel like satin, it isn&#x27;t greasy, and the scent is heavenly.  Far and away, my all-time favorite. They shouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;gardeners&amp;#34; because really it&#x27;s for anyone.  It may seem pricey, but I actually use less of this than regular hand lotion so it&#x27;s not as expensive as it may seem.  Besides which, it&#x27;s totally worth it.  A little bit of pure luxury every time I use it!</li>
            <li> Something about the way this lotion smells is so exotic and lovely - like frankincense and myrrh - but it&#x27;s subtle, not like anyone but you will be able to smell it when you put it on. It goes on beautifully and lasts many hours. I was happily surprised by the quality of this product. I think Crabtree &amp; Evelyn must have scent and skin care scientists on staff. This is the loveliest lotion I&#x27;ve ever had and I plan to give it as a gift to several friends as well as replenish when I run out!</li>
            <li> My husband stole this from me.  He&#x27;s in auto repair and he is constantly washing his hands (not all mechanics are greasy).  It works wonders and has a nice clean scent.  Leaves hands greaseless and soft.  Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> My mother in law always requests this lotion and has used it for years.  She is working constantly in the yard and swears by it!</li>
            <li> Another reviewer described the smell as a cheap aftershave. It smells like a cheap red candle to me... holly berry + menthol? Whatever it is, it is strong to my nose and NOT at all pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands feel greasy, yet dry. It doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin. It&#x27;s hard to believe you can feel greasy and dry, but there really is no other way to describe this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this lotion, especially at the $22/tube price. I will definitely not be purchasing again and I would not recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> Fantastic relief for hands after a day of gardening. Softens and heals rough dry hands. Good for preventing hangnails too.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave this a one star is that I liked the scent, otherwise I would have given no star.  A few minutes after I applied the hand cream, my hands were so dry that I got static when I touched light switch.  The crack on my  finger never healed.</li>
            <li> The smell is extra strong and unpleasant~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Not good for young ladies I think.&lt;br /&gt;As a moisturizer it works ok, not far better than what I bought for couples of dollars. Never buy it again.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, especially in cold, dry weather. She says she&#x27;s found nothing as good at moisturizing and preventing cracking.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it has a piney, cinnamony smell and works great on dry hands from winter cold.  Does not burn at all when I apply it like some hand lotions do.</li>
            <li> My friend gave me this as a gift and it&#x27;s the best stuff I ever used.  I use it on my feet too.  I like it better than Aveda, Jack Black and Kiels rough hand therapy lotions.</li>
            <li> Thanks, I did not have to go to the mall&lt;br /&gt;to find this product.  It&#x27;s a great gift&lt;br /&gt;for someone who has rough, dry, hands.</li>
            <li> cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  It works like a charm to fix dry skin wherever it is.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This cream is truly amazing.  I only wish it came in a bigger tube!  I have the exfoliating cream too.  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Love how this feels and makes skin look moistened! Great product!</li>
            <li> I hate hand creams and lotions.  Really HATE them.  I hate the way they smell, and I hate the way they feel on my skin.  But, I really liked this one.  It has a pleasant, earthy, grassy scent that I can live with, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or silky or gloppy, and best of all, it works.  All the splits and open cuts in my dry fingers healed over.  My hands look and feel good again, even in dry winter offices and apartments.</li>
            <li> We have used lots of lotions for dry, cracked, over worked hands.  This stuff&lt;br /&gt;is the best! It works immediately to soften your hands.</li>
            <li> I work in a factory all day with a lot of cardboard and chemicals which leech the moisture form skin. This stuff really works to defend my hands from the evils of manufacturing.&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s not oily but waxy and thick. Almost glove-like.&lt;br /&gt;  Now let&#x27;s discuss the scent. Fantastic. It has an herby, pine like, almost christmasy smell that I love. It really rocks. Plus it is perfectly masculine (although great for women too. Dare I say &amp;#34;unisex&amp;#34;?) and does not clash with colonge, body-wash, or deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;  I love it, but it&#x27;s kinda pricey at fifteen bucks. I like to spend ten dollars on lotion, but i suppose that&#x27;s the price you gotta pay for comfort and peace of mind in this twenty-first century fox life we live in. :)</li>
            <li> This hand cream smells wonderful, and it really soaks into my hands, making them feel soothed and soft.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Soothing and effective in assisting healing of nicks and rough hands. The lotion is absorbed quickly and does not leave hands slippery.</li>
            <li> My wife swears my this hand cream; she loves it. I got an extra hug at Christmas and now I&#x27;ll be getting more for Valentine&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li> This is the best healing product on the market. I also use it to sooth tired and aching hands after a cold round of golf in the winter.</li>
            <li> We are never without this product. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a real luxury lotion.  Lovely!</li>
            <li> Love how it feels and smells</li>
            <li> I bought this creme because I garden and my hands get very rough and dry.  While I like the way the creme feels, I just can&#x27;t wear it.  The smell is so strong and so bad that I just can&#x27;t stand to use it.  My husband said that it smells herbal, but to me it smells like cheap aftershave.  And it&#x27;s so strong you can smell if for hours afterwards.  It&#x27;s a shame because it works great.  I wouldn&#x27;t even give the tube have to anyone I know for fear of smelling it again.</li>
            <li> My son works in the produce section of a store. He has wet hands nearly every day. They were getting chapped and sore, but someone told him about this and he is VERY happy with it. It isn&#x27;t strongly scented, and really helps his hands. My cleaning woman also swears by it...again a person who has her hands in water or other liquid nearly all day. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse. I wash my hands a trillion times a day. This is the only lotion that actually soaks in and helps relieve my constantly dry, cracked hands!!!</li>
            <li> This hand cream is awesome.  It helps with dry skin, and I use it constantly on my hands, especially in the cold winter months.  It has a light smell which I find very pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have used this product.  It&#x27;s the greatest!!  Everyone should try it at least once, of course by then you&#x27;ll be hooked.  It can be used anywhere on your body and feels great.</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong on this lotion. I prefer the lighter scents without the eucalyptus or whatever the strong smell is. It DOES soften, but so does the rose, or the Nantucket Briar, and the smell on those is so pretty. Those do not burn if I accidentally get them in my eyes, either. (Within reason).</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews. It smells great and feels great. I out it in every night before bedtime. However, my hands are dry when i wake up. Will not buy again, but works well enough to finish the tube. Maybe i am supoosed to usemore frequently?</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t do anything for my dry hands after a couple of uses.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy i again.</li>
            <li> I have used several Crabtree and Evelyn hand creams and this is probably my least favorite because of the scent. As a moisturizer it works great, especially around the nails and fingertips where my hands get dry and crack. The hand therapy goes on very smooth and non greasy but the scent is very strong and spicy, it reminds me of a man&#x27;s cologne or aftershave.</li>
            <li> This cream has been my favorite for many years because it really heals the skin even after washing it off, it is still working.&lt;br /&gt;I have received this shipment in the past from the same seller once in a good condition, once in a bad condition (because it was sent in a paper envelope and squished). The seller was very nice and compensated me with a new tube after I sent pictures of the damages.  This is my 3-rd time ordering this cream, the shipment came in a box and there was no damage to the cream.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to receive it!</li>
            <li> i was introduced to this by a co-worker and i ended up buying some for my mom, grandmother and aunts for mothers day! we all love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not oily and very creamy.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter&#x27;s hands would sting from most hand creams not Gardeners. She is a gymnast so she uses lots of drying powder on her hands. This is the only hand cream that works for her. A small amount  works great.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me this cream several years ago because I do alot of gardening.  I love the texture and the fragrance and it really softens up my hands.  I&#x27;ve been buying it every since and am very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is SO stinky...the packaging is darling though!  I&#x27;m sure it has helped many people with dry hands, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the very strong smell long enough to find out if it would help mine.  Had to immediately wash off.</li>
            <li> What is listed here and described here is not the product that I received.  This was a gift and my friend specifically asked for 2792 Gardeners Hand Therapy.  Crabtree has changed their formula and no longer makes this product.  The herbs listed are not in the new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Gardeners Ultra Moisturizing Hand Therapy.  This is a different formula.  I was going to return it but my friend told me she would keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller and according to them, Amazon uses the UPC Code to determine the product.  Be aware what is listed is not what you will get.  I suggest you contact the seller before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this product is very strong smelling.</li>
            <li> I love gardening but I don&#x27;t have the discipline to wear gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love washing pots and pans but I have to do it. I don&#x27;t wear gloves.&lt;br /&gt;So, I need something to nourish my hands.&lt;br /&gt;This works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Apply it day and night and in between chores.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice fragrant too!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years! Very moisturizing, especially in the wintertime! A must have for your purse or desk drawer!</li>
            <li> Absorbs immediately, completely non-greasy after a couple seconds. Very impressive! And smells nice! Wish there was more inside the tube!</li>
            <li> This hand cream is THE best!  The very first time I tried it I was hooked.  The tubes I had been given as gifts ran out so I was looking to replace before gardening got underway. This is a great sized tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any doubts, don&#x27;t!  Try it.  It&#x27;s really good stuff!</li>
            <li> Working in the garden is tough on your hands, this is the best product yet that i have found for dried hands from gardening or the winter dry air.</li>
