            <li>They work good, they aren&#x27;t as bright as I would like them to be</li>

            <li>Price is good.</li>
            <li>Good quality Children loved it  </li>

            <li>Good these for my kids.</li>
            <li>My 5 year-old granddaughter loved it.  </li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>SOOOOO Cool!!!</li>
            <li>the color shows beautifully, my girls have lighter hair so it shows even better in their hair.</li>
            <li>daughter says this works great and doe not come off on to my grand daughters clothing..</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are an excellent way to dip your toe into some fun hair colors and they truly are self-sealing.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has blond hair and the colors showed but not as bright as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>Although my husband and I use it more than they do lol.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I have plenty of nieces who are always trying to convince me to color their hair, these work perfectly and allow for fun time doing hair together, they are bright and bold, very good product that allows for some great one on one time or even just to color your hair and go out on the town, either way it is a great product with fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My daughter enjoyed these!</li>
            <li>I want more colors!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this sparkles!</li>
            <li>I still have the color from the top of the shadows!  </li>
            <li>I will buy them again and hope they come out with more colors!</li>
            <li>Really easy to use, washes out great.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great and washes out easy.  </li>
            <li>it is a great, easy to use product.  </li>
            <li>Easy t o apply, safe, and washes out with shampoo,  granddaughters loved it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a crayon, and you need to blend with finger tips or brush, but it ends up looking amazing.  </li>
            <li>They are amazing.</li>
            <li>These are amazing........</li>
            <li>so we could do our hair for a Taylor Swift concert and the product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>After trying these again after all this time, I have to say these are still amazing.</li>
            <li>I have brown hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>and so they had given up trying to buy any, but these worked great and continue to be a huge hit.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter has loved using it on her hair</li>
            <li>It goes on kind of pasty and is crunchy after it dries.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>The colors were nice but it made her hair clump up.  </li>
            <li>Kids liked em though.</li>
            <li>Nice quality received before date to arrive.</li>
            <li>And the best thing about it is it really does wash out, no remnants.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice.</li>
            <li>It looks clumpy (think of drawing pastels on your hair and how oily that would be), but if you run a bristle brush through it after it spreads the color out nicely.  </li>
            <li>works nice, Just as described.</li>
            <li>They look nice after a lot of layering it on</li>
            <li>And it kind of smears.</li>
            <li>These are so much fun for kids &amp; adults!!!</li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant and great!  </li>
            <li>Very cool product!</li>
            <li>Good idea to wash out before bed though, as the color does come off easily.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and really bright.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, washes out, colors are good.  </li>
            <li>This does have good color once you get it applied, and it does wash out easily.</li>
            <li>They wash out very easily also.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and wash off.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply since it has the sealer already in it.</li>
            <li>Turns out it doesn&#x27;t have a smell, and washes away VERY easily.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, it&#x27;s basically just like coloring on hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to remove with just one shampooing.</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t have them this stuff washes off your hands very easily.  </li>
            <li>It also washed out very easily.</li>
            <li>They washbout very easily.</li>
            <li>It washed out 100%, very easily.</li>
            <li>and she put it on right away and LOVED it - bright colors.</li>
            <li>The markers are pretty awesome and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I liked it better after I washed it--</li>
            <li>Best gift for 13 year old granddaughter to experiment with, she loves it.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter loved it!!</li>
            <li>These are a great way to experiment with a fun hair color without the commitment.</li>
            <li>This grandmother had to try it, I must say that bright megenta looked kind of cool.</li>
            <li>These are really easy to use &amp; show up great on my light hair.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use and wash off!</li>
            <li>I would say these are best if you&#x27;re doing smaller chunks of color as they do go on kind of greasy.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, all the nieces loved them.</li>
            <li>My niece loved this for Christmas and used it right away!</li>
            <li>The colors are intense depending on your hair type but look amazing :) I am so happy to have these.</li>
            <li>but the good thing is that it comes right out in the wash! :)</li>
            <li>It gives bright, bold color and shows up even on my medium brown hair.  </li>
            <li>Stays in all day and stays bright all day but washes out quickly and easilly.</li>
            <li>I found the product easy to apply and liked it for the most part a lot.  </li>
            <li>I received so many compliments.</li>
            <li>love the product.  </li>
            <li>My daughters love to use these, they are 10 and 12.</li>
            <li>this is not a chalk, this has more of a lipstick consistency.</li>
            <li>I would say it is more like an oil crayon vs. chalk.  </li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t been able to try it out yet</li>
            <li>They lasted all day/night until I went put dancing and sweated most of it away.</li>
            <li>This is our favorite brand.</li>
            <li>(It was more like a crayon than chalk.)</li>
            <li>I got these for my daughters and they love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My kids love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I wonder if chalk would&#x27;ve stood out better.</li>
            <li>Goes on okay, but feels like lipstick in your hair.</li>
            <li>I love how you can hold it in your hand like a pen.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Definitely top of my list of must haves</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s just because I put more in</li>
            <li>I am also receiving so many compliments and not just in my Zumba class :).</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE IT!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I forgot to say that I love the fact that these come in a plastic pen.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I&#x27;m still able to brush my hair once the color is on it, and it doesn&#x27;t remove any of the color.</li>
            <li>I hope they come out with even more colors because I would love to add them to my collection.</li>
            <li>and I love to use them when i want more color in my hair</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this, and honesty want the rainbow pack to try them out as well. :)</li>
            <li>love dying my hair</li>
            <li>I love being able to have any color whenever i want, Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While my daughter is more skilled at applying it, they both love using them.</li>
            <li>I guess I should&#x27;ve more thoroughly read reviews on it.</li>
            <li>Love these highlights.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look much much better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>All in all, good stuff and worth the cost.</li>
            <li>My niece will love this</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more like &amp;#34;oil pastel&amp;#34;...very gooey.</li>
            <li>and my child was satisfied.</li>
            <li>and they do show up better than chalks.</li>
            <li>My nieces love going out with their stripy colored hair.</li>
            <li>so am ok with mine hanging around though.</li>
            <li>A brush might work, depending on the type of brush, a comb would work better.</li>
            <li>I thought these colors were bright and fun.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>My niece called to say thank you :)</li>
            <li>: Love the metallic sheen.</li>
            <li>Better than all others I&#x27;ve tried out there.</li>
            <li>My daughter and granddaughters LOVE these.</li>
            <li>it looks more gray.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughters LOVED this!!  </li>
            <li>there are many color choices to chooses from.  </li>
            <li>We love these.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these for a party and then ordered more just to have on hand.  </li>
            <li>These are better than the powers for sure.</li>
            <li>and I will look better.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t show up well, except for on the top of the head.</li>
            <li>We weren&#x27;t able to brush their hair at all afterwards.</li>
            <li>All of the kids on my xmas gift list LOVE these colors.  </li>
            <li>Definitely scored a win on these xmas gifts!</li>
            <li>My kids love this.  </li>
            <li>They love them.</li>
            <li>I love having the option each day to change the color of one one my bleached streaks.</li>
            <li>For our purpose, this set was way better than any toy or set marketed to tweens.</li>
            <li>I love the concept of having the color on a stick.  </li>
            <li>Arrived and had to be packed for move, but I am sure my daughter will love them.</li>
            <li>This stuff is ok.  </li>
            <li>My kids love this.  </li>
            <li>ends up more on my hands then in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>Love these so much and love using them on skin as well they stay on my skin but was off easy work great</li>
            <li>However, on the whole I couldn&#x27;t be happier: easy application, excellent colors, lots of fun - we even got 90YO grandma to glam it up a bit.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews before purchasing &amp; was glad that they loved up to their positive reviews.</li>
            <li>and if I would be able to get rid of the color easily.  </li>
            <li>It shows up better in the hair than salon highlights and easily washes out.  </li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re light brown to blonde I greatly suggest them!</li>
            <li>So you cant really work with your hair after the color is in, so you would not be able to say put chalk in hair and then use the straightener or curling iron, or the chalk would get on your styling tool and it will probably not be good for your hair.  </li>
            <li>Everything was very very very fine fine fine</li>
            <li>Looks very cool on my niece.</li>
            <li>However, very cool product.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, bright colors and washes out pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted pastel or bright colored streaks in my hair, but it seemed like too much hassle.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my four year old and they don&#x27;t work all that great on her hair.  </li>
            <li>: Enjoy :)</li>
            <li>Found it applies best if your hair is wet...</li>
            <li>But if you want to leave your hair natural and add this chalk it works great.</li>
            <li>The great thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come off when you have it on your hair (like on your skin or clothes), but it does wash out with no trouble.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would show up easier in light hair.</li>
            <li>It has been fun experimenting with the nice colors.</li>
            <li>It works very nicely on the portions of my hair that are completely silver, but I do wonder how it might work on darker hair.  </li>
            <li>This hair chalk is super easy to use!</li>
            <li>This stuff is so cool!</li>
            <li>It washed away easily with soap and water and worked for the day that we needed them for</li>
            <li>It washes out easily with shampoo and we have had no problems with staining any fabrics.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>easy to get on the hair.  </li>
            <li>It washes away easily.</li>
            <li>It gets on your hands and brush, but washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>They wash out easily and don&#x27;t ruin your hair</li>

            <li>My 13 year old daughter just loved this as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>Love that there is next to no mess to apply, and end result looks great!!!!</li>
            <li>When I found this as an alternative it was very exciting...</li>
            <li>It was super easy to color my hair.</li>
            <li>This is not a fault with this particular brand or color - this is just the truth for this kind of hair coloring.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is very easy to apply and washes out very well.</li>
            <li>The pricing was VERY reasonable and I love how the product works.  </li>
            <li>I really love it, very pigmented!</li>
            <li>Went on smoothly and was full of color.  </li>
            <li>These are so much fun!  </li>
            <li>Fun purchase!</li>
            <li>We had so much fun playing with it while on our girls beach weekend!  </li>
            <li>I love it and will for sure order more in the future!!!</li>
            <li>We had fun with it!  </li>
            <li>anyway, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>So fun!</li>
            <li>So much fun, our daughter loves them!</li>
            <li>My middle daughter has much lighter brown (not blond) hair and most colors showed up great.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased for a Dr. Seuss Day at their preschool, but we still use it out and about.  </li>
            <li>And did I mention that it is super bright and has almost no mess while applying?</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and shows up great in light or dark hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, vibrant color (shows up great on dark hair), but wear with caution!!!</li>
            <li>These are fun for kids and/or Halloween and are only temporary which is great.  </li>
            <li>Ran a brush thru it, and it blended, appeared less brilliant, but still there.</li>
            <li>- I think I got the nonmetallic set with more primary colors - but still really like them.  </li>
            <li>Besides it&#x27;s just fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great fun especially for dance recitals</li>
            <li>Work great on my golden blonde hair and on the lighter brown parts of my hair too.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and thought I would try this one out because the reviews looked good!</li>
            <li>but this is super easy and fun.</li>
            <li>You can put them on lightly for a pastel effect, or use more pressure on a clump of hair for a vibrant effect, it&#x27;s up to you.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has blonde hair and they show up bright on her.</li>
            <li>They work really great on dark and light hair.</li>
            <li>More like hair markers and good for dark hair.</li>
            <li>Takes a long time to get the brilliant color my daughter wants but she lives it.</li>
            <li>I also love how much easier it is to put on then sprays or chalk.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;d look really cool on bleached hair, but if I was going to bleach my hair, I&#x27;d dye it the cool color, not use hair chalk.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easier to see the color on the blonde, but my dark haired beauty had some wonderful pink highlights that showed perfectly.</li>
            <li>Used these at a Girl Scout booth at a local community fair</li>
            <li>That is true of any hair chalk.  </li>
            <li>The colors were cool, had glitter in them.</li>
            <li>This item is cool but not a must have.</li>
            <li>but they are good enough</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, showed up very well in my niece&#x27;s hair (light brown).  </li>
            <li>We love these and they wash out nicely when we&#x27;re ready to go back to nice, normal school-ready hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the best results through the as-seen-on-tv chalk stuff, they&#x27;re just a real pain to mess with.  </li>
            <li>Goes on fine for novelty wear, would look for a powder-based chalk if I wanted something higher quality.</li>
            <li>Some even said it fell off the hair so quickly they had to take a quick picture to show their friends.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But love them all the same :)</li>
            <li>Thank goodness it washes out quickly</li>
            <li>Make sure u have colorful streaks that are really visible (</li>
            <li>Some quick tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li>These were pretty easy and fun to use.</li>
            <li>FUN, FUN, FUN!</li>
            <li>but it still looks very pretty .</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no mess, easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>These colors go on easily and show up very well.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easily washed out with shampoo but didn&#x27;t really come off on my hands til I started pouring sweat.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and dries fast.</li>
            <li>It was easy to remove too, much cleaner than the spray dyes in my opinion.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super fun</li>
            <li>I love these, they are so cool, coming from a 15 year old.</li>
            <li>Super fun.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re taking these somewhere hot, maybe keep them in your cooler or something!</li>
            <li>Worked out very well!!</li>
            <li>You have to grab a section of hair and hold it while you mark it with the color, so not as spontaneous as more typical hair chalks can be.</li>
            <li>This was fine by me because I wanted a more natural look but look out if you have dark hair  and want a more striking, glamorous look.</li>
            <li>The color is fine - but it will absolutely run onto your pillow and clothes.  </li>
            <li>Easy enough for my 8 year old niece to use by herself, and it looks good in her hair.</li>
            <li>It does not show much on dark hair, but if you use it in combination with the chalks the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>Would recommend for straight, light colored hair.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my own hair, which is blonde, and it didn&#x27;t leave a trace, yet it lasted until I washed it out.</li>
            <li>These were fun.</li>
            <li>I am old as dirt and still got so many compliments.  </li>
            <li>She is having fun with this.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for just something fun to brighten up my classes.</li>
            <li>I get to have all the fun colors I want with out having to ruin my hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just for fun.</li>
            <li>These turned out to be so much fun</li>
            <li>Sure people stare, they think we&#x27;re too old to have funky colored hair</li>
            <li>I am loving these , They aren&#x27;t only for kids but adults</li>
            <li>so you can see if a lot more clearly.</li>
            <li>I used these for my daughter to have fun, and also with her friends.</li>
            <li>Is fun how they feel with the color in the hair.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool idea.</li>
            <li>did mark her face with a nice blue hue.</li>
            <li>Fun for trying color combinations.</li>
            <li>Bought for a costume party and ended up having a lot of fun with these.</li>
            <li>By far, the crayons are better than sprays.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have had lots of fun with this hair chalk.  </li>
            <li>The color is true, pretty &amp; stays on for a couple days.</li>
            <li>I thought it looked more wild</li>
            <li>They are fun</li>
            <li>Far better than others we have found.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these for my granddaughter just to have fun with.  </li>
            <li>but if you have blond or light brown hair any color will show up super vibrant.</li>
            <li>So I use the silver and if you press this softly, you get a light color from all the rest also!  </li>
            <li>My young daughters love them.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re still having fun.</li>
            <li>She had fun with it.</li>
            <li>Not a chalk at all more like a crayon,  gave them to my 2yr old to use for coloring.  </li>
            <li>Many of the other \\&quot; Highlighting\\&quot; options seemed to b a was of many by the reviews ...</li>
            <li>The only issue I had was that it was somewhat challenging to get an even color along the hair and the color was pretty light.</li>
            <li>and she really is having fun with them!</li>
            <li>The girls loved to play and color each other&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>and it washed right out of hers in one wash.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t get on my bed afterwards and washed right out, so yay.</li>
            <li>it arrived 2 days earlier and its a very cool product!</li>
            <li>Works awesome on my daughters dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Many Aunties remarked on how most of these hair chalks don&#x27;t work on my nieces dark brown/black hair</li>
            <li>These are so easy to use the color is vivid.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves these, it gives her quick color that lasts pretty much all day!</li>
            <li>Young adult rock star was pleased!</li>
            <li>my daughter loves these color last well and washes out easy!</li>
            <li>tomorrow much less look good.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, colors are bright especially blue and green.</li>
            <li>It does seem to be cool as body paint though.&lt;br /&gt;Attaching a picture that shows it decently, but I used the flash on my camera to show that it had shown up at all on my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Knocking off a couple of stars because: it doesn&#x27;t glide on as easily as they make you think it does, but if you hold your hair taut enough or put a piece of paper behind it (for me, the packet for nylon stockings, which is shiny and perfect for this, it works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If anyone does find some good temporary hair color out there for medium &amp; dark haired people, please comment on this and let me know!</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s super easy to be removed by simply washing the hair.</li>
            <li>More similar to crayons.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how they look on light hairs, but they sure did not show on my dark hairs.  </li>
            <li>so when it first goes on, while it&#x27;s a bit tacky, it works with my cut.  </li>
            <li>Comfort: 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;It globs massively.</li>
            <li>I will say they work very well on my golden retriever, and that leads me to believe that it would work well on blond hair.</li>
            <li>It has always washed out of my hair the first time.</li>
            <li>Oh - and the ones I have totally blend. :)</li>
            <li>Wide variety of nice colors and rapid shipping, these allow me to play without the commitment of permanent color.</li>
            <li>I actually think it looks much better if you DO brush through it afterwards.</li>
            <li>so I had to use more that someone with blonde to get the color to pop.</li>
            <li>First, you would have to bleach your hair (which can cause damage).</li>
            <li>(It is possible , just takes more time)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t as pleased with the actual product because unless you have blond hair, it doesn&#x27;t show up well at all.</li>
            <li>My daughter didn&#x27;t like it; stained her t-shirt, and it didn&#x27;t really come out the way she wanted it!</li>
            <li>We used our arm the first day and got color all over ourselves.</li>
            <li>They do last much better</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Probably works better on light color hair, my daughter is a dark blond</li>
            <li>Most of the color came out in one washing, the rest came out after a second washing.  </li>
            <li>I am sure these will last for years assuming they don&#x27;t spoil.  </li>
            <li>The gold is more a yellow.</li>
            <li>but over time say 5 hours, the Color Smash is exactly where I put it</li>
            <li>These work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY!</li>
            <li>It begins to fade after the first night</li>
            <li>they are almost the consistency of a dry lipstick, which makes application very easy.....</li>
            <li>These, on the other hand, were vibrant and bright, even the gold.  </li>
            <li>I will prefer to choose other nice gift</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use heat styling tools (flat iron or curling iron) - I&#x27;m sure that would have helped.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to try different temporary hair colors to see if I liked any for a more permanent color change down the road.  </li>
            <li>I bought these because of the good reviews, however it was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li>The subtle colors was very nice though.</li>
            <li>This hair chalk goes on very smooth and easy, you hardly have to press at all.  </li>
            <li>in summary, I LOVE this temporary hair color, it stayed in my dark brown hair for about two days, and it stayed in my daughters strawberry blonde hair for about four days, and it was exactly what we were hoping for so that we looked fantastic on our beach vacation!</li>
            <li>I used the green on dark hair for Paddy&#x27;s day and it showed up great!!!  </li>
            <li>let dry (30 seconds) and go :) You can blend the colors or just have one, each color have a sealer built;t</li>
            <li>Washes out easily, and doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy or gross when in.</li>
            <li>I expected this to be easy to apply, no mess, easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to purchase these as I never really had good luck with temp hair coloring, even with my blonde hair.</li>
            <li>The gold looked yellow, which was fine with me.  </li>
            <li>Good product but not so efficient and sometimes hard to apply to my hair.</li>
            <li>The green and blue are great but the rest of the colors are iffy.</li>
            <li>Bought three of these for my nieces this Christmas - they were a huge hit with everyone present.</li>
            <li>i would like more purple and pink.</li>
            <li>She may not have used much or it was muted because of her hair color.</li>
            <li>Yes, it really does work on brown hair as it claims.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair platinum before so it shows up really well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have a spiky straight cut</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I just bought this about four months ago because I really felt like dying my hair temporarily.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely order this again.</li>
            <li>Also, I read one review that said you can&#x27;t really brush your hair after.</li>
            <li>its very pretty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HELP</li>
            <li>It really couldn&#x27;t be any easier.</li>
            <li>This is crazy awesome!!!</li>
            <li>Very glossy hair look.</li>
            <li>The colors however get on your fingers as you use them and you really got to soap up to wash it off your hands, so that is why I gave them 4 and not 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>It is a fun gift and not too wild.</li>
            <li>but if you put too much in, the hair stays sticky, even after drying, and combing her hair is a battle.  </li>
            <li>My friend also has blonde hair which is not as light as mine though</li>
            <li>I had my doubts but when I applied it to my hair it showed up really well.</li>
            <li>It made my hair stringy and waxy looking, like I had already been sweating before I even went out, it also clumps very easily.&lt;br /&gt;*It rubbed off all over my boyfriend&#x27;s shirt</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t work very well with my brown hair.</li>
            <li>They really stand out, which is what I wanted</li>
            <li>The silver doesn&#x27;t show up real well as silver....</li>
            <li>The color goes on really well</li>
            <li>I really like the crayon application sticks</li>
            <li>so I cannot get the light color from the darker color I am using (Or mix the colors as well as with the Hair Chalk above)</li>
            <li>Our girls had to put so much on to get get the colors to show up.</li>
            <li>Very oily and greasy.</li>
            <li>Calling it chalk is very deceiving.</li>
            <li>that was much easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>Its very prettty</li>
            <li>Purchased these for my 7-yr-old daughter, who really wanted to color her hair.</li>
            <li>and they really don&#x27;t show at all.  </li>
            <li>My daughter really loves this product.</li>
            <li>The colour does not show up as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really show up if you have darker hair.  </li>
            <li>Then you would have to apply hair dye, and I&#x27;ve heard that colorful dyes fade fast anyway, so you would have to do this frequently.</li>
            <li>a bit different than i expected, but good</li>
            <li>They made a mess everywhere, but cleanup was quick and easy and a shower took care of all the color.  </li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair &amp; even though other reviewers had said it showed up beautifully, I wasn&#x27;t convinced.  </li>
            <li>She is only six, but I&#x27;d have fun with these too!  </li>
            <li>Such fun stuff!  </li>
            <li>Colors so rich and vibrant that they even show up on my very dark hair and look fantastic on my blond daughter.</li>
            <li>They both have somewhat dark hair and the colors were noticeable enough but not stand out bright on their hair.</li>
            <li>With Color Smash I can leave it on for 3 days and it really stays  vibrant.  </li>
            <li>only good on black hair</li>
            <li>The purple, pink, blue, and green worked best on my hair since I have Carmel colored hair.</li>
            <li>Barely showed up in my niece&#x27;s strawberry hair, but it was fun nonetheless.</li>
            <li>so the Blue, Green and Pink work best</li>
            <li>I would say the full effect of the color lasts only on the day you apply it.  </li>
            <li>Kids love them wife likes less of use and cleaning</li>
            <li>These markers work better than the hair chalk I have used previously.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried a lot of them, and the color in these is vibrant and even.</li>
            <li>They show up super well on my daughter&#x27;s blonde well - not as well on my (reddish brown) hair or her friends&#x27; darker hair.</li>
            <li>We had much more success with coloring and pulling it back, rather then let it stay down.</li>
            <li>My favorite colors are red and pink (I have light blonde hair).  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s damaging, I think after bleaching it and getting it white, i may just start using this set to get my hair pretty colors !</li>
            <li>Happily surprised when I noticed that it did work!!</li>
            <li>All the other sites, had customers complaining that it rubbed off the hair so easily, it ruined whatever costume or clothing they were wearing.  </li>
            <li>BUT they are really hard to put onto your own hair, unless it is braided.</li>
            <li>I kept applying more and more of it to try to make it show up, and it made a sticky, stiff mess of my hair, and that was all.</li>
            <li>I have light blond hair and the pink</li>
            <li>Meh, color is not intense on light brown hair and comes off a bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My little girl is very excited to have it for her hair.</li>
            <li>im happy about my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;it is faint though.</li>
            <li>they say 80 strokes per applicator i think more like 30 for long hair or a larger area</li>
            <li>The green is more like teal but</li>
            <li>They wash out with a normal hair washing.</li>
            <li>You will waste some on coloring on the cardboard, but more color will be pressed into your hair that way.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>After an hour or more, then brush the hair very firmly a few times, and you should be all</li>
            <li>My wife is having fun with these different colors.</li>
            <li>I bought these because I wanted to have temporary fun colors in my hair... and it worked, but it made my hair all gross feeling.</li>
            <li>Fades the second and third day, but easy to recolor.  </li>
            <li>You still can&#x27;t expect yellow, for example, to show up on black hair, but blues, greens, reds all turn out nicely.</li>
            <li>Do the color a little bit in advance of when you want it to look good, itâs a little crusy and flaky for the first couple hours as it dries and sets</li>
            <li>These are NOT SMALL like one of the people mentioned , in fact there huge a little bigger then a average Lipstick , There not like chalk at all more like lipstick, I have dark/medium brown hair and there all actually very visible , pink takes the most streaks to apply</li>
            <li>As soon as she brushed her hair all the color came right out.</li>
            <li>and it washes right out with the next shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are like crayons or very soft pencil eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no mess on your clothes, but you do want to use an older wash cloth when washing your face.  </li>
            <li>actually took a few washes to come out all the way, but that was kind of an unexpected bonus for me.</li>
            <li>No messy hands or &#x27;chalk&#x27; dust on your cloths!</li>
            <li>and they last pretty well</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The number one Christmas gift for my 12 yr old daughter-she loves it!</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;chalk&amp;#34; is ok, but I&#x27;ve had some in the past (can&#x27;t remember the brand)</li>
            <li>Anything from a wide swath of one colour to a few strands of colour here and there to full on rainbow is easily achieved.</li>
            <li>The chalk applies smoothly and evenly without mess, but looks faded and light unless you apply a lot of pressure and run the chalk up and down the strand of hair.  </li>
            <li>Messy but washes out easily.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and not at all messy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I have received this product in exchange for testing as well as giving  my personal thoughts and opinions , All stated above is true or my thoughts.</li>
            <li>I have a blonde and a dark haired daughter and they both love it!&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li>the markers may not show up well under regular indoor lighting, but they can really pop in the sunlight and brighter than normal lighting.</li>
            <li>The colors are strong, it&#x27;s not powdery and messy.</li>
            <li>The hair is a little clumped at first but after a bit, you can comb the strands apart and they separate to blend right in.  </li>
            <li>It works okay on some of the lighter strands but still not very bright.  </li>
            <li>The hair color crayons make the hair very stiff so make sure to apply in the direction you want the hair to go as once you put it on, the hair stays the way you apply.  </li>
            <li>So easily, actually that I&#x27;m sure if you got caught in the rain you&#x27;d have a mess on your hands.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice hard to get color to show on dark hair</li>
            <li>They were not dried out like some i have gotten</li>
            <li>I gave this to my 16 year old niece as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>so my 5 year old doesn&#x27;t have chalk all over his hands when he gets home from school.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer old and gray.  </li>
            <li>I tried it the day I got it and was instantly amazed of how real it looked in my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is a soft silver</li>
            <li>but sometimes I want to show my wild side.</li>
            <li>My 10 yr old daughter has been asking for over a year to dye her hair....</li>
            <li>Goes in fast and last!</li>
            <li>These pens have become a must have in my beauty supply, and I use them frequently.</li>
            <li>I got it for my 8yr old daughter &amp; 5yr old niece.</li>
            <li>These were a gift for my 10 and 7 year old daughters.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third: you can probably seek a few gunk bits that aren&#x27;t that smooth, Take a hair brush and Brush everywhere</li>
            <li>No messy chalkiness to deal with.</li>
            <li>I have not tried sealing the color in with hairspray to see how much longer they can last.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old daughter loves to wear this product</li>
            <li>and it not messy at all.</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin, you might want to reconsider.</li>
            <li>I think an adult would have no trouble washing it out.</li>
            <li>For the first few minutes, the color showed up pretty well.</li>
            <li>Nice idea, poor results.</li>
            <li>Tried a couple other colors and they all are pretty vibrant.</li>
            <li>Use a comb right after you put the color in, these markers WILL tangle your hair a little bit as you put it in, even with the above cardboard trick, but if you comb it out right away that helps A LOT.</li>
            <li>The silver was less bright on her dark blonde hair, but that&#x27;s just because of the combination of colors.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many other hair chalks these come in a tube like a lip balm and your hair doesn&#x27;t need to be wet for these to work,&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no mess and nothing to do to seal it.  </li>
            <li>I was happily proven wrong, it shows up really well on dark hair.  </li>
            <li>The darker colors show up pretty well on my hair (light auburn) but only the green really shows up on my daughter (dark auburn) plus it will come off on your hands and clothes if you touch your hair and rub up against something.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and they last in the hair.  </li>
            <li>They go on pretty easy with little mess and wash off hands without soap.</li>
            <li>These look like LARGE soft crayons, not small like other reviewer said.  </li>
            <li>The affect is not that bold but you an see it a little.  </li>
            <li>It lets her have a little harmless creativity with her appearance and her school luckily allows it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely NO PROBLEMS with customer service - fast and complete.  </li>
            <li>We bought Splat hair chalk at the store for my daughter, and applying it was a mess, her entire back and top of her clothing was chalky and blue, and the colors looked faded.  </li>
            <li>She is growing out her hair (from pixie cut to long) and, since her hair is too short to pull back, these create a fun doo for her in the interim.  </li>
            <li>Very temporary - meaning after a lot of work to get color to show, it&#x27;s out within less than a hour of normal activity.</li>
            <li>I think my hair (dark blonde) is a little too dark for these to be very effective with</li>
            <li>Just one thing, it doesnt last long like the chalk is really smallð</li>
            <li>my daughter has dark brown hair and you can really see it in her hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old with purple and blue hair (today).</li>
            <li>but it barely shows on medium brown hair.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s definite fading by morning, but I haven&#x27;t seen stains in pillow cases or clothing so far.</li>
            <li>They look barely used</li>
            <li>Barely visible.</li>
            <li>I completely colored the braid and also did a yellow and silver strikes.</li>
            <li>The product completely washes out with 1 regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>All the other colors show up really well.</li>
            <li>The other colors really pop and show up well.</li>
            <li>The only mess was on my hands while I was coloring my daughters hair, which washed right off.</li>
            <li>I bought these four year old for her birthday and soon everyone at the party including the adults had blue and red highlights.</li>
            <li>It does not really dry, so it can rub off onto the clothing they wear.  </li>
            <li>Some of them do not show up in dark hair very well.</li>
            <li>Takes a lot of highlighting to get it to appear on dark hair, and with curly hair, the chalk makes your curls straight.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that I brought it to a music festival where it got really hot during the day, and they got all melty &amp; made a mess.</li>
            <li>You really have to continue to draw up and down repeatedly to get the color deeper.  </li>
            <li>The color leaves your hair feeling slightly like you sprayed it with hairspray, but I don&#x27;t really find that to be a problem.</li>
            <li>Works very well on black hair- but use a lot.</li>
            <li>Sure they are a bit messy while applying, but nowhere near as messy as one other brand I tried which was shaped like 1/2 of a golf ball.  </li>
            <li>You can switch up your look by using different colors, and it takes less than 5 minutes to apply (depending on how much of your hair you want to color).</li>
            <li>The colors are beautifully vibrant and show up, even on dark hair.</li>
            <li>They are vibrant, even on my friend&#x27;s dark hair.</li>

            <li> the color shows beautifully, my girls have lighter hair so it shows even better in their hair.</li>
            <li> daughter says this works great and doe not come off on to my grand daughters clothing..</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are an excellent way to dip your toe into some fun hair colors and they truly are self-sealing.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has blond hair and the colors showed but not as bright as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> Although my husband and I use it more than they do lol.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have plenty of nieces who are always trying to convince me to color their hair, these work perfectly and allow for fun time doing hair together, they are bright and bold, very good product that allows for some great one on one time or even just to color your hair and go out on the town, either way it is a great product with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My daughter enjoyed these!</li>
            <li> I want more colors!  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s like a crayon, and you need to blend with finger tips or brush, but it ends up looking amazing.  </li>
            <li> They are amazing.</li>
            <li> These are amazing........</li>

            <li> I have brown hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li> and so they had given up trying to buy any, but these worked great and continue to be a huge hit.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter has loved using it on her hair</li>
            <li> It goes on kind of pasty and is crunchy after it dries.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> The colors were nice but it made her hair clump up.  </li>
            <li> Kids liked em though.</li>
            <li> Nice quality received before date to arrive.</li>
            <li> And the best thing about it is it really does wash out, no remnants.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice.</li>
            <li> It looks clumpy (think of drawing pastels on your hair and how oily that would be), but if you run a bristle brush through it after it spreads the color out nicely.  </li>
            <li> works nice, Just as described.</li>
            <li> They look nice after a lot of layering it on</li>
            <li> And it kind of smears.</li>
            <li> These are so much fun for kids &amp; adults!!!</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant and great!  </li>
            <li> Very cool product!</li>
            <li> Good idea to wash out before bed though, as the color does come off easily.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and really bright.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, washes out, colors are good.  </li>
            <li> This does have good color once you get it applied, and it does wash out easily.</li>
            <li> They wash out very easily also.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and wash off.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply since it has the sealer already in it.</li>
            <li> Turns out it doesn&#x27;t have a smell, and washes away VERY easily.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, it&#x27;s basically just like coloring on hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to remove with just one shampooing.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t have them this stuff washes off your hands very easily.  </li>
            <li> It also washed out very easily.</li>
            <li> They washbout very easily.</li>
            <li> It washed out 100%, very easily.</li>
            <li> and she put it on right away and LOVED it - bright colors.</li>
            <li> The markers are pretty awesome and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I liked it better after I washed it--</li>
            <li> Best gift for 13 year old granddaughter to experiment with, she loves it.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter loved it!!</li>
            <li> These are a great way to experiment with a fun hair color without the commitment.</li>
            <li> This grandmother had to try it, I must say that bright megenta looked kind of cool.</li>
            <li> These are really easy to use &amp; show up great on my light hair.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use and wash off!</li>
            <li> I would say these are best if you&#x27;re doing smaller chunks of color as they do go on kind of greasy.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, all the nieces loved them.</li>
            <li> My niece loved this for Christmas and used it right away!</li>
            <li> The colors are intense depending on your hair type but look amazing :) I am so happy to have these.</li>
            <li> but the good thing is that it comes right out in the wash! :)</li>
            <li> It gives bright, bold color and shows up even on my medium brown hair.  </li>
            <li> Stays in all day and stays bright all day but washes out quickly and easilly.</li>
            <li> I found the product easy to apply and liked it for the most part a lot.  </li>
            <li> I received so many compliments.</li>
            <li> love the product.  </li>
            <li> My daughters love to use these, they are 10 and 12.</li>
            <li> this is not a chalk, this has more of a lipstick consistency.</li>
            <li> I would say it is more like an oil crayon vs. chalk.  </li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t been able to try it out yet</li>
            <li> They lasted all day/night until I went put dancing and sweated most of it away.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite brand.</li>
            <li> (It was more like a crayon than chalk.)</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughters and they love it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> My kids love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I wonder if chalk would&#x27;ve stood out better.</li>
            <li> Goes on okay, but feels like lipstick in your hair.</li>
            <li> I love how you can hold it in your hand like a pen.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> Definitely top of my list of must haves</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s just because I put more in</li>
            <li> I am also receiving so many compliments and not just in my Zumba class :).</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE IT!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I forgot to say that I love the fact that these come in a plastic pen.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;m still able to brush my hair once the color is on it, and it doesn&#x27;t remove any of the color.</li>
            <li> I hope they come out with even more colors because I would love to add them to my collection.</li>
            <li> and I love to use them when i want more color in my hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this, and honesty want the rainbow pack to try them out as well. :)</li>
            <li> love dying my hair</li>
            <li> I love being able to have any color whenever i want, Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While my daughter is more skilled at applying it, they both love using them.</li>
            <li> I guess I should&#x27;ve more thoroughly read reviews on it.</li>
            <li> Love these highlights.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look much much better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> All in all, good stuff and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My niece will love this</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more like &amp;#34;oil pastel&amp;#34;...very gooey.</li>
            <li> and my child was satisfied.</li>
            <li> and they do show up better than chalks.</li>
            <li> My nieces love going out with their stripy colored hair.</li>
            <li> so am ok with mine hanging around though.</li>
            <li> A brush might work, depending on the type of brush, a comb would work better.</li>
            <li> I thought these colors were bright and fun.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li> My niece called to say thank you :)</li>
            <li> : Love the metallic sheen.</li>
            <li> Better than all others I&#x27;ve tried out there.</li>
            <li> My daughter and granddaughters LOVE these.</li>
            <li> it looks more gray.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughters LOVED this!!  </li>
            <li> there are many color choices to chooses from.  </li>
            <li> We love these.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these for a party and then ordered more just to have on hand.  </li>
            <li> These are better than the powers for sure.</li>
            <li> and I will look better.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t show up well, except for on the top of the head.</li>
            <li> We weren&#x27;t able to brush their hair at all afterwards.</li>
            <li> All of the kids on my xmas gift list LOVE these colors.  </li>
            <li> Definitely scored a win on these xmas gifts!</li>
            <li> My kids love this.  </li>
            <li> They love them.</li>
            <li> I love having the option each day to change the color of one one my bleached streaks.</li>
            <li> For our purpose, this set was way better than any toy or set marketed to tweens.</li>
            <li> I love the concept of having the color on a stick.  </li>
            <li> Arrived and had to be packed for move, but I am sure my daughter will love them.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok.  </li>
            <li> My kids love this.  </li>
            <li> ends up more on my hands then in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> Love these so much and love using them on skin as well they stay on my skin but was off easy work great</li>
            <li> However, on the whole I couldn&#x27;t be happier: easy application, excellent colors, lots of fun - we even got 90YO grandma to glam it up a bit.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing &amp; was glad that they loved up to their positive reviews.</li>
            <li> and if I would be able to get rid of the color easily.  </li>
            <li> It shows up better in the hair than salon highlights and easily washes out.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re light brown to blonde I greatly suggest them!</li>
            <li> So you cant really work with your hair after the color is in, so you would not be able to say put chalk in hair and then use the straightener or curling iron, or the chalk would get on your styling tool and it will probably not be good for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Everything was very very very fine fine fine</li>
            <li> Looks very cool on my niece.</li>
            <li> However, very cool product.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, bright colors and washes out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted pastel or bright colored streaks in my hair, but it seemed like too much hassle.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my four year old and they don&#x27;t work all that great on her hair.  </li>
            <li> : Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> Found it applies best if your hair is wet...</li>
            <li> But if you want to leave your hair natural and add this chalk it works great.</li>
            <li> The great thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come off when you have it on your hair (like on your skin or clothes), but it does wash out with no trouble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would show up easier in light hair.</li>
            <li> It has been fun experimenting with the nice colors.</li>
            <li> It works very nicely on the portions of my hair that are completely silver, but I do wonder how it might work on darker hair.  </li>
            <li> This hair chalk is super easy to use!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so cool!</li>

            <li> the color washed off their hair easily.</li>
            <li> Remember that most make-ups, lipsticks and eye shadows slide off my face in 30 minutes so you can imagine my joy in something I do not have to keep checking my mirror to see if I need to reapply the above chalk..  </li>
            <li> But, it easily washes out.</li>
            <li> It lasts well, yet washes out easily.</li>

            <li> The colors look nice and not dusty like the chalk brands.</li>
            <li> I did not try these colors on light hairs</li>

            <li> When I found this as an alternative it was very exciting...</li>
            <li> It was super easy to color my hair.</li>
            <li> This is not a fault with this particular brand or color - this is just the truth for this kind of hair coloring.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is very easy to apply and washes out very well.</li>
            <li> The pricing was VERY reasonable and I love how the product works.  </li>

            <li> Went on smoothly and was full of color.  </li>
            <li> These are so much fun!  </li>
            <li> Fun purchase!</li>

            <li> I love it and will for sure order more in the future!!!</li>
            <li> We had fun with it!  </li>
            <li> anyway, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> So fun!</li>
            <li> So much fun, our daughter loves them!</li>
            <li> My middle daughter has much lighter brown (not blond) hair and most colors showed up great.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased for a Dr. Seuss Day at their preschool, but we still use it out and about.  </li>
            <li> And did I mention that it is super bright and has almost no mess while applying?</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and shows up great in light or dark hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great, vibrant color (shows up great on dark hair), but wear with caution!!!</li>
            <li> These are fun for kids and/or Halloween and are only temporary which is great.  </li>
            <li> Ran a brush thru it, and it blended, appeared less brilliant, but still there.</li>
            <li> - I think I got the nonmetallic set with more primary colors - but still really like them.  </li>
            <li> Besides it&#x27;s just fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great fun especially for dance recitals</li>
            <li> Work great on my golden blonde hair and on the lighter brown parts of my hair too.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and thought I would try this one out because the reviews looked good!</li>
            <li> but this is super easy and fun.</li>
            <li> You can put them on lightly for a pastel effect, or use more pressure on a clump of hair for a vibrant effect, it&#x27;s up to you.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has blonde hair and they show up bright on her.</li>
            <li> They work really great on dark and light hair.</li>
            <li> More like hair markers and good for dark hair.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to get the brilliant color my daughter wants but she lives it.</li>
            <li> I also love how much easier it is to put on then sprays or chalk.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;d look really cool on bleached hair, but if I was going to bleach my hair, I&#x27;d dye it the cool color, not use hair chalk.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easier to see the color on the blonde, but my dark haired beauty had some wonderful pink highlights that showed perfectly.</li>
            <li> Used these at a Girl Scout booth at a local community fair</li>
            <li> That is true of any hair chalk.  </li>
            <li> The colors were cool, had glitter in them.</li>
            <li> This item is cool but not a must have.</li>
            <li> but they are good enough</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, showed up very well in my niece&#x27;s hair (light brown).  </li>
            <li> We love these and they wash out nicely when we&#x27;re ready to go back to nice, normal school-ready hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the best results through the as-seen-on-tv chalk stuff, they&#x27;re just a real pain to mess with.  </li>
            <li> Goes on fine for novelty wear, would look for a powder-based chalk if I wanted something higher quality.</li>
            <li> Some even said it fell off the hair so quickly they had to take a quick picture to show their friends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But love them all the same :)</li>
            <li> Thank goodness it washes out quickly</li>
            <li> Make sure u have colorful streaks that are really visible (</li>
            <li> Some quick tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li> These were pretty easy and fun to use.</li>
            <li> FUN, FUN, FUN!</li>
            <li> but it still looks very pretty .</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no mess, easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> These colors go on easily and show up very well.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s easily washed out with shampoo but didn&#x27;t really come off on my hands til I started pouring sweat.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and dries fast.</li>
            <li> It was easy to remove too, much cleaner than the spray dyes in my opinion.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super fun</li>
            <li> I love these, they are so cool, coming from a 15 year old.</li>
            <li> Super fun.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re taking these somewhere hot, maybe keep them in your cooler or something!</li>
            <li> Worked out very well!!</li>
            <li> You have to grab a section of hair and hold it while you mark it with the color, so not as spontaneous as more typical hair chalks can be.</li>
            <li> This was fine by me because I wanted a more natural look but look out if you have dark hair  and want a more striking, glamorous look.</li>
            <li> The color is fine - but it will absolutely run onto your pillow and clothes.  </li>
            <li> Easy enough for my 8 year old niece to use by herself, and it looks good in her hair.</li>
            <li> It does not show much on dark hair, but if you use it in combination with the chalks the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> Would recommend for straight, light colored hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my own hair, which is blonde, and it didn&#x27;t leave a trace, yet it lasted until I washed it out.</li>
            <li> These were fun.</li>
            <li> I am old as dirt and still got so many compliments.  </li>
            <li> She is having fun with this.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for just something fun to brighten up my classes.</li>
            <li> I get to have all the fun colors I want with out having to ruin my hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just for fun.</li>
            <li> These turned out to be so much fun</li>
            <li> Sure people stare, they think we&#x27;re too old to have funky colored hair</li>
            <li> I am loving these , They aren&#x27;t only for kids but adults</li>
            <li> so you can see if a lot more clearly.</li>
            <li> I used these for my daughter to have fun, and also with her friends.</li>
            <li> Is fun how they feel with the color in the hair.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool idea.</li>
            <li> did mark her face with a nice blue hue.</li>
            <li> Fun for trying color combinations.</li>
            <li> Bought for a costume party and ended up having a lot of fun with these.</li>
            <li> By far, the crayons are better than sprays.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have had lots of fun with this hair chalk.  </li>
            <li> The color is true, pretty &amp; stays on for a couple days.</li>
            <li> I thought it looked more wild</li>
            <li> They are fun</li>
            <li> Far better than others we have found.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these for my granddaughter just to have fun with.  </li>
            <li> but if you have blond or light brown hair any color will show up super vibrant.</li>
            <li> So I use the silver and if you press this softly, you get a light color from all the rest also!  </li>
            <li> My young daughters love them.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re still having fun.</li>
            <li> She had fun with it.</li>
            <li> Not a chalk at all more like a crayon,  gave them to my 2yr old to use for coloring.  </li>
            <li> Many of the other \\&quot; Highlighting\\&quot; options seemed to b a was of many by the reviews ...</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was that it was somewhat challenging to get an even color along the hair and the color was pretty light.</li>
            <li> and she really is having fun with them!</li>
            <li> The girls loved to play and color each other&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> and it washed right out of hers in one wash.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t get on my bed afterwards and washed right out, so yay.</li>
            <li> it arrived 2 days earlier and its a very cool product!</li>
            <li> Works awesome on my daughters dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Many Aunties remarked on how most of these hair chalks don&#x27;t work on my nieces dark brown/black hair</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use the color is vivid.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves these, it gives her quick color that lasts pretty much all day!</li>
            <li> Young adult rock star was pleased!</li>
            <li> my daughter loves these color last well and washes out easy!</li>
            <li> tomorrow much less look good.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, colors are bright especially blue and green.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be cool as body paint though.&lt;br /&gt;Attaching a picture that shows it decently, but I used the flash on my camera to show that it had shown up at all on my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Knocking off a couple of stars because: it doesn&#x27;t glide on as easily as they make you think it does, but if you hold your hair taut enough or put a piece of paper behind it (for me, the packet for nylon stockings, which is shiny and perfect for this, it works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If anyone does find some good temporary hair color out there for medium &amp; dark haired people, please comment on this and let me know!</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s super easy to be removed by simply washing the hair.</li>
            <li> More similar to crayons.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how they look on light hairs, but they sure did not show on my dark hairs.  </li>
            <li> so when it first goes on, while it&#x27;s a bit tacky, it works with my cut.  </li>
            <li> Comfort: 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;It globs massively.</li>
            <li> I will say they work very well on my golden retriever, and that leads me to believe that it would work well on blond hair.</li>
            <li> It has always washed out of my hair the first time.</li>
            <li> Oh - and the ones I have totally blend. :)</li>
            <li> Wide variety of nice colors and rapid shipping, these allow me to play without the commitment of permanent color.</li>
            <li> I actually think it looks much better if you DO brush through it afterwards.</li>
            <li> so I had to use more that someone with blonde to get the color to pop.</li>
            <li> First, you would have to bleach your hair (which can cause damage).</li>
            <li> (It is possible , just takes more time)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t as pleased with the actual product because unless you have blond hair, it doesn&#x27;t show up well at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter didn&#x27;t like it; stained her t-shirt, and it didn&#x27;t really come out the way she wanted it!</li>
            <li> We used our arm the first day and got color all over ourselves.</li>
            <li> They do last much better</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Probably works better on light color hair, my daughter is a dark blond</li>
            <li> Most of the color came out in one washing, the rest came out after a second washing.  </li>
            <li> I am sure these will last for years assuming they don&#x27;t spoil.  </li>
            <li> The gold is more a yellow.</li>
            <li> but over time say 5 hours, the Color Smash is exactly where I put it</li>
            <li> These work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY!</li>
            <li> It begins to fade after the first night</li>
            <li> they are almost the consistency of a dry lipstick, which makes application very easy.....</li>
            <li> These, on the other hand, were vibrant and bright, even the gold.  </li>
            <li> I will prefer to choose other nice gift</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use heat styling tools (flat iron or curling iron) - I&#x27;m sure that would have helped.  </li>
            <li> I bought these to try different temporary hair colors to see if I liked any for a more permanent color change down the road.  </li>
            <li> I bought these because of the good reviews, however it was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> The subtle colors was very nice though.</li>
            <li> This hair chalk goes on very smooth and easy, you hardly have to press at all.  </li>
            <li> in summary, I LOVE this temporary hair color, it stayed in my dark brown hair for about two days, and it stayed in my daughters strawberry blonde hair for about four days, and it was exactly what we were hoping for so that we looked fantastic on our beach vacation!</li>
            <li> I used the green on dark hair for Paddy&#x27;s day and it showed up great!!!  </li>
            <li> let dry (30 seconds) and go :) You can blend the colors or just have one, each color have a sealer built;t</li>
            <li> Washes out easily, and doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy or gross when in.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be easy to apply, no mess, easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to purchase these as I never really had good luck with temp hair coloring, even with my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> The gold looked yellow, which was fine with me.  </li>
            <li> Good product but not so efficient and sometimes hard to apply to my hair.</li>
            <li> The green and blue are great but the rest of the colors are iffy.</li>
            <li> Bought three of these for my nieces this Christmas - they were a huge hit with everyone present.</li>
            <li> i would like more purple and pink.</li>
            <li> She may not have used much or it was muted because of her hair color.</li>
            <li> Yes, it really does work on brown hair as it claims.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair platinum before so it shows up really well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have a spiky straight cut</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I just bought this about four months ago because I really felt like dying my hair temporarily.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely order this again.</li>
            <li> Also, I read one review that said you can&#x27;t really brush your hair after.</li>
            <li> its very pretty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HELP</li>
            <li> It really couldn&#x27;t be any easier.</li>
            <li> This is crazy awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Very glossy hair look.</li>
            <li> The colors however get on your fingers as you use them and you really got to soap up to wash it off your hands, so that is why I gave them 4 and not 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> It is a fun gift and not too wild.</li>
            <li> but if you put too much in, the hair stays sticky, even after drying, and combing her hair is a battle.  </li>
            <li> My friend also has blonde hair which is not as light as mine though</li>
            <li> I had my doubts but when I applied it to my hair it showed up really well.</li>
            <li> It made my hair stringy and waxy looking, like I had already been sweating before I even went out, it also clumps very easily.&lt;br /&gt;*It rubbed off all over my boyfriend&#x27;s shirt</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work very well with my brown hair.</li>
            <li> They really stand out, which is what I wanted</li>
            <li> The silver doesn&#x27;t show up real well as silver....</li>
            <li> The color goes on really well</li>
            <li> I really like the crayon application sticks</li>
            <li> so I cannot get the light color from the darker color I am using (Or mix the colors as well as with the Hair Chalk above)</li>
            <li> Our girls had to put so much on to get get the colors to show up.</li>
            <li> Very oily and greasy.</li>
            <li> Calling it chalk is very deceiving.</li>
            <li> that was much easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> Its very prettty</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my 7-yr-old daughter, who really wanted to color her hair.</li>
            <li> and they really don&#x27;t show at all.  </li>
            <li> My daughter really loves this product.</li>
            <li> The colour does not show up as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really show up if you have darker hair.  </li>
            <li> Then you would have to apply hair dye, and I&#x27;ve heard that colorful dyes fade fast anyway, so you would have to do this frequently.</li>
            <li> a bit different than i expected, but good</li>
            <li> They made a mess everywhere, but cleanup was quick and easy and a shower took care of all the color.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair &amp; even though other reviewers had said it showed up beautifully, I wasn&#x27;t convinced.  </li>
            <li> She is only six, but I&#x27;d have fun with these too!  </li>
            <li> Such fun stuff!  </li>
            <li> Colors so rich and vibrant that they even show up on my very dark hair and look fantastic on my blond daughter.</li>
            <li> They both have somewhat dark hair and the colors were noticeable enough but not stand out bright on their hair.</li>
            <li> With Color Smash I can leave it on for 3 days and it really stays  vibrant.  </li>
            <li> only good on black hair</li>
            <li> The purple, pink, blue, and green worked best on my hair since I have Carmel colored hair.</li>
            <li> Barely showed up in my niece&#x27;s strawberry hair, but it was fun nonetheless.</li>
            <li> so the Blue, Green and Pink work best</li>
            <li> I would say the full effect of the color lasts only on the day you apply it.  </li>
            <li> Kids love them wife likes less of use and cleaning</li>
            <li> These markers work better than the hair chalk I have used previously.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried a lot of them, and the color in these is vibrant and even.</li>
            <li> They show up super well on my daughter&#x27;s blonde well - not as well on my (reddish brown) hair or her friends&#x27; darker hair.</li>
            <li> We had much more success with coloring and pulling it back, rather then let it stay down.</li>
            <li> My favorite colors are red and pink (I have light blonde hair).  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s damaging, I think after bleaching it and getting it white, i may just start using this set to get my hair pretty colors !</li>
            <li> Happily surprised when I noticed that it did work!!</li>
            <li> All the other sites, had customers complaining that it rubbed off the hair so easily, it ruined whatever costume or clothing they were wearing.  </li>
            <li> BUT they are really hard to put onto your own hair, unless it is braided.</li>
            <li> I kept applying more and more of it to try to make it show up, and it made a sticky, stiff mess of my hair, and that was all.</li>
            <li> I have light blond hair and the pink</li>
            <li> Meh, color is not intense on light brown hair and comes off a bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My little girl is very excited to have it for her hair.</li>
            <li> im happy about my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;it is faint though.</li>
            <li> they say 80 strokes per applicator i think more like 30 for long hair or a larger area</li>
            <li> The green is more like teal but</li>
            <li> They wash out with a normal hair washing.</li>
            <li> You will waste some on coloring on the cardboard, but more color will be pressed into your hair that way.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> After an hour or more, then brush the hair very firmly a few times, and you should be all</li>
            <li> My wife is having fun with these different colors.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I wanted to have temporary fun colors in my hair... and it worked, but it made my hair all gross feeling.</li>
            <li> Fades the second and third day, but easy to recolor.  </li>
            <li> You still can&#x27;t expect yellow, for example, to show up on black hair, but blues, greens, reds all turn out nicely.</li>
            <li> Do the color a little bit in advance of when you want it to look good, itâs a little crusy and flaky for the first couple hours as it dries and sets</li>
            <li> These are NOT SMALL like one of the people mentioned , in fact there huge a little bigger then a average Lipstick , There not like chalk at all more like lipstick, I have dark/medium brown hair and there all actually very visible , pink takes the most streaks to apply</li>
            <li> As soon as she brushed her hair all the color came right out.</li>
            <li> and it washes right out with the next shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are like crayons or very soft pencil eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no mess on your clothes, but you do want to use an older wash cloth when washing your face.  </li>
            <li> actually took a few washes to come out all the way, but that was kind of an unexpected bonus for me.</li>
            <li> No messy hands or &#x27;chalk&#x27; dust on your cloths!</li>
            <li> and they last pretty well</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The number one Christmas gift for my 12 yr old daughter-she loves it!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;chalk&amp;#34; is ok, but I&#x27;ve had some in the past (can&#x27;t remember the brand)</li>
            <li> Anything from a wide swath of one colour to a few strands of colour here and there to full on rainbow is easily achieved.</li>
            <li> The chalk applies smoothly and evenly without mess, but looks faded and light unless you apply a lot of pressure and run the chalk up and down the strand of hair.  </li>
            <li> Messy but washes out easily.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and not at all messy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**I have received this product in exchange for testing as well as giving  my personal thoughts and opinions , All stated above is true or my thoughts.</li>
            <li> I have a blonde and a dark haired daughter and they both love it!&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li> the markers may not show up well under regular indoor lighting, but they can really pop in the sunlight and brighter than normal lighting.</li>
            <li> The colors are strong, it&#x27;s not powdery and messy.</li>
            <li> The hair is a little clumped at first but after a bit, you can comb the strands apart and they separate to blend right in.  </li>
            <li> It works okay on some of the lighter strands but still not very bright.  </li>
            <li> The hair color crayons make the hair very stiff so make sure to apply in the direction you want the hair to go as once you put it on, the hair stays the way you apply.  </li>
            <li> So easily, actually that I&#x27;m sure if you got caught in the rain you&#x27;d have a mess on your hands.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice hard to get color to show on dark hair</li>
            <li> They were not dried out like some i have gotten</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 16 year old niece as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> so my 5 year old doesn&#x27;t have chalk all over his hands when he gets home from school.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer old and gray.  </li>
            <li> I tried it the day I got it and was instantly amazed of how real it looked in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is a soft silver</li>
            <li> but sometimes I want to show my wild side.</li>
            <li> My 10 yr old daughter has been asking for over a year to dye her hair....</li>
            <li> Goes in fast and last!</li>
            <li> These pens have become a must have in my beauty supply, and I use them frequently.</li>
            <li> I got it for my 8yr old daughter &amp; 5yr old niece.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for my 10 and 7 year old daughters.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third: you can probably seek a few gunk bits that aren&#x27;t that smooth, Take a hair brush and Brush everywhere</li>
            <li> No messy chalkiness to deal with.</li>
            <li> I have not tried sealing the color in with hairspray to see how much longer they can last.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter loves to wear this product</li>
            <li> and it not messy at all.</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin, you might want to reconsider.</li>
            <li> I think an adult would have no trouble washing it out.</li>
            <li> For the first few minutes, the color showed up pretty well.</li>
            <li> Nice idea, poor results.</li>
            <li> Tried a couple other colors and they all are pretty vibrant.</li>
            <li> Use a comb right after you put the color in, these markers WILL tangle your hair a little bit as you put it in, even with the above cardboard trick, but if you comb it out right away that helps A LOT.</li>
            <li> The silver was less bright on her dark blonde hair, but that&#x27;s just because of the combination of colors.  </li>
            <li> Unlike many other hair chalks these come in a tube like a lip balm and your hair doesn&#x27;t need to be wet for these to work,&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no mess and nothing to do to seal it.  </li>
            <li> I was happily proven wrong, it shows up really well on dark hair.  </li>
            <li> The darker colors show up pretty well on my hair (light auburn) but only the green really shows up on my daughter (dark auburn) plus it will come off on your hands and clothes if you touch your hair and rub up against something.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and they last in the hair.  </li>
            <li> They go on pretty easy with little mess and wash off hands without soap.</li>
            <li> These look like LARGE soft crayons, not small like other reviewer said.  </li>
            <li> The affect is not that bold but you an see it a little.  </li>
            <li> It lets her have a little harmless creativity with her appearance and her school luckily allows it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO PROBLEMS with customer service - fast and complete.  </li>
            <li> We bought Splat hair chalk at the store for my daughter, and applying it was a mess, her entire back and top of her clothing was chalky and blue, and the colors looked faded.  </li>
            <li> She is growing out her hair (from pixie cut to long) and, since her hair is too short to pull back, these create a fun doo for her in the interim.  </li>
            <li> Very temporary - meaning after a lot of work to get color to show, it&#x27;s out within less than a hour of normal activity.</li>
            <li> I think my hair (dark blonde) is a little too dark for these to be very effective with</li>
            <li> Just one thing, it doesnt last long like the chalk is really smallð</li>
            <li> my daughter has dark brown hair and you can really see it in her hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old with purple and blue hair (today).</li>
            <li> but it barely shows on medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s definite fading by morning, but I haven&#x27;t seen stains in pillow cases or clothing so far.</li>
            <li> They look barely used</li>
            <li> Barely visible.</li>
            <li> I completely colored the braid and also did a yellow and silver strikes.</li>
            <li> The product completely washes out with 1 regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> All the other colors show up really well.</li>
            <li> The other colors really pop and show up well.</li>
            <li> The only mess was on my hands while I was coloring my daughters hair, which washed right off.</li>
            <li> I bought these four year old for her birthday and soon everyone at the party including the adults had blue and red highlights.</li>
            <li> It does not really dry, so it can rub off onto the clothing they wear.  </li>
            <li> Some of them do not show up in dark hair very well.</li>
            <li> Takes a lot of highlighting to get it to appear on dark hair, and with curly hair, the chalk makes your curls straight.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that I brought it to a music festival where it got really hot during the day, and they got all melty &amp; made a mess.</li>
            <li> You really have to continue to draw up and down repeatedly to get the color deeper.  </li>
            <li> The color leaves your hair feeling slightly like you sprayed it with hairspray, but I don&#x27;t really find that to be a problem.</li>
            <li> Works very well on black hair- but use a lot.</li>
            <li> Sure they are a bit messy while applying, but nowhere near as messy as one other brand I tried which was shaped like 1/2 of a golf ball.  </li>
            <li> You can switch up your look by using different colors, and it takes less than 5 minutes to apply (depending on how much of your hair you want to color).</li>
            <li> The colors are beautifully vibrant and show up, even on dark hair.</li>
            <li> They are vibrant, even on my friend&#x27;s dark hair.</li>
            <li> These are a little more expensive then the other chalk hair colors, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> of kids- 6-10, but have the older girls do the little ones hair or else</li>
            <li> Yellow and silver got lost, but the pink, blue, purple and green were very vibrant.</li>
            <li> She liked that it didn&#x27;t completely wash out, but I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how large sections of hair would come out with these.</li>
            <li> They seem to go a long way as they get a lot f use at our house and there&#x27;s still plenty left.</li>
            <li> and it takes a LONG time to color streaks, especially because my hair is long</li>
            <li> My girls use plain old artist oil pastels for larger portions of hair.</li>
            <li> but this works - not very vivid though</li>
            <li> Oh, just need an excuse....</li>
            <li> since I&#x27;ve worn eyeglasses since 1963, that hasn&#x27;t happened in a long, long time.</li>
            <li> the next time you want pink stripes and glitter in your hair ...</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the directions and apply it like it is suppose to be, you should have not problems.</li>
            <li> The silver looks like you are trying to give yourself grey hair for a school play, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  </li>
            <li> They are ONE INCH long and 1/4 inch thickness.</li>
            <li> as long as you wait 30 seconds for it to try, your hair won&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li> Later in the day they were running around at the park and since they were sweating the colors started running down their faces which they looked like a cross between Shek and a Smurf!</li>
            <li> It does come off a little on your fingers so I would stay away from white for at least the first two days of this being in your hair.</li>
            <li> A little messy and doesn&#x27;t really show in darker hair.</li>
            <li> Because of this it&#x27;s rather hard to comb through even with a wide tooth comb, and the streaks look very...</li>
            <li> You just apply the color onto your dry hair and within 30 seconds the color seals itself.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t rub off it allowed to &#x27;dry&#x27; for an hour or 2.</li>
            <li> My son has medium brown hair and the blue and green show up well in his (that&#x27;s the only two colors he&#x27;s cared to try).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of purple, green, and blue hair</li>
            <li> You need to wet the strand you want to color, once your strands of hair are wet take the chalk color you want and rub it back and forth over the strand to get the amount of color you want.  </li>
            <li> She used green and blue and it all washed out in the next wash.</li>
            <li> Does color even on dark hair but be prepared to rub the hair strand for 10 minutes to get enough color to stand out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommended for dark hair only for blond</li>
            <li> The white you see is the silver color, on dark hairs</li>
            <li> They are metallic colors and they do have glitter but on dark hair they show like regular colors, I noticed the diference when I applied them on my skin.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well but not great</li>
            <li> The only down side is that the colors stain the tub when being washed out and that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give a five star rating.</li>
            <li> Small size, but the color is vibrant and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My friend had black hair and only the glitter showed.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and treat the ends with blue dye.  </li>
            <li> For those times I want to look less haggard in public, I grab one of these pens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not great for dark hair but still fun.</li>
            <li> makes my hair very dry and sticky,...</li>
            <li> NOT true, they&#x27;re big.</li>
            <li> there will be a big mess.</li>
            <li> I spent $75 at the beauty salon to get my roots touched up and purple highlights put in only to have the highlights wash out in less than 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> only played with these a little bit.</li>
            <li> I actually bought the little chalk squares and they don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> A little fun, but not great.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I would say is that a trace of the color has lingered on my blonde hair for a couple of weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I had a light faint green tint.</li>
            <li> She has brown hair and the colors were not as bight as I expected.</li>
            <li> CAREFUL-</li>
            <li> Remains sticky and never really dries on.</li>
            <li> I figured it was expected.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work as well, The pink was noticeable but the colors had to be built up for you to see.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this product BEFORE I spent $75.</li>
            <li> They last on hair for a few days.</li>
            <li> but it looked messy when done and needed to be brushed.</li>
            <li> Was one of the only products I could find that had the color she needed, green.</li>
            <li> I like pink</li>
            <li> That one was horrible because you didn&#x27;t have much control when applying, it just kind of went everywhere, then the whole piece just broke rendering it useless.  </li>
            <li> , probably should have expected this</li>
            <li> My daughter was begging for pink hair</li>
            <li> If your hair gets wet the color will start to run.</li>
            <li> The thin pieced of cardboard trick really helped in applying them.</li>
            <li> The only down side is I have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> so thats a plus, and it rinsed out with just plain old water, not even using shampoo or conditioner, just a few hours after putting it</li>
            <li> : if you want a really small area chalked, it&#x27;s a bit harder to get vivid color without getting your fingers messy.</li>
            <li> The gold &amp; silver are a little flat looking on my brunette daughter.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other hair chalk, you don&#x27;t have to wet strands of your hair before applying or spray your hair with hairspray afterwards.</li>
            <li> So, if someone else can do it for you, and you have hair long enough to lay on a hard surface, it will work for you.</li>
            <li> Put it in dry hair then comb before it dries, otherwise it will be hard later.</li>
            <li> I used the pink and still have a slight pink hue in parts.</li>
            <li> I have done other brands</li>
            <li> Unlike the other products where it spread in clothing you wore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably try some of their other colors.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t rub off as easily as other chalks.</li>
            <li> That means it&#x27;s going to come off under other circumstance too, so plan accordingly.</li>
            <li> She likes to do the ends in a different color everyday!</li>
            <li> Be careful if you have dark hair and/or curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and as my fellow cosmos know we get bored w our hair fast!</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews before I purchased and I agree . . .</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only problem was a small residue stain on the pillow, but came out after washing it.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> The purple and silver are a little light on my daughters dirty blond, but showed up well on her friends brown hair.</li>
            <li> The pink, gold, and silver tinted it a little, but not much.</li>
            <li> I have used hair chalk in the past but it was super dusty and messy</li>
            <li> is very pink.</li>
            <li> For me, these came with 2 blue markers (missing a green).</li>
            <li> Which was a down fall to the other products...</li>
            <li> But kinda ruins my hair when its chalked, stains my shirts, and since I have blonde hair, it also slightly stained my hair for approximately 2 weeks even with daily shower</li>
            <li> The only hard part is application.</li>
            <li> They work well on dark hair.</li>
            <li> Does not work on dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I have really dark brown hair</li>
            <li> It even changes dark hair.</li>
            <li> : 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all to me, returned...</li>
            <li> Though they were not that visible on my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it on brown hair but have used it with dark blond hair.</li>
            <li> My kids have dark hair and you could see the colors.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair and It showed up on the dark brown and the blond.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has dark brown hair at it worked.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and</li>
            <li> Does not work on dark brown/black hair.</li>
            <li> but my children have dark hair.</li>
            <li> and i have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> I have dark hair, and hair chalks never work for me.</li>
            <li> Shows up well on dark hair.</li>
            <li> I would note however IF YOU HAVE DARK HAIR</li>
            <li> Does not show up on dark hair at all.  </li>
            <li> My oldest daughter has dark brown hair and these colors did not show up at all in her hair.</li>
            <li> The downside is that if your kids lay down any where the color transfers.</li>
            <li> She layer her head down on the table</li>
            <li> There is a very slight sparkle to them when applied, but its not really sparkly looking once on.</li>
            <li> the only thing is it&#x27;s a little hard to draw on my hair... takes time...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other brands.  </li>
            <li> Tried a few other types that sucked.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work on black hair.  </li>
            <li> Does not work well in brown or black hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has black hair and it did not work at all.  </li>
            <li> However, I tried it on my friends black hair</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you have brown or black hair - it will not work.</li>
            <li> color does does not show up on black hair.</li>
            <li> We went swimming the day that we did the application, and after an hour and a half in the pool, there was still some visible.  </li>
            <li> it was gone out of the hair in less than 12 hours</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not extremely bold.</li>
            <li> This color will come off and mess up with your clothing.</li>
            <li> The color does rub off on your fingers if you mess with your hair.</li>
            <li> What a sticky mess in the hair...</li>
            <li> Bought for Halloween, worked well, not sure if I would wear it out on a regular night, it made my hair waxy &amp; dull &amp; my curly hair was limp and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> I want to add a little attitude or spunk.  </li>
            <li> but is a little spendy.</li>
            <li> Wearing for a wedding to add a little glitz</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair</li>
            <li> But seriously, who would not wash for that long!</li>
            <li> (I wash it everyday) and is going on 3 days in my daughter&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The colors were leaving chunky residues with uneven color tones on the hair strands.</li>
            <li> Plus the chalk pens were messy and got all over your fingers.</li>
            <li> You have to hairspray over it to get it to stay for a few days.</li>
            <li> I was not as messy as I thought it was going to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pros: lasts a few days between washings.</li>
            <li> It says stays in for a few days but you have to wash it out before going to bed or it will get on your pillow and sheets.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy.  </li>
            <li> And lifting color is harsh.</li>
            <li> Especially green and blue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be coloring my hair green &amp; blue for the Seahawks game on Sunday.  </li>
            <li> Was a mess!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, hard to put into your hair.</li>
            <li> I would note that the &#x27;metallic glitter&#x27; part is...not so much, at least on dark hair.</li>
            <li> You can hold your hair really really taut and use a lot of pressure to make the color come through, but even then it&#x27;s very faint.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and can&#x27;t see the color regardless how much I apply on :(</li>
            <li> the color was somewhat subtle on her dark brown hair but</li>
            <li> I am not sure which.</li>
            <li> I just picked a small section of my hair and ran the marker across the hair.</li>
            <li> Seller immediately sent a green marker to me, no complaints there!  </li>
            <li> I searched for a few weeks on Amazon until I found this!</li>
            <li> (it goes past my bra line).</li>
            <li> Not sure I like having the gold and silver as they don&#x27;t show up as well.</li>
            <li> Stick to small portions at a time.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it is lingering in mine.  </li>
            <li> The chalk is small but you don&#x27;t have to use a how lot of it to get the color to go on your hair.</li>
            <li> I asked if they were smudgy or gross or weird or if they got on everything.  </li>
            <li> The crayon like application makes doing larger sections difficult.</li>
            <li> It usually fades after about 2 days if she doesn&#x27;t wash her hair.</li>
            <li> I would NOT have wasted the time OR the money!</li>
            <li> There is no shimmer to these either, I&#x27;m not sure how it can advertise that it is metallic.  </li>
            <li> since I have a dark long hair, the colors is so feeble!.  </li>
            <li> smudges of a faint green were left behind.</li>
            <li> Very messy and hard to use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on your hair &amp; is hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair hard to style.</li>
            <li> These pens are called chalk but have the consistency of a hard chapstick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my haie feel, hard to comb out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is greasy like a crayon, hard to apply, makes the hair greasy and matted, and gets on clothes / face.</li>
            <li> Does not make your hair hard and crusty like the sprays (when used correctly).</li>
            <li> You need a hard surface to place the hair on, it&#x27;s like trying to color your hair with a crayon.  </li>
            <li> My hair is gray now, I&#x27;m tired of dyeing it every month, yet I wanted to add a little pizzazz to it.  </li>
            <li> but at least they work.</li>
            <li> Not incredibly impressive on our dark hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sad to say this is absolutely not worth the money, given that I&#x27;m now off to find something that will take it out of my boyfriend&#x27;s clothes, which is adding to the over all cost of this experience.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have mostly dark hair</li>
            <li> subtle color, no stickiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found them a little difficult to get them to stand out.</li>
            <li> I hate this stuff, and so does my 7 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> it is a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> hair has just turned gray in the last few years and sooooo boring.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the hair chalk.</li>
            <li> (Since I have used pastels before, they always seem to get under my long nails, and it get&#x27;s annoying after a while.)</li>
            <li> She likes the colors, but they are difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Coloring ends is difficult.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but got it because of the reviews</li>
            <li> And for the blondes, it is difficult to put on.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dyed purple or blue intermittently, but I have to admit I&#x27;m terrible at maintaining it.</li>
            <li> Expensive crayons.</li>
            <li> However, because these are hair chalk markers they are very thin</li>
            <li> Always wanted to have colored hair, but I don&#x27;t like to have to commit to a single color, and deal with nasty chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for &#x27;crazy hair day&#x27; at school for my kids.</li>
            <li> works but kinda awkward to use.</li>
            <li> And hair got sticky and almost impossible to comb.</li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well on my hair. :(</li>
            <li> The section of hair you color sticks together, and I found it highly annoying.</li>
            <li> I hate to say it</li>
            <li> Worst thing, I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>

            <li> My daughter loves these!! They are so easy to use and wash off! my daughter has dark brown hair and you can really see it in her hair!</li>
            <li> I bought these for &#x27;crazy hair day&#x27; at school for my kids. They both have somewhat dark hair and the colors were noticeable enough but not stand out bright on their hair. The crayons had to be applied over a few times for the color to take and it had a very waxy feeling. Later in the day they were running around at the park and since they were sweating the colors started running down their faces which they looked like a cross between Shek and a Smurf! It washed away easily with soap and water and worked for the day that we needed them for but I don&#x27;t think I would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> These colors go on easily and show up very well.</li>
            <li> These are great. They work well on dark hair. I also love how much easier it is to put on then sprays or chalk. I received so many compliments. I will definitely reorder these</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work on black hair.  I kept applying more and more of it to try to make it show up, and it made a sticky, stiff mess of my hair, and that was all.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and can&#x27;t see the color regardless how much I apply on :(</li>
            <li> love the product.  i would like more purple and pink.</li>
            <li> These are fun for kids and/or Halloween and are only temporary which is great.  The only issue I had was that it was somewhat challenging to get an even color along the hair and the color was pretty light.</li>
            <li> These work great! They were not dried out like some i have gotten and they go on and wash out well.</li>
            <li> These freaking ROCK!!!! my daughter is going to LOVE them for Christmas!!!!! :D</li>
            <li> My daughters love to use these, they are 10 and 12. They wash out very easily also.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well but not great</li>
            <li> Does not work on dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t  know what&#x27;s in these (lead?) but my daughter got some on her hands, then touched her face and broke out in an allergic reaction!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 16 year old niece as a Christmas gift. She loves them.  She has brown hair and the colors were not as bight as I expected. She may not have used much or it was muted because of her hair color. I am not sure which. The subtle colors was very nice though.</li>
            <li> Not incredibly impressive on our dark hair. I think it&#x27;d look really cool on bleached hair, but if I was going to bleach my hair, I&#x27;d dye it the cool color, not use hair chalk. It does seem to be cool as body paint though.&lt;br /&gt;Attaching a picture that shows it decently, but I used the flash on my camera to show that it had shown up at all on my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this! It goes on easy and shows up great in light or dark hair. It washes out easily with shampoo and we have had no problems with staining any fabrics.</li>
            <li> As advertised. My grand daughter has loved using it on her hair</li>
            <li> Yes, it really does work on brown hair as it claims. My daughter LOVES it!  It&#x27;s like a crayon, and you need to blend with finger tips or brush, but it ends up looking amazing.  Washes out easily.  I tried it on my own hair, which is blonde, and it didn&#x27;t leave a trace, yet it lasted until I washed it out.</li>
            <li> this is not a chalk, this has more of a lipstick consistency. The darker colors show up pretty well on my hair (light auburn) but only the green really shows up on my daughter (dark auburn) plus it will come off on your hands and clothes if you touch your hair and rub up against something. Were going to try using a sealing spray over it and see if that works.</li>
            <li> These look like LARGE soft crayons, not small like other reviewer said.  I just picked a small section of my hair and ran the marker across the hair. Then I tried just drawing it on. THEN I read the instructions. Ran a brush thru it, and it blended, appeared less brilliant, but still there. Will try following instructions next time.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has just turned gray in the last few years and sooooo boring. These were fun. Got some on my fingers, but just washed it off. A good way to experiment with colors and then shampoo completely out. Perfect for Halloween or party time. Oh, just need an excuse.... Margaritas and blue streaks.</li>
            <li> This hair chalk goes on very smooth and easy, you hardly have to press at all.  I would say it is more like an oil crayon vs. chalk.  The hair is a little clumped at first but after a bit, you can comb the strands apart and they separate to blend right in.  The color lasted all day in my hair (I wash it everyday) and is going on 3 days in my daughter&#x27;s.  There is no mess and nothing to do to seal it.  I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my four year old and they don&#x27;t work all that great on her hair.  She likes the colors, but they are difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> This item is a gift for my granddaughter so I haven&#x27;t been able to try it out yet, It arrived as described, and in great condition, and I can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
            <li> Looks very cool on my niece. Very easy to apply and wash off. We did not have issues with staining clothes.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and she loves the colors and uses them every day. Small size, but the color is vibrant and a little goes a long way. The colors look nice and not dusty like the chalk brands. The only down side is that the colors stain the tub when being washed out and that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give a five star rating.</li>
            <li> Contains an acid that is toxic per a brief Google search. Returning.</li>
            <li> I wanted hair chalk for pride. Ordered these. They are amazing. Never used hair chalk before. More similar to crayons. It was super easy to color my hair. I did this myself. I dyed my hair platinum before so it shows up really well. My friend had black hair and only the glitter showed. I haven&#x27;t tried them on brown hair but if you&#x27;re light brown to blonde I greatly suggest them! They lasted all day/night until I went put dancing and sweated most of it away. DRENCHED sweated. And it&#x27;s easily washed out with shampoo but didn&#x27;t really come off on my hands til I started pouring sweat. Get them!</li>
            <li> I did not try these colors on light hairs so I don&#x27;t know how they look on light hairs, but they sure did not show on my dark hairs.  The colors were leaving chunky residues with uneven color tones on the hair strands.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for a kid but not so happy with them... some colors didnÂ´t paint good in the hair... I will prefer to choose other nice gift</li>
            <li> These are amazing........they are almost the consistency of a dry lipstick, which makes application very easy.....they DO show up on darker hair, but look amazing on blondes!!!!  CAREFUL- the color can transfer, as my daughter laid her head on the car&#x27;s seat and it did!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works awesome on my daughters dark blonde hair. Stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t rub off. This is our favorite brand. We&#x27;ve tried a lot of them, and the color in these is vibrant and even.</li>
            <li> Worst thing, I&#x27;ve ever bought. Won&#x27;t work on my hair. It makes my hair stickyâ¦</li>
            <li> Great worked well. Was a gift and she really is having fun with them!</li>
            <li> My daughter enjoyed these!</li>
            <li> easy to get on the hair.  My daughter has blonde hair and they show up bright on her. My son has medium brown hair and the blue and green show up well in his (that&#x27;s the only two colors he&#x27;s cared to try).  I have really dark brown hair and I tried only the purple and blue colors. The blue to me showed up great, but the purple wasn&#x27;t even noticeable. I attached a picture of the blue so you can see for yourself.</li>
            <li> they say 80 strokes per applicator i think more like 30 for long hair or a larger area but it works well on all hair types</li>
            <li> Bought for Halloween, worked well, not sure if I would wear it out on a regular night, it made my hair waxy &amp; dull &amp; my curly hair was limp and lifeless.  I don&#x27;t use heat styling tools (flat iron or curling iron) - I&#x27;m sure that would have helped.  It stayed in throughout the night &amp; I had no problems with the color coming out when I washed it.  (It was more like a crayon than chalk.)</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughters and they love it. It washes away easily.</li>
            <li> I love it it works perfectly</li>
            <li> I used the green on dark hair for Paddy&#x27;s day and it showed up great!!!  Tried a couple other colors and they all are pretty vibrant.</li>
            <li> My kids love this stuff. It even changes dark hair. The downside is that if your kids lay down any where the color transfers.</li>
            <li> For me, these came with 2 blue markers (missing a green). Seller immediately sent a green marker to me, no complaints there!  I think my hair (dark blonde) is a little too dark for these to be very effective with and I wonder if chalk would&#x27;ve stood out better. I&#x27;ve found them a little difficult to get them to stand out.</li>
            <li> FUN, FUN, FUN! Colors so rich and vibrant that they even show up on my very dark hair and look fantastic on my blond daughter.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a gift and she put it on right away and LOVED it - bright colors.</li>
            <li> Does not work well in brown or black hair.  Bought for my 9 year olds slumber pa r th and it only worked on the blondes.</li>
            <li> Goes on okay, but feels like lipstick in your hair. Remains sticky and never really dries on. I have light blond hair and the pink actually took a few washes to come out all the way, but that was kind of an unexpected bonus for me. I liked it better after I washed it--subtle color, no stickiness.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I have done other brands but this is super easy and fun. I am old as dirt and still got so many compliments.  I want more colors!  It goes on easy and dries fast.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Fantastic coloring, self-sealing so my 5 year old doesn&#x27;t have chalk all over his hands when he gets home from school. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I got these - I think I got the nonmetallic set with more primary colors - but still really like them.  I have white / gray hair and they are great for those days I want to add a little attitude or spunk.  I have a spiky straight cut so when it first goes on, while it&#x27;s a bit tacky, it works with my cut.  After 30 minutes I can brush it and the color stays.  Have yet to find any on my pillowcase.  Fades the second and third day, but easy to recolor.  Not had any issues with staining.</li>
            <li> I really love it, very pigmented! Can&#x27;t wait to try the rainbow version</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use the color is vivid.  I&#x27;m no longer old and gray.  I&#x27;m old with purple and blue hair (today). There&#x27;s no mess on your clothes, but you do want to use an older wash cloth when washing your face.  I like seeing people look at my face and, since I&#x27;ve worn eyeglasses since 1963, that hasn&#x27;t happened in a long, long time.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I would hoping for.  My daughter has black hair and it did not work at all.  Plus the chalk pens were messy and got all over your fingers.</li>
            <li> Purchased for granddaughter for Christmas.  It arrived in time for Christmas which was a miracle considering when I ordered.  She is having fun with this. THANKS</li>
            <li> makes my hair very dry and sticky,...</li>
            <li> I just bought this about four months ago because I really felt like dying my hair temporarily. I searched for a few weeks on Amazon until I found this! It said that it washes out whenever in the shower. So I thought I would give it a go. I tried it the day I got it and was instantly amazed of how real it looked in my hair. I love how you can hold it in your hand like a pen. (Since I have used pastels before, they always seem to get under my long nails, and it get&#x27;s annoying after a while.) The purple, pink, blue, and green worked best on my hair since I have Carmel colored hair. The gold, and silver Barley showed up. Over all I think this was a great product and whence I run out of it... I am definitely buying it again:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~CM</li>
            <li> This is the best hair chalk that I have discovered. Very easy to apply since it has the sealer already in it. Rinses off with shampoo and water. It does not bleed onto clothing and it can last 3-4 days if you do not wash your hair! But seriously, who would not wash for that long!</li>
            <li> My hair is a soft silver and I love it but sometimes I want to show my wild side. These chalk pens are perfect! Easy to use, no mess, easy to wash out. Anything from a wide swath of one colour to a few strands of colour here and there to full on rainbow is easily achieved.</li>
            <li> This color will come off and mess up with your clothing. I do not recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great product! Exceeded my expectations. Unlike the other products where it spread in clothing you wore. The colors combine so evenly. Definitely top of my list of must haves</li>
            <li> Comfort: 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;It globs massively. The section of hair you color sticks together, and I found it highly annoying. I guess you could get used to it. I just couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Brightness: 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair. These markers have sparkles in them. For the first few minutes, the color showed up pretty well. Then it started fading. To get it to show, you have to put a LOT of color on, and that uses up a lot of marker.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 3 1/2 stars&lt;br /&gt;These could work for a party or something, but I am going to try hair extentions. These would not work long-term. I will say they work very well on my golden retriever, and that leads me to believe that it would work well on blond hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair chalk ever. I have very blonde hair and it is great on my hair. The colors are strong, it&#x27;s not powdery and messy. It gets on your hands and brush, but washes off easily with soap and water. It has always washed out of my hair the first time. I even went to bed with it in once and could detect no trace of it on my pillowcase the next morning. I&#x27;ve recommended this to friends and would buy again - but there&#x27;s plenty which will probably last me a while. I&#x27;ll probably try some of their other colors. Oh - and the ones I have totally blend. :)</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work as well as I was hoping. It goes on kind of pasty and is crunchy after it dries. Some of the colors do not show up well, but that could just be the blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Put it in dry hair then comb before it dries, otherwise it will be hard later. The green showed up the best but I think it&#x27;s just because I put more in, I have strawberry hair.</li>
            <li> This was one of my daughters Christmas presents, and now she has different hair color every day. This stuff is very easy to apply and washes out very well.</li>
            <li> Bought for a birthday party and I was concerned about chemicals and if I would be able to get rid of the color easily.  Turns out it doesn&#x27;t have a smell, and washes away VERY easily.  The girls loved to play and color each other&#x27;s hair.  They made a mess everywhere, but cleanup was quick and easy and a shower took care of all the color.  Nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece so we could do our hair for a Taylor Swift concert and the product is amazing.  It gives bright, bold color and shows up even on my medium brown hair.  I would absolutely order this again.</li>
            <li> My 10 yr old daughter has been asking for over a year to dye her hair.... When I found this as an alternative it was very exciting... Many of the other \\&quot; Highlighting\\&quot; options seemed to b a was of many by the reviews ... This product shows up in brown hair... Which was a down fall to the other products... It is very easy to use , lasts more than a day, no clean up and is easily washable !!! I give this product a big pat on the back!!!!</li>
            <li> My 9 y/o daughter loves this.  Messy but washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Wide variety of nice colors and rapid shipping, these allow me to play without the commitment of permanent color. Recommend!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used these Chalkers with our daughters hair.  She is growing out her hair (from pixie cut to long) and, since her hair is too short to pull back, these create a fun doo for her in the interim.  She is only six, but I&#x27;d have fun with these too!  Good for all ages!</li>
            <li> I had searched online for this item with varying prices. The difference that spurred me to but this set was the reviews.  All the other sites, had customers complaining that it rubbed off the hair so easily, it ruined whatever costume or clothing they were wearing.  Some even said it fell off the hair so quickly they had to take a quick picture to show their friends.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter says this works great and doe not come off on to my grand daughters clothing..She says it HAS to be washed out!  Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;So the next time you want pink stripes and glitter in your hair ...BUY THIS ONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery and perfect gift!</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff. Stays in all day and stays bright all day but washes out quickly and easilly. Also, I read one review that said you can&#x27;t really brush your hair after. I actually think it looks much better if you DO brush through it afterwards. I just wish there was a solid red color as the only reddish one is very pink. But love them all the same :)</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the chalk glitter.  My granddaughter thought it was great and her friends orderd it also.</li>
            <li> I just became zumba instructor and I was looking for just something fun to brighten up my classes. I thought about dying my hair but I didn&#x27;t want to bleach it. These provide the perfect solution. I get to have all the fun colors I want with out having to ruin my hair. I am also receiving so many compliments and not just in my Zumba class :). I have left the color on when I went to bed and none came off on the pillow. The only down side is I have dark brown hair so I had to use more that someone with blonde to get the color to pop.</li>
            <li> Best gift for 13 year old granddaughter to experiment with, she loves it. Thank goodness it washes out quickly and it&#x27;s just for fun.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this product 2 stars is because the color really is beautiful. Very bright and vibrant, and blends very well. However, because these are hair chalk markers they are very thin and it takes a LONG time to color streaks, especially because my hair is long (it goes past my bra line). It also leaves a very gross residue, almost like you have wax in your hair, even after it dries. Because of this it&#x27;s rather hard to comb through even with a wide tooth comb, and the streaks look very... well.. streaky! and not blended out well through the hair. Not worth the money at all to me, returned...</li>
            <li> Very temporary - meaning after a lot of work to get color to show, it&#x27;s out within less than a hour of normal activity.</li>
            <li> These were pretty easy and fun to use. Though they were not that visible on my dark brown hair. This was fine by me because I wanted a more natural look but look out if you have dark hair  and want a more striking, glamorous look. It was easy to remove too, much cleaner than the spray dyes in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought these to try different temporary hair colors to see if I liked any for a more permanent color change down the road.  These turned out to be so much fun I&#x27;ve been passing them around to friends and we&#x27;ve all been playing with them!  We&#x27;ve had a blast \\&quot;decorating\\&quot; each others&#x27; hair and going into town.  Sure people stare, they think we&#x27;re too old to have funky colored hair but we just don&#x27;t care!  ( BTW I graduated from these to semi-permanent purple and magenta hair.  I absolutely LOVE IT!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are an excellent way to dip your toe into some fun hair colors and they truly are self-sealing.  No need to use hairspray or another sealer to keep the color in.  You can put them on lightly for a pastel effect, or use more pressure on a clump of hair for a vibrant effect, it&#x27;s up to you.  These lasted three days on a friend&#x27;s hair, without washing of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I forgot to say that I love the fact that these come in a plastic pen.  Holding them doesn&#x27;t get color all over your hands, joy!  The colors themselves are in a creme stick form so no powder dusting all over the place, either.</li>
            <li> This hair chalk is super easy to use! Goes in fast and last! No messy hands or &#x27;chalk&#x27; dust on your cloths! Color show up well in hair and washes out as promised.</li>
            <li> Love these so much and love using them on skin as well they stay on my skin but was off easy work great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted pastel or bright colored streaks in my hair, but it seemed like too much hassle. First, you would have to bleach your hair (which can cause damage). Then you would have to apply hair dye, and I&#x27;ve heard that colorful dyes fade fast anyway, so you would have to do this frequently. Instead, these hair color pens are a great alternative! You can switch up your look by using different colors, and it takes less than 5 minutes to apply (depending on how much of your hair you want to color). Unlike other hair chalk, you don&#x27;t have to wet strands of your hair before applying or spray your hair with hairspray afterwards. You just apply the color onto your dry hair and within 30 seconds the color seals itself. I&#x27;ve had no problems with the color rubbing off onto my skin or clothes either, which is great. I even slept with the color on my hair and there was no trace of it on my pillowcase when I woke up the next day. The color leaves your hair feeling slightly like you sprayed it with hairspray, but I don&#x27;t really find that to be a problem. I figured it was expected. Plus, I&#x27;m still able to brush my hair once the color is on it, and it doesn&#x27;t remove any of the color. These pens have become a must have in my beauty supply, and I use them frequently. I hope they come out with even more colors because I would love to add them to my collection.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and beautiful hues on my blonde hair. However, I tried it on my friends black hair and it did not show with the exception of the silver which looked gray on her hair. If you have light hair, It is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the sticky texture it left on my daughters hair. The colors were nice but it made her hair clump up.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Today I have the Metallic hair chalk set which includes Silver,Gold,Pink,Green,Purple &amp; Blue. Each color is super pigmented! Unlike many other hair chalks these come in a tube like a lip balm and your hair doesn&#x27;t need to be wet for these to work,&lt;br /&gt;Simply cap off color stix, and run onto hair or skin (can be used as eye shadow!) let dry (30 seconds) and go :) You can blend the colors or just have one, each color have a sealer built;t in to last of to three days but can be washed from hair with shampoo or face with makeup remover. I am loving these , They aren&#x27;t only for kids but adults and I love to use them when i want more color in my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually tried to use these on my husband and because his hair was darker it didn&#x27;t work as well, The pink was noticeable but the colors had to be built up for you to see. (It is possible , just takes more time) My hair is blonde so you can see if a lot more clearly. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this, and honesty want the rainbow pack to try them out as well. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love dying my hair but it&#x27;s damaging, I think after bleaching it and getting it white, i may just start using this set to get my hair pretty colors ! I love being able to have any color whenever i want, Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I have received this product in exchange for testing as well as giving  my personal thoughts and opinions , All stated above is true or my thoughts. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Edit* After trying these again after all this time, I have to say these are still amazing. The colors are intense depending on your hair type but look amazing :) I am so happy to have these. they work ! Three days after using this my husband still had color in his hair :D.</li>
            <li> I used these for my daughter to have fun, and also with her friends. Is fun how they feel with the color in the hair. Also it&#x27;s super easy to be removed by simply washing the hair.</li>
            <li> Meh, color is not intense on light brown hair and comes off a bit.&lt;br /&gt;They are like crayons or very soft pencil eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The metallic colors are amazing!! Love that there is next to no mess to apply, and end result looks great!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great! I got it for my 8yr old daughter &amp; 5yr old niece. While my daughter is more skilled at applying it, they both love using them. They work great too! I read the reviews before purchasing &amp; was glad that they loved up to their positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Great doing business with this seller concerning price and shipping. I wasn&#x27;t as pleased with the actual product because unless you have blond hair, it doesn&#x27;t show up well at all. I guess I should&#x27;ve more thoroughly read reviews on it.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool idea. Some of them do not show up in dark hair very well. Easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these, it gives her quick color that lasts pretty much all day!</li>
            <li> I spent $75 at the beauty salon to get my roots touched up and purple highlights put in only to have the highlights wash out in less than 6 weeks.  I found this on Amazon by accident after the fact and decided to try it. The pricing was VERY reasonable and I love how the product works.  It shows up better in the hair than salon highlights and easily washes out.  It does leave your hair feeling like hair spray is in it but it doesn&#x27;t rub off so you can sleep in it too without worrying about the colors coming off on clothes or linen.  I wish I had known about this product BEFORE I spent $75.</li>
            <li> I got these to use in my daughters hair. They work good, they aren&#x27;t as bright as I would like them to be but at least they work. They wash out easily and don&#x27;t ruin your hair</li>
            <li> Love these highlights. Makes my hair look much much better.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and washes out easily.  Haven&#x27;t used it on brown hair but have used it with dark blond hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have ordered it twice.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for my 10 and 7 year old daughters. They are perfect for the girls! I have a blonde and a dark haired daughter and they both love it!&lt;br /&gt;Sure it&#x27;s easier to see the color on the blonde, but my dark haired beauty had some wonderful pink highlights that showed perfectly. Besides it&#x27;s just fun and easy to use. The only issue I saw was the blue my blonde used (and kept on for days) did mark her face with a nice blue hue. However, it washed off easily. I don&#x27;t think these are made to stay on for days.</li>
            <li> Got from the vendor in a timely manner but it is way too over -priced for what they are claiming the product does.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on your hair &amp; is hard to apply.</li>
            <li> These are really easy to use &amp; show up great on my light hair. Washes out with no problems. My only issue is that I brought it to a music festival where it got really hot during the day, and they got all melty &amp; made a mess. If you&#x27;re taking these somewhere hot, maybe keep them in your cooler or something!</li>
            <li> Does color even on dark hair but be prepared to rub the hair strand for 10 minutes to get enough color to stand out.</li>
            <li> These are NOT SMALL like one of the people mentioned , in fact there huge a little bigger then a average Lipstick , There not like chalk at all more like lipstick, I have dark/medium brown hair and there all actually very visible , pink takes the most streaks to apply but it still looks very pretty . The green is more like teal but its very pretty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HELP FOR APPLYING:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First brush your hair so theres no knots and your hair is smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd: Make sure u have colorful streaks that are really visible (the color)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third: you can probably seek a few gunk bits that aren&#x27;t that smooth, Take a hair brush and Brush everywhere were you put the highlights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3: Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> My daughter requested hair chalk for Christmas so I ordered this set.  The chalk applies smoothly and evenly without mess, but looks faded and light unless you apply a lot of pressure and run the chalk up and down the strand of hair.  It washes out with shampoo, thankfully.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of purple, green, and blue hair but I&#x27;ll take chalk over permanent vegetable dye any day.</li>
            <li> Someone wrote a review saying these were tiny. NOT true, they&#x27;re big. I have brown hair looks amazing. Love it! It&#x27;s creamy and it goes on very very easily, it just brushes right on. It really couldn&#x27;t be any easier. You have to hairspray over it to get it to stay for a few days.</li>
            <li> Not metallic. Leaves hair hard to style. Coloring ends is difficult. Fun for trying color combinations.</li>
            <li> Great fun especially for dance recitals</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you have brown or black hair - it will not work. And hair got sticky and almost impossible to comb.</li>
            <li> Bought for a costume party and ended up having a lot of fun with these.</li>
            <li> It has been fun experimenting with the nice colors. By far, the crayons are better than sprays. All in all, good stuff and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Tried on my beard. Was a mess! Kids liked em though.</li>
            <li> I have two boys who wanted GREEN hair for St Patricks Day, this was perfect!  Stayed on all day and washed out easily.</li>
            <li> Happily surprised when I noticed that it did work!! My kids have dark hair and you could see the colors. I was not as messy as I thought it was going to be.&lt;br /&gt;My nieces have lighter hair and it worked for them too.&lt;br /&gt;Age of kids- 6-10, but have the older girls do the little ones hair or else there will be a big mess.</li>
            <li> Kids love them wife likes less of use and cleaning</li>
            <li> I can not rate because it is a gift for christmas.</li>
            <li> These haircolor pens were great for my daughters party! Bright colors! Good idea to wash out before bed though, as the color does come off easily. Great party item!!</li>
            <li> My niece will love this, I can not wait to see her use it, she is a Diva !! Nice quality received before date to arrive.</li>
            <li> This is crazy awesome!!! These are an asset ! For bridal parties &amp; groups.. Great up sale too!! A must must must</li>
            <li> Daughter that is 5 did by her self! She loves it! Beautiful colors but is a little spendy. I would get again though.</li>
            <li> Pros: lasts a few days between washings. Easy to apply. Blends well. No messy chalkiness to deal with. Removes easily.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: if you want a really small area chalked, it&#x27;s a bit harder to get vivid color without getting your fingers messy. There are only 6 colors and the silver makes your hair look gray and doesn&#x27;t show up well on skin.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this was a great purchase. We needed something to use for our hair for a 5k. It worked great. The girls put rainbow streaks in their hair. The product was even used to write words on our arms and legs  and to draw designs on our faces. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Used these at a Girl Scout booth at a local community fair and it was a great fundraiser.  We gave mothers and daughters matching streaks in their hair!</li>
            <li> Love these. They work really great on dark and light hair. They go on pretty easy with little mess and wash off hands without soap. They are a waxy substance that you color onto the hair. The purple and silver are a little light on my daughters dirty blond, but showed up well on her friends brown hair. All the other colors show up really well. They last on hair for a few days. I have not tried sealing the color in with hairspray to see how much longer they can last. Well worth the price. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other brands.  Not if you actually want to chalk color in your hair. The only mess was on my hands while I was coloring my daughters hair, which washed right off.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Wearing for a wedding to add a little glitz</li>
            <li> too waxy and for darker hair it&#x27;s not that noticeable</li>
            <li> Not happy with the hair chalk. I worked on my daughters hair making it looked great with the color chalk but it looked messy when done and needed to be brushed. As soon as she brushed her hair all the color came right out. Waist of time and money.</li>
            <li> My niece and I had a good time coloring strands of our hair.  Easy to do and it washes right out with the next shampoo.</li>
            <li> Found it applies best if your hair is wet...This grandmother had to try it, I must say that bright megenta looked kind of cool. And the best thing about it is it really does wash out, no remnants. But if you sleep on it you find your pillowcase has a lot of the dye on it.</li>
            <li> More like hair markers and good for dark hair. They don&#x27;t rub off as easily as other chalks. Very glossy hair look.</li>
            <li> I have had lots of fun with this hair chalk.  I did my hair in autumn colors for fall and well you get the idea.  My favorite colors are red and pink (I have light blonde hair).  The colors however get on your fingers as you use them and you really got to soap up to wash it off your hands, so that is why I gave them 4 and not 5 stars.  The colors are nice. You need to wet the strand you want to color, once your strands of hair are wet take the chalk color you want and rub it back and forth over the strand to get the amount of color you want.  When the color is in the strand you need to spray it to seal the color.  IF you dont spray it the color will come off on your hands or clothes, etc.  So you cant really work with your hair after the color is in, so you would not be able to say put chalk in hair and then use the straightener or curling iron, or the chalk would get on your styling tool and it will probably not be good for your hair.  But if you want to leave your hair natural and add this chalk it works great.</li>
            <li> These pens are called chalk but have the consistency of a hard chapstick. The color is true, pretty &amp; stays on for a couple days. The color doesn&#x27;t rub off it allowed to &#x27;dry&#x27; for an hour or 2. Kids loved playing with this hair color over &amp; over again.</li>
            <li> My daughter didn&#x27;t like it; stained her t-shirt, and it didn&#x27;t really come out the way she wanted it!</li>
            <li> It works well. Love this sparkles! Not sure I like having the gold and silver as they don&#x27;t show up as well.</li>
            <li> It says chalk but it&#x27;s more like &amp;#34;oil pastel&amp;#34;...very gooey. The colors are not super vibrant in brown hair unless you totally gunk up your hair. That said, they do glitter and they last pretty well and my child was satisfied.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Worked out very well!!</li>
            <li> The color is fine - but it will absolutely run onto your pillow and clothes.  That is true of any hair chalk.  So - consider if you will be sweating (from dancing or whatever) and whether you will be showering before your head comes into contact with hats and pillows.  This is not a fault with this particular brand or color - this is just the truth for this kind of hair coloring.  It doesn&#x27;t die the hair - which would be temp-permanent.  It is just a coating on the outside of the hair and it needs to be water soluble so you can wash it off.  That means it&#x27;s going to come off under other circumstance too, so plan accordingly.</li>
            <li> Children&#x27;s school had a &amp;#34;Crazy Hair&amp;#34; day.  These did just fine in a pinch.  Just an FYI, the darker colors do fade as the day wears on.</li>
            <li> Not great for dark hair but still fun.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter just loved this as a Christmas gift. It is a fun gift and not too wild. She would use a lot in her hair and sometimes it would get on her clothes (always a white shirt) - but the good thing is that it comes right out in the wash! :)</li>
            <li> Works alright, but mine came with 2 of the same purple chalks and no blue.  Blue is the one I actually wanted so don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll use these at all.</li>
            <li> Would buy this again. I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my haie feel, hard to comb out. It&#x27;s not chalk it&#x27;s like a paste.</li>
            <li> The colors were cool, had glitter in them. The chalk stayed in for a while. The only hard part is application. You have to lay your hair on a paper towel and color back and forth until the color sticks. We used our arm the first day and got color all over ourselves. This item is cool but not a must have.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 9yo daughter who recently discovered hair chalks. However hair chalks don&#x27;t always show up well on blonde hair and don&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve only played with these a little bit. They do last much better and they do show up better than chalks. BUT they are really hard to put onto your own hair, unless it is braided. You have to grab a section of hair and hold it while you mark it with the color, so not as spontaneous as more typical hair chalks can be.</li>
            <li> Bought for my cheerleader daughter for games.  Tried a few other types that sucked.  These work great.  She can do it herself with no problem, she&#x27;s 10.  Really easy to use, washes out great.  Was one of the only products I could find that had the color she needed, green.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter loves to wear this product but if you put too much in, the hair stays sticky, even after drying, and combing her hair is a battle.  Stick to small portions at a time.</li>
            <li> Perfect and beats having to use sidewalk chalk!  Went on smoothly and was full of color.  My girls&#x27; hair is blond though so that might make a difference.  Washed out very easily which was my concern so very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, it&#x27;s basically just like coloring on hair. It&#x27;s also very easy to remove with just one shampooing. My nieces love going out with their stripy colored hair.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautifully vibrant and show up, even on dark hair. They wash out with a normal hair washing. Colors have gotten on clothes and have washed out with no problems.</li>
            <li> These are so much fun!  They work really great, even on darker hair.  I just wish they made one that actually matched my hair color so I could use it to cover my roots!  Fun purchase!</li>
            <li> The green and blue are great but the rest of the colors are iffy. I have light brown hair. Goes on fine for novelty wear, would look for a powder-based chalk if I wanted something higher quality.</li>
            <li> My niece loved this for Christmas and used it right away!</li>
            <li> I found the product easy to apply and liked it for the most part a lot.  We had so much fun playing with it while on our girls beach weekend!  The only negative I would say is that a trace of the color has lingered on my blonde hair for a couple of weeks now.  My friend also has blonde hair which is not as light as mine though and it washed right out of hers in one wash.  Not sure why it is lingering in mine.  I used the pink and still have a slight pink hue in parts. She used green and blue and it all washed out in the next wash. Go figure.  I like pink so am ok with mine hanging around though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so cool! It does exactly what it says it will do. Some quick tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Do the color a little bit in advance of when you want it to look good, itâs a little crusy and flaky for the first couple hours as it dries and sets in.&lt;br /&gt;2. For stronger color, wrap the hair you want colored around a sturdy piece of cardboard and rub the marker in downward strokes across the hair. You will waste some on coloring on the cardboard, but more color will be pressed into your hair that way.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use a comb right after you put the color in, these markers WILL tangle your hair a little bit as you put it in, even with the above cardboard trick, but if you comb it out right away that helps A LOT. A brush might work, depending on the type of brush, a comb would work better. After an hour or more, then brush the hair very firmly a few times, and you should be all set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary, I LOVE this temporary hair color, it stayed in my dark brown hair for about two days, and it stayed in my daughters strawberry blonde hair for about four days, and it was exactly what we were hoping for so that we looked fantastic on our beach vacation!</li>
            <li> My girl LOVES these things.</li>
            <li> I thought these colors were bright and fun.  I have highlighted hair and It showed up on the dark brown and the blond.  Of course it looked different on each color.  I thought it looked more wild which is what I want for the event I will be using these for.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter loved it!!</li>
            <li> This will come off on your skin, on your clothes, on your white coat, on your couch, and anything else that rubs up against it.  It&#x27;s a great, vibrant color (shows up great on dark hair), but wear with caution!!!</li>
            <li> Barely showed up in my niece&#x27;s strawberry hair, but it was fun nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Sure they are a bit messy while applying, but nowhere near as messy as one other brand I tried which was shaped like 1/2 of a golf ball.  That one was horrible because you didn&#x27;t have much control when applying, it just kind of went everywhere, then the whole piece just broke rendering it useless.  These pens are nothing like that.  With the pen shaped design, it goes on exactly where you want it to, and very easily.  I would recommend wearing rubber gloves while applying but if you don&#x27;t have them this stuff washes off your hands very easily.  I have dark brown hair &amp; even though other reviewers had said it showed up beautifully, I wasn&#x27;t convinced.  I was happily proven wrong, it shows up really well on dark hair.  I&#x27;ll be coloring my hair green &amp; blue for the Seahawks game on Sunday.  Woot!</li>
            <li> Have had these before and I like this brand, lasts as stated, colors re bright and like the choice of colors.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and thought I would try this one out because the reviews looked good! I had my doubts but when I applied it to my hair it showed up really well. As long as you follow the directions and apply it like it is suppose to be, you should have not problems. The chalk is small but you don&#x27;t have to use a how lot of it to get the color to go on your hair. I love it and will for sure order more in the future!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  A little fun, but not great.  The hair color crayons make the hair very stiff so make sure to apply in the direction you want the hair to go as once you put it on, the hair stays the way you apply.  The affect is not that bold but you an see it a little.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Easy t o apply, safe, and washes out with shampoo,  granddaughters loved it!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it lasts and its easy to apply. It does not show much on dark hair, but if you use it in combination with the chalks the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> My wife is having fun with these different colors.</li>
            <li> I got these for my niece and she ADORES them.  My sister said they were great.  Easy to apply, showed up very well in my niece&#x27;s hair (light brown).  I asked if they were smudgy or gross or weird or if they got on everything.  She said she hadn&#x27;t noticed.  My niece called to say thank you :)</li>
            <li> Such fun stuff!  Brilliant colors that stay put till you wash them out.</li>
            <li> I was shocked since I have a dark long hair, the colors is so feeble!.  I don&#x27;t recommended for dark hair only for blond I guess!.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to get the brilliant color my daughter wants but she lives it. Probably works better on light color hair, my daughter is a dark blond</li>
            <li> color does does not show up on black hair. dye matting the hair</li>
            <li> My granddaughter Loves to add stripes of color to her hair so this will be perfect for her.... Especially for her Hockey tournaments.</li>
            <li> We love these and they wash out nicely when we&#x27;re ready to go back to nice, normal school-ready hair. They show up super well on my daughter&#x27;s blonde well - not as well on my (reddish brown) hair or her friends&#x27; darker hair.</li>
            <li> These are a little more expensive then the other chalk hair colors, but totally worth it. The colors are very bright and stay in the hair for up to three days. They are easy to use and not at all messy.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be easy to apply, no mess, easy to remove. NOPE. This stuff is greasy like a crayon, hard to apply, makes the hair greasy and matted, and gets on clothes / face. I hate this stuff, and so does my 7 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Product pictured is not actually what I ordered, I order Gypsy Sticks, a rainbow of colored chalk for hair.  My daughter hates it because she says it rubs off on her hand and the product feels like grease in the hair.  Nice idea, poor results.</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant and great!  But kinda ruins my hair when its chalked, stains my shirts, and since I have blonde hair, it also slightly stained my hair for approximately 2 weeks even with daily shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad to write this review, I wanted to love this chalk.&lt;br /&gt;I have brown hair, in the milk chocolate color zone, and none of these colors showed on my hair. The pink, gold, and silver tinted it a little, but not much. It made my hair stringy and waxy looking, like I had already been sweating before I even went out, it also clumps very easily.&lt;br /&gt;*It rubbed off all over my boyfriend&#x27;s shirt* though didn&#x27;t not get on my skin, so thats a plus, and it rinsed out with just plain old water, not even using shampoo or conditioner, just a few hours after putting it in.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sad to say this is absolutely not worth the money, given that I&#x27;m now off to find something that will take it out of my boyfriend&#x27;s clothes, which is adding to the over all cost of this experience. If anyone does find some good temporary hair color out there for medium &amp; dark haired people, please comment on this and let me know!</li>
            <li> I was happy with these for &amp;#34;crazy hair day&amp;#34; at school.  My daughter has blond hair and the colors showed but not as bright as I would have liked.  You really have to continue to draw up and down repeatedly to get the color deeper.  It looks clumpy (think of drawing pastels on your hair and how oily that would be), but if you run a bristle brush through it after it spreads the color out nicely.  Most of the color came out in one washing, the rest came out after a second washing.  The silver looks like you are trying to give yourself grey hair for a school play, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  The gold looked yellow, which was fine with me.  They are fun and I would purchase them again.  I am sure these will last for years assuming they don&#x27;t spoil.  The pens are a good size.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my grand-daughter and she loves it! She is 14 and this is a great find for her.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and washes out easily too.  The color looks bright and vibrant and it lasted all day.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this hair chalk. Far better than others we have found.  The color lasts for a couple days.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  We had fun with it!  Washes out easily but stays in all night.  Does not make your hair hard and crusty like the sprays (when used correctly).</li>
            <li> Bright, shimmery and NOT goopy!</li>
            <li> I bought these because I wanted to have temporary fun colors in my hair... and it worked, but it made my hair all gross feeling. It felt as if I had mud in my hair or something. It stayed in for a while but it didn&#x27;t work very well with my brown hair.</li>
            <li> It does come off. When I did wash my hair my whole body was green, face too. I had a light faint green tint. Had to wash my face a couple times to remove. It says stays in for a few days but you have to wash it out before going to bed or it will get on your pillow and sheets.&lt;br /&gt;Also, probably should have expected this but it barely shows on medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughters. Pros: Love the metallic sheen. Price is good. Seems like they will last awhile. Moist &amp; non-drying - unlike chalk. Precision coloring possible.  Cons: The gold &amp; silver are a little flat looking on my brunette daughter.  The crayon like application makes doing larger sections difficult.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Better than all others I&#x27;ve tried out there. Work great on my golden blonde hair and on the lighter brown parts of my hair too. They really stand out, which is what I wanted</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my granddaughter just to have fun with.  She had a great time. Clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very cool product! My daughter has dark brown hair at it worked. She likes to do the ends in a different color everyday!</li>
            <li> Definitely a must have if you have teen girls! Although my husband and I use it more than they do lol. I have dark hair and the color shows beautifully, my girls have lighter hair so it shows even better in their hair. Washes out easily, and doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy or gross when in. Awesome for team games, Halloween, homecoming events, slumber parties and so much more.</li>
            <li> My daughter and granddaughters LOVE these. The silver doesn&#x27;t show up real well as silver....it looks more gray. The gold is more a yellow. The other colors really pop and show up well. There is a very slight sparkle to them when applied, but its not really sparkly looking once on. I would say these are best if you&#x27;re doing smaller chunks of color as they do go on kind of greasy. I&#x27;m not sure how large sections of hair would come out with these. My girls use plain old artist oil pastels for larger portions of hair. These wash out easily and do stay overnight to a point. There&#x27;s definite fading by morning, but I haven&#x27;t seen stains in pillow cases or clothing so far. They seem to go a long way as they get a lot f use at our house and there&#x27;s still plenty left. A little pricey, but I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but got it because of the reviews and I am very happy. I have used hair chalk in the past but it was super dusty and messy and I didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted. This product though is great! The color goes on really well and it not messy at all. It is like a giant pastel crayon that puts sparkly color in your hair. I have very dark hair so the Blue, Green and Pink work best but if you have blond or light brown hair any color will show up super vibrant.</li>
            <li> These are so much fun for kids &amp; adults!!!</li>
            <li> JUST AS AGREEDJUST AS AGREED On Time No surprises Good quality Children loved it  Everything was very very very fine fine fine</li>
            <li> My teenage daughters LOVED this!!  It worked great!!  there are many color choices to chooses from.  the color went on easily.  the color washed off their hair easily.</li>
            <li> The picture is not of the product that I bought.  I actually bought the little chalk squares and they don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> It will eventually wash out and is not permanent since this is for a preteen that is a great idea.</li>
            <li> Wow! We love these.  I ordered these for a party and then ordered more just to have on hand.  The colors are vibrant and they last in the hair.  These are better than the powers for sure.</li>
            <li> Very fun, easy to use, and washes out easily.  The great thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come off when you have it on your hair (like on your skin or clothes), but it does wash out with no trouble.</li>
            <li> I want you to know that I do not wear this hair chalk on my hair but as eye shadow.  Using the color wheel, I can combine colors to fit any outfit I have.  I have close eyes and I was told that if I put a light color in between them, the will look farther apart and I will look better.  So I use the silver and if you press this softly, you get a light color from all the rest also!  I hate to say it but since I have to wear glasses, I accent my eyes by almost going punk rocker so people will look at God in me in my eyes.  I really like the crayon application sticks and they LAST.  I still have the color from the top of the shadows!  I not only have not had to use the twist to make the chalk go up to use, I have not even had to twist at all.  They look barely used and I have been using them for 2 months almost daily.  For the price, they are a good starter kit to see if you like chalk eye shadow!&lt;br /&gt;  Now for the reason I rated them low.  I actually discovered using hair chalk with the brand Color Smash and I put Color Smash on with my finger so I cannot get the light color from the darker color I am using (Or mix the colors as well as with the Hair Chalk above) but over time say 5 hours, the Color Smash is exactly where I put it but the Hair chalk here was chunking up.  With Color Smash I can leave it on for 3 days and it really stays  vibrant.  Remember that most make-ups, lipsticks and eye shadows slide off my face in 30 minutes so you can imagine my joy in something I do not have to keep checking my mirror to see if I need to reapply the above chalk..  I cannot count on the above color to even be there tomorrow much less look good.  It may be great for those using it for Hair Chalk but I&#x27;m going to try something else on my next buy.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and treat the ends with blue dye.  Colored dyes do not last the same length of time that regular hair dyes.  I am looking for something to treat my ends as the blue color fades.  This might work on blonds but it does not work on my hair.</li>
            <li> SOOOOO Cool!!! Always wanted to have colored hair, but I don&#x27;t like to have to commit to a single color, and deal with nasty chemicals.  This stuff is great and washes out easy.  It also didn&#x27;t get on my pillow at night, or on my clothes.  Though I didn&#x27;t wear white at the time, and my pillow case was brown.... It does come off a little on your fingers so I would stay away from white for at least the first two days of this being in your hair.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well.  My young daughters love them.</li>
            <li> The hair chalk is waxy. It doesn&#x27;t show up well, except for on the top of the head. Our girls had to put so much on to get get the colors to show up. We weren&#x27;t able to brush their hair at all afterwards. Thankfully it did wash out well.</li>
            <li> My daughter was begging for pink hair so I decided to give these a try. They&#x27;re super fun and she loves them! It usually fades after about 2 days if she doesn&#x27;t wash her hair. These are a great way to experiment with a fun hair color without the commitment.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well on my hair. :(</li>
            <li> Be careful if you have dark hair and/or curly hair. Takes a lot of highlighting to get it to appear on dark hair, and with curly hair, the chalk makes your curls straight. However, very cool product.</li>
            <li> Does not show up on brown hair.  And for the blondes, it is difficult to put on.  You need a hard surface to place the hair on, it&#x27;s like trying to color your hair with a crayon.  So, if someone else can do it for you, and you have hair long enough to lay on a hard surface, it will work for you.</li>
            <li> All of the kids on my xmas gift list LOVE these colors.  They are easy to use and really bright.  Definitely scored a win on these xmas gifts!</li>
            <li> My kids love this.  It is a bit messy.  It does not really dry, so it can rub off onto the clothing they wear.  But, it easily washes out.</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY! I have plenty of nieces who are always trying to convince me to color their hair, these work perfectly and allow for fun time doing hair together, they are bright and bold, very good product that allows for some great one on one time or even just to color your hair and go out on the town, either way it is a great product with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> These markers work better than the hair chalk I have used previously.  Easy to use, washes out, colors are good.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, hard to put into your hair. Barely visible.</li>
            <li> The number one Christmas gift for my 12 yr old daughter-she loves it! It washed out after 3 times..the color was somewhat subtle on her dark brown hair but definitely there. It lets her have a little harmless creativity with her appearance and her school luckily allows it.</li>
            <li> I got these for teen granddaughters for the holidays. they&#x27;re still having fun. My daughter doesn&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s nothing permanent!!</li>
            <li> Does not work on dark brown/black hair. Maybe nothing does.</li>
            <li> works nice, Just as described. Just If it is for someone young I would have a adult help , lol because you need someone to help you do your own hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter for Christmas. They go smoothly and seemed to stay on the hair really well with a nice color. The only problem is they gave my daughter hives everywhere it touched her skin. So if you have sensitive skin, you might want to reconsider.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO PROBLEMS with customer service - fast and complete.  HOWEVER -- These things are TEENY TINY!  They are ONE INCH long and 1/4 inch thickness. (Internal box dimensions is 9.25\\&quot; X 3.75\\&quot;. (These dimensions would have been a clue if I would have known them.) These were supposed to be a gift...I think I&#x27;ll return them. I just wish I would have had some idea of how TINY they actually are -- I would NOT have wasted the time OR the money!</li>
            <li> Bought three of these for my nieces this Christmas - they were a huge hit with everyone present. Many Aunties remarked on how most of these hair chalks don&#x27;t work on my nieces dark brown/black hair and so they had given up trying to buy any, but these worked great and continue to be a huge hit. You still can&#x27;t expect yellow, for example, to show up on black hair, but blues, greens, reds all turn out nicely. I would note that the &#x27;metallic glitter&#x27; part is...not so much, at least on dark hair. However, on the whole I couldn&#x27;t be happier: easy application, excellent colors, lots of fun - we even got 90YO grandma to glam it up a bit. Most importantly, all the nieces loved them.</li>
            <li> This is not chalk at all but almost like lipstick. Very oily and greasy. Very messy and hard to use. Got everywhere. Calling it chalk is very deceiving.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to purchase these as I never really had good luck with temp hair coloring, even with my blonde hair. These work so well and last for up to 3 days, especially the blue and purple. They are vibrant, even on my friend&#x27;s dark hair.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product! I have silver hair and the colors show up so beautifully and really do last for days and wash right out!  I will buy them again and hope they come out with more colors!</li>
            <li> My hair is gray now, I&#x27;m tired of dyeing it every month, yet I wanted to add a little pizzazz to it.  Now I use it to streak my hair with color to match colors I&#x27;m wearing.  It lasts well, yet washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, colors are bright especially blue and green. I need something to put in my daughters hair for &amp;#34;crazy hair day&amp;#34; at school. These look like crayons. It also washed out very easily.</li>
            <li> daughter likes it. a bit different than i expected, but good</li>
            <li> Good these for my kids. They love them. They look nice after a lot of layering it on but my children have dark hair. I&#x27;m sure it would show up easier in light hair. They washbout very easily. If your hair gets wet the color will start to run.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;chalk&amp;#34; is ok, but I&#x27;ve had some in the past (can&#x27;t remember the brand) that was much easier to apply.  This does have good color once you get it applied, and it does wash out easily.</li>
            <li> the only thing is it&#x27;s a little hard to draw on my hair... takes time... anyway, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> So fun! I love having the option each day to change the color of one one my bleached streaks. I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and as my fellow cosmos know we get bored w our hair fast! And lifting color is harsh. This eliminates that. Easy to wash. Stays in fine.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does, which is temporarily color your hair. My hair is dyed purple or blue intermittently, but I have to admit I&#x27;m terrible at maintaining it. The bleach starts to show and I look all a-fright. For those times I want to look less haggard in public, I grab one of these pens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knocking off a couple of stars because: it doesn&#x27;t glide on as easily as they make you think it does, but if you hold your hair taut enough or put a piece of paper behind it (for me, the packet for nylon stockings, which is shiny and perfect for this, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t get on my bed afterwards and washed right out, so yay.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews before I purchased and I agree . . . it is a great, easy to use product.  My little girl is very excited to have it for her hair.</li>
            <li> My 5 year-old granddaughter loved it.  She liked that it didn&#x27;t completely wash out, but I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t.  She had fun with it.</li>
            <li> Its very prettty and i have dark brown hair and it looked amazing! it arrived 2 days earlier and its a very cool product! Just one thing, it doesnt last long like the chalk is really smallð</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my 7-yr-old daughter, who really wanted to color her hair. These are perfect for that. Easy to apply, bright colors and washes out pretty easily. I think an adult would have no trouble washing it out. The color does rub off on your fingers if you mess with your hair. We haven&#x27;t had any issues with it getting on clothes. These are bigger than a crayon, but smaller than a marker. For our purpose, this set was way better than any toy or set marketed to tweens. Great buy!</li>
            <li> So much fun, our daughter loves them!</li>
            <li> I love the concept of having the color on a stick.  They do give you a lot.  Unfortunately I have mostly dark hair and they really don&#x27;t show at all.  You can hold your hair really really taut and use a lot of pressure to make the color come through, but even then it&#x27;s very faint.  It works okay on some of the lighter strands but still not very bright.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type.  I&#x27;ve found the best results through the as-seen-on-tv chalk stuff, they&#x27;re just a real pain to mess with.  Will keep looking.</li>
            <li> I am so, so impressed with this product.  We bought Splat hair chalk at the store for my daughter, and applying it was a mess, her entire back and top of her clothing was chalky and blue, and the colors looked faded.  These, on the other hand, were vibrant and bright, even the gold.  The silver was less bright on her dark blonde hair, but that&#x27;s just because of the combination of colors.  We went swimming the day that we did the application, and after an hour and a half in the pool, there was still some visible.  It washes out, but it also has staying power.  And did I mention that it is super bright and has almost no mess while applying?</li>
            <li> My daughter has brown hair. The colors showed up well and lasted to the next day when I made her wash her hair. Didn&#x27;t notice it rubbing of on anything.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair, and hair chalks never work for me. But as soon as soon as I put these on you could totally see it! I use the purple a lot, and it is great. They smell like a mix of rubber and flowers, and what I didn&#x27;t know was that they are glittery!!! This is the best kind of hair chalk you can get, and I would have gladly paid $30. This is day 2, and you can still see it! I love these, they are so cool, coming from a 15 year old.</li>
            <li> Good product but not so efficient and sometimes hard to apply to my hair.</li>
            <li> Second one I bought. My daughter really loves this product.</li>
            <li> well they do rub off easily unlike what they state ... but they are good enough</li>
            <li> Opened up the silver and yellow and the tips both fell off... Shows up well on dark hair.</li>
            <li> The markers are pretty awesome and easy to use. The thin pieced of cardboard trick really helped in applying them. I would note however IF YOU HAVE DARK HAIR the markers may not show up well under regular indoor lighting, but they can really pop in the sunlight and brighter than normal lighting.</li>
            <li> What a sticky mess in the hair...plus they crumbled all over the floor and clothes so I had to scrub my white wood floors of color. The 3 days? it was gone out of the hair in less than 12 hours</li>
            <li> my daughter loves these color last well and washes out easy!</li>
            <li> Does not show up on dark hair at all.  There is no shimmer to these either, I&#x27;m not sure how it can advertise that it is metallic.  I bought these because of the good reviews, however it was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> These were great...in lighter colored hair. My oldest daughter has dark brown hair and these colors did not show up at all in her hair. My middle daughter has much lighter brown (not blond) hair and most colors showed up great. Yellow and silver got lost, but the pink, blue, purple and green were very vibrant. She layer her head down on the table and I colored her hair with a sheet of paper under to protect the table. I brushed her hair out immediately. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with tangling. The chalk made her hair feel like it had hairspray in it. We had much more success with coloring and pulling it back, rather then let it stay down. No color rub off at all, though she didn&#x27;t sleep with the color on her hair. It washed out 100%, very easily. So easily, actually that I&#x27;m sure if you got caught in the rain you&#x27;d have a mess on your hands. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too temporary! The colour does not show up as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> Arrived and had to be packed for move, but I am sure my daughter will love them.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok.  It doesn&#x27;t really show up if you have darker hair.  And it kind of smears.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product it is a waste of money!!! Not a chalk at all more like a crayon,  gave them to my 2yr old to use for coloring.  Expensive crayons.</li>
            <li> This product works for me. I have brown hair and all 6 colors worked on me. I wore no gloves, just washed my hands with soap and water after.&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing, it all washes away and my hair wasn&#x27;t dry.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem was a small residue stain on the pillow, but came out after washing it.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Here I posted some pics to show how it looks on my hair. I completely colored the braid and also did a yellow and silver strikes. The white you see is the silver color, on dark hairs I guess it looks white. They are metallic colors and they do have glitter but on dark hair they show like regular colors, I noticed the diference when I applied them on my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought these four year old for her birthday and soon everyone at the party including the adults had blue and red highlights. Easy to use push up crayon style stick.</li>
            <li> Perfect teenager gift</li>
            <li> My kids love this.  I originally purchased for a Dr. Seuss Day at their preschool, but we still use it out and about.  My son doesn&#x27;t feel left out when his sister gets braids or ponytails.....he gets to have his Spiderman hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very easily, and washes right out.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it getting on bedding or clothes.</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful. Especially green and blue</li>
            <li> only good on black hair</li>
            <li> Easy enough for my 8 year old niece to use by herself, and it looks good in her hair.</li>
            <li> Used for my daughter&#x27;s halloween costume, worked out perfectly. Washed out easily</li>
            <li> It works very nicely on the portions of my hair that are completely silver, but I do wonder how it might work on darker hair.  I would say the full effect of the color lasts only on the day you apply it.  It begins to fade after the first night you lay your head on a pillow.  The product completely washes out with 1 regular shampoo.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant stains on  my pillow cases, but it does wash out easily.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice hard to get color to show on dark hair but this works - not very vivid though</li>
            <li> Super fun. A little messy and doesn&#x27;t really show in darker hair. Would recommend for straight, light colored hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well on black hair- but use a lot. buyer beware color transfers...My son had it on and did a somersault...smudges of a faint green were left behind. Washed off though.</li>
            <li> works but kinda awkward to use. ends up more on my hands then in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> Young adult rock star was pleased!</li>
            <li> good product. stays in for 3 days given that you don&#x27;t take a shower so it comes out with shampoo. as long as you wait 30 seconds for it to try, your hair won&#x27;t get tangled. it looks great and im happy about my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;it is faint though. it&#x27;s not extremely bold.</li>
